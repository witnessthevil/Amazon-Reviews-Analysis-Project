{"product_name":"B006WQR3GA","description":"","reviewerName":"Q","summary":"A classic, reborn.","reviewText":"We are all familiar with disappointing remakes; from movies, to video games, even to political parties. Oft times it seems as if those who were given the privilege of retooling and a cherished IP, didn't appear to \"get it\", or cherish it in the first place, like many a high school student's book report. When I heard, and even read, about the new contender in the XCom franchise, it immediately dropped from my radar. The franchise has a horrid record at doing just that, missing the point. The videos and reviews seemed to point at the same. Oh, to my surprise, how much have those who are responsible for this welcome addition, \"got it\".Turn based is back! This is one of the few most recent remakes of a turn based strategy, who didn't push to real time, or some hybrid wacky real-kind of, but not at all turn based (see Jagged Alliance) messes. From scanning the skies, to boots hitting the ground, this feels like XCOM.One of the most noticeable changes was in the inventory system, which was replaced with a simpler equipment system - instead of picking items up in the field, making remove for that alien corpse you always wanted to lug around, now you equip a primary weapon, a secondary, and one or more additional items, and armor. There is only one round of weapon for a gun, instead of being able to choose HP, incendiary, or standard ammo, for example. While it is not the same as the original, it doesn't detract from the game, and I believe makes the game easier to get into, and less of a bean counter feel.The game has a similar look and polish of the recent simplified Civilization game, by the same developer. Menus, for example, aren't just a bunch of text, instead you have rooms, and structures that represent the areas you are working with.This game is so much fun, however, there isn't really that much replay value. Once, as I've done, you get all weapons and knowledge, it's really all the same in another play through. The number of stages where you do battle are pretty limited, even in one play through they repeat a lot. Near the end of the game, it feels like the end of the game - it seemed, for me, that all things felt like they were wrapping up - I completed all science, all constructions, all founder work - you can do -everything- in one play through.As another review pointed out, the fit percentages are wacky. While it will say greater than 50% on chance to hit with a weapon on a target, it will, most of the time, feel like 0%. I've never seen a miss at 100%, however. Another problem is that you can shoot through indestructible objects, such as five walls, or the side of a tank. It's not horrible, it simply is something to get used to and say, \"really? Why?\"My biggest complain are the defects. I've had graphical defects where a creature mesh will be leaning like MJ in Smooth Criminal, the game will indicate that one solider can see an alien, and yet, there isn't one... ghosts, perhaps? My squad will be hovering several feet in the sky, sometimes slowly approaching the ground every time I enter and exit the menu (doesn't affect game play, just graphics). Then, however, are the more serious bugs. I've had the aliens turn (indicated by Alien Activity), never end (I waited over 5 minutes, where it normally takes 5 seconds). I had to exit the game and reload, to which it only, again, took 5 seconds. I've had the game freeze on me (requiring me to hard reset the system by unplugging it, the first time I've ever had to). I've had the indicator to move a solider, however, I could not, nor could I do anything else except move the camera around - that required a soft reset. And there have been many other bugs, usually requiring a soft reset. More than I've ever had in any other XBox 360 game. Deal breaker? Not really, annoying? Heck yeah! I don't think they will get fixed, which is a shame, and very slack on the makers.Would I recommend this game, yes! Especially if you are a fan of the original XCOM. The fact that the producers backed a game that hasn't tried to break it's own formula too drastically to pull in a new audience, is commendable! After a recent game purchase for a sequel was an incredible and unforgivable failure (RE6) this game has done well to respect the franchises original fans in producing a game that looks and feels like the original.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2012"}

I pre-ordered this game despite straight up disgust with id's previous title, Doom 3, so I take full credit for the sheer lack of foresight that led me to waste $40 on this title (I had $20 amazon VG credit).  However, that doesn't excuse the awfulness in this AAA title.First, the praise.  RAGE is technically impressive in many ways.  The character models are very detailed, and the creature AI is among the best in any shooter -- if not the best.  Mutants will perform incredible acrobatic maneuvers using the environment.  Enemy bandits and soldier will take cover and work as a team to flank you.  Combined with the many weapons and ammo types as well as sentries and bots, it's quite fun, but ultimately a very shallow experience.\"Megatextures\" are the major new feature in id's new engine, id Tech 5.  It allows the game artists to paint directly on the environment's multi-gigabyte textures, which makes for some impressive scenery.  However, it does nothing to improve the actual gameplay, and I often found indoor environmental textures to be rather low quality and straight up bad.  Overall, they seemed to cancel each other out.  Give me deep gameplay over superficial graphical features any day.One of the major complaints about id is that they make great tech, but awful games.  RAGE certainly feels that way.  Like Doom 3, it seems like a tech demo.  They created what seems like an amazing game world, but it's shallow and linear to an extreme.  For example, you have the ability to jump, but often rails that would be easily jump-able in other games serve as invisible walls in RAGE.  It's frustratingly bad.  Furthermore, aside from very rare exceptions, there's no reward for exploring the very limited environments.The paths through levels are designed to be convenient at the expense of logic and immersion.  With every level, you fight your way through linear corridors and end up conveniently near an exit.  In one instance, you have to fight through the sewers to stop bandits from contaminating the well.  The treatment facility room, where the level ends, has an exit right into town.  Well, why didn't you just start there to begin with?  Why did you take the long way around?  Horrible design decisions like this plague RAGE and destroy every bit of potential this game had.There are boss and mini-boss battles throughout the game, but the final battle is completely anti-climactic.  It's so utterly disappointing.Oh, of course there's also the buggy that you use to travel from location to location.  In town, you upgrade the buggy by earning racing tickets by racing and engaging in other buggy challenges.  It's a decent feature, but I wonder if it was really necessary given the extreme linear nature of the game.Overall, I really didn't like RAGE.  I could not recommend this game to anyone, and there's not a chance that I will ever pay full price for an id game again.  It might be a decent bargain buy just to form an opinion on your own for $10 or $20.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2011"}

Featuring an intuitive combat system and exciting multiplayer mode,The World Ends With Youis set to immerse gamers into the modern-day culture of Japan.StoryThe story begins as Neku Sakuraba, an unsociable 15-year-old boy, unexpectedly wakes up in the Shibuya shopping district of Tokyo, Japan. While trying to piece together his rude awakening, he receives a strange text message warning him that he will cease to exist unless he accomplishes a certain mission. Although he barely has time to grasp what is happening to him, he commences his assigned task in the mysterious streets of Shibuya.Features:Distinctive modern art style created by a team of artists led by Tetsuya Nomura, world-renowned character designer of the upcomingFabula Nova Crystallisproject which includesFinal Fantasy XIIIandFinal Fantasy Versus XIIIInnovative Stride-Cross Battle System allows players to control two characters simultaneously, unleashing special attacks with the stylusCollect a vast array of custom-designed pins, each with a powerful psychic ability that can be activated with the right touch or sound commandCustomize characters with Shibuya?s coolest fashions and exchange items with other players via Mingle ModeExperience an amazing soundtrack combining a fusion of musical influences from hip-hop to rock to electronicaBattle with up to three friends in Tin Pin Slammer, an exciting and fast-paced mini-game, via local wireless connection","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"An overlooked classic, but can be extremely hard","reviewText":"The Good: Another amazing Square Enix story, interesting combat design, twists cliche RPG elements, very memorable charactersThe Bad: Dual screen combat just doesn't work, can be extremely hard sometimes, a bit long winded for a portable gameI first have to mention that this game was made by the extremely talented Square Enix and Tetsuya Namura was behind this (Final Fantasy VII, Kingdom Hearts). The World Ends With You is an RPG like no other. They took the cliche elements of RPGs and twisted them around so much it's an enjoyable new welcome. First off, the story is the strong point here. You wake up in Shibuya without your memory and all you have is a Player Pin and you have to stop the Noise and find your way back to the Real Ground. The combat in here is great, but is the most flawed part of the game. You use the stylus to fight with Neku by using Player Pins. Think of these pins as weapons with different attributes. You can tap empty space to send sparks flying, shout in the mic to create a shockwave, slack up on Neku to hit enemies, healing pins, some pins have you drawing circles to send meteors crashing, some pins use telekinesis to send signs, cones, and even cars flying into your enemies. On the top screen you control your partner (there are three throughout the game) by using the D-pad or the face buttons.This is where it's flawed; controlling two screens at a time does not work. You either have to focus on one or the other, but what makes it harder is yo have a combo tree when you hit the button and you have to much up certain cards to make a fusion pin appear for a super powerful attack. This is really difficult and annoying because some fights make you control both. You can, however, have the game do it on it's own, but the AI seems to be flawed since if you don't you'll lose health really fast.With that aside everything else is great. While you run around Shibuya you can visit stores and buy clothes (think armor) to increase attack and defense etc. What's neat about this is each section of Shibuya has a \"brand chart\" and if you wear those clothes or pins you get attack or stat bonuses. This is also the other flaw in the game, each section is a tiny little area so you're not going to stop through ever section and change your layout out so you just have to use what you like and try to make it popular by fighting the Noise. While we're on that the Noise are the enemies in the game. You can scan the area with your Player Pin and they all show up as red symbols. Tap these (or more than one for a chain battle) to level up and fight them. When each day of the Game starts you have missions you have to complete via your phone and you have to get past walls that the Reapers put up. To get past these you have to meet objectives such as defeat this many Noise, buy me this or that, take this quiz etc. This tosses things around and makes you want to keep playing. You can add to your attributes as well without leveling up by eating food. These food have to be digested through battles and after so many bites you'll get the stat. You can also change your level to drop more pins as well if you need some good ones.Of course, this is a Square Enix game so it is dialog heavy and there are text based cut scenes every five minutes. This adds to the incredible story though so it's all ok. The graphics are all 2D but they have the same art style as Kingdom Hearts, it looks like, thanks to Tetsuya Nomura. The sounds is a bunch of swishing and bleeping but the music is pretty nice. There are dozens of tracks you can buy in stores. Overall if you can stomach to odd combat design and you want a great story driven game then go for this. This is too complicated for a portable game, but for some odd reason it still works. I think Square tried to take advantage of the hardware a little too much but this game will sit in our hearts along with Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts because I know it has for me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

I thought all the sound effects were cheesy (seems to be that way for all Sega games) and I thought the soundtrack sucked.  But when the reviews started rolling with the majority of the reviewers giving it high marks, I started to wonder maybe if I was too harsh on the game.  Although my gut told me not to buy it because of how I felt playing the demo, I felt like I should give the game another chance.Boy, I should've listened to my gut on this one.  I simply don't understand (my co-workers don't either, they can't stand the game) why this game gets all these high reviews.  First off the storyline isn't that strong and the voice acting is average at best.  The graphics of this game are decent and the fighting action is definitely over the top, which is a plus for this game.  The soundtrack for this game is bad....very bad.  What's worse is they keep playing the same song over and over everytime there is a fight scene.  That song sounds like some little Japanese girl singing in karaoke.  Playing this game will give you a new found appreciation for games that actually take thier soundtracks seriously (GOW, Uncharted, etc).  Other than being button-mashing delight, I really don't get the appeal of this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2010"}

Now he's chasing them across the Game Boy Advance inCastlevania: Circle of the Moon. He'll use his trusty whip, as well as a few magical items, to combat Dracula and more than just a few foul minions. The game takes advantage of the GBA's rich color palette to create detailed, moody environments and intricate spell effects.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"Circle of the Moon makes it debut on the GBA","reviewText":"Castlevania: Circle of the Moon was a launch title for the Game Boy Advance back in 2001. It's been a few years since a 2D Castlevania game was released to the public and they were hyped to hear it was coming to the GBA. While it made an impact, this game brought mixed results that fortunately was more good than bad.Castlevania: Circle of the Moon follows a new main character named Nathan Graves on his quest to defeat Count Dracula in a brand new castle. Much like every Castlevania game so far, you control the main character and he is armed with a whip. You can pick up weapons along the way to use against the enemies and bosses. A new feature was introduced to this game: the card attribute system. You can find and acquire different kinds of action and attribute cards. When you combine certain cards together, you unlock special effects that enhance your whip or weapons to deal greater damage. This comes in handy as the game gets harder. The castle you explore is huge but not every area is accessible from the get go. Be ready to backtrack often because the items you need to help you progress further into the castle requires you to visit areas you can't get into before. When you need to take a break or want to continue your game later, look for save rooms located throughout the castle to save your progress anytime.The PROS: It's a brand new 2D Castlevania game since Symphony of the Night and Circle of the Moon is a fun game to play. It continues with the new \"Metroid-vania\" game play style established by the PS1/Saturn title so exploring the castle takes awhile and is entertaining as well. The controls and sounds are excellent and are perfect for highlighting what the GBA was capable of doing early on in its debut to the world. The new card attribute system works well and is fun to mix and match cards to see what effects you activate; there are so many that it will keep you busy trying to find them all as some are rare and others appear more often. This game is also challenging so at some points it will get hard but not to the point that you want to give up.The CONS: This game is dark....literally speaking. Konami went out of their way to set the mood here to make this castle you explore spooky by making every area dark; it worked too well because it is hard to see where you are going because of the lighting. And when your eyes adjust to it, you'll realize that the graphics aren't that great. They are decent but not what you expect from a Castlevania game. Because of the graphics, the animation is also lacking. While it doesn't ruin the experience, you can't help to notice how they somewhat dropped the ball in these two areas.Castlevania: Circle of the Moon made an excellent debut on the GBA and was worth picking up as one of the launch titles for the new handheld system back then. Despite its shortcomings, it a fun game that carries on the tradition that is associated with a Castlevania title. It's hard to find nowadays and it very expensive to buy it new so you are better off getting it used. If you like action adventure games and/or you're a fan of the series, this game is worth investing your time in.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2011"}

Coming from someone who had bf3 + premium opening day I decided to give best buy $35 for this game. I hesitated in purchasing the game due to all the negative reviews. But saw a glimmer of hope in the latest patch and decided to put my gift card to good use.First, I expect a lot of down votes but I need to put this out there...Read the packaging/back of the game- it says right on the game that you need a hard drive to play, further more, the back reads the following, \"hard drive sold separately for xbox 360 4g, and original xbox 360 arcade, core consoles.\" So don't blame anyone but yourself for not reading the packaging before cracking out the game...I for one appreciate the extra downloading for a better core game experience. Especially if you download maps, I think I have ~30 g of space tied up with bf3. Don't down vote the game, call amazon and complain so that they may update the description of the game. DICE continues to support their games for multiple years.Game is  fluid on a very old console- and it performs really tight. The controls differ a little from bf3 but sometimes change is good. The matches are up to 24 players and have dedicated servers (super nice and little lag)...can't imagine the 64 player matches like the One has, but it's fun...I'd stick to the mode 'Rush' since it's forces you a certain direction thru the map, it keeps things hot and tight- but that's my opinion.Pick this game up used if you'd like, no authentic online code required for this installment (yay!)I reduce one start with the 'party feature' that is missing in this game (what the..?). Check it out, you won't be disappointed.EDIT #1 I have now found out how to party with friends.

At the time of its release it was something quite new and unique.  An interactive puzzle experience.  The game was followed up later with Big Brain Academy and that was also pretty good.  Now we've got Brain Age 2 which is more or less an expansion to the first one.The mini-games here are fun and addictive much like the first one.  A lot of it actually comes from the first game but now they've added more twists to the games or updated some of them.  Not every mini-game is a winner, but if you liked the first Brain Age game, then this one should satisfy.  These mini-games are quite a challenge too.  Especially because some of the \"twists\" they threw into these games really actually makes you start thinking, or better yet, memorizing things.Nintendo also threw in some multi-player this time.  You and your friends can compete and it only takes one card to do so.  The rest of your friends just have to bring their DS along.The two biggest problems of the first Brain Age still exists here however.  Games that require you to speak or games that require you to write don't always work in your favor.  You could say the correct answer but for some reason the game won't \"hear\" you correctly and you'll get it wrong and get penalized.  Just the same when it comes to handwriting simulation games it might not be able to \"read\" your handwriting.  It's actually pretty annoying and you're unfairly penalized for it.Despite that, however, Brain Age 2 is still a fun game and a great follow up to the first game.  If you liked the first one, chances are the second one will be enjoyable as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000B2YR74","reviewerName":"B. Convery","summary":"Half-Life, FULL game","reviewText":"The only way to give the XBOX version of this game less than five stars is to have played the PC version of the game.  I've read reviews (Gamespot specifically) that talk about near abysmal framerate/slowdown drops... to the point of freezing the system.  that's cold, man.  and, umm, dead wrong.  I have a feeling someone over there reviewed an unfinished product.  The game is not flawless.  It does have load times every so often (7-10 seconds) but not as bad as Gamespot says (20-40 second load times).  I question the validity of what they were reviewing.  I've never played FPS on PC and I don't doubt it's better.  But I understand to play Half Life 2 on a PC fluidly requires thousands in upgrades, etc.  It's just not worth it to me.  That's a lot of beer I could be drinking, money to be gambling.Anyway, Half Life 2 is just SUCH a playable game.  The environments are really stunning.  It starts in a train station where you soon learn that this world is throat under boot, a completely fascist regime with civilians walking thoughtlessly like escape psyche ward patients.  You'll soon learn that Gordon Freeman, YOU, has a head on his shoulders and is respected among an underground resistance group.  This game oozes similarities to dystopian society of Oceania in Orwell's 1984.  The enemy in the game, similar to 1984, is a faceless totalitarian one.  You'll see resistance posters on crumbling walls.  You'll feel the burdens of this decadent society.  Moreso, You'll feel respected when people recognize you as Gordon Freeman, the hero.I can't say enough for the enviroments.  They are so well rendered, such a great world create, to experience it slowly.. EXPLORING is not a chore...  Taking your time is what you'll want to do, to enjoy the visuals that have been so well-crafted.A big part of this has to do with the putty-like \"structure\" of the levels, IE the ability to interact with 99% of object on the screen.  Breeaking windows and smashing tables never gets old.  It's fun to throw garbage everywhere, stack a bunch of crap.  And many times you'll need to.The acting and sound in this game is extremely well done.  It's a relief to come across safe havens with friends excited to see you.  Gets you away from the intense action for a little bit, sometimes giving you better weapons.The controls of the game are very good, right up there with Halo, Halo 2, Doom 3 on the Xbox.  Weapon switching is done via directional pad... It's just real easy to get a feel for.To wrap it up, the Xbox version of Half Life 2 deserves five stars.  It's not gonna be a best seller and it's going to suck to geeks with PCs.  It will appeal to drinkers/stoners alike who take their vices too seriously to spend that much money on a good PC.  Yet these creatures of myth also respect the opinions of PC gamers.  I respect a PC gamers opinion.  Why?  Because they do spend all that much money on their hardware.  If they rave girlishly about something, I listen.  But I don't have a great PC like them.  I have an Xbox.  You know where my money goes otherwise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2005"}

Well, in Citan's opinion, there really is no reason to keep these movies in your hd after their expiration.  Since you can no longer play them, you may as well delete them and free up space.  Demos, trailer, music, etc.  You may want to keep those.  And this is where you will run out of room.The replacement drive is overpriced.  And undersized.  But due to the console's design, you will not be able to substitute just any serial hard drive.  This is the only replacement available.  No one can ever say that Microsoft doesn't know how to get the most money out of its customers.  They didn't get to where they are by being otherwise.Whether I give this drive my recommendation or not is irrelevant at this point.  This is your only choice, should you run out of space in the original drive.  Microsoft will eventually release a larger drive.  That is pretty much a given.  I can only hope that it will work with the current console and not just the \"version 2\" that is currently in the works.  If you can, wait for the new drive.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2007"}

The ping pong and beach volleyball are also very entertaining while the bouce game while somewhat enjoyable reminded me to much of throwing horseshoes almost but still good.

{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"Va- Bank","summary":"In short...","reviewText":"I think all the features of this game have been covered so....If you're an older gamer (20+) who enjoyed the Genesis Shinobi titles and didn't mind the difficulty - this game IS FOR YOU.I've updated this review to clarify a couple of things:1.) Yes, the game is very difficult. But those reviews that say that it's difficult and the fighting system is bad are innacurate. There absolutely IS a strategy to fighting groups of enemies. You charge your sword on the smaller ones, then kill the large one in one slash! If you understand and use this system the way it was intended, you can even kill some stage bosses with as little as 2 hits!2.) Platforming - to me it was the most difficult part of the game, but it's not impossible. All Shinobi games I can remember had verydifficult jumps. The only really bad part - is no checkpoints. You restart the whole level. However if you die during a boss fight, you won't have to repeat it.The point is, it seems everyone either loves it or hates it, there's no middle. I can see how it may be frustrating, but I don't think why people would think it's boring. But I think everyone should give it a chance.

{"product_name":"B000ZJVDA2","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Fantastic Game","reviewText":"Pros:+Astonishing graphics+Even better music score+Well performed voice actors+A well told story that spans four discsCons:-Load times are long and frequent-There's some slowdown to deal withHironobu Sakaguchi, the creator and producer of the Final Fantasy series, left Square-Enix and formed Mistwalker along with several of the staff members who made the Final Fantasy series. Their first effort, Blue Dragon, was, for the most part, a decent RPG but not what you'd expect from the man who brought you Final Fantasy. Lost Odyssey is a much better effort than Blue Dragon.  From the creators of Final Fantasy comes another sprawling epic that's far better than Blue Dragon could ever hope to be.If there's one thing Mistwalker has solidified themselves in doing, it's the ability to make a beautiful game with some decent production values. The story of Lost Odyssey centers on Kaim. An immortal who has lost his memory. As the game progresses, you learn more about Kaim and who he was. In spite of having several overly done moments, Lost Odyssey doesn't feature a bad storyline at all. Much of it is well written, the dialog well spoken and acted by their voice cast. Even better is that there are a lot of emotional moments going on that make the game a thrill to play. While there isn't anything too stark about the story itself, the characters are likeable enough to keep you going. And they should be. This game spans four discs.Lost Odyssey doesn't do a whole lot to separate itself from a lot of JRPGs. It has a few good elements to it, but in truth, this is really just your average turned based battle system. There are a few tidbits to separate it from other JRPGs, however. Such as placing your characters in the front or back row. While Final Fantasy has already done this, Lost Odyssey puts much more emphasis on this. There's a guard gauge you must keep an eye on, and once it runs out you'll take much more damage from attacks. Learning skills is also somewhat different. Kaim, like other characters who will join you, is immortal. Immortals can, however, learn abilities from their mortal allies by battling with them in combat.There are also attack rings. When a character attacks you can hold the right trigger and then release at the right time to do extra damage. While it doesn't really add much of anything to the combat, it keeps you focused. Combat isn't too hard to learn. Neither is the rest of the game. In fact, Lost Odyssey plays pretty much like a standard RPG.Lost Odyssey looks absolutely beautiful, though. Helped along, of course, by a well told story. The characters and environments are absolutely beautiful. To compliment all this, the music score is astonishing. Done by former Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu The voice acting is also pretty good. If there was anything that might keep the game's production values down, it might be that it just doesn't run all that smoothly. Blue Dragon suffered similar problems. While the slowdown people may not mind, the frequent and somewhat long loading times might be problematic.In short, Lost Odyssey is so far the best JRPG you can get on the XBOX360 at the moment.  It's deep emotional story and focus on its characters make it a more memorable RPG. While it suffers briefly in the technical department, it's certainly not a bad game by any means.  JRPG fans should definitely pick up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2008"}

Despite the differences, I find it good that they have a handheld version of this game so when I go on vacation, I can take it with me (along with my other 2 FF games and some other great SNES-to-GBA RPGs) If you don't have FF Anthology, you don't really need to worry because this game is just as good as the PSone port (dispite the graphical changes).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00BGD6LMG","description":"","reviewerName":"Raven A. Wind","summary":"May be slightly more fun to actually watch dogs play than to play Watch Dogs.","reviewText":"I like open-world games. However, I have to wonder how this game won any awards. Granted, I haven't finished it yet, but I'm a good way into the game and I'm not seeing anything here that hasn't already been done better in other games. The hacking component is an interesting addition to the GTA style of play, but it's really not that amazing and actually gets a little boring after a while.Now, I'm not saying the game is bad. Three stars is \"average\" as far as I'm concerned. I'm just not seeing how it lives up to the hype, and to be honest, I found the characters kind of unlikable. I don't know if it was the voice-over work, or just the general blandness of the characters, but I just didn't like them. They didn't grab me and keep my interest. For example, in Red Dead Redemption, I was ENJOYING being John Marston. Meanwhile, I care so little about Aiden Pearce in Watch Dogs that I had to look up his name after being away from the game for a day.One thing that kills one whole star in my review is the driving control. The cars control very loosely, like they're driving on icy roads. When you're slamming into things all over the place because the driving physics are so wacky, you get frustrated. Being able to change the traffic lights via hacking was pretty cool, I'll admit, but it didn't make up for the driving being the way it is.Hacking individual pedestrians is interesting for the first five minutes, and then you realize it's really not DOING anything but filling in for the \"picking up random money lying around\" game mechanic of other games. Instead of picking stuff up, you hack people and get their ATM information, and then you steal money from them. Big thrill. Sometimes you find out that they're about to commit a crime, so you have to high-tail it to where the crime is about to happen and carefully sneak up on them so as not to alert them, so you can catch them in the act. The problem with this is that everyone is hyper-aware, and if you walk into a room filled with people while someone's about to commit a crime, they somehow are able to pick you out as the guy who's there to catch them, despite you not looking like a cop or doing anything particularly suspicious. Again, it's frustrating.If the potential criminal runs away before going through with their crime then you can't do anything to them without being penalized. for it. It makes little sense. If the guy was going to kill his girlfriend and just stopped because he saw you out of the corner of his eye, why wouldn't you want to stop him ANYWAY to prevent him from going back later and doing it when you're not there? It's just plain stupid the way they worked out some of the crimes you're meant to prevent, because they don't actually want you to PREVENT them-- They just need you to catch them in the act. But you're a vigilante, not a cop. You really shouldn't care about catching the guy in the act so much as preventing him from acting in the first place. It's a logic breach I can't accept in a somewhat sloppy story.Now, is it fun to play? Yes, mildly so. It's not as fun as I'd hoped, though. I'm not a kid, though, so maybe some of the \"cool\" factor is lost on me. All I know is that after playing for a while it just feels repetitive and I find myself shutting down to do something else. Most of the time, it just doesn't feel like you're really accomplishing anything in this game. It's like they had an interesting concept-- hacking everything-- and then didn't build up much of a game around it.This is a moderately-good GTA/Saint's Row clone without as much humor or fun as the originals. It lacks sorely in character development and likability, and the driving mechanics make car chases a lot less fun than they were in GTA or Saint's Row games. The combat is decent, and the story is acceptable but not groundbreaking. Everything looks good and the sounds are well-done, but overall it feels like a cardboard world you're running around in, and you just never feel an attachment to what's going on around your character. Personally, I also found it difficult to root for Aiden Pearce, as he's restricted enough to not be crazy fun like a GTA or Saint's Row character (You're penalized for harming civilians, for example),  and he lacks much in the way of a personality. He just feels like a stereotypical hacker vigilante archetype and slapped him on the screen expecting players to make him interesting somehow... And it's not easy.It feels like the \"Under The Dome\" (TV show) of video games: Great concept slightly soiled by dull or dim-witted characters who you try to like, but just never do, and thus you never really care who live or dies, who wins or loses, and won't be terribly upset if you never see the ending. It's junkfood. It's mildly entertaining, \"I'm bored with GTA and Saint's Row so this will do until a new one comes out\" off-season filler. It's what you play in the summer while waiting for the better games to come out at Christmas time.Again, it's not a bad game-- It just doesn't really reach for the stars. It's just a lot of the same-old, same-old, but it takes itself too seriously and just never feels amazing. It's just average, which I suppose might be disappointing after the hype from the early trailers, but it's really not so surprising. Perhaps the experience on the newer-generation consoles is more involved, but I doubt that better lighting and shadows could make Aiden Pearce any more interesting, or his sidekick any less annoying, or the civilians any less like manikins in a department store designed to look like Chicago.Slow load times despite being installed on the hard drive add to the unpleasant experience. I assume this is a better situation on the newer consoles. Sometimes I wonder if developers are tasked with making previous-gen console versions of their games run or load slower to push people toward buying the new consoles. The load times in this were enough to make me become bored with waiting.If you really love the open-world sandbox type of game, you may find some nuggets of joy in this otherwise drab world. If you want something funny, though, I expect you'll be unhappy with this one. If you want wild action, again I'd say you're barking up the wrong tree. However, as a summer filler type of game, this does the trick. It all comes down to individual tastes with this one.Three Stars. Average. Not awful, not amazing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2014"}

There is no comparison. COD's campaign is light years better than battlefields which never had a good campaign IMO. The multiplayer is great too. Got a ton of new tweaks and new game modes to have it feel fresh and exciting. New maps galore and some new weapons I came across. Graphics are what you expect, from good to very good. But the engine is feeling dated.One mode I need to mention. Do you like killing Aliens? Than rejoice! Squads and Extinction is probably my favorite mode in Ghosts, and even better, you get to deal with Aliens. I would give this a perfect score if I could score the game separate from the campaign. If you like multiplayer its even more fun. Squads is a new and innovating feature in multiplayer which allows you to create your own team and play against another player's team. You can also play with your team against another team of bots and it also allows you to play survival mode with your team or with another batch of players. If you're familiar with Zombies in Blops, you will be right at home with Aliens. Beware, this is a lot more challenging than Zombie mode is! So that said, if you're also a fan of Zombies, you'll be very very pleased with this new addition to the franchiseActivision is promising lots of future DLC. So hopefully will last us till next year. That said...I will say that this is the best COD I've played yet. Time will tell when I get my Ps4 or XBOX1 version. :)Here's what the overpaid cynics are saying...IGN - 8.8GameSpot - 8/10Game Informer - 8/10Eurogamer - 7/10Multiplayer.it - 7/10Edge - 7/10VideoGamer - 7/10GameTrailers - 7/10Playstation Official Magazine UK - 8/10Metro GameCentral - 8/10NZGamer - 87/100Joystiq - 7/10The Escapist - 8/10Telegraph - 8/10Push Square - 6/10Giant Bomb - 3/5God is a Geek - 100/100NowGamer - 75/100Lazygamer - 83/100LaPS3 - 78/100Destructoid - 5/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2013"}

When you start the game, you choose either to play the role of a boy or girl, and depending on your choices, the hero will grow up to be tall or short, good or evil. Players can get married and have children; female player characters will become pregnant, which will then be reflected by their physical appearance.Early in the game, players are presented with a stray dog for a best friend, who will need to be fed and loved, and will accompany the player throughout his or her life. Depending on the player, the dog will change appearance and assist him or her in various ways, such as alerting of impending dangers and attacking enemies.Players inhabit the world of Albion and are free to roam the land to as they please. Players can use different expressions to communicate with others, such as taunting and laughing, and even belching or farting.As the players grow, so does Albion, reflecting the choices that were made earlier in the game. Every house, hut, castle, and dungeon can be purchased if the player wishes. Players can buy up all the land in a town and can become mayor, king, and even emperor of the entire land.Fable 2 presents a dynamic and free-roaming world that doesn't demand a player to take any one set path. At the same time, players seeking a plot line will find an epic story and quest that they can follow if they wish, along with many side adventures.Fight Using Different Weapons and MagicFable 2 introduces a new combat system that allows for mastery of hand weapons, such as swords, long range weapons such as cross-bows and guns, and, of course, magic. Players improve at each discipline with time, and can combine different combat styles when they fight. Other advanced design features include tactical positional advantages that can bring new strategic elements into combat.Bring Other Players into Your WorldFable 2 has a multiplayer mode that allows you to bring other players into your own world. Consistent with the rest of the game, the actions of these other players can be permanent and affect your world.

McAdams","summary":"Much improved over the original","reviewText":"I played the original Fable on the original XBOX, and while it was okay, it seriously under delivered on all of its \"ground breaking\" RPG claims.  The game mechanics of the first Fable were fine, but tended towards the obnoxious side.  The \"Guild Master\" was constantly yipping at you through his telepathic talking ability, the combat was repetitive and unsatisfying, the world's surface looked plastic-like, and the depth of EVERYTHING was very shallow.  Want to get married?  OK, now what?  Want villagers to like you?  Flex for 'em.  Want them to fear you?  Murder something in front of them.  Want them to like you again?  Do some more flexing, AND THEY WILL COMPLETELY FORGET ABOUT THE WHOLE \"MURDER\" BUSINESS!  The original Fable had lofty goals, and tried to get a little bit of all of them into the game, with the end result being a rather unsatisfactory experience, overall -- especially at full price.Fable II ... still doesn't really live up to the hype, and has managed to add a couple of new really irritating aspects to the game play, while repairing some of the old.  I want to say up front, though, that I enjoy this game, and I am obsessively playing it.Some of the things they fixed from the first game are: no \"Guild Master\" is constantly talking to you through the game anymore, or encouraging you to \"try to get your combat meter even higher!\"  The depth of THIS Fable is much greater than the first.  The combat is still repetitive, but at least they have managed to mix it up a little better this time around.  You can get slightly more complicated (and elegant) with hand to hand.  Ranged is actually an option now (it was completely unplayable in the first Fable, due to the forced 1st person perspective in a 3rd person game, and inability to move while shooting, and no aiming help), and magic is more or less like the first game, with some tweaks.  The \"expressions\" are still a rather stupid method of \"communication\" in the game, frankly I would prefer dialog trees or Mass Effects' \"wheel-o-emotion\" way of digging through dialog trees.  They have tried to emulate Mass Effect's \"wheel-o-emotion\" but it is still just a list of expressions you can use, to different effect.A couple of new (good) things are: condoms for sex (which surprised me -- but, I guess if you are going to allow polygamy and \"swinging\" parties in the game, you have to do SOMETHING to placate the right wingers), which leads to the ability to have (or not have) children.  You can now RUN when trying to get around (much better than having to walk everywhere).  Relationships are now much more complex, and interesting (although your wife/husband will still have a very limited range of things to say to you).  The world is now MUCH bigger, and there are a CONSTANT list of things to do (although after the 20th \"save the slaves\" quest, or the umpeenth \"bounty hunter -- slay the bandits\" job, you get a bit tired of those options).You can now also take a job in most of the various towns in the game, and earn some cash outside of quests, monster slaying, or stealing.  The jobs are useful EARLY in the game, to get much needed cash -- if you are playing as a good character anyway.  They are simple timing mini-games, but they pass the nights well, when you are waiting for the shops to open back up.  I ignored the jobs once my real estate holdings started netting me over 5-8K per payment period, because at that point your money is making money for you, and you really can't get much more than 5-10K working at a job in a 24 hour \"day\" in the game, whereas you get paid your real estate \"rent\" every 5 minutes, you do the math ;-)  You can buy homes and businesses in the game, although I was a bit disappointed by both.  For homes, you can do a little bit of redecorating (much better than what you could do in the original Fable) -- I was hoping for more options, like maybe painting it, completely re-ordering everything, having more than 5 \"types\" of furniture, home construction projects (having another kid, add a new bedroom!) -- that kind of stuff.  Oh well.For businesses, I was kind of hoping you could actually assume the role as the business owner, and interact with the town on that level for a while -- and only hire an employee to run it when you lost interest in doing that.  But, all you can actually do is buy the building/stall.  The employee for that business will continue operating it same as before -- you just now get a share of the profits (delivered along with your rent money), and a permanent 39% discount.  Also note, I don't know if it is a bug in the game, or what, but buildings you buy can be bought out from under you (without you explicitly selling them).  You get the money from the sale, but then you have to go back and buy the building back, if you didn't want to sell it.Now, on to the obnoxious report.  I again want to say that I like this game, these notes are mostly for the developers (who I am SURE have some poor PR person reading reviews online for feedback for Fable 3).  For all of the obnoxious things the game fixed from the first Fable, it (sadly) added many new ones.  First of all, the controls suck.  The left analog stick, used for moving around, is WAY too sensitive (but to confuse things, there is also a delay in responding to your directional commands), and there is no way to turn the sensitivity down -- it is fine for combat, but way too sensitive for in-town maneuvers.  Prepare to make many frustrated micro corrections to your path finding as you try to navigate your way through town, or (god help you) select something (like a merchant).  Running makes this phenomenon worse.  This is even more obnoxious when you are trying to select something, or someone in a crowd.  Instead of using the shoulder buttons to change highlighted selections (as many XBOX 360 games now do), you have to run/walk up to the person or item, and cajole your character into facing them *EXACTLY*, to get them to highlight properly, even then, you have to \"lock on\" to your target, if they are a person (not a merchant though), to interact with them and them alone -- of course, if someone moves in between you and your target, EVEN IF YOU ARE LOCKED ON TO THEM, the game will STILL think you want to suddenly interact with the now closer person instead.  Yeah, um Lionhead Studios ... welcome to the 21st century, we don't want game mechanics like this any more.  They are last century, and last console, technology, and other developers have invented far better ways of doing it.  For goodness sakes, Knights of the Old Republic, on the original XBOX had a better selection and interaction control scheme than you are using now for your second generation game for the second generation of the console!  If you cannot come up with it on your own, then ape their way of doing it, please.Probably the most INFURIATING game mechanic, which should get someone a spanking, is the \"B button to quit ... and also cast offensive magic spells\" mechanic.  See, the \"B\" button quits you out of ALMOST everything (except when you are \"locked on\" to a person with the left trigger, to \"unlock\" from them, you have to left trigger again, or move far enough away from them), and you get into the habit of doing that.  But, the problem is, IT ALSO CASTS OFFENSIVE MAGIC SPELLS!  This means if you are jamming on it to get out of the menu system, and hit it one too many times, you are suddenly trying to kill your wife, and she doesn't like that!  Nor do I like hearing her beg for her life with terror in her voice.  I am sentimental that way.  WHO GREEN LIGHTED *THAT* GAME MECHANIC?!Speaking of menus, Lionhead has provided handy dandy short cuts to get to the \"quests\" menu, the \"jobs\" menu, the \"sales\" menu, and the \"families\" menu.  These are all sub-menus of the \"Quests & Jobs\" main menu item.  You would think, then, that hitting those short cuts would bring you right into those sub-menus, wouldn't you?  And you would be wrong.  Instead, all 4 short cuts bring you to the same freaking sub-menu list, where you then have to scroll down to the appropriate sub-menu item, and actually select it.  To be fair to Lionhead, though, they DO highlight the sub-menu item for you, when you use the shortcut.  An additional menu issue is using items.  When you want to use a bunch of items at once (say the 10 XP potions you have accumulated), one would think you could just jam on the \"use item\" button in the menu system, and keep going until you are done.  One would be wrong.  INSTEAD, Lionhead dumps you back into the game and completely out of the menu system EVERY-SINGLE-TIME you use an item.  Want to use 20 XP potions?  Do you have 20 minutes?  My final gripe about menus is the lack of information about CURRENT STOCK!  If I am browsing a gift store, it would be helpful if the items I am browsing would show a current stock of my inventory when items are selected, so I don't accidentally stock up on too many things.  Having to physically go into each item menu and check on things, is stupid.  Also, not having a sort option for things like the books list, is almost criminal (you will know what I mean when you get a certain someone's 20+ page diary, which shows up in your inventory in a random order -- good luck reading it!).  It would also be helpful to be able to keep items, but \"hide\" them from view, unless specifically asked for.  You will accumulate notes and items in the game, which you will want to hang on to, but you don't need to see them in the full item list every time you are in there.Maps are almost useless in this game, they are zoomed out way too far, and you cannot zoom in (and I am playing on a 46 inch wide screen HD screen using HDMI, so don't try to tell me it is my fault for having the wrong setup.  There are no labels, and no way to self label, and the not even helpful \"this way to such and such town\" markings.Finally, expressions are as ridiculous as they were in the original game.  They would be mildly handy to help persuade people to like you, or dislike you, or whatnot, or for special effects.  BUT TO MAKE THEM THE PRIMARY, AND ONLY METHOD OF COMMUNICATION IN THE GAME IS JUST STUPID!  You will really grow to hate expressions (if you are playing \"good\") if you start showing trophies, or do your wooing of your romantic conquests in public, because inevitably the vast majority of the public will start to follow you around (something to be said for the \"evil\" option, and people fleeing from you!) completely in love with you.  That wouldn't be so annoying if the NPCs couldn't BLOCK YOUR PATH!  They will crowd behind you in doors and shops, making getting around VERY difficult, as you cannot just knock them back (unless you want to go dark side and ACTUALLY attack them). They will even follow you upstairs into your own home (WHY can't I CLOSE my front door when I am home?!), when you are trying to have \"alone time\" with your spouse -- who will react negatively to you (thinking you are more crass/pig like), if you try to sleep with him/her when people are around.  I have found the best way to get the NPCs to go away, is to turn my back on them, and stop moving for about 30 seconds.  They quickly lose interest after they have had their say (usually incessantly begging you to marry them -- I mean, honestly, the romance option would be MUCH more satisfying if it wasn't so stupidly easy to find a spouse and get married.  Do a few \"seduce\" expressions, and darn near the entire town will spend the rest of the game following you around begging for a wedding ring (and that gets old REALLY fast)).  I FULLY intend to be evil next play though, and that should help this annoyance immensely.Overall, *GOOD*, *SOLID* RPG!  Lots of fun, engrossing, good story.  Good side quests.  The dog is an interesting game mechanic, and I would like to see more exploration done on that mechanic.  The look and feel of the game is much improved over the original.  The depth of the game is MUCH deeper than the first, and over all this is a 4 star game.  If they manage to fix my gripes above in Fable 3 (and refrain from adding too many new ones), then I will consider the series a 5 star game.  Over all, good job Lionhead Studios!  I will be watching the news for Fable 3, closely.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001ASJIS6","reviewerName":"Patrick_91 \"Patrick\"","summary":"A Wonderful Game With A Mediocre Ending.","reviewText":"Like the above says,Prince of Persia was a great game. I played the trilogy on the PS2 and I didn't really like them all that much. This PoP for me was almost perfect. The story starts out when the 'Prince' looses his donkey named Farah (lol),who happens to be loaded to capacity with stolen gold,in a sand storm. He somehow ends up in the land of the Ahura and sees a women being chased by guards. The Prince comes to her aid and saves her. She later tells him her name is Elika and that she is trying to save the world for Ahriman and the Prince is welcome to help her. Little does the Prince know that Elika is hiding much more from him than he knows. The game is spread out through 24 missions,in order get further in the game you need to collect Light Seeds,there is no challenge to getting the required amount (540/1011) but there is trophies for getting them all. That can be time consuming,but the trophies are not worth the trouble (there all bronze XD). One thing I find weird is that the manual states that the 'Prince' is a mere nickname for the main character,but you later find out he is indeed a prince (but had only lived in his kingdom when he was a young boy.) The game never states what kingdom he is a prince of and why he doesn't want to return. I felt that the developers could have fleshed the 'Princes' back story a little more. They paid much more attention to Elika than the prince even though the prince is supposed to be the main character.The graphics in PoP are very good. They are cel-shaded witch give it a cartoony/comic book look,they do the job well but don't even compare to that of FF13 or Heavy Rain. I'd even venture as far as to say that Eternal Sonata's environments looked better the PoP (ES was released BEFORE PoP) The character design is top notch for it time (don't forget that this is a 1st generation PS3 game). The gameplay focuses more on platforming and less on fighting. You fight maybe 40 enemies (including bosses) in the whole game. The game also gives you a major crutch in that you cannot die! Elika saves you each and every time form death. I liked it,other people won't.My one major complaint with PoP is the ending. I found the ending repulsive in that the 'Prince' undoes every bit of hard work that you have done and FORCES you to buy the sequel (if there will be one &lt;.&lt;). Overall I'm very happy I didn't buy this when it was full price. I bought it nice and cheap used for 1/4 of its original price. I'd say its worth about that considering the ending was so freaking terrible and that the game was relatively short (under 12 hours).Edit: It seems Amazon censored my last paragraph where I listed the original price of the game and the price I paid, I have edited my statement accordingly. I'd like to say something else but we will leave it at that,","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2010"}

The gameplay video did not look up to par but after further videos of BF4 and DR3, none of them seamed to be up to par so I picked it up.I have to say that I am very hapy with my purchase.  Some people will say it is repetative but all games are repetative to a certain extent.  With Ryse, every level is different and enemies are difficult while on normal difficulty.  I dont understand the need for the Day 1 DLC and I wished it was better than what they gave so dont feel that you missed out.  The game has about 120 collectables and one set is a form of a comic book.  After collecting all of them, you will see what happened in between each chapter and why you have to travel around to each location.I do feel that the game has many combat similiarities to Batman AA/AC/Orgins and if you enjoy those, you could might Ryse.  Much like Batman where you beat people up and you can almost see their facial expressions, Ryse is slo motion as your complete your execution with Y or X and see their face in perfect agony.  You have to time your attacks perfecty and swiftly, once you tigger an exection with RT, the color of the enemy will change to yellow or blue and then you have to hit the button with that collor for the execution.

Because this game has far surpassed the slight boredome you experience in the first.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2008"}

One to four players can team up or compete.","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"Unique, endless fun from Sega","reviewText":"At a glance, Super Monkey Ball appears to be a big, blind step right back into the childlike atmosphere that nearly killed the N64. Graphics are cute and cartoony, the characters are sticky sweet and actually perform singing and dancing numbers, and the music is straight out of the days of Sid and Marty Krofft. Superficially, this looks like everything Nintendo did wrong in the last four years all rolled up into one big stinking package, and as such serves as an immediate stumbling block, right out of the gates. But I'm here to warn you; don't let that immediate impression fool you. Behind that childlike facade lies an intensely addictive puzzle / party game that's just biding its time, waiting for a chance to invade every aspect of your consciousness.This is a party game in every sense of the word, assimilating the best elements of nearly every multiplayer title in video game history and defecating upon the bad. Then again, it's also a unique, imaginative one-player puzzle game that's eerily reminiscent of Tetris in its horrifyingly addictive gameplay. It functions marvelously, whether you're surrounded by friends or stuck alone on a Friday night.Despite varying wildly in theme, each aspect of the game comes down to one consistent factor; you're in control of a tiny monkey, inexplicably captured within the confines of a translucent hamster ball. The world is yours to explore freely, so long as you remain within this plastic cage at all times. It's ingeniously ridiculous, mixing our comedic love of monkeys with our natural fascination with those big, American Gladiator-esque hamster balls (and, perhaps, the end result of smacking one across the room while something is still trapped inside.)In the one-player \"story mode,\" things move quite linearly. When the storyline reaches a standstill (for example, the heroic monkeys and the evil Dr. BadBoon are swallowed by a whale), the four heroes perform a horrendous song and dance number, signifying their understanding of what must be done, and the screen shifts to a stage select menu. Each stage carries with it ten maps, and each must be completed before the story can move forward. You don't have to complete them in any sort of order, so if you're having trouble with one particular map you can concentrate on one of the other boards, and take a break from the difficult level.It's at this point that the game puts on the first of its many hats, acting as a sort of messed up, first person, 3-D version of the old board game \"Labyrinth.\" Never are you actually in complete control of Aiai himself, instead you're tilting the entire plane of the level itself, and his hamster ball is merely succumbing to the forces of gravity. The learning curve is almost flawless, as each progressive level builds upon the skills you discovered in earlier conquests.Truly, the only real problem I have with the single player mode's gameplay is the terrible, automatically controlled camera angles. For a game that requires such absolute precision at times, it's almost unheard of to overlook the option of a player-controlled camera angle, and it's something that terrible wounds the enjoyment factor of Super Monkey Ball 2. The entire experience resembles a sickly, drunken dance, as you struggle to both reach the goal in time and maintain a course that won't confuse the camera.Fortunately enough, this problem is exclusive to the puzzle section of the title, and doesn't affect any of the available party games. Yes, there's more to this title than the immensely enjoyable rethinking of \"Labyrinth.\" In addition to the single player and multi player versions of the puzzle game, Super Monkey Ball 2 includes twelve distinct mini games, each of which can be played alone or with three friends. Each mini game is merely a rehashing of a title you've likely played before, yet slightly tweaked and respun so as to provide a fresh, new experience.On the whole, the mini games are very well done, and boost the replay value of the disc exponentially. I completed the single player mode in roughly seven hours, but I don't think my fianc&eacute;e and I will ever get sick of competing with one another in a quick game of arcade-style golf, baseball, bowling or billiards. It's a tremendous addition to a game that would otherwise be forgotten after the first completion.As far as the music goes, I'll say this; you won't be rushing out to pick up the official soundtrack. It's a collection mindlessly looped tunes, ranging from surreal ambience to bouncy cartoon themes. It fades into the background easily enough, which is all you can really ask for in a puzzle game, and at the very least fits in with the theme of each particular level.The graphics do their job... not breaking new ground with their beauty, but at the same time not spoiling the entire game with their horror. Chances are, if you're buying a puzzle game for its graphics, you're buying it for the wrong reason. Visually, this is a title that could've flown just as easily on the PlayStation One or N64, but the depth and mini games that really make it such a success would've had to take a pretty significant cut. In short, the graphics neither help nor hinder this one.Put cleanly and plainly, if you're the kind of person with even a passing interest in puzzle games, this one is worth a peek. It successfully matches the uniquely addictive atmosphere that surrounded Chu Chu Rocket, all the while blazing a path all its own. It's remarkably easy to learn, yet the early stages never really seem to border on redundancy. I'm proud to admit this game's in my collection, and I'd be more than comfortable with recommending it to my friends, despite its misleading exterior.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2003"}

You can control the direction of the game by being evil or erm...REALLY evil. Your main focus are your Minions which you use to fight baddies, move objects in your way, or get them. You have four races which are Browns (your main fighting Minions), Reds (long distance Minions that are immune to fire), Blues (which are weak but can revive downed Minions and can take down magical creatures and are immune to water), and Greens (they can ambush large enemies and rip them apart). When you acquire all the Minion gives you can summon them via holes throughout the game.You're main goal is to go from world to world helping the people so you can find parts from your destroyed tower. You can save damsels in distress to have as your mistresses and receive items like smelters for armor and weapon upgrades, blue, red, and yellow objects to increase mana, health, and maximum Minions. You are able to sweep your Minions to specific places with your right analog stick to solve puzzle and what not. All these features are fine and dandy but with the lack of a map or arrow you get lost ALL the time. Without a FAQ you'll have no idea what to do most of the time. You yourself can attack foes but you just mash the A button and it's the same 3 hit combo over and over again. Of course you can use your powers like shields, fireballs, and berserk your Minions but it doesn't help much sometimes. This game could have been so much more if you were more involved in the game. It's like a 3rd person real time strategy.There is a lot to do in the game but sometimes you just saying forget it and never playing it again. The game is very unforgiving with a lack of checkpoints. The graphics are pretty good and so is the audio but nothing that says next-gen in your face. The voice acting and dialog is very funny here and that helps ease some of the pain.

A record like Wilt Chamberlain scoring a hundred points in an NBA game, Lara may never be surpassed either.The two TRs that were the most similar in play and total gaming were #2 & #3. I still like their look on PC even today. #1's graphics were pixelated, but we loved it all the same. #4 & #5 are good too. Now, TR:AOD(1st PS2 game), everyone complains about, but everyone that slammed it, finished it, and maybe even played it again. No one ever says that they played the first level and quit or threw the game away, which I've done before(Doom3's one dimensional play). Tomb Raider will always be the thinking person's game, not the fast twitch kill 50 monsters in-a-row type of game. TR:AOD was a very good game with a not very good control scheme. I really liked the colorful graphics compared to the new incarnations of muted colors in Legend, Anniv., and Underworld. Another game that everyone complains about is Rez Evil4(pc), but is one best playing games around. Legend is the best of the new bunch(AOD,Legend,Anniv., and now Underworld), with few glitches and good play. Anniversary is good too, but it has some sections for me that my non-teenage hands can't move fast enough to maneuver. Spinning blades on walls and Centaurs are killing me from finishing that one, and I've been able to finish every TR game 'cept that one.Why have we gotten nine TRs so far? Because we love to play the darn thing over and over again. Just like your spouses and friends, you complain about them, but you always keep coming back. Personally I'd like to see a combo of TR:AOD and the last three, with a few items from the oldies. OK, back to TR:Legend, if you haven't played any TR games to date, this is a good starter. Also, start with one of the oldies 1-5. #1 is pixel-dated in todays standards. You always gain a greater appreciation for the newer games if you have played earlier incarnations. Try Legend or Underworld first also.Shooting in TR games is always a diversion to the true intent, being able to find your way through the maze of tunnels, cliffs, caverns, oceans, and buildings. All in all I don't have anything bad to say about Lara and her Legend. Some people are complainers and some enjoy life, just play it, as Nike says.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"One hell of a game (pun intended)","reviewText":"Ok, I'll admit that I overlooked Dante's Inferno for years. Everything I read indicated that it was a God of War clone, and a pretty bad God of War clone at that. Now that I'm getting a little closer to sunsetting my PS3 and moving on to the PS4, this was one of the games buried in my Amazon wish-list, so I figured I'd give it a shot. It turned out being one the best gaming decisions I've ever made.Combat - After playing the very clunky Castlevania Lord of Shadows II, I needed a game that offered sweet combat, and boy I got it! It's very refreshing to embrace combat, as opposed to shying away from it. In my opinion, there's only one aspect of the combat that reminded me of God of War. While engaging in battle, you'll get the occasional prompt to press 'x' button here, or 'circle' button there. But besides that, Dante's Inferno holds it's own. I think my favorite thing about the combat is the distance attack, that uses Dante's holy cross. I don't know, it's something pretty neat about shooting a series of crosses at demons. And, many of the combos are seamless - that's always a plus in my book.Weapons - Usually, if a game only offers two weapons, that's a problem. However, this approach kinda works for Dante's Inferno. I'm very satisfied using the scythe for face to face battle, and the holy cross to take care of enemies from a distance. As with several action games, there are magic attacks, but I'm reluctant to use them, as usual. For those who are wondering, the scythe feels nothing like Kratos' chaos blades, and the holy cross is like nothing Kratos has ever used.Enemies - I was very surprised with the enemy variety, wow! I believe there were 9 circles of hell, and each circle introduced new enemy types. Many of the enemy types were independent from each other. For example, many games may have a standard demon as an enemy type. Later on, you might see said demon with 'wings', and that's treated as a new enemy. Thankfully, I didn't see too much of that while navigating the circles of hell. Many of the bad guys were difficult to fight, but it never felt frustrating for some reason. Let's chat about the boss battles for a quick second. If the game has a weakness, this is where it's at. Don't get me wrong, the battles are fun and full of surprises. With that being said, they aren't too awe inspiring, and didn't evoke a jaw dropping moment for me. Oh, one more thing. The enemies look nothing like the ones in the God of War franchise, and there's more of a variety.Miscellaneous - Without a doubt, this has to be the most macabre game I've ever played! If you have an aversion to blood and nudity, it might be in your best interest to stay away from this one. There's not much to offer in the exploration department because of the fixed camera (ok, that IS similar to God of War lol). I've always heard about how short this game was, but I spent 15 hours on it, and that's not a short game. Well, here's something that could bother some people (although I didn't really care). Towards the end of the game, you'll have to endure 10 'trials'. These are very similar to the optional challenge maps that are popular in today's action game genre. I'll admit that some of them are hard, but just make sure you make use of your relics, and you'll be fine.I honestly don't have anything bad to say about Dante's Inferno. It exceeded my expectations in pretty much every category. I'm really hoping for a part II somewhere down the road, but we'll see. There's one important piece of information that I want readers to come away with after reading this review. This is NOT a God of War clone! Sure, they're both action games; but I could argue that this game is a little better than the first God of War. That's right, I said it! If you're planning on retiring your PS3 in favor of the PS4, you owe it to yourself to play this game. Go ahead, it might surprise you. Jak & Daxter III, you're up next!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2014"}

The sound is good. But these days \"technically proficient\" isn't quite enough, and other than an exaggerated drama based on some of the more psychedelic apocalyptic elements of Christian mythology. At the end of the day I could barely be made to care about the plot of the game, at points even becoming a little tedious, and inasmuch as it is an \"RPG\", you don't really have the option for a great deal of character development or customization. You buy a few things, put a few things into selection slots, and collect some artifacts, and the game is over. There's not much point in replaying it and not much point in going back through each level to find things you missed the first time (or didn't have the right tools to get them). I can't call this a BAD game, it certainly isn't, but it's just kind of an exaggerated apocalyptic cartoon, a caricature. If you like swinging swords at absurdly over-sized scary demon monsters, this is the place to be... if you're looking for a brilliant TPS / RPG or a deep, engrossing story, or disturbingly realistic environments, move along.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2010"}

Cooper","summary":"Excellent Attention to Detail + Superb Multiplayer","reviewText":"Graphics: In the graphics department you are probably looking at THE definitive next-gen gaming experience.  Textures are not overused, smoke/explosion/bullet effects add great visual atmosphere to the game, and you really do feel as though you are in a war zone.  The visuals are no less than stunning in Single Player mode, and multiplayer achieves high marks as well.Attention to Detail: I give this its own category because the attention to detail is almost unsurpassed in any game I've ever played since the 80s.  The exhaust fumes from the back of a tank, the chatter on the radio, the between mission stats of particular military equipment, the Judgment Day-esque atmosphere post nuclear explosion... all of it keeps you firmly grounded in the story.Story: The story seems like something Tom Clancy would write.  The sad thing is, all of the things that happen in the game take place over a 4-5 day period, switching between the view of U.S. Marines and British S.A.S. This is unsettling because you see how much chaos and destruction can be wrought over such a short period.  Some gameplay sequences are merely story devices, as you play as a character whose sole purpose in a mission is to be executed, or to crawl out and die after being horrifically wounded.  I've also had reports from friends who have played the game who had certain sequences turn out differently, and the story is somewhat dynamic based on choices you make in the game.Sound: All of the sound effects are great, though mostly you hear gunfire - the dialogue is excellent.  Each character has his own personality, and you feel almost sad when something happens to one of them.  The music really sets the tone of each mission/sub-mission as you can kind of gather what will happen based on the musical cues.Gameplay: Think of the other Call of Duty games.  Remove redundant controls, and some new options.Multiplay: You are really missing out if you do not have Live enabled with this game.  The sheer awesomeness of being able to fire through walls, be wounded and fire from the ground at your attacker, or having a helicopter machine gun the enemy team during a multiplayer match is something I haven't found in any other game.  You level up after each match, unlocking new weapons, \"traits\" (abilities for your class), and \"Create a Class\" options where you can create your own classes.  Also, unlock challenges to perform certain feats with a weapon to unlock special attachments for that weapon.  For instance, 25 head shots might unlock a silencer, or a better attachment for steady aiming.My current class is the 'stereotypical AK-wielding maniac' who runs around with an AK47, pistol, and an RPG strapped to his back.  You can focus more on a special forces type role, general assault, or sniper, or any combination.The radar works differently than most MP games.  Radar blips only show people who have fired a weapon, and silencing your weapon prevents you from showing up on radar, though it lowers your impact rating with bullets.Firing a weapon, then backing away and hiding while waiting for someone to investigate the gunshot is a valid strategy.I would be willing to say that this beats out Halo 3, and with the multiplayer aspect beats out Bioshock for FPS of the year... I can't imagine anything being better in the current crop of releases.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2007"}

Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Kevin C.

This is one hell of a mediocre game. It's one of those games where you can get shot literally hundreds of times and not die (uses INFINITE HEALTH over a health pack system)... For dummies (gives you arrows on where to go if you get lost). The graphics and style are cartoonish (so bad there are windows media player visualizations in some parts). The music is lame. The story is lame. I have no emotional investment in the characters and don't care where the story is going. AI is basic in which many enemies stand out in the open waiting to be shot. Weapons are very basic, other items lame (there is a door-opening scrambling device - could never figure the thing out). I don't see anything ingenuitive or original in the game whatsoever (except that it's an FPS with a female lead - so what) - if you disagree prove me wrong. And once again, as with many next-gen titles, it uses GRAB COVER. Not much positive to say about the thing. The hard case for the LE was very nice...I don't give it a 1, because there are far worse things out there. But I cannot for the life of me understand why this is a franchise. Not really impressed by it's production company either (RARE). Maybe this next-gen release is an upgrade visually from its predecessor in the franchise, but even compared to last-gen games like Halo, Half-Life2 or Doom3 produced years ago, it just doesn't measure up. It might make for a basic introduction into an FPS for a very young person that has never played one before.There are simply far better FPS next-gen and last-gen titles out there for the 360.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2007"}

Halo 2 is in the house.  So here are the pluses and minuses I have about the game.+ Amazing graphics, especially if you have an HDTV like me.+ Excellent music score (although some people hate the guitar inclusions I love them)+ Still the same superb controls as in the first Halo.+ More destructive vehicles and weapons.+ Duel Wielding to mow down your enemies.+ Longer than the first.+ XBOX Live!!!!!!!!!!!- As like most game endings, it blows.- Still wasn't that long on normal although I know Heroic and Legendary will be crazy again.- Lots of graphic pop-ups during cinematics.  This really doesn't get in the way of the fun.Well as you can see, the pluses definately outway the minuses and so the only reason I give an overall 4.75 out of 5 is the story.  It's just not as long as I thought it would be and when the end of the game hit I was very, very surprised to see I was actually done.  I just felt it should have gone longer and felt nothing was really accomplished at the end except only for killing the head brute and the Prophets.

{"product_name":"B005TH6BD4","description":"","reviewerName":"James Skemp \"JamesRSkemp.com\"","summary":"Inconsistent targeting is easily overlooked in this gem","reviewText":"When I first heard about Yakuza Dead Souls I was a little worried. The best part about the Yakuza series is the story, and I feared that they were jumping on the zombie bandwagon (albeit late). However, I should have reminded myself about the multitude of games I have that has the Sega logo on the box, as there was nothing to fear with this iteration in the Yakuza series.First, supposedly the game is not part of the official Yakuza canon. The way it's wrapped up (don't worry, the ending isn't cheap) it could be, but it's probably better that it's not.Unlike the other games in the series the combat is focused on guns, instead of hand to hand combat / picking up weapons from the environment. However, after a short time (excluding targetting hiccups), the combat felt fairly natural.Perhaps because of the change in combat focus, this game was also the easiest of the last three in the series. Recovery items are fairly plentiful, and I rarely found myself in a bad situation, and never died, during my 24 hours on normal (default) difficulty.Like Yakuza 4 you play as one of four characters as the story progresses, but unlike 4 you're only able to switch between the four at will in the premium adventure. There's nothing really wrong with that, but I would have liked to finish up a couple items before I got the trophy for completing the game. However, premium adventure allows you to continue where you're at, so I can finish the items I started. Once the game is completed two additional difficulty levels are unlocked, one of which is supposedly extremely difficult, so there's plenty of replayability.I'm quite honestly a huge fan of the series, so without a doubt the game gets 5 of 5 stars. There is an issue with inconsistent targetting, however, once you realize the issue you'll find it impacting your game very rarely, and you'll be able to recover from it fairly quickly.If you enjoyed Yakuza 3 and/or 4, and/or like the sound of a third-person zombie killing game, pick up Yakuza Dead Souls!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2012"}

Perhaps my main gripe so far with this game is that it's very easy to get lost and / or loose track of what to do / what you're doing. I've read that this game is comparable to past Zelda games. I don't think so. This game is no where near that enticing.This is one I really just don't get.

{"product_name":"B0054INKZK","description":"","reviewerName":"citan-uzuki \"citan-uzuki\"","summary":"Tediously Repetitive","reviewText":"The gameplay here is tediously boring and repetitive.  I mean, how many different holes and how many types of gaps are you going to need to jump across before you find it boring.  And to make matters worse, if you do miss the jump, you have to start back from the start of that area.  Usually, this is not too far back from where you were, but I recall fairly early in the game that after failing the jump a few times, I was taken back to a point previous to a boss battle!  That's cheap gameplay.  C'mon, use some creativity and come up with some fun activities for the gamer.Ok, the story had promise.  But really, such a beautiful story would have been better told in the form of an RPG.  Say, an RPG like the old Xenosaga franchise, or Final Fantasy franchise.  Now, it does not have to be turned-based gameplay, but you do want to invest in both plot and character development.  Here, Enoch's character was not developed well enough.  You feel rather ambivalent towards Enoch.  And you are never drawn into the story.  There was never any flow to the story.  All that requirement to jump and repeat yourself at the same spot took away from the plot.Here, there are very few options available to the player in terms of weaponry and armor.  You only get to switch your weapon when you steal it from an enemy, or during points in the game where you get to choose.  And then you're stuck with it until you steal another type or get to a switch point.  Not much control, and not much fun.All this platforming is just the kind of game that you want to play in mind-numbing repetition when you have an absolute abundance of time to kill.  But, in my opinion, it is not quality gameplay.  I can now understand why this game did not sell many copies.  And the people who bought it, just like me, were expecting a tightly-told story of Enoch.  And that is not what you get.  What you get is Enoch \"Light\".  The main character is Enoch, the main premise is that he is given a mission to apprehend the rogue angels (Watchers) and bring them before the Council.  Each of the Watchers are given a motivation for betraying God and throwing a monkey wrench on his plans for human evolution.  But it never gets any deeper than that.  The beautiful story of Enoch should have been given the right treatment.Ok, is this game totally bad?  It depends on the type of gamer you are.  If you are a dedicated platformer, then you might like it.  If you are in it for the story, then you will be very dissapointed.  If you like action, you will be dissapointed.  But, there is no denying the artistry that went into this game.  The scenes are beautiful.  The music is fitting.  The drawings are breathtaking.

If you've spent any time online, you know how frustrating hearing someone else's home theater through the TV can be. I read mostly positive reviews about the P21 and thought I would give them a try.Talk about a game changer. From a pure sound standpoint,they are incredible. I spend a lot of time on Modern Warfare 2 and the game experience is substantially improved through the headset. Ambient noises are everywhere and the bass is stunning. The first time I got loose with an ACR and blew up a car (and some bad guys) I couldn't contain my smile. Simply incredible. Also, being able to change the volume of the voice chat versus the gameplay is awesome. For most games, I mute all of the other players and just listen to the game, but when I play with my team, it's great to be able to listen to the game AND teamates clearly (as opposed to game turned low as not to interfere with my headset).If there are any complaints, they are from an wiring, set up standpoint. The headset is not wireless, and for me, that is a problem. I have 2 game stations, one that is a smaller screen and I play from about 4-5 feet from the television. The other is in my living room and the chords are a hassel and not nearly long enough. You can get a USB extension if you want, but in the wireless era, I don't want. Also, the instructions are very simple and make set up very easy. The problem is that my PS3 is my Blu Ray player as well and you have to go in and change the audio set up everytime. It's not difficult, but it would be nice if the headset turned off when it was unplugged from the USB and default setting were restored. I am also concerned about the longevity of the of the chords and control module. The chords are very thin and there is no sort of clip to stop them from just hanging and pulling on the connection into the headset. I will purchase a clip and fix it up myself, but for close to $100, that something that should have been included.Gripes aside, I'm not sure there is a better, more functional, better performing headset available for the PS3 and highly reccomend the Turtle Beach P21.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2010"}

You play Jack, a cop accused of murder and out to prove his innocence with blazing guns and flying fists.  The controls here are fairly easy to learn and the disarming of a criminal is what you really want to work at.  Not only does it give you life, but it's probably the coolest thing in a video game ever!  No longer do you just take the gun, now you can flip over them and break their neck on the way down, twist their arm behind them (still holding their own gun) and blow them away, and dozens of other amazing moves!  Add to that the ability to target multiple enemies while rolling (via Max Payne's bullet-time) and you get a very visual and fun game.  Now on to the bad parts: first, about 5 minutes into the game you suddenly find yourself playing a female exotic dancer who has to distract bouncers so Jack can get by them.  It's a mini-game, but it's unnecessary and stupid.  It takes roughly 15 seconds AT THE MOST to complete each section of the mini-game, but the lady dances probably a total of 5 minutes on the screen.  It's unnecessary and a waste of time when you're ready to go blow away some bad guys.  Oh yeah, and it's not something you want to be playing while your wife and kids are wandering through the room, so I took off a star for that one.  Also, you have the ability to turn off the blood, so cheers for that - but why not give us the option to turn off the profanity too?  At least with GTA 3 you could read the subtitles and mute the tv when necessary.  Here you just cross your fingers and hope for the best.  Loss of half a star for that one.

Since all the positive points have been hit on, let me say some of the little niggles that set the game back a bit.For one, combat can get repetitive. You only have one \"combo\" that you can perform, and special moves take a while to fill up. Basically each map is the same, enemies \"spawn\", you defeat them and you're allowed to progress. I guess what elevates the game is the animation and characters, and the strategy involved in the big boss battles and regular enemy fights. The limited combos though sorely hurt the game and keep it from that true 5 star rating. Basically it boils down to how quickly you can tap the x button over and over.Should you pass this game up? No, this is one of the few games in a while I actually purchased, and it was worth it. It's too bad it couldn't have been more though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

Randall","summary":"Is there any arena that Nintendo does not excel at?","reviewText":"Once again, Nintendo continues to prove why it is the dominant leader in the video game industry.  Other systems come along with more publicity or promises of flashier gameplay and titles, but Nintendo keeps moving along and defeated all challengers.  Its most recent full-size console, GameCube, has more than held its own against its fancier competition of Playstation 2 and X-Box, owing the superior quality of titles and better gameplay.Now, in the handheld arena, Nintendo continues to monopolize the market in a way that has discouraged any other video game manufacturers from trying to compete.  With Gameboy Advance, Nintendo has managed to produce a handheld device that would go toe-to-toe with mid-generation full-size consoles like Playstation 1, Super NES, and all Sega platforms.  Gameboy has been around since the late 80's and, despite being viewed as a lesser gaming system with competitors like Sega GameGear, Atari Lynx, and TurboGrafx 16, it somehow managed to be the only one left standing.  Once again, this is a tribute to superior quality of game titles and better gameplay.  Really, the only knock on the earlier generations of Gameboys was that the games they could play were limited in scope by the technology at the time.  Versions of the Super Mario games, Play Action football, and CastleVania were subdued versions of their NES and SuperNES counterparts (though I really did like CastleVania 2 for Gameboy).  That problem does not exist anymore.  Gameboy Advance now carries titles that are direct ports of original NES and SuperNES titles.  Super Mario World, the legendary game on which all future SuperNES titles were judged, translates perfectly onto Gameboy advance.  The gameplay and levels are all identical with even a little improvement in graphics and features (like a feature to save at anytime).  What is even more amazing is that, not only is GameBoy Advance perfectly regenerating earlier titles, but that they are going after the big boys of modern systems.  In November, Gameboy Advance will be releasing its own version PlayStation 2's landmark game, Grand Theft Auto 3!  While there will have be some scaled-backed concessions made to accommodate GBA's design, it will still be an amazing accomplishment to port a version of that game for a handheld.Despite all the gushing, there is one area where GBA is lacking and cost it a 5-star rating.  That has to do with lighting.  The GBA is not a back-lit system.  Therefore, the user will have to make sure they are in good light to play this system.  There are some lighting devices available for the GBA that can improve that lighting, but be wary of the which one you get.  I tried the wormlight and found that all it did was increase the glare on the screen.But, I digress.  This is a wonderful system.  The current titles provide hours of compelling gameplay and the promise of future titles will keep Gameboy Advance at the forefront of the handheld revolution for years to come.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2002"}
{"product_name":"B000U34SYQ","reviewerName":"GintaxAlvissforever","summary":"Not as good as Path of Radiance but knows how to make the game difficult","reviewText":"I will say this right now, this is probably the hardest Fire Emblem game up to date. Critics will always say that but that's why there's an easy mode in this game where you can save anytime.Radiant Dawn picks up from Path of Radiance taking place 3 years after the original game. The setting is still the same but the villain group has switched to Bengion who was your ally in the previous game and now you're playing as Micaiah and Sothe (returning from Path of Radiance) who form the Dawn Brigade in Daein to liberate themselves from Bengion. The first arc in the game will make you want to strangle someone with the difficulty, beside Sothe who has been improved greatly from the last game (but still ends up sucking in later levels anyway because now instead of being under leveled, he ends up being the Jagen and unless you're playing on easy mode, he won't be that powerful given he promotes story wise) all the other units are useless and usually get killed in one hit. What's worse is the game at the beginning forces everyone to survive up until a certain point and with pathetic units until trained, you'll be pulling your hair out.And it gets worse when you're playing as Ike's team in the third arc where the Greil Mercenaries are as powerful as ever but then switching back between them, the Crimean Knights and the Dawn Brigade meaning even on easy, the difficulty gets hard.The biggest blow this game has besides introducing more characters that up being irrelevant given how Fire Emblem characters that aren't main characters get pushed to the side is the fact that the support system is taken out. The support system is supposed to bring depth to characters, but removing the support system killed any develop. You were only allowed to know the character from the previous game and that's it so when it got to A support, the person ends up OOC for the sake of the crappy support with anyone system. Also, the game doesn't even warn you who can marry who in this game and basically again you need to play Path of Radiance to get an idea on who can get married (like Mist can only marry Boyd at the end of the game). The worse part is because there are so many characters introduced, you don't know anything about them. Everything about the Dawn Brigade is based on INTERVIEWS and that's unacceptable on how the creator themselves have to give us something to work with.The story overall does tie in some unanswered questions from the previous game, but some of the things could have been prevented if there wasn't miscommunication from both sides.And with gameplay, while things go smoother now when the characters run on the grid, there could have been more cutscenes (better voiced. Mist and Rolf had the worse voice actors in the game and no one gave credit to who did Shinnon's voice). The Greil Mercenary cutscene is still the best scene in the entire game...which is depressing given there are other important points in the game, but this still stood out.I would recommend the game for the most hardcore players but I disgrace, this game will tear your heart out and make you take an arrow to the knee. -_-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2013"}

With each new copy, the game comes with activation codes that unlock [1] hidden sewer levels (not sure how much), [2] an extra car (a hot rod), [3] spiked gloves for better melee attacks, [4] a sawed off shotgun that's more powerful than the normal one but with only 2 simultaneous bullets per reload, and [5] a special armor (Crimson Elite armor).I only found 3 of the hidden sewers and was not interested in finding more. You enter, fight a large wave of little ninja mutants, find their stash (nothing spectacular) and leave. The hot rod was unnecessary and mostly unused. You get 4 vehicles normally, each more powerful than the last and the hot rod is equal to the second vehicle you get. The gloves are also useless (unless you're out of ammo and desperate). The sawed off shotgun is fun and effective especially in boss fights, but slow. Finally, and certainly the most useful, is the Crimson Elite armor. Normally you can only pick 1 of three armors, each with a specific perk, but the Crimson Elite combines all 3 perks into one armor.Actual review (shortened)This game is a ton of fun. Special mention goes to the silky smooth movement, both on foot and in vehicles. I wish the Need For Speed franchise would take note as their recent outings have had controls akin to that of driving an ice berg.However this game feels unfinished from the get go.- The first noticeable problem is the graphics, which need to load (pop in) every single time you look in a particular direction. You look to the left, it loads. You look to the right, it loads. You look to the left again, it loads again. This continues to varying degrees throughout the entire game, but eventually you get used to it.- The plot feels less like a story and more like a \"to-do\" list, you're basically doing errands for people to the very end. Granted these missions are fun, but not particularly engaging.- The ending is incredibly disappointing. You'll literally be sitting there wondering why the credits are rolling already.Despite it's flaws, and taking into account it's current price ($20) I'd say it's a worth while buy.

But if you haven&#8217;t, Ground Zeroes does include a recap you can read through.  However, it&#8217;s still a bit confusing as lots goes on during Peace Walker.  Upon starting the game and looking at the absolutely stunning (and I really mean that&#8230;STUNNING) graphics and presentation, you will definitely get excited for the game.  But that excitement turns out to be bittersweet.Ground Zeroes&#8217; storyline consists of just one mission with two objectives.  Once that mission is completed, the credits roll and you get a &#8220;To Be Continued in The Phantom Pain&#8221; message.  The first time playing through the mission can take a player about 1-2 hours.  My own playthrough lasted 84 minutes, 51 seconds, but only because I just happened to stumble upon the right place by accident.  The mission is challenging because you&#8217;re basically dropped in the enemy encampment and it&#8217;s entirely up to you to determine how to proceed.  You can go in guns blazing or you can go in full stealth.  You get a waypoint for the first objective, but for the second you&#8217;re blind and must sleuth your way to the finale.  There are a few extra things you can do such as find hidden patches or rescue other prisoners, but it&#8217;s nothing too in-depth.  The gameplay is actually really tight and polished, and is easily the most immersive Metal Gear Solid game I&#8217;ve ever played.  After the credits roll, up to five side missions are unlocked for you to try.  However, these missions are not tied to the story in any significant way and serve as nothing more than filler.  They have a variety of objectives and all take place in the same area, only during different times of day.  The PlayStation 4 version has a dynamic weather system for these side missions which adds some cool variety to them.Graphically, this is easily the most impressive 8th generation game I&#8217;ve ever seen.  My jaw dropped when the game began.  I just couldn&#8217;t believe what I was seeing.  The 8th gen versions both run at a blistering 60 frames per second that remains constant, which gives both the game and the cutscenes a remarkably fluid look and feel.  Amazing that such visuals can be achieved on a game console and still have such detail in the textures, especially on PS4 which also outputs in 1080p.  Keifer Sutherland does a fine job voicing Snake as well.  I expected to hate it, as David Hayter IS Snake, but surprisingly it sounds great.So rating this game was rather difficult for me. I&#8217;m not going to jump on the hater bandwagon and call this game a &#8220;demo&#8221;, because plain and simple this game is not a demo.  A demo would imply that what you play here is also part of The Phantom Pain, which it&#8217;s not.  However, I do have to question the value you get for thirty bucks here.  The main mission is phenomenal, but there&#8217;s just not much to it.  I&#8217;m not sure why Kojima couldn&#8217;t beef it up a little more, especially since he knew this is all we&#8217;d be getting.  Sure, there are side missions that could hike up your playtime to 8 or 10 hours, but since they&#8217;re not unlocked until after the game ends, they feel like fluff.  Besides, gamers buy Metal Gear Solid for the story, not side missions.  At most, Ground Zeroes feels like your standard DLC pack, and should have been priced for maybe half of what it costs.  But the fact remains&#8230;this is the start of a new Metal Gear story, and it&#8217;s a really good one.  For newcomers to the series, I would recommend they start with Metal Gear Solid 3, and then move on to Peace Walker, as the story in Ground Zeroes is too far into canon to pick up completely.  For fans of the series, this is required gaming no matter the cost.  And if the intent for this game was to get us excited for The Phantom Pain, then the mission is most certainly accomplished.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2014"}

Now, let me start off by saying that this is not the Final Fantasy III you played, loved, and worshipped on the Super Nintendo years ago; that game is being re-released as Final Fantasy VI Advance on the GBA eventually (hopefully).  This instead is the real FF III which never made it here from overseas, and it has been remade and restructured to fit perfectly for Nintendo's smash hit handheld.  The graphics have been given a big facelift, and that's saying it lightly.  The character sprites have been replaced with full on 3-D effects that look great for a DS game, and the storyline has been tweaked as well.  Everything else about FF III is an old school RPG gamer's dream come true, even if the touch screen features feel tacked on and unnecessary.  Everything else about FF III though is a pure delight, and the Wi-Fi features are nice to say the least.  All in all, DS owners looking for an excellent RPG to pass the time should look no further; their prayers have been answered.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2006"}
{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

I have seen a lot of good review that game features a really good story and excellect cinematics, which both are very true and the experience well rewards you.Gameplay:I saw both critic and user(Amazon Purchases) reviews before deciding to buy this on great sale from Amazon for $15. As many users said that the difficulty is quite high even at normal which is quite true, if you are not accustomed to style of gameplay, you will die quite a bit. Tip: use the dodge excessively and Run & Hit attacks, going in blazing will get you killed in even in Normal. The game feature solid RPG mechanics, such as skill trees, upgrades, potion making, diagrams for crafting new stuff. The Inventory can be little annoying as you can have a lot of items but it automatically sorted into categories to help browsing. The game features simple dialogue system (it doesn't say good or bad), wrong line can get you killed or fail the mission ( side missions only, story ones will be restarted). One thing that should have been in game is New Game Plus, the abilty the take previous playthrough ( levels, and tools) in 2nd gameplay. Unforunately it doesn't meaning you have to start new playthrough. The game features the ability of transferring Witcher 1 save (I haven't played first one) but didn't get to try it.Graphics:European Developer from Poland, CD Projekt has done a great job at making a solid game engine that puts up quality graphics, environments are gorgeous and has significant detail in textures. The cinematics in game feature exceptionally good voice actors with high quality cutscences, they look very amazing without doubt. I was able to play highest settings on my rig without use UberSampling which is seemed to Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing - Best and expensive form of AA (Other Games use more dynamic Multi-Sampling. SSAA creates more refined graphics (really high smoothness) but it requires the most powerful graphics cards(HD 6970 or GTX 580) to do so. Since this is first usage of their engine, there will occasionally hiccups at certain points of game. Graphics of this game is truly to praise about.Story:From my own research, the game is based on famous Polish author books which are called Witcher Series, the game takes play after book stories, where the character Geralt of Rivia, a witcher 2 (sci fi like Mutant (X-Men) with super human abilities hunts monsters in the world and makes a living). He is experiencing memory loss (Amnesia) of few years of his life. The story begins with assassination of a king whom Geralt was working for temporarily. The story takes you three different locales, the last one is quite short and seemed too fast pacedm taking you to the conclusion. The game conclusion may not be satisfying but the most of the story is very exciting doing quests or exploring the place and killing monsters like a bad-***. \\Extras:This copy of game features the soundtrack which I say was very well composed, added to Game Soundtrack Playlist, a guide to the game story & side missions which is useful if you wish to find other possible scenarios to any decision in the game. Some Papercraft items and Developer Diaries given with English Subtitles ( Devs are Polish).In the end, this game definitely worthed $30 bucks, the sale was incentive for me to get this game and become a fan of this new series. I am looking forward to the next Witcher game and expect to be significant. From the looks, Witcher 2 was significant jump from first game similar to Mass Effect Series. These developers have put a lot effort to make english version to have high production value.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2011"}

V. Dam \"California Candyman\"","summary":"Ground Breaking Game - A bit too much back n forth","reviewText":"SINGLE PLAYER REVIEW ONLY - Normally I detest console ports but this is better than most.A ground breaking game in the style department.  I like the combination of FPS + RPG-Lite.  I am an FPS fan and never have been into RPG's  but this one grabbed me.  The fact that you make decisions on the game, pace, direction, weapons, skills, etc that are ONE WAY.  There is no \"save, try this and reload\" you make the decision, you live with it.  You die, it costs you to come back (none of the just reload stuff).  A new challenge over the typical run-n-gun type of games.The graphics are VERY COOL on the level of high end comic book combined with classic animation like Heavy MetalHeavy Metal (Collector's Edition).  As they say...a BAZILLION weapons (not always that much different though) and having to choose which ones you want to carry in your limited space.  The choices you have to make lead to a great game experience.  The wide open landscape, the ever expanding map as you explore and accomplish tasks, the skills, weapons, vehicles, inside, outside, hidden areas.........this is a fun game.I finished using Roland; now playing Mordecai.  There is some replay value but again the back n forth can get even older the second time around.  Still this is a fun game to play, it involves typical FPS skills, a little strategy and that's about it.  Less linear than most, more free form play.  Not heavy duty in either dept. like Fallout3 (RPG) or CoD Modern Warfare 2 (FPS), just good fun that;s easy to jump in and out of.Controls are decent, the only issue is when is run mode, when you strafe, you stop.  When you tab, you stop, you cannot just keep your finger down and resume running.  That and they should have added leaning.Best part of the game by far, graphic style, this is great to look at.  I hope they make Borderlands 2 or someone else makes a game with similar graphic styling.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2009"}

Wario, Mario's jealous rival, plays the hero--well, kind of--in his first console adventure.Money TroubleIn the depths of Wario's castle lies the plunder of his many adventures on the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance and elsewhere.While Wario kicks back in his crib, enjoying the videogame equivalent of bling-bling, a mysterious black jewel in his trove transforms gems into monsters. His wealth, which was once a source of pride, becomes his greatest foe. Now, Wario must scramble to recover his riches.Cranky CapitalistStep into an alternate world filled with quirky puzzles, swarming enemies and lots and lots of loot. You'll learn a multitude of cool moves as Wario progresses in the game. You can punch, kick, jump, grab monsters and objects and inhale surrounding coins like a two-legged vacuum cleaner. The game even has a wrestling game-ish feel, as you can string together combo attacks that The Rock would give his eyebrow for.Early on, you will learn the significance of special sticky balls that dot the landscape. Wario can cling to these balls to navigate tough spots, reach new areas, and even fight bosses.You can freely bash and manipulate your surroundings to discover secrets. For instance, you can pick up a stone pillar and swing it at your foes or spin a fallen monster to activate a switch that raises a gate.Perplexing PuzzlesThe side-scrolling action remains true to the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games that made Wario famous, but Wario's incredible range of motion gives him newfound freedom.Finding treasure often calls for flipping a colored switch, then searching high and low for the activated chest. Considering the size of the worlds and the plethora of hiding places, this can be quite a feat. When it comes to moolah, though, no task is too tough for Wario.Trap doors transport you to hidden worlds that offer mind-bending puzzles. Using your noggin' will yield some important items. A colorful band of fairies offers game info and advice throughout your adventure.GraphicsThe development team at Treasure have stamped Wario's Nintendo GameCube debut with colorful and vibrant graphics. Wario's signature look comes to life like never before. From his arrogant waddle to his purple trousers, Wario is immediately recognizable. Charles Martinet, the actor famous as the voice of Mario, brings a special zest to Wario's growls, chortles and guffaws.From gleaming castle walls to gloomy gravestones,Wario Worldis crammed with beautifully realized details. The action is relentless but the frame rate never falters, even when the screen is packed with dozens of enemies that explode into showers of coins when defeated.Wario Worldwill test both your brains and your button-mashing skills.","reviewerName":"jong chung","summary":"What a freak!","reviewText":"The graphics aren't the best with a tendency towards repetition, but the right effects and touches have been utilized to create varied environments, including staples like snow, desert, circus and jungle. Wario's animations are spot-on, and each of the weird enemies really captures the oddity of the world. I think the game would have really looked sharp if they opted for more of a claymation feel ?some of the creatures look halfway there already.The music plays up the action nicely and the sound effects are deliciously evil, with Wario singing nah-na-na-nah-nah during the paused screens, plus plenty of Wario outbursts left and right.Wario is a strangely endearing lug. It comes through in his goofy walk and his inexplicable self-confidence. I mean, here he is, ugly as sin, yet he still struts his stuff. Wario World is equally goofy and strange, but in an unassuming way, it's also good, unpretentious fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2004"}

There is only one series (or 2 games) that seemed better, and that series was the Jedi Knight franchise (Jedi Knight: Jedi Outcast, and Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy). This game beats them in graphics but the sword play could possibly have been slightly better though I know its hard since very few game companies have been able to do sword play that well in the past.I will admit iv NEVER been interested in the Metal Gear franchise. The only reasons this game got my attention was cause the main character always seemed cool and bad ass (as well as funny in some cases) and also the sword play looked really good.He mainly only uses a sword for everything. He also has an ability to where you can slow down the perception of time in a way and be able to pin point which directions you want to slice. Then it speeds up and he does it quite fast. You even fight giant robot things which can be quite fun. It took a little time getting used to how to do some stuff but once I figured it out the game because quite fun.Pros:1. Good swordplay2. Cool graphics3. Some bits of humor thrown in4. Metal Gear type stuff (if your into that stuff)5. A cool character you play asCons:1.Metal Gear type stuff (if your not into that stuff)2. Cut scenes can get in the way sometimes, or having to slow down and walk while your on a call with someone between missions.3. Can be a bit difficult at first until you figure out how everything works.4. The final boss battle can be difficult until you figure it out.5. Doesn't look like we will get a sequel anytime soon. :(So for a game it might not be the best out there. But as a sword game its pretty darn good.

{"product_name":"B00005YTYJ","description":"WithGrand Theft Auto III, Rockstar proves that not all  developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games.  This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a  monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages  to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerNote: This review refers to thePlayStation2 versionof  this game.Pros:Offers an enormous world for players to exploit, rendered in  staggering detailEqually fun whether you go on plot-based missions or run around as  a freelance crookCons:Ultraviolence, foul language, and adult situations mean you'll want  to keep this far away from kidsIt takes too long to get from one island to another, making some  missions tedious","reviewerName":"Bob Marley","summary":"Faithful Port","reviewText":"This game, as advertised, is like the PS2 version, only for PC.Rockstar has added to and cleaned up GTA 3's graphics for gamers who aren't playing on a TV. As a result, the game requires serious hardware to run. In fact, if you are planning on playing this game on a maching that barely meets the minimum specs, I would reccomend against it. This game chugs occasionally at 800x600x16 on my machine:P3 800640MB RAM32MB Nvidia GeForece 256AGPThat being said, I love this game! The ability to run amock in a fully realised 3d city is downright amazing. Being able to add my own tunes (the standard 'radio' stations get dull after you've heard them repeated 4 or 5 times) is a nice new feature.The missions, though repetative at times, have a few originals thrown in the mix. Personally, my favorite thing in the game is being able to do \"Whoops... Blew up the car again. Better steal a nice new one.. (pause) OOh, that one looks nice\"All in all, GTA 3 on PC is wicked entertainment for the (im)mature gamer in you.Next month I'll be buying a seriously newer video card, so hopefully that will smooth out some of the graphics issues.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2002"}

The differences are limited, and that's a fact whether you want to believe it or not. The graphics are better, they offer some different weapons and cheat codes, and there is a decent multiplayer aspect. However, at the end of about 10 hours playing it, you'll definetly get the feeling you've \"played this before\".

The story builds around the ancient Heavenly Sword, which once belonged to a powerful deity. It can never be wielded by a mortal without it slowly but inevitably draining their life-force.When the invading King (played by Andy Serkis) destroys the warrior clan that guards the Heavenly Sword, the clan leader&#x2019;s daughter, Nariko, takes up the sword in a desperate fight for survival.

Soatthiamroong","summary":"Great story & production value, strong gameplay","reviewText":"Pros:- Great story. It's kinda remind me of \"300\". The pacing and the way the story unfolds is right. The performances may be a little weird but I think it's also very entertaining.- Great production value. Animations are great, not just the combat moves or in-game animations but the performance also.  Art direction has a certain appeal. Characters and environment look great. Sound effects and BGM tracks are top-notch. Again, it's like watching a good, highly stylized epic movie, like \"300\".- Strong fundamental gameplay. You have combo moves, counter attack, special attacks, and some cool SIXAXIS tricks that you can play with. You get to play 2 characters. The good thing is that the secondary character helps making the game more fun, not dragging it down like many other games.Cons:- Learning new combos can become a chore. You'll end up using the same simple sets of moves over and over if you don't want to memorize the more complicated ones. Also, using 3 kinds of attacking and blocking requires some getting-used-to.- No character upgrade. You unlock new sets of moves as the game progress but that's about it. No weapon or status upgrade of any kind.- Not much replay value. You can unlock some special feature videos and art gallery, but nothing related to gameplay, except the Hell difficulty.In Conclusion:It's a junior version of \"God of War\" and \"300\" combined. It certainly has rooms for improvements, but the fundamentals of a good game are already there.If you could get a good deal on this game, buy it. At least, rent it and give it a try. You'll have fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0088MVPFQ","description":"","summary":"Not the most original, but still a blast.","reviewText":"Despite what the title says, this is actually the third instalment in the New Super Mario Bros series. The first game was lauded for bringing the series back to its roots, and the second added a much needed layer of polish as well as an ambitious multiplayer, NSMB feels like its lacking purpose and identity. In fact I would go so far as to say that's its sole purpose was to launch Nintendo's downloadable strategy as well as the 3DS XL. This is, in fact, the worst aspect of the game. Unlike previous games in the Mario cannon, this one fails to break any new ground and is the kind of \"me too\" sequel that Nintendo claims to hate.While that may seem like a pretty poor way to start out a 4 star review, it does aptly take care of the \"elephant in the room\". If you can't deal with that, then there in no point in continuing on reading this review.So what makes it a 4 star game? First, it goes without saying that Mario has a reputation of offing high quality titles that are well made, accessable, challenging, engaging, and above all else fun. In that respect NSMB2 fits in perfectly with the Mario cannon. From the instant you turn on the game, it's pretty apparent what you are supposed to do. The game starts out simply enough, it shows you the mechanics without holding your hand too tighly (as far too many games are guilty of) and guides you through the game. It's appeal will be to the core as well as the casual gamers. In that respect the game is brilliant.Graphically, it looks much like it falls more in between NSB and NSB Wii; basically the style of the first but the fidelity of the second. It's bright, colorful, and varied; in other words, very Nintendo-like. The 3D effect however, leaves a lot to be desired. As you move the 3D depth slider up, it gives more of a perception of depth, but the beautiful backgrounds become blurrier and blurrier. Granted, it only has that effect in the levels and not the overworld, but that's not where it really counts, it it? I find that if you really want the 3D effect the best place for the slider is in the middle. It's a nice happy medium, but to be honest, you really aren't missing much to leave it off, at least the viewing angles will be good.Sound is a bit of a letdown. It's not bad mind you, in fact it's memorable in ways modern game music rarley is, but the music was yanked straight out of the previous titles. No original music was added, only slightly remixed. I love Koji Kondo's work, and the lack of new music is felt. Even 2 or 3 new songs would have been a great addition.The controls are spot on, no gyro gimmicks, only a simple touch needed to activate your spare power up. I for one am glad for that. Mario feels like he should, an extention of your hand. If you die, it's your fault. The flying mechanic has returned from Mario Bros 3 on the NES, and feels almost indentical. The only real differences are that you hold the jump button instead of tapping it, and that your flying meter depletes depending on how long you run to fill it. It's somewhat jarring at first, but it makes sense I suppose. Fact is though, theres really not a whole lot of places to run/fly so it's a moot point.The level designs are, as usual, great. They are filled with secrets and collectables. But the big difference this time around is the coin collecting. The ulimate goal in the game is to collect a million coins. While that may seem unreasonable, Nintendo made some adjustments to the design to compensate. Gold rings turn enemies gold and killing them yeilds coins, bonus levels are filled with them, and every coin you collect is put into a bank at the bottom of the screen. It's addicting and really is one the reasons that will keep you coming back. You can even send your scores via street pass. Finally coin rush mode is exactly what it sounds like. You are given 3 randomized levels in which you speed run while collecting all the coins you can, the balcance between time and score makes for a very challenging mode. Those scores as well can be exchanged via street pass.There is a local 2 player mode, but I have yet to try it because I don't know anyone else with the hardware, but I do know it requires both players to stay on the same screen to progress, that is somewhat disapointing considering that it's a handheld game. The lack of online is disapointing, once again, a missed opportunity on Nintendo's part.Overall, it's a great game. I encourage any Nintendo fan who isn't put off by its lack of originality to pick this game up. It's the best 2D platformer on the system. That is of course assuming you've already purchased Super Mario 3D Land. If you haven't, pick that up first, it's just a better game with more to offer. Either way, you've got some platforming to do.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005V6BB","description":"Medal of Honor: Frontlinemarks the debut of the Medal of Honor franchise on the PlayStation2. InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"David Smith","summary":"it's no call of duty.","reviewText":"let's see, this game was made about 5 years ago.. maybe then, it was considered great, but now?  nope!  call of duty 1 for PC was way way better than this.  no thanks.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2006"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"JLeack \"Jleack\"","summary":"Extremely unique, but boring to play","reviewText":"If you're looking for a detective game, L.A. Noire is the best in the business. With some extremely well-presented facial animations, interrogating people is something fresh and unique. In addition, the voice acting is spectacular, and in conjunction with an overall quality presentation creates a very unique, noir style experience.However, while unique expeirences are welcomed, this game isn't very entertaining. Much of the game is spent walking around buildings pressing X to find clues, which is mindless, then interrogating witnesses, which has no effect on the outcome. Both of these tasks are fun for a few cases, then quickly dry up. The representation of Los Angeles is spot on, and I applaud Team Bondi for doing so well, but the outdoor environments aren't integrated well into the framework of L.A. Noire. They simply act as a means of traveling from one mission to the next, and even then you can have your partner drive you from point A to point B instantly.This game isn't very fun to play, and it is definitely not something to play when people are over, because in my experience they'll fall asleep or want to do something else. L.A. Noire executes well on its goal, but isn't enjoyable enough to warrant purchase. Pass on this one unless you think you'd find this style of game engaging. It definitely won't reach its hand out to do that for you, though.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2011"}

I personally don't mind the lacking power button, it's not that big of a deal to hit the PS3 button and choose shutdown. It's not like you have to get up to turn it off. But, the most exciting thing to me is the bluetooth. I still find myself pointing the remote at the PS3 out of habit, but it is an awesome change from my other remotes, some of which don't work if you are accidently blocking part of the IR. I think this will revolutinize all remotes in the future, and a few years from now we will wonder why the heck we ever used IR remotes that need line of sight.

{"product_name":"B00005LOXE","description":"The two classic RPGs in this compilation not only represent hours upon hours of story, character, and action, they also present the background for two recent bestselling, critically hailed games:Final Fantasy IXandChrono Cross.With all the different names for the original 1991 release of the first title in this compilation (Final Fantasy IVin Japan,Final Fantasy IIin the U.S.), role-players new to the game may get confused. Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation. InFinal Fantasy IV, players take on the role of Cecil, a loyal captain who questions the orders of his king, and for it is sent to slay a mysterious beast in a nearby valley.InChrono Trigger, Chrono must follow princess Marle's teleportation through time and locate her before an intergalactic parasite arrives to destroy the world. The original game, also on the PlayStation for the first time, was one of the first nonlinear role-playing games. The decisions that players make during the game will point them toward one of more than a dozen possible endings.These new versions retain the authentic Japanese SNES stories and characters while updating their graphics and adding new full-motion video sequences and other features.","reviewerName":"clifford goldenberg","summary":"good game but not perfect","reviewText":"I don't get why these remakes aren't perfect.Final fantasy IV suffers some major slowdown when you use menus in combat,and the load times before battles and switching to the sub screen in chrono trigger are absurd.That said,these are still very playable versions of two of the most important games in RPG history,and taken as such are worth buying.All the old timers will get to relive their super nes glory days while all the kids who cut their teeth on final fantasy VII might actually learn something about the genre's roots.Aside from some nice new FMV and a decidedly better translation on FFIV,though,don't expect a lot of improvements.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2001"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Ivan Orozco","summary":"classic mario best gamecube game ever","reviewText":"super mario sunshine is a classic the best of the best great great game buy it if your a mario fan you wont be sorry","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Crusader","summary":"love it","reviewText":"kingdom hearts was a brand new concept game in its time and was a hit for the ps2. the game was perfect back in the day.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0001NE48U","reviewerName":"Robb Boutros","summary":"A good start. Needs more refining though.","reviewText":"For some reason Star Wars and video games don't seem to get along very well. There really haven't been any good Star Wars games on consoles since the SNES Super Star Wars series back in the early 90's (Jedi Outcast for PC notwithstanding). Star Wars Battlefront is looking to rectify that. And it, to all intents and purposes, comes pretty close.Star Wars Battlefront can be best described as Battlefield: 1942 with a Star Wars mod. You have the basic classes of soldiers from the Star Wars universe; Rebel solider, Pilots, Stormtrooper, Snipers, and even Wookies. All with thier unique weapons and abilities. There are squad commands to a limited extent. Basically you can order who ever is in your close proximity to back you up, hold position or advance. Personally I was looking for a little more deeper command structure, like in the EA game Freedom Fighters. The graphics are very good. Everything has a very Star Wars feel to it.The controls are somewhat confusing at first. About 2 one hour long  sessions are required to really get used to them. Piloting flyable vehicles is quite difficult. Though the maps are large, it's a constant challenge to NOT crash into anything. The game environments run the gamut of the Star Wars universe. From Yavin to Hoth they're all represented. Some of the game environments are more combat friendly than others. There's lots of open space and at times cover is hard to find. One thing that didn't make it into the game is the player's ability to \"lean out\" from behind cover. This makes things difficult when in the middle of a fire fight. Also the single player campaign could have benefited from more depth. There's Galactic Conquest mode and Historical Campaigns, but there's no real story line and no othe objectives other than \"capture command posts\" which are indicated by beacons of colored light. There's no \"storyline\" to speak of, but footage from the films is used to try and give the action more context. Again, I was expecting more of a Freedom Fighters type of single player with more compelling objectives. But unfortunatley I didn't find it. During Galactic Conquest there are \"Planetery Extras\" you unlock. For example, if you're playing as the Empire you can unlock Darth Vader to fight along side your troops. Sounds cool and to and extent it is. There's also Split Screen action so you can take on a friend or play co-op. One thing that bothered me was that in training mode you are only shown videos of how to do things. The passive training mode did little to help me during the actual gameplay. A more interactive mode would have benefited players more.With no Network Adaptor I was unable to try the online modes. But after playing the Single Player game, I get the feeling that the online mode isn't much different. Single player feels more like a practice mode for the online games.Okay now, why did this game get 4 stars? Even with all it's problems, this still is a pretty fun game once you've been playing it for a while. It's also a very good game graphically. One thing I'm hoping is that Pandemic and Lucas Arts will take the foundation that they've laid down for this game and build on it. Giving it a more extensive single player mode and making some things a little more player friendly. There's enormous potential here. They just have to tap into it. Wait till this one is on sale.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2004"}

The shooting is solid 3rd person with the ability to aim down sights if needed. The game has challenge with the low amount of hits you can take and the limits on missions (some have time, don't be seen, rescue someone, no regenerating health).It's a solid title and shouldn't be overlooked because it's not a established series, if you like shooting bad guys it's a bit generic but it does what it does well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2012"}

This accessory can play Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance games on the Gamecube and on your big screen TV. Not only that but you had a lot of customizable options to boot making it not only a great accessory but useful for anyone who ever bought a handheld console and the games for it. Hands down, this was the best accessory for the Gamecube during its life cycle.Setting up the Game Boy Player is real simple: you connect the flat, black contraption onto the bottom of the Gamecube and it snaps in place. Connect any Game Boy/Color/Advance cartridge into the slot on the attachment, load the start up disc into the Gamecube disc tray and turn it on. After it boots up, you can use the Gamecube controller or the Game Boy Advance (via the GBA link cable) to change the options and/or play whatever game is loaded on the bottom. While GBC/GBA games play exactly as you saw them on the handheld, the Game Boy Player has color pallets that you can use for the original Game Boy games to show some color. You don't have to turn off the GBP to swap cartridges; it comes with a \"hot swap\" option where it will stay idle while you change the games. And for those games that supported up to 4 players, you can take the Gamecube controller and 2 GBA link cables to connect 3 Game Boy Advance handheld consoles with ease.The PROS: It works exactly as it said it would. Now you have a choice between using your GBA or the Gamecube to play any Game Boy/Color/Advance game. The customizable options are great; you can set it up any way you like and Nintendo went out of the way to include everything from supporting GBA link cables to using Gamecube controllers or GBA handhelds to play the games to actually being able to play hundreds and hundreds of classic Game Boy games and newer Game Boy Advance titles. It couldn't be any easier to set it up on your Gamecube.The CONS: Because of screen resolution differences between Game Boy games and Gamecube games, you won't see the game screen totally blown up so there are borders in place (there are many to choose from, so it's not bad at all.) Also, the Game Boy Player disables the rumble/motion sensor and tilt features some Game Boy Color games had at the time.Despite the small drawbacks, this is a must own for any Gamecube owner and those who grew up playing with the Game Boy handhelds.

The spec ops mod is awesome and I wish they would release updates for that instead of Multiplayer.For the people rating this 5 stars is amazing to me.  Unless you are a hardcore 360 gamer and trying to get into PC games.  But even then I would say 2-3 stars at most.I have played MW2 sense it has came out hoping it would get better.  But it has got nothing but worse.  And by worse I dont mean graphics wise or anything like that.  For the people that rated this 5 stars and said that this is how it was designed.  What does that mean?  We know that and the way it was designed SUCKED!!!  Everyone knows with PC games online there are hackers everywhere more than there are on 360 or PS3.  That is one of the main reasons dedicated servers are better not just for the fact of better ping and to chose exactly what you want to play but for the fact that you had admins that could kick and ban those pieces of %$&^%$ that ruin the game by hacking.  Not to mention that with dedicated servers the host always has an extreme advantage online because he is in game with a zero ping with a reaction time about a half second faster than everyone else.  There isnt even an option to have a kick-vote.  Oh but you can go to their steam webpage and submit a problem to steam about how they are hacking...im so glad they have that feature because its about 2 steps lower than worthless.  Steam doesnt give a &^%#& about hackers nor are the trying to fix it.So for all the people that rated this a 5 I'm not saying you are wrong because it is your opinion.  You might really like this game or IW paid you off to right one of the few good reviews on here.  Either the case, I will save your amazon names so when I read reviews for other games on Amazon I will be sure not to pay any attention to the ones that you guys have written because we have 2 completely seperate views on video games.In the end if you are thinking about buying this game this late in the release just to try in out...I would definantly find a friend with it or maybe just stop and ask a random person if you can come over to his house and play it because it is highly disappointing in my eyes....SHAME ON ACTIVISION and IW.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004EVWYYG","description":"","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"Another generation, Another great adventure","reviewText":"I've been playing the Pok&eacute;mon games since the Game Boy Color days. I didn't know anything about it until my cousin was talking about it. It sounded stupid, yet interesting. Sure enough, I ended up wasting quite a few batteries playing this game. Pok&eacute;mon is basically built for children. The game isn't that difficult. There's not a lot of moves. It's turn-based. But it holds it's charm and has such an addictive mechanism for children (and adults), that South Park did a great parody of it in the 90's. But enough about the past. The 5th generation of these abused creatures is back, and this time, it's almost the same exact thing!Which is a good thing, if you ask me. Just to give some gameplay background of the series, Pok&eacute;mon adventures start out with a professor of the island you live at asking you questions, you picking one of three rare Pok&eacute;mon (grass, fire, water), you leaving your mom - dad's M.I.A. - behind to become a trainer, and then heading out to collect Pok&eacute;mon data on a device called a Pok&eacute;dex. The Pok&eacute;dex is a sort of encyclopedia, giving you information on seen Pok&eacute;mon and then more information after you capture them. Capturing a Pok&eacute;mon requires you throwing a Pok&eacute;ball at a creature during battle, and locking it into place. It's sort of like how the Ghostbusters do it, only faster and less messy. During your collecting, you also go on various side quest for people, battle other trainers, and train yourself to beat all of the Pok&eacute;mon Gym masters (just think of them as bosses). This is essentially the series in a nut shell. So why is there five generations of the same style game? It might be because Nintendo doesn't need to fix what isn't broken.Pok&eacute;mon Black/White is a bit different than most of the other games, at least in it's story. Team Rocket, the bad guys of the previous games, are no longer the bad guys. Instead, Team Plasma are the new bad guys, and they're a bit more realistic than the previous villains. Team Plasma closely resembles the animal rights activist we have in every country. They're just a bit more extreme in some manners. They feel Pok&eacute;mon are mistreated and should be set free. You'll get this message pushed at you during the entire game. Nintendo did a great job at making me hate their guts, because they were extremely annoying when they popped up. I missed Team Rocket when I played, but these guys feel more like true bad guys than Team Rocket ever dreamed of being.The new visuals of the game are top notch to the series. It's great seeing the cities come to life when you walk through them, but it still doesn't change much to the game. If you're really wondering about the newest changes to the game, aside from the Pok&eacute;mon , look no further than the way the game is a bit more fast-paced. The tweaks they did to the game really shine, as they just make the game feel a lot more fluid than before. Along with that is the more annoying features of the series has left, and hopefully for good. TMs are no longer used up like before. This is one of the more annoying things about the old game, as sometimes it's just a hard choice to make on how to use these moves.If you've never played the series before, this isn't a bad start at all, but you may want to get familiar with the previous installments before getting Black/White, if anything just for the story. The game is so well defined in it's own way that going back afterwards is kind of hard. Trust me, I'm playing through HeartGold again, a game I loved, and there's several little things that make the game feel old. Real old. But if you want a solid experience with online support, this is the game to get. A top of the line title from Nintendo, once again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B008XMSR6G","description":"Neo-Paris. 2084.Personal memories can now be digitized, bought, sold and traded. The last remnants of privacy and intimacy have been swept away in what appears to be a logical progression of the explosive growth of social networks at the beginning of the 21st century. The citizens themselves have accepted this surveillance society in exchange for the comfort only smart technology can provide. This memory economy gives immense power over society to just a handful of people.Remember Me is a 3rd person action adventure where players take on the role of Nilin, a former elite memory hunter with the ability to break into people's minds and steal or even alter their memories. The authorities, fearful of her knowledge and capabilities have arrested Nilin and wiped her memory clean. After her escape from prison, Nilin sets out on a mission to recover her identity, helped by her last and only friend. This search for her past leads to her being hunted by the very people that created this surveillance society.","reviewerName":"Brendan Riley","summary":"If 3.7 stars were possible - here's why..EDITED","reviewText":"I'll start with the amazing things about this game. First, and most noticeable, are the graphics. Absolutely stunning. This is exactly what you would expect to see on a next gen console that is on its way out the door (presumably later this year). The lighting is superb and even plays a pivotal role in several fights later in the game. You can tell that this game is a labor of love for the developers here, because detail is everywhere.When movies first came out there were no extras, or at least very few. Then some director, probably someone like Howard Hughes, decided to add extras. Doing so added a sense of realism and attachment to not only the scenery, but also the scene taking place. In the game, there are robots everywhere, cleaning this and that, and there are signs that pop up as you get near them - even telling you what's on special in that restaurant that day! There is stuff on the ground, blowing around, hanging, and I could go on, but I'll not bore you. While this may seem like typical stuff common to games these days, the sheer level of detail in trivial things like this is enough to gawk at.Also, the over-arching premise of the game is pretty cool too. According to the game, in the not too distant future, memories and experiences, essentially, will be recorded on a huge mainframe somewhere. Thus, memories become digitized. The developers show how this could be used recreationaly (a guy buys a first kiss memory, and a \"drugie\" talks about \"just wanting to remember something happy, man\" to a dealer) and how this sort of digitization can be abused by the powers that be. This is where the story comes in.While I'm not going to give a synopsis of the story (that's what playing the game is for), I will say that at 43% completed it feels predictable. The guy that helped you out may not be such a great guy after all and your character, Nilin (yes, she's a girl, deal with it. She could kick my butt!), is feeling not so trusting of his motives, behaviors, and rationale. We've heard this one before. While not uninteresting, it is nothing new. There are great moments after each Episode (or level) where Nilin has a monologue and tells her feelings on the state of things within her head, and outside of her control. This creates a depth in character as she wrestles with morality, a shocking feature to be included in a game.The gameplay is also pretty predictable. You run here, fight these guys, then jump and climb there. There's no new life being breathed into this genre, in fact, some is being taken out. As you approach an object, an arrow appears above it in accordance to your own position. Basically the route you need to take is mapped out exactly for you when climbing. So, yes, this is a rather linear game. But it isn't so linear that it is abrasive. The desire to just explore Neo-Paris is certainly present throughout the game so far, but is left unfulfilled due to lack of ability to do so. Oh well.As far as the gameplay is concerned, the creme de la creme is the ability to remix memories. A good example of this is when a general, or some such official, remembers having an argument with his girlfriend. Nilin comes in and enters his data memories and tweaks certain things to get the desired result. So, you, the player, have to manipulate certain objects until the aforementioned result occurs. In this particular situation, you must make the general \"remember\" that he shot his girlfriend in a drunken rage. The result - he comes to after Nilin escapes and he realizes what he's done and kills himself in real life. Crazyness. Unfortunately, this system is used all too infrequently. I've used it maybe twice so far. If they had utilized this gem more often this game could have easily been a 5.There is an interesting innovation for the fighting, too, though. It is simply punch and kick and then dodge and repeat, BUT, you can customize your own combos (within preconditioned parameters). The game provides a combo layout (square, square, square, or square, triangle, triangle, square....) and you fill it in with your choice of three \"types\" of attacks - either power move, regenerative, or cool down. These are all explained in the game, and if you're interested enough, you'll buy the game so I won't describe them here. Besides, if you're a crafty gamer, maybe you can already figure out what they do?Overall, this is a fun game, but so far it hasn't captivated my heart to the point that while driving back home I think \"Can't wait to get me some of __________ (fill in blank with awesome game).\" If you're looking for a mindless good time with a story that is engaging but not spellbinding, and gameplay that doesn't scream revolution, but is fun nonetheless, then this is for you. Also, I thought I would mention that thus far, again about 43% into the game, I have seen no reason for this to be rated Mature. There has been some slight smear of blood on the wall but that's about it. When you, or an enemy, gets hit, there is no blood that flies out (God Of War style). The language hasn't been offensive either.EDIT 8/1/13: Ok. So I put this game down to play The Last of Us (which if you don't own, then you should really stop reading this and go buy it now). In my opinion it was poor timing to have this game released so close to a monstrously anticipated title such as The Last of Us. Well, I beat that game, and so I returned to Remember Me, as it was left unfunished - about 50% through when I stopped playing.The problem was that once I started playing again, I was bored immediately. I did a few fights, even remixed a memory, (my favorite and the most redeeming value of this game) but I still just lost interest within a few seconds. It wasn't because the Elite Enforcers are a lame enemy, it was just SO boring.Part of the fun of games is figuring out where I can climb next, and if the developers can't create an intuitive \"flow\" of climbable objects then phooey on them. Don't put an arrow telling me where to climb, I should be able to figure it out for myself. I wouldn't go so far as to say that doing so is \"offensive to my intelligence\" but it is downright unnecessary.Also, the fights are very tiresome. Even with a break of about a month between where I left this game off and where I picked it up, I was still bored with the fights.This game boils down to one thing: predictability. This is why my title says \"3.7....\" yet I switched my four star original rating to a two star. Remember Me is fun and endearing at first, but once you play a bit, you realize, \"Hey, I've done this before...like a thousand times.\"","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2013"}

Third, the game's \"missions\" and other things become tedious after the 1000th time that you have done them.  Even provoking the police gets boring after a while.  Additionally, there was very little storyline or cinematics to provide an actual story.  For example, the character's ex-girlfriend all the sudden becomes a factor on the last mission.  I wish there were radio or television broadcasts that would display who or what the character affected.  Like if you murdered a mafia boss, the news would display what you did, on television or something.  Also, what's up with NPGs all the suddenly disappearing after the missions are completed?  That's a cheap tactic for the developers to limit the storyline and make it shallower than it already is. The only thing going for the game is the freedom involved, but with all that freedom, the game is full of itself.  The game doesn't portray the grittiness of the streets. In fact, the Don of the La Cosa Nostra wouldn't like this game either.  It's just too incredibly boring after a while.  Hopefully, games in the future such as The Getaway will resolve this inordinate shallowness of Grand Theft Auto 3.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000066RKC","description":"Based on the same elements that made the movie so enjoyable--fear, suspense, and the possibility that your teammate might be infected--The Thinglets players slowly creep into the action with the help of several nonplayer characters (NPCs), whom you control and use to protect and aid you and your group. Using a core team of engineers, medics, and soldiers, players must manage and control their level of trust in, and fear of, you. They react to your actions, and might betray you if they think you might be the Thing. Conversely, you must constantly monitor which one of them might be infected and dispose of that person. Other characters must trust you, but if they fear you, actions as drastic as coercion might be necessary. For example, if a soldier doesn't have confidence in you, you may have to put your gun to his head to convince him you're not the Thing. For his sake, he'd better believe.","reviewerName":"TorridlyBoredShopper \"T(to the)B(to the)S\"","summary":"Skin and Snowmen, The Playmates Cold Climates Create","reviewText":"Its been years in the coming, too many to count in fact, so after seeing the previewed version of The Thing and having a short taste of its very \"M for mature\" greatness, I couldn't help but write a review about this unique roller coaster ride brought to us by the good people at Universal Interactive and Computer Artworks. (Give them a hand!!).The elements of my deliciously enticing experience:First, I feel compelled to try and stress how great the mood that this game was able to produce actually is. The look and the feel itself was so richly enticing, with the angles and the interiors drifting into darkened realms that were very much akin to those that the movie helped bring to the surface. It had that eerie ability to conquer goosebumps from the \"seemingly hardened\" and to make you look over your shoulder the whole time, pondering on the proximity the aliens the whole time. This combined with a second portion, the more unique \"trust/fear mechanism,\" adding to your interaction with the people you met and gave those interludes a little slice of that down-home Antarctic paranoia we all know and love. Through this useful feature, you actually have the ability to calm freaked out teammates by giving them a confidence boost (and weaponry in the process) or to test them if you feel they could be part of the alien menace masquerading as your friends. Next, there are the aliens themselves, shambling nightmares that are somewhat like the movie but with liberties taken, and the feel of dispensed flame-thrower justice was about the only way to deal with such monstrosities (although splatter painting walls with their innards by shotgun dispensed glory was a fun idea as well). Added to this is the fact that the much expected gore is really plentiful, plus the mouths of the characters are of the unwashed variety.If you want a game that delivers something that will grant you a sweet plague to go with your otherwise monotonous dreams, then this is the game for you. Just make sure to have a testing kit handy in case your friends suddenly seem a bit more fiendish afterwards.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2002"}

So if you're still on the fence about this game I have to ask, do you like FPS games, do you like RPG games, sandbox games or co-op games?  If you answered yes to any of those questions, you will enjoy this game.Story-lineThe first Borderlands barely made an excuse for a story-line whereas in Borderlands 2, there is a more immersible story-line with a villain that taunts you and baits you throughout the story-line of the whole game.GraphicsThe graphics and colors in Borderlands 2 are both artistic and detailed.  Importantly is that 90% of the time even when the screen is filled with enemies the frame-rate remains relatively smooth.  The environments are quite varied and the color pallet is much improved since the first game, this game is pretty and the colors really pop.SoundThe sounds of the guns are varied, impactful, and the dialogue is well acted and the overall sound design is well done and really adds to the feeling of the Borderlands.GameplayThe enemies are new and much more impressive than in the first Borderlands.  There are fierce creatures and enemies to shoot and more importantly, the guns are much better and more varied than in Borderlands one.  If you want a \"realistic\" or \"military\" shooter, then go elsewhere, but if you enjoy sci-fi worlds, aliens and crazy-out-of-this-world guns, then you will love this game.  Naturally, this loot-filled, mission-heavy game is three times more fun if played with a friend.  Played by itself, the Borderlands can feel empty, boring and desolate.  The sense of power you have with your class's abilities are amazing and Axon's gun turret is far better than Roland's gun turret. The menu system to organize your loot and spend your skill points is much better than the first Borderlands.Conclusion:If you enjoy FPS, RPG/Sandbox games have a friend to play this game online with then what are you waiting for, you need to get this game! :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2012"}

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"A couch multiplayer essential","reviewText":"Well, thanks to the oh-so-awesomeMario Kart 8free game deal, a friend of my little brother's gave us a Club Nintendo code, allowing for not only our own code to be used onThe Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD, but also for this new code to be used on a certain multiplayer bonanza that seems to be directly inspired byMario Party. And I'm not talking aboutthe one with Sonic the Hedgehog in it.Wii Party U strives to be much more than just copycat game, though, and it succeeds at that.There is a surprising amount of game modes and ways to have fun. There are multiple modes based on the traditional board-game-video-game rules, but with a twist depending on the mode.For a notable example: Highway Rollers has you move a ginormous amount of spaces to reach the other side of the board. The numerous minigames that you'll be thrown into determine how many dice you will get to use per turn. There are spaces on the board that can also send you 20 spaces forward, backward, or give you more dice!There's also a mode based around \"fashion styles\" - You collect pieces of the outfit, show up on the stage when it's nearby, and gather points for the outfit you come onstage with! Lurking around the board causes you to find shops with clothing you could either nab for the outfit, or there are spaces where you can play a minigame to gain a freebie or steal a player's piece!TV Party (the set of modes the above two are grouped with) contains all sorts of kooky competitive shenanigans and very diverse and equally entertaining minigames that Mario Party has been struggling to execute properly this day and age. And that's just a fraction of what the overall package has to offer!House Party is a second set of modes that have their own arguably more unique experiences, especially since they don't use the minigames that TV Party partly thrives on. These modes are composed of their own less-than-20-minute exercises that make interesting uses of the Gamepad. You could make a silly face with the camera and make your opponents guess what charade you're doing, draw with the stylus and see whose drawing is the odd one out, or cooperatively press buttons on the Wii Remotes and Gamepad in what's like a new way to playTwister. If you won't be playing Wii Party U for a long burst of time, the House Party set is where your short-lived party is at!And then there's the Gamepad Tabletop games.These games may only allow two people to play, but the games that are in here nevertheless manage to pack in lots of intense and competitive moments. Heck, I'm just going to say it right now - Tabletop Baseball alone is more intense and addicting thanMario Super Sluggers. It may seem like a very bold claim, but that's just how I feel about it. Another favorite is Tabletop Foosball, which has never ceased to excite me, whether or not it's simulated on the Gamepad or on a physical table. There are also activities such as the Tabletop Gauntlet and minigames, but Baseball and Foosball are the real deals in this set.As for the entire Wii Party U game, I wholeheartedly recommend getting it, regardless of whether or not you'll be buying it for a Wii Remote or because you bought Mario Kart. If you are a lone person who doesn't really have people to play with, then subtract one star from the overall rating. Otherwise, this is a great game to play with family and/or friends!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2014"}

My least favorite weapon is probably the dark matter shotgun.

Bill's performance just seems a little stale to me.Everyone else is dead on.It was an incredibly long wait for a good Ghostbusters game, (We never actually had one) so I find it very appealing to put it mildly.Two things I hope for in the sequel. One make it more open world. PLEASE! I don't think the Developers quite grasped, just how much the fans of Ghostbusters would just -looooove- spending countless hours roaming around and busting ghosts. If there was an option to do so in this game, I guarantee you I could have played this game another 40 hours or more.The second thing? Is alot more minor. I'd like the protagonist to speak. While it is awesome that we get to watch the other Icons of Ghostbusting speak and do their thing, I wish that the protagonist would get in there with em as far as speaking goes.Ghostbusters, is an excellent but fairly short romp into something we Gamers really don't get that often these days.

Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends.

If you have a Nintendo 64 you'll also note that the DS presents games looking a bit more lavish (look at Super Mario 64 DS for instance).The touch screen is a new addition to gaming, and the DS makes good use of it.  Enjoying the DS's touch screen is just one of the biggest joys of it.  Each DS comes with a stylus.  Use the stylus to touch the screen.  It makes some things more convienent than sifting through a menu.The DS is also more than just a gaming system.  You can set the date, time and even an alarm clock.  The DS is also wireless up to 100 feet.  Using the wireless connection you can go into chatrooms with up to fifteen other people.  It also makes playing multiplayer a lot easier.  No more link cable!The sound is presented in stereo.  There are now two speakers as opposed to one.  Plug in some headphones and the games just sound incredible!As for GBA games.  There's a seperate slot to put them in.  You can select whether you want the GBA to display on the touch screen or top screen.  Regardless, GBA games look clearer than they did before.  They show up much brighter on the DS than previously.The DS also comes with a charger.  As with the GBA it takes about three hours to fully charge.  You can play the DS while it charges as well.In addition to the games.  If you have something you must attend to but don't want to leave the DS on, just flip it closed and the system automatically goes to sleep.  It's much easier than having to press certain buttons or select \"sleep\" from the menu.But with all the good comes some bad.  Every system has some sort of flaw.  And the DS unfortunately has a few flaws of its own.Firat of all, the games are brutally small.  They're about an ince tall and an inch wide.  If you don't keep your games in some sort of game case, you'll undoubtably lose them.While the DS plays GBA games, it doesn't play normal gameboy games or gameboy color games.  So just because you get a DS doesn't mean you throw your previous GB systems to the side.The buttons are small!  My fingers are pretty big and it sucks to press the \"B\" button and suddenly hit the \"Y\" button along with it.  I was also disappointed to find you can't configure the \"Y\" and \"X\" buttons to act when playing a GBA game.The touch screen is nifty, but the DS almost requires the Stylus.  If you touch the touch screen with your bare hands you could damage it with the oils on your fingers.  The stylus is also small and easy to lose.  Luckily, the DS has a place that stores it for you.  It may also prove troublesome at first to keep your eye on the touch screen and the top screen.Lastly, wireless multiplayer doesn't work with GBA games.  So if you want to play a GBA game up against a friend then you'll still need the GBA link cable to do it.The DS is a wonder, true enough.  But there are a few glaring things about it.  It's worth the money, but a few small things about it may grow into big problems in the long run.  It's an incredible system but the small problems keep it from being perfect.The good+It can handle more power than the GBA+You can still play GBA games+Surround Sound and Stereo!+Touch screen brings more intuitive gameplay+Lavish presentation+Not too complex or complicated to understand+More than just a gaming sytem.  It has a clock, calender and alarm clock set.+Wireless connection of up to 100 Feet+Wireless connection is easy to use+Chat with other DS holders+Small and compact.  It fits in your pocket just like a GBABut of course those cons-You shouldn't touch the touch screen with your fingers-The games are SMALL-You can't play GBC or regular Gameboy games-The buttons are a little small-Wireless Multiplayer doesn't work with GBA gamesA great system with forgiveable cons.  If you loved your GBA you'll only be doing yourself another favor by purchasing this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2004"}

Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A fantastic controller once everything is broken in","reviewText":"When I first took this controller out of the box, I legitimately thought it might either be a piece a junk in general, or that I got a dud. I tried playing a game of Mega Man 2 which, as you probably are aware, requires a perfect performance from the controller in order to just get through the experience, let alone excel at it. In fact, playing any amazing game as intense and awesome as a Mega Man title, with anything less than perfection from a controller, would be a horrendous, dreadful trial. When I first started playing, the d-pad and every button was so shockingly unresponsive, it was painful. I had to press every button really hard to get it to even register. I was really saddened at first, but after suffering through Air Man's stage, the buttons started to show signs of working properly. I turned off Mega Man 2 and tried playing Mega Man 6, an easier entry overall in the hardcore series, and by the time I finished Wind Man's stage (the first stage I always play with that game), this controller worked perfectly, and it has worked perfectly ever since. I've played many classic NES titles since then, finishing all Mega Man titles and playing a ton out of classics such asThe Legend of Zelda,Super Mario Bros. 3,Crystalis,Double Dragon,River City Ransom,Bubble Bobble,Tecmo Bowl, and several others, and the controller has worked perfectly with every single one. The buttons, as well as the d-pad, are all incredibly responsive and have perfect resistance, the controller itself is made of sturdy plastic and has excellent construction quality, and even the cord is a perfect recreation of the classic NES controller, aside from the USB plug-in at the end. It's super easy to plug-in and play with as well, with automatic, near-nonexistent installation upon its first time plugging in. It is definitely lighter than the original, but overall, I cannot recommend this controller enough.  If you fancy yourself an old-school gamer and want to perfectly recreate classic NES experiences from yesteryear, this is the controller for YOU. Buy it, enjoy this near-perfect recreation of a classic controller, and be lost in gaming nostalgia bliss.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003C1I06U","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"The Batman Simulator","reviewText":"On the few occasions Batman has had his own videogame, it's been a hard run for our hero.  He doesn't have super-powers.  It's hard to translate his detective skills into something that doesn't a) require the player to have the genius of Sherlock Holmes; or b) boil down to grabbing colored tokens and calling that \"investigating\".  And of course the other obstacle Batman has to surmount is that balance between \"Batman punches bad guy\" and \"Batman uses gadget on bad guy\":  you need good fight mechanics and useful gadgets that serve a purpose.\"Arkham Asylum\" is the perfect marriage of the best things about Batman.  It is also the perfect videogame for almost any audience.  The fight mechanics make sense:  they seldom leave you worrying more about being able to see than whether or not you're hitting the bad guy.  There is a gameplay balance between the \"quiet stealth\" mechanic of a Splinter Cell or a Hitman game, versus the \"weapons free\" tactical assualt of a Rainbow Six.  And best of all, every scenario can be handled more than one way:  you can choose to sneak by a clump of henchmen, you can leap into the fray, or you can swing around Spider-Man style and torment them as you slowly take them down one by one.  The only choke points in Arkham Asylum appear to be the boss battles, where you typically need to do one or more very specifc things in order to win.  If you like RPGs, you'll be pleased to know that you can collect \"experience\" as you go and then spend it to get new upgrades to your armor, abilities, and gadgets.Arkham Asylum is about as perfect as a game can get:  it makes a complicated hero like Batman very easy to handle.  It doesn't require fast-twitch skills, and yet there is plenty of action to be had.  The controls are very fluid and despite lacking a platform-style \"jump\" mechanic, you are extremly agile and can easily chain combinations of moves together.  For example, let's say you're on a ledge.  You'd like to glide down, kick a bad guy, then grapple up to a gargoyle and swing across the room before he knows what hit him.  You could do this by tapping square, then R1, then R1 again.  If you knock somebody down and you'd like to finish them off, just hold R2 and press the triangle button:  Batman will pounce on them, grapple, and subdue them with a knock-out punch and he'll even do it from some distance away so you don't have to sprint across the room before the bad guy gets to his feet.Arkham Asylum also boasts a storyline written by Paul Dini, who is well known for the lion's share of the Batman Animated Series.  Characters are voiced by the same people from the series, such as Mark Hamill as the Joker.  There are all sorts of hidden goodies to find in every level, and each can unlock either the ongoing saga of Dr. Arkham or detailed information on the many DC characters that make up Batman's universe.  Half of the fun is in listening to \"patient interview tapes\", reading origin stories and \"first appearance\" details, and exploring the \"Behind the scenes\" video content on the disc.  You don't have to find everything that is hidden in this game, but the payoff makes you want to.  Best of all, rather than worrying that you might miss out on a hidden secret, you are very clearly shown that some things won't be accessible until you come back later.  Batman's gadgets come to him over the course of the game, and sometimes you'll need one that you'll be getting later in order to get into a secret area...you can always come back another time.If games like this are typically hard for you, Easy difficulty does make it a cakewalk.  Normal difficulty still gives you a lot of helping hands, though:  if you get into a fatal situation such as falling off a ledge, the game will tell you 'tap R1 to escape' and give you a chance to avoid death.  If you do die, you'll get a tip on the loading screen specific to what you were trying to get through.  And if you're having trouble finding all the goodies, each section has a map that you can find that will light them up for you.Still not impressed?  Well, the Game of the Year Edition offers you the ability to play in \"3D\".  This isn't the polarized \"Avatar movie\" style 3D, unfortunately:  it is the traditional \"red-blue glasses\" 3D and comes with two pairs of folding paper 3D glasses.  It works, it just doesn't bring much to the table.  In levels with specific color balances such as the Arboretum (which has a lot of blues and greens), the colors tend to bleed out because you're looking through tinted lenses, so most of the time I leave this off.  The Game of the Year Edition also adds 4 more maps, and the ability to \"Play as the Joker\".  These extras really boost up the replayable appeal of Arkham Asylum.  No matter what you're looking for in this game, you're going to find yourself coming back for more.  You don't need to be a comic-book cognoscenti, but if you are you won't be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Tanya McHenry","summary":"Full MMO Experience without the MMO Subscription","reviewText":"Guild Wars 2Let me start with some credentials. I've been playing MMOs since Neverwinter Nights days on AOL. The highlight of my MMO experience was Everquest though, the original EQ. I've enjoyed many games since like Lord of the Rings Online, Star Wars the Old Republic and Vanguard, but none of them long-term.My review may be repetitive to those who play MMOs and followed the game's release. I have opinions and information beyond the marketing material as well so some points might be geared more to non-MMO players but gives some insight into how it works in practice.Pros1. No Subscription. This game does not require a monthly fee, but there are options to buy thing in the cash store. This, however, is not a grab for money kind of Free to Play cash shop. I have hit 80; I play in dungeons, fractals, WvW and have yet to buy anything. I am most likely going to buy more bank space because I am a pack rat. Other players laugh at the idea of buying more space which is fine. Other things you can buy are things like cosmetic items, essentially trying to get your character to look more unique in some way, or play boosts consumables, things that boost your XP, grant you access to the bank on the move, or repair your gear without having to go back to town.2. Character Creation - It's fun, offers a variety of nice looking toons you can cater to your liking. I know there are some options coming to the cash shop soon that should offer more variety, but let me assure you that there are a good amount of options to tinker with. I have not run into my exact twin ever, and the dye options in this game, which expands as you play when you buy dye or find it, makes the clothing intriguing even if it is similar to others. I had fun creating my characters, and the variety of classes, races makes it fun. Unlike other games, there is no supreme wrong combo. Just have fun. Leave the calculators stay in the office.3. This game is certainly doable solo. You do not have to be in an organized guild or have a bunch of friends online all the time to enjoy this game.  In the open world, events that require additional players almost naturally get them. People running by will help you kill that giant troll... eventually. Events are like moths to a flame, players just want to do them. I know I love them. Also, pick-up groups, groups of people who do not typically work together, can certainly work well.4. The game's content does not scale, but you do. What this means is as a level 80 player, if I have a friend who is just starting the game I have two choices. I can take my level 80 over to their starting area, and have my level downgraded to 3 or 6 or whatever that area's content is and still be challenged, still have fun. I'll have some bonuses like better gear, which also scales, and skills and traits that I have as an 80 but everything is down so I really can't just clear an area all by my lonesome. The other option, of course, is to create another character and enjoy it all again.5. The world is huge, feels absolutely huge. If you roll another character, or three, it's very likely you'll run into things you missed with your other character the first time around. This might keep things fresh for some. I am not that easily bored with repeat content, so doing more quests again is fine with me.6. Completionists - There are tons of things for you to do to get access to some completionist geared titles, badges and actually get real game rewards for it too. Each time you complete a map, visit all those points of interests, do quests/tasks in a certain area to fill in hearts, find out how to get to vistas way up on the side of the cliff and see some nice aerial views of the game... finish all of those in an area and you get some rewards and a change to move your percentage complete of the word map up and up until you finish it. I assume there is a reward for finishing the entire map, but I am not there yet so I cannot confirm.7. Jumping Puzzles - This is almost a con for me because it is not my strength at all, but some people just adore those jumping puzzles. You know the kind where if you are off a bit you have to start over or maybe you just die. These jumping puzzles are in Story Quests, Fractals/Dungeons, Events and wind up in places you don't expect it... like some of the Vistas can be a little tricky. If this is your thing, seek them out, they are there.8. Crafting - Crafting is fun, expensive, especially for some trades, and 100% optional. If you don't like it, don't do it. Just harvest and sell on the trading post, you'll make some money. If you do like this sort of thing, well it's not as fun as Vanguard was or EQ2 (the mini game crafting), but entry into crafting is easy and leveling up, discovering recipes, just enjoying making things is there.9. PvP - I almost never play PvP. I actually hate it in most games, but the way GW2 does it is my cup of tea. People who like to gank and get their jollies on weaker players are not going to like this game. You don't get to strip players of their gear or anything of that nature. World vs. World, WvW, is kind of like a big siege map where your team (server) is trying to capture or defend different points on it. It's a group effort, easy to do hard to master and definitely a team sport. There are some issues with cheating and overpowered classes in this part of the game, but it is still fun and ArenaNet is supposedly working on it. I played the PvP team mini-game during the Halloween event and enjoyed that. These mini games could use a little more instruction and maybe a PvE demo round so you understand what was going on, but it was a fun, more intimate PvP part of the game I enjoyed. Again, if you love killing players that have no chance against you, this is not your game. If you avoid PvP because of that former issue, you might have some fun in this game. PvP also has its own reward system, everyone is leveled up enough to do it, and so you can't kill some low level character for funnies aspect. You could feasibly do PvP and nothing else if you really wanted to.10. Community - The game is designed to the point where you are not competing with other players for hardly anything which creates a pretty friendly community. No one is running up to mine that gold before you get a chance to because it's there just for you too. Events are group efforts, so working together well works. There really isn't any kill stealing that I can think of.11. Travel - Way points make travel easy and expensive if you want to, otherwise running around on foot is the way to go. There are areas that are more dangerous to travel, especially areas without a lot of people in them, but there is no artificial cap on traveling. You can head to that dangerous area and know that some stray animal might instakill you if you want.12. Death - Die often enough and you'll probably be poor. It's not prohibitively expensive but repair bills can be weigh you down. On the other hand, exploring is worth the risk.13. Events - Events happen all the time in the game, on timers like the dragons, or occurs when another event ends, successfully or fails. It's not nearly as cool as they previewed because some of them happen too fast. Before you even get a chance in the fun of overtaking a centaur camp that it resets and you are in hostile territory again. It's partially successful though because they are fun. I think the timing and the results still need work. I don't know they are working on that or not. Onetime events are a lot of fun, offer interesting rewards and the unexpected.Con1. Low Population in low level areas - Because of the way events are, starting now gives you a different experience than when the servers were bursting at the seams. Some events are just not taken care of because the population isn't there. This is not an uncommon issue for MMOs, but it seems a little more of an issue because of events in this game. As a level 80, I travel in some areas getting to others, and occasionally stop to do an event because they are still fun, and I am downgraded that they remain a challenge2. Short One Time Events- I think ArenaNet is looking at this, but these one-time events that happen over a weekend that trigger at times when some people are sleeping or working, never to repeat again seem unfortunate to me. I hope they stretch them out longer eventually and maybe rerun them a couple of times a year... keeping them rare but still playable for those who missed it.3. Gear - This is under Con, but it's really only an issue for some. At some point towards the end game content, what you are working for is no longer levels but gear. Gear is not extreme in this game, however, not like say raid gear. The stat differences are minor, so a lot of it has to do with how it looks. Getting a complete set of some sets is extremely hard. Some people love that challenge, others hate it. I am working towards gear, and don't mind it at all, still having fun.4. Lack of Raid - There are big events, for certain, like the Dragons and the recent one time Karka event. The game lacks the big risk and big rewards that other games have, and this could be a deal breaker for some. I've never seen a dragon event fail, and the reward is a random chest. It's nice to roll on these chests, and I do them all the time for a chance at the chest and because I still like the events. The Ancient Karka event almost felt like a raid. Almost in that nearly half our server group fighting it wiped during some unexpected attacks. The rewards were awesome as well. IF the game is missing anything for traditional MMO players, it's this. Big events, huge risks, and likelihood of dying but possibility of winning... that's a sweet spot for some, and it is not here yet, not on the huge scale of raids in other games.5. Story - The voice acting in the game ranges from okay to did they really just grab the mailroom kid and ask him to read a few lines. Some people will certainly play this down. I've muted the story many times, and have yet to finish my story quest. I barely care; can't stand the voice acting, the content scales but the reward does not so I am often destroying or just selling what it gives me. Overall I find the Story Quest line a generally unpleasant experience. Every few weeks, I might do one or two and then forget about it.This is a great game. It's a lot of fun for those who love MMOs, but dislike some of the time consuming, hardcore unpleasant parts of other games. The community is generally pleasant. You can play dungeons and usually not get yelled out, kicked or otherwise rudely treated for doing something wrong often because there is room for mistake and recovery. It's not a sandbox, so you are generally working on quests or towards some obvious goal. You are not as forced down one path as say Star Wars leads you, and new characters can very well encounter content you skipped or missed the first time around. Exploring can be interesting and rewarding, even dangerous but I am hesitant to suggest this is even close to a sandbox experience some desire.Downgrading higher characters to the area's content works marvelously, especially if you want to go back and pick up some map completions or specific crafting materials. If you didn't like the time consuming, punishing nature of other MMOs, give this one a try. If you like MMOs, but are open to some of the content ideas in this game, don't expect 7 years of content perfection like some other games might give you, and give this a go.Without the subscription, there is little to lose, even if you play it, stop for a while, and come back only for events or with updates. There is no real \"end game\" content, but it's not needed. There is plenty to work for, dungeons to explore, gear to work for, and maps to complete, crafting to master. The only people I would truly advise to stay away from these games are players who want a solo RPG experience. Yes, you can play this game almost entirely solo, only needing others for events, dungeons and other kinds of group content, but why? There are better RPGs out there, actual single-player RPGs on PC for you to play instead. The sad experience that is the Story Quest lines in this game are unlikely to satisfy anyone looking for an epic story like those found in Baldur's Gate or Dragon Age or something truly one player driven. This is, of course, is different from wanting to just play most the game solo and join in group content without the group, which you can do as mentioned above, and only run dungeons when you want to, not because you have to which again, is possible in Guild Wars 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2012"}

You'll spend a great deal of time just wandering about, completing side quests, leveling up and buying weapons and armour.It has it's good points too: challenging combat, great scenery, the pawn system is incredible!, you'll spend a great deal of time just wandering about, completing side quests, leveling up and buying weapons and armour. Yeah, I know, that aspect is both a pro and a con because you're going to need this time to perfect the crafting mechanics and your fighting style, learn the nuances of the game and gather up some worthwhile weapons and armour.If you've played The Witcher (original Witcher), Two Worlds (a diamond that stayed in the rough) and Dragon Age you'll find elements of all three games here, especially The Witcher and Two Worlds.So anyway, it's a great game and one that has to be played strategically. If you go too far into the map without having gathered enough goodies and skills you're going to get killed... easily and often. There's some absolutely stellar boss fights here. They're brutal but oh so worth the effort.How good is it compared to Skyrim? I've no idea. Never played Skyrim but I can tell you that I played Oblivion for a total of one hour before returning it. It wasn't a bad game but it was like playing a medieval Fallout 3. I love Fallout 3 but I've already played it and wasn't looking for a repeat so if Skyrim plays like that then I'd imagine that Dragon's Dogma is the better game.How good is it compared to The Witcher 1&2, Two Worlds, both Dragon Ages, Oblivion and a few others? With the exception of the original Witcher, it slays them all. The combat in Dragon's Dogma is infinitely better than combat in The Witcher but The Witcher has, IMO, the best, most coherent and relevant to the game story ever in any RPG. Plus The Witcher's panoramic scenery was so much better but that's to be expected with the PC platform.So, in the end its a draw between these two but nevertheless, Dragon's Dogma is a superb game and a much needed breath of fresh air in what has lately become a mostly stale genre of shallow, childish cookie-cutter hack and slash games that are fast becoming an insult to the phrase \"role-playing game\".","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2012"}

I am only a couple of hours into this game, and already it blew my mind, the first AR movie looks good both in standard and in 3d, the backgrounds are gorgeous, and the story thus far is amazing.  It takes a lot of the elements from the old style RPGs but adds a twist - a risk/reward combat system which allows you to choose early combat, or save up brave points by defending and then going whole hog on an enemy (its fun to take out an enemy of you store up enough points in one shot) or using a special ability to Speed up your turn, but to do this you either need to use money to buy potions, or let your system sleep for 8 hours, the job system reminds me of the Final fantasy tactics games where you can level up the current jobs, or switch out and gain levels learning new things, and making each character unique.  Also the streetpass and friend list comes into effect, you can use powers and abilities others have by passing them while your system is in sleep mode and also use them to rebuild your town, a good benefit for those like me who enjoy extra things to do.  The soundtrack is reminecent of old FF games, haunting and beautiful.  Overall I say this game deserves a place in any players library and while the story may be linear, the ways to get there are immense.  Enjoy.UPDATE(WITH LITTLE SPOILER) - for those who have not beaten it, or beat it without trying, I only am in chapter 5 - but I discovered there is an alternate ending.  When you do the Rite after Airy says stop keep pressing the x button and keep going until the crystal shatters - you will unlock another story when beaten will get you an outfit for Anges, but then you will go back to before you shatter the crystal (usually suggested to do the final Crystal), there will be changes to the story and to the opening screen shot.

Speaking of graphics this game has them. The game runs at a smooth frame rate even during large fights. Contrary to what the box says, this game does in fact have multiplayer. It can be acessed by unsing a cheat code in the hacking mode. The fighting sequences are awsome and the action is very fast and furious. You can play through the game using two different characters, Ghost and Niobe, both of whom make appearances in the newley relseased film. To top it off the game packs in a little over an hour of never before seen fotage from the film and also a short trailer for the third and final Matrix movie. I my opinion the unreleased footage from the movie is worth the money. Another cool feature of the game is the ability to enter and exit slow motion at your onw pleasing. In slow motion, you can see the famous bullet time effect and you can dodge them. Overall an excellent game, with only one drawback which would be some graphical glitches.Graphics: 8/10Sound: 7/10Replayibility: 5/10Multiplayer: 1-2 Players (With cheat)Online: No","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2003"}

Taking heroes and enemies from all-star cast of characters such as Fantastic Four, Avengers, Spiderman, and X-Men, this game is full of powerful characters to play with and experiment with. Each character has multiple moves/attacks which is a very nice touch. Animation is done quite well also.The mission levels are beautifully rendered with impressive amount of detail, including the Hellicarrier and local scenary in New York. I had a ton of fun playing this with my 7-year old daughter who learned the controls very quickly and laughed outloud many times at the humorous dialog.There is loads of content even after you finish the 8-hour or so campaign. You open Free Play once you beat a mission, and can also free roam NY City looking for side missions.Overall, a very well-done game.

{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"Mr. H","summary":"A review from a long time Zelda fan","reviewText":"I'd like to make this review as short as I can, while still giving out as much information as I can (NO SPOILERS).This is the first Zelda game built from the ground up for the Wii. TP on the Wii was a port from gamecube with horrible controls and annoying sounds every time you swing your remote. In Skyward Sword, there is an initial sound when you pull the sword out of the sheath and swing, then it goes to the tv, which helps save batteries and not be so annoying.The motion controls are nice, but very unnecessary. I would have loved to just play this game like all the other Zelda games, on a controller. Some of the boss battles were just ridiculous, in what you had to do with the motion. There is one boss in the game that I had the hardest time fighting, because you have to counteract him with motions, and it is very confusing..Gameplay is like any other Zelda game. You go through temples, get a certain objective done, and move closer to the ultimate goal in the game. Skyward Sword however has been dumbed down compared to other zelda games. The temples are easy, I didn't get stuck at all on any temple or any part of this game, which is nice in a way, but also annoying in another. I want to be challenged, and this game failed to deliver on that.Music.. Zelda has always had the best music in its series than any other video game or movie unique song. However,  Skyward Sword doesn't bring any new great original songs to the franchise. It also didn't bring back many of the great classics. There were only 3 classics that I noticed. The house theme, a very dumbed down version of the shop theme, and the zelda theme. The main zelda theme is also in it, but only in the credits.This game heavily lacks story. I feel like it could have been a great game, but it fell short. It's still better than windwaker, but OoT, MM, and TP are WAY better than this game. If you are new to the series, this may be a good start (it is chronologically the first game in the series anyway). Any true Zelda fan will not have this game anywhere near their top list of Zelda games.It's still a Zelda game to its core, but Nintendo just dropped the ball on this one, it could have been way better. I'm not saying this is a bad game, because it's not. But this is a Zelda game, it's not a mario or some other game.. Zelda is Nintendo's best franchise, it's the one that is always better than average, it sets the bar for all other games of the genre. This one didn't live up to Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time. I give it a 9.5/10 as a game, but as a ZELDA game, I give it a 7/10 (assume OoT is 10/10 and WindWaker is 5.5/10)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2012"}

Nintendo 2DS is only capable of 2D display.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Better Than I Expected","reviewText":"For those who have followed Nintendo Handhelds, the very idea that they'd release so many different versions of one handheld is nothing new. The original Gameboy eventually had the Gameboy Pocket and then Gameboy Color. The Gameboy Advance had the SP and the Micro. The DS had the original release, the lite, the DSi and the DSi XL. The 3DS already has the original and the XL. It seemed strange that so soon after the launch of the 3DS XL we'd find ourselves with another DS release. This is the 2DS. On the outside it doesn't seem like much, but once you get it in your hand it's actually pretty solid.As a note before beginning: The following review assumes you are quite familiar with the 3DS already. In reading this I am assuming you are familiar with the 3DS interface and features. They will not be detailed here. Just know that they all work exactly the same.There are only two major differences between a 2DS and 3DS. The first is that there is no stereoscopic 3D. This means those hoping to play their games in stereoscopic 3D won't be able to do it. For someone like me who insists on playing his original 3DS with the 3D slider turned off anyway, this is no problem. It doesn't bother me in the slightest. The second major difference is that the screen doesn't close like other DS models. Other DS models had a clamshell design that allowed you to fold the screen down. Both screens are visible at all times. If you plan on getting this for a child I would strongly suggest buying screen protectors.Aside from those two things, the 2DS pretty much does everything your 3DS does. All the channels are still there. You can still access the Nintendo eShop. There's nothing really &#34;stripped&#34; away. There is still a place for your SD card on the side. All games are inserted into a slot that is located on the top of the 2DS. The camera still works just fine. The interface is still fine. The stylus is located in a slot on the back about halfway down the right hand side. Anything you could do on your other 3DS systems you can do here. It also retains being able to play your original DS games, although it doesn't look like there's a chance of it playing GBA games for those who are wondering.For those curious about the size of the 2DS, it's relatively small. The screen sizes are that of the original 3DS and not of the XL. So you won't have to worry that it's &#34;too big&#34; for the little ones. Although the DS itself might be a tad small if you've got big hands. Other differences include the fact that the L and R buttons are a lot bigger and easier to press. The button placement itself actually works. The face buttons (A, B, X, and Y) and circle pad are located next to the top screen while the directional pad is located closer to the bottom screen. The start and select button are also located near the bottom screen off to the side just below the face buttons. They're all very easy to get to and because it's not too big it's perfect placement. Also, and I must say this is especially nice, there is a switch that allows you to put the 2DS into sleep mode. Since you can't fold the top screen down they built in this little switch to compensate for that. Just a flick and your 2DS goes to sleep. A flick back and it wakes up. Perfect if you need to put it away for any reason.There are only a couple of gripes with the 2DS. None of them large. The first is that I think I'd have preferred a clam shell design. The 2DS is quite a remarkable device. Yet a fold down top screen would've still been nice to have. That way you could easily stick it in your pocket and not have to worry too much about scratches on the screen. Both screens could've been protected this way. This is pretty minor, but something that would've been nice, nonetheless. The other thing is that if you are getting this to replace a 3DS or 3DSXL some accessories don't work. Those who got a Circle Pad Pro, for instance, won't be able to use it. I'm sure there will be brand new accessories to go with it, but at this point it feels odd that Nintendo isn't simply making a model with a second circle pad always there. Likewise, if you're actually getting this to replace your 3DS, Nintendo has made it very tedious to transfer your data. As you must perform a system transfer. So if, for any reason you plan on trading in your old 3DS for a 2DS for any reason, keep in mind that you need to do a system transfer before handing it off. You can't simply pull out your SD Card and put it in another system.This, of course, brings about the question always asked when a new model of a system comes out. Is it worth it? The answer varies from console to console. But here I'll say simply that the 2DS is definitely a cheap alternative to the 3DS if you don't have one. The price isn't bad. This is especially nice if you have a young child. If you've already got a 3DS there's no particular reason to get a 2DS. It does all the same things. The only reason to really replace a 3DS with this one is if you really like the design (or if you're looking for a cheap alternative should you need to replace it). Nevertheless it's not bad by any means. As a cheap alternative it's perfect.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2014"}

Not only did they fail but they failed miserably.  Here are the reasons.I own an HD-DVD player and after comparing the movies and the players HD-DVD \"blu\" the Sony out of the water.  I compared Superman Returns in both format and the HD-DVD version at 1080p is much clearier, less graining, and more crisp then the Blu Ray version.  The ps3 takes forever to load the movies and the system is terribly loud while playing games and watching movies.  I had to turn the volume up in order to not hear the system running.Next, is the internet service available.  Yes, many would say this sounds cool but I actually couldn't stand it!!!  The interface is absolutely terrible and searching was difficult.  I actually got so frustrated that after the first day of owning this machine I never attempted to get on the internet via the PS3 again.Online gaming isn't terrible but it isn't great either.  I have Verizon FIOS so speed is not an issue with me, but connections with the server were constantly happening.  PS3 online seemed disorganized and jus tnot as funa nd user friendly as Xbox Live.The controller is notrious!!! I can't believe Sony is still using this 11 year old piece of junk.  It feels light and flemsy and I was just begging for an Xbox 360 controller.The system over heated on me twice.  I don't have to add anything else to that.  I was pissed.I played 3 different games and was not impressed with the graphics of any of them.  Resistance is pretty nice but Fight Night 3 and Ultimate Alliance are actually not as well made as the 360 counterparts.  Especially FN3.Several other factors such as Blu Ray being 5-10 dollars more a disc than HD-DVD, the system costing so much money, and other things made me take this DUD back to Wal-Mart to sit with the other dozen units still sitting on the shelves.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2006"}

I found the the first uncharted used dirt cheap and I bought it thinking I was going to play a crappy tomb raider knock off but I was blown away. Since then I've pre-ordered every  uncharted game since(except golden abyss ). My wife's mother got me the Vita for Christmas and my wife got me this uncharted game. I popped it in and was hooked for 12 hrs.You play as Nathan Drake, a treasure hunter with an extremely likable persona and uncanny agility.  this game in the franchise takes place way before the ones on ps3 so you won't spoil any storylines. I won't get into specifics about the story but you start out in South America with a shady business partner and things go south from there. The game throws in some new likable characters(including villains ) and an old friend from the previous titles shows up as well. I was incredibly impressed with the voice acting in this title.  I figured since its on a handheld they would skimp out on it but no, same voice actors as before with top notch voice acting, Naughty dog spared no expense here. The storyline itself was a bit weaker than the last two titles however but still kept me wanting to know what happens next. Naughty Dog did its best job at getting a new plot line going for the vita. So depending on if you've played the other 3 titles the story might not grab you as much.The gameplay surprised me the most. You can either just uses the normal buttons or implement the touch screen and tilt axis on the vita for instance you can draw your weapon and aim with the analog stick or simply move the vita in the direction you want aim. I found that if I combined both techniques it made it much easier to fine tune your aim, especially for headshots and sniper rifles.Uncharted also uses the third person cover system much like gears of war and red dead redemption etc...and it works AWESOME. Moving in and out of cover is so smooth and easy and will will have to go cover to cover because the enemies are smart and will try their best to overrun your position.  Enemies are painfully smart.  They will try to sneak around you, trick you, or sometimes just rush you. Many times one enemy will pop out of cover to grab your attention while another pops out and unloads an AK from your flank. However the the firefights start to get repetitive after a little while there are moments where you just want to move to storyline along and the fire fights just get in the way. Be prepared for a lot of quick time events that involve swiping the screen in certain directions. At any moment a rock can come loose or a pillar could crack and you need to be ready when it does. I like it when a games uses these tactics, it makes me feel more involved in the game than shooting up bad guys or jumping puzzles.Speaking of jumping, this is where I think the game shines. I never liked jumping puzzles until I played the first uncharted and this game is no different. The vertigo I get from scaling a cliff and the knots I get in my guts from barely making a jump makes the game even more of a joy to play.I'm looking foreword to more uncharted titles just for the vita. This is a must have if your an uncharted fan. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars but I hate that rating system. 7.5 out of 10 sounds much better. It was a very good game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2013"}

Well to be honest, I haven't actually played that one. The only real Castlevania I started playing was Lament of Innocence which even series fans didn't really care for. As a Christmas gift, I received this and finally started my first blown try at a Castlevania game and I actually did like it. While it does have a noticeable Metroid root (so dubbed by people Metroidvania), it's also quite enjoyable despite some minor but noticeable flaws.Story: With this series it's just like Mario only instead of saving the Princess we have to contend with another castle and baddie in a different time period. Taking him on during World War II era is Jonathan and his companion Charlotte. It doesn't really have huge twists but it's at least a good story to experience.Graphics: They almost feel GBA-quality and it isn't a knock against the game. The other game I asked for was Final Fantasy III which has some great 3D graphics. Portrait's graphics aren't really that stellar but they've been like this for awhile so it's hard to knock them. I like having the varied locations for the levels though. Levels are essentially portraits you enter with places like an old town or a desert.Sound/Music: The in-game sound effects are nice and fit the world but don't think they're going to impress since they're just meant to add realism to a fantastic world. The voice acting is minimal at times, relegated to sound bytes with the story told through text but the always dependable music doesn't disappoint either.Gameplay: An RPG format with levelling up and weapons and equipment found along the way. The problem is like a lot of RPG's you might find yourself overwhelmed but it's kind of inconsistent since you can dispatch enemies no problem but then there's a boss with a killer hit taking off a HUGE chunk of life, literally making it 2 hits and you die. Purchasing equipment is not really a problem except things can get pretty expensive but since by that time you need more Potions, Anti-Venom or Curse antidotes than you never really get to purchase that next armor since you're spending it on life-saving stuff.The game has a Dual-Character system where you can switch between action heavy Jonathan or book-wielding/spellcasting Charlotte. Again, it's inconsistent since you'll mainly use Jonathan since he hits harder. There's a couple of puzzles where you can call him/her to fight with you or solving a puzzle. An early example is having her stand on a statue and pushing it so you can access a higher path that's too high to jump. There's room for a lot of these but that's evident through the game.Of course it's not going to eclipse Symphony of the Night in fans' eyes or even Dawn of Sorrow but regardless it's a really enjoyable game that shows that even if it's familiar, they don't do wrong either...unless they're in 3D.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2006"}

Yes, I did expect Rockstar to make this game amazing and they did. I miss the old max Payne games and I thought they weren't going to make another Max Payne. When I heard this game was going to come out, I was going crazy because I knew that this game was going to be the best and the technology we have right now can make it the best game of the year.The game is amazing with great graphics, the movement is awesome and the gameplay is unbelieveable. Yea, there were some mistakes in the single campaign. Maybe one or two. In one point when Max had to dig the ground. The graphics was pretty ugly when he was digging. When he was digging, there was like no hole in the ground lol.Good:Graphics are of course better than the old games. It shows great reality in the game like it looks pretty real.The cameras are sooo great. When the max Payne talks, the camera gets close to him it shows the area around him. It is just like watching a movie.Gameplay is wonderful l. The movement in the game is very smooth. Pretty easy for the players to move the character.Weapons- the guns are pretty good.there were some guns that i never heard or use it. Some guns can kill one shot.Bullet time- this is the best part of the game. It is all about that Matrix slow motion trick. I have a lot of time to aim my enemies. The kill cam is freaking crazy. When you shoot the last person in the area and when he gets killed, you can go slow mo watching the bullet going towards the enemy and you can just hold the trigger and left him have it.Bad-Graphics- they probably couldve done better with it but overall it is pretty darn good.Weapons- need more guns and grenadesOverall, this game could be one of the best games of 2012. I didn't try multiplayer. I hope it is good. So I give this game a 5!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2012"}

I'm a 16 year old gamer and actually prefer old-skool myself. I think it's time we start reviewing a product for what it really IS rahter than how old it is.For its time, Metroid was a milestone in video gaming. One of the largest games when it was released that wasn't quite so linear. The game doesn't have a completely set path for you to take. You're supposed to get around by exploring the game and finding abilities. It is possible to find nearly every ability before you even fight your first boss.  This was also one of the first games to use the &quot;Password&quot; system. There were probably a a few before this.Also, what I like most about this game (and what the games these days need) is that its HARD! Should you play this game you'll be stunned at some of its difficult feets. Some things you must do to get abilities are amazingly hard, but well worth it.For 8-bit graphics these are amazing and some of the best on the NES I've seen.  This is by far one of the best NES games you could ever get.  The game is also HUGE that you MUST explore. If (when?) you die you always get a password displayed. Depending on what area you're in will depend on where you start.  For the NES using this system was a bit different at the time.Metroid is a milestone among games. Not to mention it had one of the most shocking moments in videogame history (that when I played, I myself was a bit shocked at the time), that being that Samus is a woman.  Sure nowadays its no big deal but when Metroid came out all the big heroes in games were male characters back in this time.  So while today it isn't shocking to see, back then it was.Overall, you'd have to be crazy not to be able to enjoy this game. Unless of course you're like most of my friends who could care less about the gameplay and more about the graphics.OverallThe good+Old Skool fun for everybody+Extremely fun+Redefined Exploration (for me anyway)+A good challenge+Great Audio and Graphics for the NESThe Bad-If I could think of one right now I'd tell you...umm...Samus can't aim diagnally or duck? No that really isn't anything bad considering most games in that time you couldn't aim diagnolly. So I guess there's nothing bad I could say about this game. Except that some of the glitches the NES cartridge tends to have sometimes.-The other con...its too bad that compared to today it won't get what it deserves anymore. It's so much better than Metroid Prime is (though even I have to admit I like Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion a bit more than this one)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

But the second time around Sony hasn't made the splash with me they did years ago, don't misunderstand, the PlayStation 2 and the XBox have some incredible titles, but these systems are bulky and cost a lot more than I'm willing to pay. Also, I have small children and I want a system that's kid friendly, but also has a game catalog to support my taste. Gamecube was the only one that fit that bill.To me Gamecube has the most compelling exclusive titles, trademark games like: Metroid, Mario, Zelda, etc.. are being done justice on the new platform, the GameCube Metriod game is the most outstanding console game I've ever played. In addition to Nintendo's exclusive's Sega is porting more exlcusive titles to Gamecube than any other system they develop for. True it doesn't have a DVD drive, but the truth is, DVD doesn't do much for games, it just provides more storage space (mostly wasted on prerendered movie scenes). The inclusion of the DVD drives on XBox and PS2 are keeping their prices up and their systems bulky. Consider Gamecube.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000056KDW","description":"After making a name for himself with horror classics such asThe  Damnation Gamenovel,The Books of Bloodshort-story collection, and  the feature filmsHellraiserandCandyman, Clive Barker has slowly  moved away from the horror genre toward more fantasy-centric work. Barker hasn't  completely forgotten about his first love, however, andClive Barker's  Undying, a first-person action game from Electronic Arts and DreamWorks  Interactive, beautifully captures the type of horrors that populated Barker's  earliest works. And not only is this game genuinely frightening, it's also a lot  of fun to play.Cast against the backdrop of Ireland in the year 1923,Undyingfollows  Patrick Galloway, an investigator of the paranormal. Galloway has been summoned  to Ireland by his old war buddy Jeremiah Covenant to put an end to the strange  occurrences at the Covenant family estate. What Galloway finds is a house of  horrors that is populated with Jeremiah's dead siblings (and other ghastly  creatures), all of whom want to snuff out Jeremiah so they can complete a spell  cast when they were children.Graphically,Undyingis first rate. TheUnreal Tournamentgraphics  engine has been used to great effect and the result is amazing character models  and environments. The haunted mansion is suitably dark, with wispy draperies and  macabre paintings. The estate's grounds are a mix of lush Irish countryside and  crumbling ruins, all set against vivid skies.Pretty pictures aside, the most impressive thing aboutUndyingis its  atmosphere--this game is flat-out scary. Every element of the game, be it the  gothic architecture, eerie story, great weather effects including rain and  lightning, or amazing sound effects, perfectly complement each other. The result  is a gameplay experience that rivals theResident Evilseries in terms of  generating sheer terror in the player.The great atmosphere isn'tUndying's only innovation--it also features a  very cool two-handed attack system. Most action games saddle the player with an  attack system where one hand controls all the weapons and the other hand does  nothing. InUndying, the left hand (and left mouse button) controls the  standard weapons, such as the pistol and shotgun, while the right hand (and  right mouse button) casts spells. This is a great gameplay device and ensures  the action stays at a frantic pace.Of all the spells in the game, the coolest is the Scrye spell. When cast, it  lets the player see and hear past events--some of which are quite  horrific--and  occasionally it shows you how to progress beyond a certain level. This help can  come in the form of highlighting certain objects or unveiling a portal, but  whatever the method it is a very well-designed gameplay element.The only real complaints withUndyinginvolve the long loading times  between levels and the system requirements, but even those aren't enough to  derail this excellent--and terrifying--action game.--Kilmic RobbinsPros:Very, very creepyAmazing sound effectsExcellent graphicsSlick controlsCons:Long loading timesStory is a little convoluted","reviewerName":"Vappour","summary":"How did I miss this one!!","reviewText":"Wow!  How did I miss this game when it came out?  I purchased it on a whim recently and found one of the best realized, most entertaining and scariest shooters I've ever played.  The idea of placing it in 1920's Ireland is brilliant.  It oozes with atmosphere, and the time period combines the best of both the 19th and early 20th centuries (i.e. 19th century atmosphere with somewhat modern 20th century weapons -- at least the ones that aren't magical).  The music, graphics, pacing, lighting, level design and &quot;enemies&quot; (both human and other) are right on.  There is even an incredibly well realized magical city to visit and eventually subdue.  This is one of the few games that has really scared me (the old adrenaline was really pumping).  The most disappointing aspect is the ending (bad enough to warrant the loss of a star).

But . . .1) The game stops giving you quests and the storyline stops cold for no reason at various points in the game.  Rockstar's current answer?  START OVER.  You lose all progress, all items, everything.  Hours invested become lost meaningless time.2) Fun things like hidden briefcases of money, weapons, cars, boats, do not spawn where they are supposed to or they disappear.  No reason.  So, you waste time diving to a wreckage for nothing, driving out of your way for miles for nothing.3) GTA Online is boring.  It often spawns you nowhere near vehicles or players or NPC's most of the time.  There is not a lot to do online with others.  The character builder is lame with few options.  I had not tried it when I wrote the first review.4) The soundtrack is very limited.  In fact, I think not one hard rock or heavy metal song is on the list.  Nothing good, anyway.  Only two or three channels are listenable.  But there are so few songs on each channel that it sucks.  You have to play your own music on your ipod to really enjoy driving with music, in my opinion.  Hopefully there will be DLC.Save your money.  When and if you hear these things are fixed, then buy it.*********************If you loved Vice City, this one is going to blow you away.

Several new powerups were added to compliment the mushroom, flower, and star.  These come in the form of 'suits,' and give Mario an array of abilities and forms.  The Raccoon suit, for example, allows Mario to fly, the Tanooki suit lets him turn to stone for a few seconds, and the Hammer Brothers suit allows him to, well, throw hammers.  This is one of the reasons this game remains so popular today--most of the suits are unique to this game, and they're all a lot of fun.This game also features an overworld map with several stages per \"world.\"  Instead of being simply linear like the original Super Mario Bros, players have some choices in the order they play the stages.  There are also bonus squares on the map, which have little mini games that offer powerups (which you can store and use later).  The game allows you to save after passing an airship or a fortress, but this version of it also allows you to save at any point (though you can only continue once from that location) if you have to interrupt play in between save points.The Game Boy Advance version of Super Mario 3 (which they call Super Mario Advance 4) is a pretty faithful port of the original game.  The graphics and gameplay are essentially the same, which causes fans of the original (like me) to breathe a sigh of relief.  The original soundtrack to the game, which was excellent, remains intact, although Mario's voice (the one that started popping up around the time of Mario 64) pops up from time to time.  Apparently this bothers some people, but I don't find it intrusive or something that hinders the experience.  The game also includes a version of classic Mario Brothers which can be played by up to 4 people.While I would have preferred to get this on my Wii's virtual console, the idea that I now have a portable version of Super Mario 3 to take with me on the go is pretty exciting.  The price tag may seem a little steep to some, but I consider it worth every penny (even though I have the original NES version).  I'd definitely recommend this title, regardless of if you're a fan of retro video games or if you're a relative newcomer to the Mario series of games.

A truly complex and challenging game, \"...3\" re-invented the side-scroller genre.  Like so many longtime Nintendo loyalists, I have fond memories playing \"Super Mario 3\" for hours on end as I tried to defeat the bosses in the new and varied worlds like the Ice World, the Desert World, and the Sky World, to name a few.  It took 14 years, but Nintendo has giving this seminal game a spectacular rebirth on the handheld Gameboy Advance System.  While it is actually the fourth in the \"Super Mario Advance\" series for the GBA (preceded by Super Mario 2 [SMA1], Super Mario World [SMA2], Yoshi's Island [SMA3]), it is a complete port of \"Super Mario Brothers 3\".  It is exactly as I remembered the original game, save for the ability to play as Luigi (in addition to Mario) and some spruced up graphics.  The gameplay is a seamless re-creation of the original and it's simply amazing to be playing this marvelous game in a handheld format.  The only port more astounding for GBA was \"Super Mario World [SMA2]\", and that was simply because it was from a more advance system.  In addition to the wonderful nostalgia of playing \"Super Mario 3\", \"SMA 4\" also gives the gamer the original \"Mario Bros\" game to play individually or in multiplayer mode (all the \"Super Mario Advance\" games do this).  While Nintendo has made some missteps in understanding its core fan base with its handling of its last two platform systems, the \"Super Mario Advance\" series, especially \"Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros 3\" shows that Nintendo still has an intimate understanding of what its fans want in a portable gaming system.

Resistance for its massive battles & COD for the great graphics and super tight play. Killzone 2 is a great blend of each.There are a lot of complaints about the controls, but none from me. The guns are weighted and recoil as you would expect. The characters move like heavily armored soldiers carrying heavy artillary might. I could see it as an issue if it wasn't equal, but everyone is playing at the same speed and after a very short amount of time, I can say without fail that I am pretty quick with the M82 and plenty of online players that are far superior to me will light you up as quick as any game of Halo or COD.As far as the graphics, online there is no dropoff compared to the single player. This is the best looking game I can remember playing. I had a difficult time going back to Resistance because it looked terrible after KZ2.The single player game is ...about like every other signle player FPS that I can remember. Follow a line shoot guys, etc. I only played for a couple of hours to get familiar with the controls before playing online so I can't really speak as an authority on the single player.The online game has all of the usual suspects as far as game modes go. The new exception is being able to string any of the five together that plays as single game. If you have a squad that you enjoy playing with, this is great. If you jump into a 25 minute game and get stuck with a team of half-tards, prepare to be frustrated that you have to wait 25 minutes to get credited with your experience. It's also worth noting that KZ2 has a similiar level up / xp system that unlocks various items like COD 4. It's about what you'd expect.The battles are awesome and where KZ2 really takes the cake for me is the whole package with 30 people at a time. My biggest complaint with COD4 is 12 player battles on medium sized maps. It is too easy for people to camp and the middle of the screen remain empty for extended periods - especially in hardcore modes where you are playing 1 shot kills.Killzone 2 doesn't reinvent the wheel and doesn't really offer anything new in terms of gameplay. A similiar thing has happened with the fighter genre. You can only \"play guns\" in so many different ways, so the next logical step is perfecting the genre, and right now, Killzone 2 is at the top of the heap.UPDATED:I purchased the downloadable map packs, Titanium & Steel. One takes place on a moving train, the other in the cruiser shown at the opening of the game. The train is a sight to behold and a snipers dream come true as the action funnels to visible choke points and the map is very narrow. The Vekta cruiser is multi-leveled and circular in shape. It's a stark contrast to the rest of Killzone with bright lighting and vibrant colors. The pack cost $6.00 and both are fun to play. The only problem is not many people appear to have purchased. It is common to find lobbies with the new map pack OR the originals. They're great to see in motion, espcially the train, but not a mandatory purchase at all.I have such a problem with connection, that I've found myself going back to COD4 & WAW despite preferring Killzone 2's gameplay. Not only am I frequently disconnected, but it logs the PS3 offline and occassionaly locks up the system and requires a hard restart. I've even found myself having to restart my router becuase it locks everything up and I have to reboot my connection. It is exceptionally frustrating to play partial matches and get kicked (especially the longer games) and pop in COD or Resistance and have no issues.Finally - Clan battles. Ugh. Oddly enough, COD felt like you had to be in a clan to enjoy the game. In fact, it's almost mandatory (log into a match with just a bunch of guys versus a party and get ready to die...a lot, no level balancing). KZ seems to be the opposite. Clan battles have rampant cheating and cheapness you just don't see in the big open matches. I played in a couple clan matches and virtually every negative I'd heard about them was evident(not respawning in deathmatch, hiding the the radio in your base, etc.). I've had a much better time just going from game to game until I find a group that is competitive on both sides. The good rooms are typically set to automatically balance, so a room with a few good players on both sides can be as much fun as any clan battle.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0049DYNNO","description":"","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"Some of the best games ever, in a rushed mess of a port.","reviewText":"First, something needs to be made very clear- this is an EXACT port of the standard Super Mario All-Stars as it was on the SNES. When I say exact, I mean just that. There are no improvements made to anything, no enhancements, no widescreen option, no extra games to unlock, nothing. Heck, even the SNES controller appears when you're selecting files on the main menu, showing what button does what. Shouldn't -that- at least have been changed?That being said, the games are still fun, and if you've never played any of these before, you're in for a treat. This collection includes Super Mario Bros, The Lost Levels, Super Mario Bros 2 and Super Mario Bros 3. Super Mario World isn't included for some reason, but maybe just because it was only on versions of the game that came with the SNES console. Still, each game here provides hours of fun. There aren't many games from the 80s and early 90s that I can say that about, as most of them don't age very well, but these Mario games hold up. Super Mario Bros 3 in particular, which single-handedly changed gaming back when it came out. There's not really any plot to these games (though I do remember having coloring/activity books as a kid that explained what was going on), so you won't be stuck with boring cutscenes to sit through. You'll run, jump, kick koopa shells, shoot fireballs, and more through dozens of levels in each game. Really, I feel stupid explaining anything about them because I'm pretty sure everyone, regardless of their age, has played these in some form before. Be it on the NES, SNES, GBA, the Wii's Virtual Console, or through *cough* other means, the games in this collection are considered classics for a good reason.Being a straight port from the SNES version, that means that the original 8-bit versions aren't here. This is one of many problems with this collection. Why bother porting the cart exactly as it was without any added features? It'd be nice to have those on here as well, to show the difference in graphics for people who might not have played the originals. Also, would it have really been that hard for Nintendo to throw in Super Mario World, Super Mario Kart, the GameBoy games, and maybe even Super Mario 64? I get that this was released to celebrate 25 years of Mario, so why re-release an older game without going all out with the extra stuff? The bonus CD and booklet are lame reasons to buy this game, considering the CD only has 10 actual music tracks, and the other 10 tacks are just sound effects from the game. Yeah, did you ever want to have a quick sound of Mario going down a pipe or collecting a coin? Me either. The booklet looks nice and all, and serves as a kind of Mario timeline, but it's missing a couple of major games. I was expecting more of a book instead of this dinky thing. Basically, you can get everything in this booklet from various Nintendo sites.If you notice, I gave this game 5 stars for fun. The 3 stars is the overall rating, because it applies to this as a 'limited edition'. You're not getting anything that special. Keep your NES, SNES and GBA carts if you still have them, unless you're a die-hard Nintendo fan and something being limited is that important to you. But if you haven't played these games before and have the means, buy them from the Vitual Console instead.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0049DYNNO","description":"","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"All-Stars on Wii","reviewText":"Saying that Mario is a video game icon is an understatement, Mario games have been constant sellers and there continues to be excellent Mario titles to be released. It is only normal that for his 25th anniversary the big N decided to celebrate by releasing a bright red Nintendo Wii AND a special edition of the 1993 Super Mario All Stars. This limited edition of Super Mario All-Stars for the Nintendo Wii is a cool idea for the Nintendo/Mario collectors. Truth is, this could have been done much better. It is the exact same port as the 1993 SNES game of the same name, it doesn't add anything bonus (except the soundtrack), the games can't be played in Wide-screen and the games even shows you the controls on a SNES controller (Nintendo didn't fix this)! I thought that the games looked a little bit better here as I did notice a slight improvement.Some fans won't get why this is being re-released and why to buy it when it's cheaper to get the games from Virtual Console. This was made for fans that wish to own this limited collectible game, if you don't want it or are against this idea then...don't buy it! As for contents, there is nothing much to say really. It's those three first Mario Bros we love so much along with The Lost Levels (2 in Japan), it's basically a port from the SNES Super Mario All-Stars to the Wii. I think the inclusion of the soundtrack was a nice addition (even if Nintendo could have put more songs on it) to Super Mario All-Stars. You get 10 songs that are used in various Mario games such as Mario Bros, Mario Sunshine, Mario Galaxy and so on, and ten more are basically sounds such as 1 UP and Lose A Life, a cool addition. On the other hand they made the booklet sound a little better than it really is and while it's a nice extra it doesn't have all that much in it, mostly pictures.Many collectors want this exclusively because it's potential future value and the fact that it's something limited, some even bought two copies so they can play with one and keep the other. I can't say I blame them but I bought my copy to play. I picked this up for 29.99 but know it sells considerably higher on other stores and on the internet. At $30 it is a reasonable price for what it is I believe but being that it is \"limited\" you may want to consider buying on Amazon if you really can't find a copy. You can still buy these games on Virtual Console if you prefer since after all, it is cheaper to buy that way and this was made for collectors really (and those who want to play those great games again and want to own the game). I have nothing to complain about I suppose, the soundtrack is an excellent addition and I now have those classics for my Wii. For fun it's a 5 stars, those classics are always fun to play. The soundtrack and booklet are both nice but for overall value it's more like a 3-3.5 because the game itself is just a direct port (it would've been nice to have Super Mario World added or something like that).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXFKE","description":"","reviewerName":"The Czar","summary":"Magnificent!","reviewText":"I've played all the AC games with the exception of AC1 and this game is a great addition to the franchise. People try and compare this to the others but I believe it stands on it's own. The time period being the Revolutionary War really helps me connect to the story versus Renessaince Italy, which I really enjoyed as well but wasn't necessarily MY history. You can tell there was alot of work put into this game. The graphics are outstanding. I play on a 73 inch 3D TV and I am blown away by them. I find myself getting lost in the environments, especially the wilderness, with its forests, cliffs, waterfalls, wild game you can hunt, etc. New York and Boston were beautifully done and lively. Ubisoft claimed to have gotten hold of actual engravings of the cities layouts and portrayed them as accurately as possible. The fight mechanics are superior to the previous games. Climbing feels more fluid. There were some glitches, maybe should have been beta tested a little more. Also, more explanation was needed for certain aspects of the game such as crafting and upgrading your artisans. That's why I'm dinging it a star for overall. I would've just dinged half a star if I could, but still give it 5 stars for fun.Another bonus of this game is you can actually learn some history because although the game is set around a fictional character, the historical events are pretty accurate due to Ubisofts diligence in getting it right. I loved taking part in the Boston Tea Party or witnessing the events of the Boston Massacre. Interacting with Ben Franklin, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams to name a few, was very cool.The Naval battles were epic and as many others have said could have been a game of it's own. Commandeering a sailing naval warship with blazing cannons and all is exhilarating! You have to experience it for yourself.3D:A little more on the 3D aspect since I haven't seen many reviews touching on this. The 3D is very well done. With the 3D setting at max this game really comes to life. Just amazing. When syncronizing a view point at a high vantage point whether atop a tree, a church spire or a cliff, you get a nice depth perception that takes your breath away. Looking down a street in Boston or New York almost feels like the real deal. Definite bonus to have this game be 3D capable!Multiplayer:The multiplayer is well done. So far I'm on level 20 of 50 before you become a master Assassin. Good variations of multiplayer utilized including free for all and team based. A nice diversion if you can ever tear yourself away from the main game lol!Miscellaneous:Hunting the way frontiersmen did it back in the day was great. Being a Native American Assassin hunter is a critters worst nightmare lol! You're not always the hunter though. There are wolves, bears, cougars and even bobcats that try and get a piece of you, LITERALLY! Building up your homestead is rewarding but not necessary. I could have used a tutorial or something though...not enough explanation on how to do it. Plenty of other side missions I won't go into for sake of keeping this short. You definitely get your money's worth.Bottom line:I highly recommend this game. It is a great gaming experience, one of my all time greats, despite the minor glitches I encountered. Ubisoft has sent out a patch which resolved most of them. Personally I did't run into any major ones myself. You would be doing yourself a disfavor if you listen to the detractors who thought the game moved too slow and need instant gratification, you know, the COD crowd. Just like any good story there is a build up until it really gets going. I say enjoy the journey! It's a heck of a ride.P.S. Excersise self control or you will find yourself losing sleep and burning hours and hours on this game. Trust me I know lol!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2012"}

Armed with lethal double chainblades, Kratos must carve through mythology's darkest creatures - including Medusa, Cyclops, the Hydra and more, while solving intricate puzzles in breathtaking environments. Driven by pure revenge, nothing can stop Kratos from achieving absolution.","reviewerName":"citan-uzuki \"citan-uzuki\"","summary":"Top-Notch Production","reviewText":"This game follows the adventures of a man called Kratos.  The time period is ancient Greece.  And Ares, the God of War, has decided that it is time to destroy the great city of Athens.  The city has fallen into decadence and it is now time to level it to the ground.  Thankfully, not all of the Gods share his views.  Expectedly, the patron Goddess of the city, Athena, wants to save Athens.  As usual, the Gods do not confront one another directly.  Instead, they use human surrogates as play pieces (much like in the game of chess) in order to change the course of events.  Athena decides to use the services of Kratos, a warrior, to help save the city.  Other Gods who side with Athena also decide to help Kratos on his mission.  The heart of that mission is to stop Ares, even if it meant killing him, from destroying the city.The game itself is very well done.  The graphics, soundtrack, dialogue, voice acting, and gameplay are all top notch.  In other words, the production values are very high.I prefer a long prologue to draw the player into the story.  I want to be gently introduced to the game and story, basically.  This game however, starts you off into battle immediately.  After a very, very short scene, you are then given control of Kratos onboard a ship in the Aegean sea.  Immediately, you are surrounded by demonic creatures.  And the action very rarely slows down after that point.  Keep in mind that this is not an RPG.This is a very challenging game.  I played at the \"easy\" setting, Mortal.  There's never any shortage of things to do, hurdles to overcome, and enemies to fight.  And there's no shortage of blood, gore, and violence.  As one previous reviewer mentioned, Athens is not a happy place.  There's plenty of suffering and misery all around.I recommend this game for people who like adventure games.  I do not, however, recommend it for anyone who might be \"squeamish\".  As has been mentioned already, there is an abundance of violence.  And the atmosphere of the story is rather gloomy.I do not seek to play games that contain a lot of violence, gore, and misery.  My preference is for games that have an uplifting story.  However, I will occasionally make an exception if the game is otherwise excellent.  While God of War might be depressing and gloomy, it is also an excellent action-adventure game.  One of the best that I have ever come across.UpdateI forgot to mention that a lot of players have complained that there might be a glitch in the game.  This glitch comes out when you play the first boss of the game, a three-headed Hydra.  During the battle, you will have the \"option\" to press the circle button repeatedly to slam the Hydra's head into a post.  However, many gamers have complained that they were not able to do this even when they pressed the button properly.  During my first playthrough, I ran across this problem.  I restarted the battle three times.  The third time, I was finally able to accomplish the task.  Now, was that due to a glitch or improper timing on my part?  I don't know.  But I am an experienced gamer and my timing is usually good.  So maybe there is a glitch.  In any case, if you find yourself having a difficult time with this, then simply restart the battle from the Save point. Ok, Citan knows that can be aggravating.  But at this point, Citan is not prepared to say that there is a glitch in the game.  One thing, notice that I put 'option' in between quotations above.  I don't believe you can beat the Hydra unless you play this option/mini-game.  I could be mistaken, but the Hydra's health recovers during the battle.  So it is something you have to do in order to proceed.It's not my intention to spoil the game for you by telling this.  No, my dear ladies and gentlemen.  The last thing Citan wants to do is spoil the plot for his fellow gamers.  But it might be an important bit of information for anyone who is considering the game.  And don't we write reviews as a service to our fellow buyers and consumers?  Is that not the purpose of these reviews?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2007"}
{"product_name":"B001UWGBC8","reviewerName":"Happenstance Slugger \"taco\"","summary":"Better gameplay , less depth than the previous game.","reviewText":"To start with the game looks awesome , the level design is much improved in terms of the environments looking real and not just copy and paste room after room. The Heroes powers look great and I have more of a feeling of power than in xmen legends games were more based around melee attack and you just happened to have super powers. The Game itself has a pretty decent story but if you play it twice you will realize there is not a whole lot of difference if you play pro or anti reg. There is less content than in previous games , each character has four powers and that is it. Each one only has two costumes, that is it. That being said the costumes you do get are well rendered and your powers are also more well developed in terms of visualization per the character you are using. As for the DLC not being available , it is a let down they did away with it as I would really like to use Juggernaut, Magneto , Cyclops..Etc but at the same time I found myself running out of game to use all the characters already at my disposal anyways. Opposed to in the first game where I would try half the people and be like that's lame and never use them again and pretty much stick to the same four and maybe rotate in a few new guys now and again. I really really enjoyed being pretty much every single character in this game. Even the ones who I really don't care for or know as much about like Luke Cage , Iron Fist , Penance and Songbird. They were all fun to use and came in handy expecially Iron Fist with his healing power. If you like the other games you will probably like this one too. I liked the first Marvel UA better as a whole , but there are alot of things about this game that are better. If they made a third game I would undoubtedly buy it based on the strength of this game and it's merits alone not just because I am a fan of the series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00BY0G0YU","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"\"HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!\" Now in glorious HD!","reviewText":"On the box, this collection is described as an \"HD remaster.\" I cannot think of a better term for this package. This definitely had more work put into it than yourrun-of-the-mill PS3 HD port collection, and I don't just mean visually too. Overall, I'm pretty impressed by the amount of upgrades these games received. For those who are already familiar with the original Final Fantasy X and X-2 and want to hear about the enhancements/changes the games have in this package, skip the next two paragraphs. If you're new to the FFX/X-2 saga and want to know a little bit more about those games, then I'll try to sum them up in a concise manner.*Quick reviews for Final Fantasy X and X-2*Depending on who you ask, FFX is either the last great *traditional* single-player FF game, or the beginning of the end of the series. For my money, FFX is a classic. At the time of its release, the whole gaming community was caught up in its beautiful world and interesting characters. Thematically, FFX is a magical game, filled with beautiful locales and heaps of mystery. There's also a great deal of deep philosophical musings on all sorts of things ranging from religion to dreams to the very nature of existence. MOST of the characters are also likable. Auron is a real contender for coolest FF character ever. The visuals were seriously incredible back in the day, and its art design is still wonderful (this world really benefits from being in HD now), and the music is among Nobuo Uematsu's very best works, and that's saying A LOT. Mechanically, FFX was a pretty great JRPG. There were plenty of things to do, and almost all of them engaging. The battle system is incredibly deep, strategic, and rewarding to master. There's even an interesting, huge meta-game that incorporates the in-universe sport, Blitzball, with JRPG mechanics that are pretty interesting. Even though I don't think it matches up to its immediate predecessor, the virtually perfectFinal Fantasy IX, FFX is still a fantastic classic very much worth playing.FFX-2 is not quite so beloved as X, generally speaking. At the time of its release, the consensus among the FF community was a lot of confused and pissed off fans. It was the first sequel to any entry in the FF series, and it was such a dramatic departure in pretty much every way from FFX that nobody knew what to make of it. Gone was the sweeping orchestral music, replaced by lots of J-pop. Gone was the feeling of a FF adventure, replaced with an almost Charlie's Angels \"BOW, PICHOW, KACHOW, let's strike a cheesy pose for no apparent reason\" campy romp sort of way, starring Yuna, Rikku, and newcomer Paine (designed to be a femaleSquall) on their quest to find Tidus. It has been stated by the developers that it was made to appeal more to the large female demographic of X's fanbase, and I'm not sure if that succeeded. I have to admit, some of the game is so cheesy and embarrassing to be caught playing (The scene where Yuna gives another character a message complete with orgasmic sounds is borderline pornographic, and makes me cringe every time). X-2 IS a strange game, no doubt about it. What most haters of FFX-2 DON'T tell you is that, mechanically, X-2 is pretty awesome. The dressphere battle system is pretty great, utilizing a class-style focus in a very unique way. There's always something engaging to do in X-2, and getting to the mountain of side quests is easy and intuitive. The story also features some genuinely well-written parts as well, despite the overwhelming cheese majority. It's not as great as FFX is, but if you can get used to the strange thematic elements, then you may be surprised just how fun and engaging X-2 is as a JRPG.*Review of this package as an HD remaster*Obviously, the biggest change is in the title of the package: HD visuals. How does this collection do in that way? Surprisingly well. Despite the fact that the bones of the package here are from an early PS2 title, the visuals in these games look fantastic. Textures have been cleared up immensely, and the lighting and shadow effects have also received attention and look great. The game is in 16:9 widescreen and it all looks fantastic. Because of the transition to widescreen, the cutscenes and their assets have been remade completely and look gorgeous in HD (although you still can't skip them, which is sure to bother some). Perhaps best of all, almost all of the in-game character models have been remade from the ground-up and look right at home on the PS3 system. Auron has never looked more awesome than here. It may not be as huge of an upgrade as some modernfull-onremakesand there are some graphical quirks remaining (i.e. hands going through sleeves,  hair clipping into clothes if a character moves their head back, some hilarious lip syncing blunders, etc). Still, considering the fact that most HD collections amount to slapdash up-rezed ports and nothing more, this collection looks great. So bravo to Square-Enix for clearly going the extra mile to refresh this game visually. They did a great job.From an audio perspective, there have been a few improvements as well. Voices are clearer and sound better (whether the voice acting was great or not in the first place is highly debated by fans). Now all aspects of Tidus and Yuna's imfamous forced laughter scene look and sound clearer than ever. Whether that's a blessing or a curse is up to you, lol. Roughly 60 tracks have also been remastered for this game and they sound better than ever. However, the audio enhancements in this package are clearly not as drastic of an upgrade as the visual elements are. Still, X/X-2 have never looked OR sounded better.Another huge change from the originals comes in the form of additional content. Back in the day, FFX was rereleased with additional content in Japan. We never got that version in the US. Now we do. In addition to some new optional bosses, FFX also gives you the option to try out a revamp Sphere Grid that allows for more customization and challenge. X-2 has some new dresspheres as well as a \"Creature Creator\" that allows you to capture and train most enemies, including bosses from BOTH games, to use as party members in future battles. I wouldn't describe any of these additions as paradigm shifting, but they are pretty cool additions and it's nice to know we're getting the most updated, complete version of the games. Add in trophy sets for each game, and you get what is pretty much the definitive release of these games.The package includes several new additions to the X universe's story. There's Final Fantasy X: Eternal Calm, which is a long epilogue cutscene following the events of FFX. It's not a particularly interesting plot,but it does bridge the gap between X and X-2 stories, and that's nice. There's also Final Fantasy X-2: The Last Mission, which is a short expansion of sorts that takes place three months after X-2's ending. I can't speak as to its quality, but I do know that it does change depending on the events that took place during a players' game of X-2, which is neat. Finally, there's a brand new audio drama set a year after X-2 entitled -Will-. I'm always a little hesitant to buy into these sorts of official/unofficial side stories, as they can be really bad at times, but still, I'll take what I can get. Clearly, the main draw of this package is the core X and X-2 games, but all this content at $40 is pretty cool if you ask me.So there you have it. Overall, I'm very impressed by the work that went into this collection. It's definitely higher-quality than your average HD port. The visuals and audio have never sounded better in these games, and there's just so much content here on just one blu-ray disc, it's pretty awesome. All of this for $40 seems like a steal to me. If you've never played these JRPG classics before, then now is definitely the time to get into them, as they have never looked/sounded/played better than here. If you're like me and you sunk countless hours into the original all those years ago, I'd definitely recommend picking up this package again. I've been loving diving back into the world of FFX again. The enhancements to this version definitely makes it feel new again. These games, and particularly FFX, hearken back to a time when Final Fantasy games were universally hailed for their immersive worlds, great stories, interesting characters, brilliant music, and engaging JRPG mechanics. Now, they're better than ever. So buy it, prepare for a classic FF experience, and get lost in the magical, lovely world of Spira.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}

If you must have waves of strategy and a sussurus of storyline constantly pounding your mind, this game is not for you.  However, if you can accept its lack of the aforementioned, you will have some unadultured fun.BG: DA is not a thinking man's game, it's a hack-and-slash.  Sending the player through droves of seemingly-endless monsters in Diablo-style is the point of the game.  A short, though adaquately written, storyline weaves around the gameplay; the gameplay is the obvious main focus.  Strategy amounts to not entering a large group of enemies that guarantees your death, putting the correct weapons on, allocating gained skill points effectively, and healing when necessary.  Not exactly mind-bending, but acceptable and fun.If you need heavy, deep times--stay far away.

These two games together on a single Blu-Ray disc at such a reasonable price are fantastic.  Great storyline revolving around Greek mythology, tons of blood and gore, excellent cinematics, decent control scheme, and lots of merciless killing.  Definitely my type of game (and not for the faint of heart or little kids)!  Not playing continuously, both games took me between 10 and 15 hours total to complete, so they're very epic in scope.  The puzzle portions of the games seemed a bit lackluster and could be more challenging, but overall, everything else trumps that particular aspect.  As of this writing, God of War 3 has just been released, and I'm psyched to get it in the mail soon (review of that one is pending).On a side note, Greek mythology is a fantastic genre to make video games with, but after the God of War trilogy, there should not be any more video games revolving around that.  GoW has officially set the standard and raised the bar to which no other video game can compete, and it's best to leave the Greek mythos alone after this series is complete.  Mythology itself, however, should continue to be explored and developed in the video game industry.  Perhaps we'll see Roman, Celtic, or Hindu mythology next???  Would be an awesome idea (hint hint to any video game developers reading this!!!).  In fact, I'd LOVE to see a video game featuring a heavily Christian/religious element with saints and such.  Would make a mind-blowing concept, don't you think?In any event, definitely pick up GoW: Collection when you get the chance.  These two games are considered to be staples for Playstation owners, and that's the truth.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2010"}

To help the Simpsons, gamers at home must journey through all of Springfield (as well as vast worlds beyond!), vanquish an amazing array of villains, and fight their way through parodies of multiple popular games.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Mediocre Gameplay but Fantastic Production Values","reviewText":"The Simpsons isn't new to the gaming world by any means.  But it's been over a decade since they actually had a true video game.  For years we've seen Simpsons games that were just knock offs of other games like The Simpsons Road Rage or Hit and Run.  The Simpsons Game, however, is its own thing.  After nearly twenty years of a successful television run, a blockbuster movie and having an influence on our culture as a whole, The Simpsons finally get a true video game to call their own.  It isn't as good as the 90's original arcade game, but it's by far one of the best video game outings The Simpsons have had in a while.  By far this is one of the better games based off a TV show to hit the video game market yet.The first thing to get out of the way is simple.  Any huge fan of the show will absolutely love this game.  The writing staff hopped on board to do the writing and they do a fabulous job.  It's full of all the clever wit of the show along with several references to show as a whole.  Many of the levels are centered around events which actually took place in episodes.  The game serves as brilliant fan service to those who have come to love and admire the show over the past twenty years.  Not only that, but it's easily one of the funniest games ever made.Just like the show, you should expect it to be full of parodies and poking fun.  And in this game it does all of that.  It especially makes plenty of pokes at the gaming industry as a whole.  If you're a hardcore gamer this game only becomes that much funnier when you see parodies of some of your favorite games like Everquest, Medal of Honor, and Grand Theft Auto.  There are also jokes about some of the other aspects of the game presented by Comic Book Guy.  Moments where you discover you can't swim for example.  Or Invisible walls.  All of these are things that have been done in video games several times and The Simpsons Game decides to make fun of them.  They even managed to get some people from the video game industry in here to do some cameos.  For The Simpsons fan and gamer, it's almost heavenly the amount of humor and pop culture references that are here.  You'll most certainly being dying of laughter throughout the entire adventure.Even better.  The game looks and sounds just like the show.  The graphics have the look and feel of the show and the actual voice cast came on the lend their voices.  In short, in reality it's like you're getting a full blown episode of the show that's well... hours long.  And it works.  The production values of this game make you put aside the mediocre gameplay in part because the game makes fun of itself too by being packed full of cliches they mock.And that's where the problem with The Simpsons Game comes into play.  The developers spent so much time on the production values of the game that they didn't spend nearly as much time perfecting the overall gameplay experience.  That's not to say the gameplay doesn't have its merits.  It certainly does.  It's just that the gameplay only meets the standards, it doesn't try to exceed them.Throughout the game you'll play as The Simpsons family.  In every level there is at least one other Simpson to control and you can switch between them as often as you like.  And you'll have to considering some of the puzzles you'll be doing.  Each level is fairly open ended with bad guys coming at you left and right.  Every Simpson has standard attack and a fairly special one.  Bart, for example, can use his slingshot for standard attacking, but he can also become Bartman and glide all over the place.  Some characters have downright zany powers, though.  Lisa, for example can summon a giant hand, and she uses her saxophone to fight off baddies with music.  It's a little over the top but then again, The Simpsons has never been a show grounded in reality.There's also co-op play but it feels like a last minute thought at times.  This is because in some levels it is more than obvious that certain characters aren't really needed for anything other than pummeling your enemies.  Only certain characters are suited for certain tasks.  It's fine on single player, but on co-op your partner can sure feel useless at times.  Just the same, however, the AI isn't really all that bad.  While it's pain to have to keep an eye on both health gauges for those who have a go at single player, your partner can really hold his or her own in just about any situation.  So it's nice that you don't have to constantly babysit an AI controlled character.There's not much to the gameplay, but at least it's simple and easy to pick up on.  But there's so much more that could've been done with it.  It gets repetitive in many areas.  At the very least, however, each new level you go to is distinguished from the previous one.  And while the objectives are not by any means difficult to reach (it's a pretty easy game) you'll have some fun.  There are also a lot of collectibles to uncover throughout the game.  Each level is just teeming with items for The Simpsons clan to obtain.As I said, however, it's a game that meets the standard but doesn't really try to exceed it.  The good news is that the humor keeps you going through the game, even when the gameplay gets tiring.  Simply because a laugh out loud video game.  This game was definitely made for Simpsons fans and gamers alike.  And despite the gameplay the humor and production values really make this a unique gameplay experience.If anything, The Simpsons Game is worth a look just for the production values alone.  It's funny, it carries the look of the show, it was written by the writers of the show and even includes the voice cast from the show.  What's not to like about the production values for the hardcore Simpsons fan?Pros:+The production values are some of the best to ever be done in a TV gone video game.  The clever witty writing of the show comes out.  The clever parodies come out.  It's just an all around funny game filled with gaming culture references.Cons:-The other thing we must face, the gameplay could've been so much better.  It's not bad by any means, but certainly isn't as good as it had the potential to be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2007"}

{"product_name":"B001E8QA2E","description":"Batman: Arkham Asylum","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Finally, the Real Batman Simulator","reviewText":"UPDATE, OCTOBER 2013:  Good news!  With Games for Windows Live dead, Steam just converted Arkham Asylum and Arkham City out of that godawful platform.  Even if you bought a boxed copy, you can add it to Steam:  you just key in your Product key and Arkham Asylum or Arkham City will be added to your Steam Games Library at no cost.  If you already have it through Steam and it's installed, the latest update kills GfWL for you.  I just did mine over the weekend and am reminded at what fun these games were.The bad news is, you lose savegames, because those were all sucked into the GfWL abyss...but I thought I'd pass this news along in the hopes that it helps other people.P.S.:  They've also done this for Bioshock 2 and I'm hoping they'll keep going with Fallout 3 / New Vegas and more......and now, back to your original review as posted...On the few occasions Batman has had his own videogame, it's been a hard run for our hero. He doesn't have super-powers. It's hard to translate his detective skills into something that doesn't a) require the player to have the genius of Sherlock Holmes; or b) boil down to grabbing colored tokens and calling that \"investigating\". And of course the other obstacle Batman has to surmount is that balance between \"Batman punches bad guy\" and \"Batman uses gadget on bad guy\": you need good fight mechanics and useful gadgets that serve a purpose.\"Arkham Asylum\" is the perfect marriage of the best things about Batman. It is also the perfect videogame for almost any audience. The fight mechanics make sense: they seldom leave you worrying more about being able to see than whether or not you're hitting the bad guy. There is a gameplay balance between the \"quiet stealth\" mechanic of a Splinter Cell or a Hitman game, versus the \"weapons free\" tactical assualt of a Rainbow Six. And best of all, every scenario can be handled more than one way: you can choose to sneak by a clump of henchmen, you can leap into the fray, or you can swing around Spider-Man style and torment them as you slowly take them down one by one. The only choke points in Arkham Asylum appear to be the boss battles, where you typically need to do one or more very specifc things in order to win. If you like RPGs, you'll be pleased to know that you can collect \"experience\" as you go and then spend it to get new upgrades to your armor, abilities, and gadgets.Arkham Asylum is about as perfect as a game can get: it makes a complicated hero like Batman very easy to handle. It doesn't require fast-twitch skills, and yet there is plenty of action to be had. The controls are very fluid and despite lacking a platform-style \"jump\" mechanic, you are extremly agile and can easily chain combinations of moves together. For example, let's say you're on a ledge. You'd like to glide down, kick a bad guy, then grapple up to a gargoyle and swing across the room before he knows what hit him. You could do this by tapping space, then F, then F again. If you knock somebody down and you'd like to finish them off, just hold right-click and press Ctrl: Batman will pounce on them, grapple, and subdue them with a knock-out punch and he'll even do it from some distance away so you don't have to sprint across the room before the bad guy gets to his feet.Arkham Asylum also boasts a storyline written by Paul Dini, who is well known for the lion's share of the Batman Animated Series. Characters are voiced by the same people from the series, such as Mark Hamill as the Joker. There are all sorts of hidden goodies to find in every level, and each can unlock either the ongoing saga of Dr. Arkham or detailed information on the many DC characters that make up Batman's universe. Half of the fun is in listening to \"patient interview tapes\", reading origin stories and \"first appearance\" details, and exploring the \"Behind the scenes\" video content on the disc. You don't have to find everything that is hidden in this game, but the payoff makes you want to. Best of all, rather than worrying that you might miss out on a hidden secret, you are very clearly shown that some things won't be accessible until you come back later. Batman's gadgets come to him over the course of the game, and sometimes you'll need one that you'll be getting later in order to get into a secret area...you can always come back another time.If games like this are typically hard for you, Easy difficulty does make it a cakewalk. Normal difficulty still gives you a lot of helping hands, though: if you get into a fatal situation such as falling off a ledge, the game will tell you 'tap F to escape' and give you a chance to avoid death. If you do die, you'll get a tip on the loading screen specific to what you were trying to get through. And if you're having trouble finding all the goodies, each section has a map that you can find that will light them up for you.Still not impressed? Well, the Game of the Year Edition* offers you the ability to play in \"3D\". This isn't the polarized \"Avatar movie\" style 3D, unfortunately: it is the traditional \"red-blue glasses\" 3D and comes with two pairs of folding paper 3D glasses. It works, it just doesn't bring much to the table. In levels with specific color balances such as the Arboretum (which has a lot of blues and greens), the colors tend to bleed out because you're looking through tinted lenses, so most of the time I leave this off. The Game of the Year Edition also adds 4 more maps, and the ability to \"Play as the Joker\". These extras really boost up the replayable appeal of Arkham Asylum. No matter what you're looking for in this game, you're going to find yourself coming back for more. You don't need to be a comic-book cognoscenti, but if you are you won't be disappointed. I have this title for both the PS3 and the PC, and prefer the PC edition for much the same reason most PC gamers prefer the PC edition of a console title:  the camera control is much better.*note:  I cannot find a listing for the PC Game of the Year Edition at Amazon.com.

It is very fun.  VERY fun.  Some good things about it is the fact that it features all real weapons, unlike some other games.  I love fighting with real weapons.  The models for these guns are really detailed.  I love watching the reload for the double Berettas.  Another good thing about this game is the additional weapon models made by the fans.  You can d/l new models for the game, and those models, I think, are even better looking than the ones that come with the game!  The gameplay for this game is very fun.  You play as a terrorist or a counter-terrorist battling it out in a variaty of levels, De_Dust being one of my favorites.  But theres more to it than just trying to kill the whole of the other team.  You can play levels that have objectives like bomb planting and diffusing, and hostage releasing.  This is truly a unique multiplayer experience.  Even the mod for Unreal Tourniment, Tactical Ops, that features almost identical gameplay, cannot match the super \"fun-ness\" of CS.  Some things that could be fixed are the usual Half-Life glitchyness, and also some minor buggyness with the graphics.

Everything else is simply the same as AC: Brotherhood, which means that the game is really fun. I loved playing the game, but I must say that the gameplay was getting a little old as the only addition really since AC:1 is a hookblade, which really doesn't change anything other than being able to go zip-lining (Sadly there aren't too many lines for you to use). I will say that the story is much weaker than all of the previous campaigns, there's really no story in the present, and for what little story they have in the past I wasn't too interested in the setting.The only other gameplay addition to this game was an interesting and sometimes annoying first person virtual reality game. There were some interesting puzzles and platforming here, and it was nice to get to learn about the main character's past, but I almost wish they had given more information. The monetary/leveling system in the game is again kind of messed up, but now it's almost worse than the previous games. You still have the whole buying/upgrading buildings and increasing your salary, and unlike Brotherhood I didn't have a crazy amount of money by the end, but instead there was really nothing worth buying. All of the best weapons and armor in the game could be attained relatively early if you do some of the challenges and fully train your assassin apprentices.Overall, if you liked the previous Assassin's Creed games, you're almost assuredly going to like this game even with the horrible tower defense (I only had to play it 3-5 times, though the 3rd challenge was impossible) especially since you can probably get it pretty cheap now. I do find this game a year schedule without changing anything very annoying, but thankfully for the past two games a separate team has been creating AC3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2012"}

BioShock immerses players into a war-torn underwater utopia, where mankind has abandoned their humanity in their quest for perfection.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"\"I Chose... Rapture...\"  Again","reviewText":"Pros:+Enticing storyline full of philosophy and intrigue+Fantastic voice acting brings the already fantastic story to life+Lots of variety in the gameplay+Great sound effects+Great music score+All around beautiful game+The atmosphere of the game never settlesCons:-There's not much in terms of difficulty when you can always respawn-There may not be enough new content to justify paying sixty dollars if you've already got the 360 versionIn 2007 as I'm sure many know, Bioshock was released on the XBOX360.  The game went on to become a huge classic and sell over a million copies.  Earlier this year, it was announced the game would go to the Playstation 3.  At first glance, it may not seem worthwhile to buy the game on the Playstation 3 if you played the 360 version, but some of the additions and enhancements just might change the minds of some gamers.In the beginning of the game you are an unnamed man who happens to be on a plane that crashes seemingly out in the middle of nowhere.  Luckily, however, there is a lighthouse in sight.  Once you step inside it is quite clear that this is no ordinary lighthouse and soon you descend in the undersea world of Rapture.  Rapture is a totally free society in which no one is ruled by anyone, and it was built by a man named Andrew Ryan.  Unfortunately, Rapture is anything but perfect.  The once perfect world has now become imperfect and is overrun with splicers who thrive on Adam.Bioshock has an incredible story that digs much deeper than simply being about a central antagonist and protagonist.  In the end it'll make you think.  It's a very absorbing game.  Even is how it looks.  It looked incredible on the XBOX360, but the visual experience is enhanced on the Playstation 3 and it looks even better than it did before.  Much of it looks very real.  Even better is the artistic design and attention to detail.  The atmosphere itself is absorbing as well and really makes the world come alive.Throughout the city you'll also find recorded radio diaries that give you a good idea of what happened to Rapture.  The voice acting in these diaries, and throughout the games various cutscenes is incredible.  It really helps anyone become absorbed into the world.Playing Bioshock is an even better experience.  At it's heart it is a first person shooter.  You'll find weapons that you can use to take down the splicers.  Throughout Rapture you'll also find plasmids which you can use to help you take down certain enemies.  Some Plasmids can be used to electrocute splicers, or manipulate others.  There's a lot to BioShock's gameplay that makes it interesting.  In addition to the weapons and plasmids you can also hack the shopping arcades to lower prices, as well as hack security cameras and gun turrets to help you out against your enemies.There's nothing incredibly difficult about it's gameplay.  It's simple enough.  Perhaps a little too simple.  Bioshock is not a game where you ever really permanently die.  If you happen to die you'll respawn from a Vita-Chamber where you'll be able to go right back up to the enemy that killed you.  The enemy's health never changes.  So essentially, if you're stuck you can keep respawning until you kill whatever it is giving your trouble.  This essentially means BioShock is never too difficult.  You may get tired of dying, but you can never die permanently.What exactly is new in Bioshock on the PS3?  Well, the graphics are smoother and you get a new difficulty setting.  While the new difficulty is enticing, it doesn't really add too much.  The enemies are stronger and you pick up less ammo etc., but it's not really enough to entice anyone who owns the 360 version to really pick this one up.  So if you've played one of the previous versions of Bioshock, there isn't really too much here that makes it worth getting again.  At least not for the price tag of the game itself.Bioshock is still an amazing game even a year later.  It may not be worth it to buy the PS3 version if you've played the XBOX360 version already, but if you have a PS3 and you haven't played Bioshock yet, it's worth checking out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7G3Q8","description":"","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"yup, you probably read the news- this is indeed average","reviewText":"Yoshi's New Island has a false name.  There's nothing new about it.  All it does is recycle the same exact ideas that were used in the original Super NES Yoshi's Island.  The only things that are really new are the occasional new vehicles you can play around with such as a mine cart (which plays exactly the same as the car from the original) and you also have a new gimmicky humongous rolling egg boulder that can smash through practically anything for a few seconds.  Unfortunately it's basically the same idea as the overlarge Mario from the New Super Mario Bros. games, where an invincible Mario can plow his way through anything for a short period of time.All the worlds are laid out in similar but less interesting/more basic ways compared to the original Yoshi's Island.  The monkey levels in World 3 and the unthreatening blandness throughout World 6 are the biggest offenders.  In World 3, I got lost for days back in the Super NES days trying to find all the goodies hidden up in trees and discovering hidden areas that I'd NEVER have found had I not explored thoroughly.  World 6 is even more bland than Super Mario Galaxy 2's sixth world and I didn't think that was even possible.  World 5 is the same way by drastically underutilizing the snow theme.  This game won't take you days to discover everything since all the items are pretty much noticeable right away.  This means I really am playing nothing more than a poor imitation.  It makes the game feel like the levels are still in the early development process of being tested, and that the game's not yet ready for the final touches.The other really big problem that HAS to be mentioned is that every stage is incredibly straightforward.  All you really have to do, more often than not, is follow the row of coins to your destination.  When you follow the coins, you're taken to the places you're supposed to go.  This is what is referred to as handholding.  Now in the original Yoshi's Island the levels were presented in a more open adventurous kind of way where it took gamers several minutes (even hours, occasionally) to find the 20 red coins, the 3 flowers and 30 stars.  This game is more or less a completely straightforward affair, and what little exploration there is (by going up, left or down through pipes or across clouds) still feels really simplistic and uninteresting.  I guess if we realize this is a handheld and not a console game, such a shortcoming is slightly forgivable.  However if you've played the original Yoshi's Island, you probably won't be very pleased with the basic level design.  We rightfully expect more out of Nintendo given it's been 19 years since Yoshi's Island so we expect advancements and improvements.However the good news is that the game is still fun.  Imitation and poor level design aside, the core gameplay has remained.  You're still shooting eggs (though slightly slower and tackier than before) battling shy guys and several other familiar returning enemies like you were before.  It's just that Yoshi's New Island has been toned down in challenge overall due to the simplicity and straightforwardness of the level design.Yes this of course means the game is now pathetically easy for the most part.  I think Nintendo did do one thing right- they made the red coins slightly trickier to obtain.  By that I mean, I can't sense a slight red tint to them to indicate they're different from the yellow coins.  Plus red coins very well could be hidden in locations that in the Super NES version they'd NEVER be, such as when you find a hidden floating winged-cloud in the air and pop it with an egg, don't be surprised if red coins come out of there, or if the red coins make appearances you'd never guess if you've thoroughly explored the original Yoshi's Island.  That's a pleasant surprise and a very slight boost in difficulty.  The flowers seem easier to find and grab overall.  We've all mastered the ricocheting \"egg off the wall\" trick, which many flowers can be obtained this way.  Perhaps the amount of stars is less per stage compared to the Super NES Yoshi's Island which requires gamers to make less mistakes, but it's not like you're going to make huge mistakes time and time again anyway.I also like the occasional areas where you find a starman.  Now when you run up the walls and across the ceiling, you're still controlling Yoshi instead of baby Mario.  Mario remains on Yoshi's back while the starman moments are happening.  What's unusual is that, before reaching the end of the starman areas, Yoshi will suddenly BURST forward like a swift-moving rocket and you can collect coins this way.  It's unusual and perhaps gimmicky, but a nice addition.  But why in the WORLD did they keep the atrociously annoying howling basset hound sound effect in this game that was first presented in the Game Boy Advance version of Yoshi's Island?  Every time Yoshi flutters I have to put up with that same irritating sound over and over.  Ugh!  Get rid of that noise Nintendo.  You don't need it.The boss fights are a joke.  A joke in design and challenge.  Now you fight Kamek himself at least once per world.  These particular fights lack challenge considerably and you can figure out how to take him down in a matter of seconds.  The Kamek fight in World 6 is admittedly hard since there's a lot of distracting things going on all at once, but otherwise they're easy battles.  As for the REAL boss fights you face at the end of each world -such as a goofy-looking poorly animated beanstalk and a slow-moving bat to name a few- these are very easy in strategy compared to the boss fights you're familiar with from the first Yoshi's Island, not to mention lack that something special so they appear somewhat bland.  You're supposed to fear and feel excitement when Kamek turns regular enemies into huge and threatening bosses, but that feeling is missing here for whatever reason.  The giant crab boss I suppose is a bit tricky though he too looks dull.  The castle levels themselves are the biggest offender of the straightforward design approach.  Castles are supposed to be huge and threatening as well.  These are neither.Seriously, other than a few subtle additions and the different bosses, all this game does is copy what's already been done which makes me wonder why it exists.  A port of the first Yoshi's Island to the 3DS is all we really need.  We don't need poor imitations of the real thing.  Also am I missing something, but it doesn't seem like you can play the mini games such as roulette or slot machines, or the balloon popping games with the bandit (bandit mini games).  Are they actually in the game and I just haven't discovered them yet?At least the music is memorable with a HUGE variety of tunes that completely smears the original Yoshi's Island soundtrack, but the tunes being memorable is probably due to most of them being comparable to the legendary rock years of the 60's and 70's.  The piano theme that serves as the regular theme, especially frequent in the early levels, reminds me of the 70's experimental pop/rock band Klaatu from their first album titled 3:47 EST.  There's a familiar jazzy rhythm that's been around for ages used in another level.  I admire the upbeat techno music from the bonus stages.  Also the music from the vehicle bonus areas where you use the mine cart, submarine, helicopter or the drill bit (yes, a drill bit just to name a few) reminds me of the rhythm from \"Funky Town\", the early 80's disco tune by the band Lipps.  I LOVE the theme from level 4-1.  It's an oddly written waltz of some kind, but it's very clever/unusual in how it sounds and HIGHLY enjoyable.  World 6 even features Mike Oldfield-style world music with mandolins if you can believe that.  World 6 also has soothing Love Boat type jazz music.  The variety really is astounding.  The castle music is probably worse than the original however and the cave music is MUCH less creative than the original, but at least none of the music gets under my skin in this game.  Give the music time to grow on you like I have- what might sound like underdeveloped/half-written theme songs will probably grow on you gradually.Oh and without spoiling the Bowser fight, let's just say there's at least two major surprises.  I did NOT see either of them coming!Overall just play the regular Yoshi's Island.  I think most people will end up doing the same anyway since the reception so far seems to be that Yoshi's New Island is flawed and the majority of people are noticing this, thankfully.  Whereas the original Yoshi's Island looked like a game for the younger crowd but was actually challenging enough for any age group, Yoshi's New Island is most certainly designed for the kids.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2014"}

Yeah cheesy opener and even cheesier game. Yes I said it. I played through the first two and felt robbed by this version. Let me explain after getting to the end there was no reason to even go back and do anything that I felt I missed. In the first two you felt you had to get every bit of ammo cause it was scarce, plasmids were fun but help with the gameplay, they gave the gunfights depths, and the GUNS were amazing you could plant a person and then fry them with fire or lighting or send a swarm of bees after them. Yes this is something different maybe to DIFFERENT. It almost got away from being called Bioshock except for one tid bit that came at the end. Speaking of the end, it has got to be the worse explaination for a whole world or reason you have gone to that world to begin with. Don't get me wrong I'm not knocking the game as a whole compared to its siblings it can hold its own but its lacking that something that made the other Bioshocks have you going back for more. All I can say is that its a pretty (visual-wise) game, a loose but good storyline (one that is easily forgettable once finished) along with some guns and powers and that is it. Its just lacking whatever it was that had me going back to the first two games even almost years later.Sidenote: there are combos in the game just like the first two but unlike the first two these combos invole ONLY your vigors. Where there is very little to no environmental stuff. So if you want to set the world on fire literally you barely can do it. Where in the first two with water all around they still managed to set the place ablaze if you wanted too. Look I'm not saying there isn't a oilspill, a puddle of water, or even a barrel full of fireworks to set off. Just not enough of it to warrent a look for something like that. Don't bother with powering up your guns to much cause the power ups are not that effective, vigors are tap or trap. Which bring me to something I almost forgot, possesion which is a new one I like the most but again not alot of situations to use it at first then you can posses people which doesn't last to long but this is something that they should really have looked into more along with the others which are not bad just not really worth using when a shotgun blast can damn-near clear a room.So with that said overall the game is not bad just doesn't warrent a $60 buy. Plus the replay value is not there. I beat the first two many times and love them. This just feels like a cheap movie that you saw in the theater when you could have waited for it to come out on Blu-Ray.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2013"}

I wonder about people who claim to have played Halo 3 the first time through in 6 hours. It may be possible for someone who has already mastered Halo 1 and 2, but for the rest of us, it is possible to spend an hour or two just trying to get through one scene where you are almost out of ammo with no more laying around and tons of baddies rushing you, or where no amount of hits on an enemy seem to phase it/them and it takes a dozen or more attempts to figure out how to overcome it/them, especially those that require you to hit a particular part of an enemy or to attack it in a certain way.The worst feature of Halo 3 is the way it saves (or doesn't save). When you die, it reverts back to just before you died, so you might think that it has saved that point, but if you save-quit and restart, it goes back to an earlier point, making you refight the same tough battles. So if you are half way through a difficult mission, pause the game and leave it on if you must quit; otherwise, be prepared to redo the same fights you have just struggled through.And unlike other games, if you just turn off the Xbox, it does not auto-save, so you end up going back several scenes which you already spent a lot of time (and some luck) beating. Nor does it allow you to save the exact point you are at. Again, it just reverts back to the start of the scene/mission. So don't just turn off the Xbox without saving first.Frankly, the first time through the game was so hard that I couldn't enjoy it. I'm playing for fun, not to have to work so hard nor to take a dozen tries to make it through a scene. It wasn't as bad the second time through because of understanding how things work, but it was no 6-hour walk in the park, either.Another complaint about Halo 3 is the lack of sound control. Other games allow you to control the volume for music, sound effects, and speech separately, but not H3, so if you want to be able to hear the spoken instructions and hints, you have to put up with even louder weapons fire, explosions, etc., which others in the house may not appreciate. And turning on captions doesn't help that much because not all speech shows up in captions (even with All selectedc), plus a really stupid \"feature\" is that H3 does not save your captions setting, so you have to manually turn it on every time you turn on the game.Halo 3 is better than Mass Effect, which spends too much time on talking/reading, and Left4Dead, which is too repetitive, but not as much fun as GTA4, in my opinion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2008"}

I've played some awful titles based on TV Shows or Movies in my life, so I'm always wary when a new one is released. South Park: The Stick of Truth is a shining example of what a licensed title SHOULD be.The premise is essentially that the kids of South Park are participating in a town wide LARP (live action role playing game) and, as always, they're taking it way too seriously. You get to create your own character which is awesome and makes the game easier to play. Assigning you an existing character is a common pitfall of most licensed titles in my opinion. Throughout the game you will find a TON of items to customize your appearance. The gameplay is pretty standard RPG fair, but you're probably not interested in this title because you expect it to be some revolutionary RPG that turns the genre on its ear.The writing is exactly what you would expect from Matt and Trey. No punches were pulled. This isn't just a cash cow. They absolutely put the same effort into the writing of this game that they would in any South Park episode or movie. There's plenty of appearances and nods to previous episodes and running gags.Graphically, it is a South Park Episode. If someone didn't know you were playing the game, they would just assume you were watching an episode of South Park.Many have cited the length of the game as a negative. Keep in mind this is a, fairly, open world RPG. The game is what YOU make of it. Yeah, you can complete nothing but the story objectives and just plow through the game in around 10-12 hours. But you'll miss so many hilarious encounters and hidden things. Take your time, do the side quests, poke around, go in all the houses and you'll easily clock 25-30 hours out of the title AND you'll probably want to play it again afterwards.Overall, this is a gem and sets the standard for licensed titles.

RTW incorporates an in-depth strategic empire building experience with nerve racking amazing tactical combat. The best elements of the previous versions (Shogun: Total WarandMedieval: Total War) are enhanced and expanded.The province management has been improved so each is like a small economy. The population growth is complex and is effected by everything from overcrowding and disease to taxes and food supply. Money management is an essential part of the game and makes this a true strategy that requires careful judgment and planning not just mindless unit training. Sea trade has been modified a limited amount of trade routes and allows blockading specific ports and does not require ships on every part of the ocean to trade between cities.The Roman senate is an interesting addition to the game. It changes all the rules and makes politics more difficult. The senate also makes requests of your fraction for the better of Rome, but necessarily you. I like it better than the Catholic Church affect on Medieval Total War.In the battle map you will find the same great gameplay. Commanders are still very important and morale is more fragile than before. Tactics will have to change to meet new challenges. The sound of battle is even more intense and cavalry charges actually causes them victims to be tossed around. Another improvement is the movement of armies on the campaign map. It is no longer just move from one province to the next. You can now maneuver around the province to ambush armies and attack from multiple angles similar toKnights of Honor. Field of vision is now more important. Armies can hide in woods on the campaign map and troops can hide in different types of terrains in the tactical map.I could go into more details, but suffice it to say this is a great game. It is a step above and beyond Medieval Total War and beats all the others.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2008"}

The only problem is that sometimes the writing and voice recognition of numbers and words isn't so great. Besides that, the games like the math facts and sudoku are VERY addictive.

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

GOODWIN \"dragon678\"","summary":"Good long game.","reviewText":"Having just finished Doom 3, I really did enjoy the game. Here are some of the good and bad points:While the graphics were very good, I wouldn't say they were great. It was just too dark. What you could see of the creatures was very good. The outside and usually when you had to fight an end boss, it was always orangish red. Very little color or detail whihc for me kind of ruined what is supposed to be a great graphics engine.The sound effects for me were the best. The sound of th weapons was good, but walking around and hearing moaning and breathing all aorund you gave the game great atmosphere. Keot me on the edge of my seat.There were also too many time where creature would just warp in (why not warp them all in at the same time and obliterate the whole base?). It was very tiring clearing an area only to have something warp in behind you.Also, the flashlight was a pain going back and forth between the two. And the PDA system sucked too. You had to watch every video and listen to every audio file and read every e-mail or you might miss something to get extra ammo or shield or life. And most of those files were stupid. It was such a waste of time.The length of the game was very long for an FPS game. Took a ver long time to beat, alot of it seeemed repetitious. And the game was scary as that was there main goal in the first place. But the gane didn't keep me hooked to it. I found myself playing other games and leaving this one alone for for 7 or 8 days at a time.Compared to Half-Life 2, this game isn't even close. Half-Life 2 had much more outside terrain where in my opinion you could really see some great graphics. This was just too confined, dark, and not very colorful.Overall, I would reccommend this game as the graphics and sound were very good, the story was ok, but the scares and intensity were very good. I will try the MP when I play the expansion pack.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2005"}

The loss of interest can be due to ridiculous challenges (unfair) or lack of interest in the gameplay/story.  Demons Souls is the type of game in which you are dying most of the time and the gaming sesions are basically the same areas  while going to the point where you were killed, only to die again, and again.  As tedious as this may sound to some, its the complete opposite.  The game mechanics are so well balanced that the difficult challenges are fair.  If you dont pay attention every second, you get killed,if you get sloppy in combat, you get killed (therefore is your mistakes that kill you, not an unfair event).  Once you beat a demon boss you feel like you just aced an important issue in your day(while i consider gaming an important part of my life, it really is not , get it?).  When you see the boss for the first time your heart starts pumping, you know you are about to die, but how? how can i prevent it? all this thoughts racing through your mind as the game over screen appears, and the great thing is that as soon as you are killed, you can't wait to get back in the action and find out how to beat this boss.After playing Demons Souls, you will play other games with more skill and patience.  Demons Souls is a game that can take gamers to the next level (casual-->core-->hardcore) and no matter in which level you are, Demons Souls is something special.

I have purchased all lego games for my sons 7 & 11 including Lego Rock Band and I must say that so far this one has really impressed me. The very first ones made (Lego Batman) although game play was for kids wasn't too co-op friendly. You had to stay close to the other player ortherwise it was almost impossible to do anything. Got tired of hearing \"can you please move?\" :) They improved it with Lego Indiana Jones and we were in awe at the co-op play. Here was a lego game that actually gave the other player free reign in the game as well.Well Lego Batman 2 did not disappoint. The co-op play is awesome, the graphics actually looks a bit more polished as well and guess what? Our lego characters finally talk and they're funny to boot. My son especially loves playing with SuperMan since he flies. Batman has his BatMobile but he's still not as cool as superman. The one thing I can say about this game that may be different is that you now have to finally go around looking for your missions instead of them just being there like before.This is one game that you're not going to be done in day but then again no Lego game so far have you been able to completely finish in one day.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Patrick","summary":"Very fun","reviewText":"I was prepared to give this game 1 star because I played it for the first time today and I thought &quot;this game is stupidly easy!&quot; Then I realized the game was preset on &quot;very easy.&quot; So that explained things.

The colors are bright and vibrant and the characters are very well detailed. However, the pitfall to this game is the loose controls. They're too simple to be a good fighting game and too loose to be a good platformer. In this fighting game you're asked to sometimes perform some difficult jumping and, while that's not the toughest thing in the world to do, it should be a lot easier. Street Fighter it's not. The game is huge though and offers a lot to a single player or multiplayers. The game creators thought of everything. Even putting a mini Star Fox type game during the credits.

The update is purely graphical, but there isn't much of a need to refine the mechanics when they are so smooth.  Silky animations, hilarious voice acting (Slippy still makes me laugh and Falco is still the same smart-a** as he was before) and diverging paths make this game fun enough to continously play.  The other vehicle segments maybe could use a bit more playtime in the (hopeful) sequel of this game on the system.

{"product_name":"B000VJRU44","reviewerName":"E. David Swan","summary":"Impressive First Effort","reviewText":"As someone who's been working out for well over two decades I was skeptical whether a gym veteran like myself could actually get a decent workout using the WiiFit particularly since most of it is done standing on a small plastic platform several inches off the ground. By and large I was quite impressed by what Nintendo was able to do. I couldn't imagine how they could manage strength exercises but they did, although a vast majority focus on the abdominals and lower body.What I liked was how I was able to work the body in new ways particularly focusing on the core muscles and balance. My favorites were the yoga poses and balance exercises that included skiing and tightrope walking. When it comes to cardio I enjoyed the running where your Mii jogs around an imaginary island. In some ways the WiiFit opened my eyes to many other possibilities for the Wii including perhaps a full fledged running game. I know that the new Shawn White snowboarding game uses the balance pad apparently with considerable success. Even the modest skiing and snowboarding games on the WiiFit felt MUCH closer to actual skiing than anything you can simulate with a controller.Although the WiiFit is an excellent effort here are some suggestions to make the WiiFit even better.1. The WiiFit does a rather strange test to check your fitness that does nothing more than run you through a short balance test. It then determines your `real' age. Since the nanchuck attachment is almost totally unused by the WiiFit why not add a peripheral to check your heart rate and give a better test of endurance and conditioning?2. The WiiFit spends an excessive amount of time on non workout related filler. For instance it gives you a warning every single time an exercise comes up that may cause the user to lose balance. After each exercise it shows coins going into a piggy bank with the number of minutes you've banked, displays the ranking of your score and gives you a post exercise pep talk. It's all well and good but it breaks the momentum of your workout. My suggestion would be to allow users to create a routine and then work through that routine without the filler. The way it's set up it feels more like a series of mini games than an actual workout. Also, why not have some preset routines that focus on weak areas. It seems like this would be a small addition since the hard part of creating the exercises is already done.The main problems I see is that the WiiFit plays more like a toy than a legitimate workout for experienced athletes. On the other hand the gamelike feel may encourage beginners to keep with it. I highly doubt the WiiFit is going to cause a health revolution in the United States but as the first of its kind it's very well down.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2008"}

The new owner mode is fun and actually impacts your franchise's success (no money, no free agents...).  The graphics are great and the new tackling animation are for the most part pretty good.  HOWEVER there are some problems with this game; some can be fixed by adjusting the A.I. sliders, some can't:1.  Secondary/DB AI.  There are WAY too many interceptions (I once had 20 in a season.  With one player.)  Also, enemy CB's tend to be smarter and react faster than your CB, no matter how good yours may be.2.  Physics/Tackling: For the most part, Madden is quite realistic.  There are, however, numerous cases where the tackling defies physics, such as when a speeding 250lb FB is knocked BACKWARDS by a skinny, stationary CB, or when a defensive lineman runs down Michael Vick (yeah, right!).3.  Offensive line.  To perform halway decently on the ground (and in the air, too), you will need a superstar back and an all-pro cast of OL.  Simply put, running with most teams is quite tough.  I know the big guys are important, but Madden 2004 seems to overemphasize their importance.4.  Punting.  For some reason, even a top punter will have a tough time getting 45-50 yard punts.

Driv3r's detailed cities boast over 30-square miles of drivable roads!","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Not as good as Vice City, but different and REPLAY MODE!","reviewText":"Anybody who has played the Driver games and GTA will love Driv3r as the second best thing that has come out on PS2 yet. Although there are some game crashes (as with GTA:Vice City but a little more here) because the A.I. is so sophisticated. With so many possibilities because of the highly detailed and semi-destructible environments and certainly destructible vehicles - that to tune this game to perfection, without crashes would probably mean waiting for the PS3/XBOX2 to come out or the PC VERSION! There is no doubt - no other game has pushed the limits of a console gaming experience like Driv3r (PC Half-Life 2 rulez all). The Getaway had similar problems on release with its glitches but Driv3r is nothing like that horrible experience and is more akin to that cherry you got popped when you stuck the Vice City disk into the machine. Also please remember that if it was not for Driver 1 + 2 we would not have had the 3D GTA series!!!! GTA 3D was spawned by the Driver series!!!! Div3r has now developed nicely... It deserves it too... and to be honest I am looking forward to Driver 4.There are 3 full scale cities (Miami, Nice and Istanbul - all WOW! WOW! BIG WOW!) and I believe the detail is a little better than GTA: San Andreas, but not as big. Tanner has a choice of several weapons including a rocket launcher that virtually blows up everything except some buildings. There are, however, no sniper riffles or melee weapons! But the game story is different and these are never needed. A pair of binoculars with a zoom feature would not have gone amiss! Tanner can swim (spawning GTA: San Andreas aquatics!) So no more death by drowning - YOU can fly off a bridge into the water and swim ashore again! The vehicle destruction systems and world physics in this game are as good as they will get on the PS2/XBOX. If this thing hits the PC it will probably be awesome. So will San Andreas. The driving in Driv3r is as realistic as Grand Turismo and is not too far away from matching the graphics found in Need for Speed 3: Underground. There is a cool slow motion \"fun\" feature in the controller (L1+R1) that allows you to see crashes in slow-mo while still driving. There is very little blood in the game but that does not make it any less violent. The shootouts with the cops after a chase are first rate action sequences. Unlike the GTA series everything comes out of the blue and you will not second guess a thing. The A.I is that good.The replay and director mode are sublime. With Driver 1 + 2 you have spent hours creating endless little movies. If you liked that experience Driv3r will have you doing a recreation of the Steve McQueen Bullet car chase sequence in no time. Every conceivable camera angle and tracking shots are covered (with controllable cinematic motion blur!... Hell Yeah!)The missions themselves are each compelling, entertaining and present a level of realistic quality not seen before. This is as close as it gets to playing a movie on the XBOX/PS2. The free ride mode of course will allow you everlasting driving and mayhem across the 3 cities for the price of $50. You can also play various type chase/getaway/cross country/point to point/ scenarios.It has NO multiplayer which is a shame. I have wondered why they did not do this but then again this may be a problem with the PS2/XBOX engines. It is my understanding that San Andreas' Rockstar programmers could not do it either. I doubt we will ever see a 2 player game this rich in detail and game physics without better technology (In Grand Turismo you went around circuits and things did not blow up! and there where no cop chases and shootouts). Now and again the PS2/XBOX does stall at times even in the only single player mode. There is also no stats page like in GTA.There are tons of missions and you will spend a few days at them.... relentlessly. I can not quarrel about any of the little glitches that crop up now and again causing you to press reset on the console. To be honest the more I learned to control the game the less the glitches appeared (come on folks, they only happen now and again when you start learning the game). In fact I have not found a glitch in quite a long time (playing now 3 months +). The bottom line is that this is an evolution in driving game experience. Nothing will be the same after playing Driv3r.Pros:- The BEST game ever for the PS2. Better than Vice City.- Graphics are the best in any game for the PS2 so far. 3 gloriously rendered cities to do battle with.- The driving IS Grand Turismo.- The slo-mo fun feature is whacked out!- The shootouts and destruction on this scale and realism have not been seen before.- You can do virtually anything you want in the game.- The A.I is outstanding.- The car crash physics are like something NASA came up with.Cons:- Some glitches (jumping and control problems, going through walls sometimes, odd game crash).- Requires a greater deal of practice than you think before you fully come to grips with the Driv3r experience.- The shooting system may not be to everyone's style.- Character movement may appear sluggish at times (yet during playback it looks extremely realistic).- The height of realism impacts the cartoonish quality that GTA has.- You will die quicker in this game because you can be injured while driving.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2004"}

You basically have to save your game every two seconds because if you die, you start from the last save point.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem, because you would just save before a big battle.  But there are many times that you won't even know you're about to enter a big battle until it's too late.

Such as, when I used the \"hold position\" strategy to try and set up an ambush, then when I begin my conversation with the enemy, my party is just there for some reason.  It seems that you can't have conversations alone, the entire party must be present no matter where you actually positioned them.3)  One annoying glitch, but really a minor quibble.  One of my party members has a full face guard  and helmet on, but in every cutscene, his face is fully viewable.  It's like they only have one appearance for the cutscenes and they stick with it.  Just an annoying oversight.4)  The pre-set conversations happen no matter what spells you try, for example....I used the invisibility potion to sneak up to a group of mercenaries, but as soon as the cut scene was \"supposed\" to happen, it still did.  The dialogue began and paid the fact I was invisible absolutely no mind.  Takes a lot of the strategy away when things are so predetermined.5)  Most conversations go the way they're determined to go regardless of the answers you give.  You \"feel\" like your statements are influencing the other NPCs but it's only an illusion, because the talks ALWAYS end the same way regardless.Overall, very good game and worth playing.  I've put about 15 hours in so far and still like it. The combat system and use of weaponary is fairly well done, but it coudl've been a much better game if strategy played a larger role.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2010"}

Bennett \"Will 'vouge' For Food\"","summary":"Mario Falls Flat","reviewText":"After so many years it seems that the next true \"Mario\" game is \"Mario Galaxy\"...but in the meantime we have \"Super Paper Mario\".  Sort of a spin-off to the normal \"Paper Mario\" franchise, \"Super Paper Mario\" melts the platforming elements of Mario with an epic story of a classic RPG. And this is where it begins to fall flat.  An epic story this is not, as Mario must battle a cut-out count heck bent on destorying a dimension not even nearly related to the Mushroom Kingdom.  As this quasi story progress Mario adds allies to his roster and the story meanders forward.The controls are pretty basic and work well with the Wii's narrow controller.  The graphics are beautiful, colorful, and simple.  Each character is rendered wonderfully.  The animation is top notch and the \"classic\" sound effects are presented well.For the most part \"Super Paper Mario\" work great.  It's a must have for the Wii's relatively weak library.  Mario fans will enjoy the platforming elements mixed the RPG elements of leveling up.  One of the funnest parts of this games is the cooking aspect.  Players can collect ingredients and mix and match of make a truly inspiring mix of recipes.  What also works well is the classic mix of characters.  Nostagia is present as Nintendo offers up the ultimate mix of playable characters for the game--each one is duly represnted and equally fun.So what doesn't work for \"Super Paper Mario\".  What it lacks most is heart.  The games comes off cold and truly lacking that Mario magic.  The second half of the game feels rushed and Nintendo's desire to have Mario be the ultimate hero can leave some fans of the franchise wishing Bowser could save the day.  Power ups can be few and far between and the tie to \"Super Mario Bros\" is lost after the first level.  After that is takes a different turn with excessive dialouge and lack of spirit.It's easy to see why this title was moved from the Gamecube to the Wii.  As a Gamecube game is would be easliy overlooked but on the in-demand Wii it's most essential.  While not a bad games, \"Super Paper Mario\" is not a an amazing game.  Hopefully as the Wii begins to build a solid library Nintendo game re-visit this idea and great a title that is legendary.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2007"}

Gamers take up the Vampire Killer whip as Richter Belmont as they seek to destroy the maniacal Dracula once and for all in this pivotal piece of the ongoing Castlevania saga. Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles also includes the original Rondo of Blood and Symphony of the Night games, delivering incredible gameplay and value while updating two of the most beloved video games of all time for a new generation of gamers.","reviewerName":"JOHN SPANGLER \"Johnny Spang\"","summary":"Pretty much a Castlevania's fan dream come true, in the palm of your hand!","reviewText":"Castlevania is one of the most beloved games of all time in video game history. Way back in 1986 it made a big splash with it's introduction on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Since then the series has progressed, and here in 2008 the series is as popular as it was back in 1986. People who have never played the series, now might be a good time with this gem of a catch, and I personally consider it to be the best PSP game around at this point.Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles is a collection of 3 games. The first unlocked game you're available to play off the bat is Castlevania: Rondo of Blood. This game overlooked by many was never released in the U.S, and finally in the palm of your hand. It's an amazing game from all directions, including amazing graphics, tremendous sound, and awesome gameplay. If you never played it before, this game is strictly focuing on the action aspects of the series. Lots of jumping, slashing and running from enemies. No worries about using magic or RPG elements to slow the game down. This is do, or die for this vampire slashing game. This particular version of Rondo of Blood can be considered a remix of the original(also included). What's so great about it, Castlevania fans will recognize the remixed music brought back from many of the original Castlevania games including the orignal level theme from the original Castlevania on the NES!! A true fans dream of hearing this music all new and synthesized with the power of the PSP. Even better, when you unlock the levels, you can setup each level with each theme song you want to use for that particular level, now how cool is that???  All that with new updated graphics, sound, etc. Rondo's graphics are amazing, the 3D cutscenes look great and although the game is considered to be 2D like the classic Castlevania games, you can probalby say it's 2.5 with the 3D look it has while all the action is taking place.Word of warning, Rondo of Blood is an unbalanced game in difficulty with parts amazingly easy to get through and bouts of amazing difficulty levels that will frustrated casual gamers from the start. Replenishing energy is so sparse and the game makes you start levels over adds to the frustration. Even levels in the beginning will be test of ones patience because you're going to die, a lot. But the reward of getting through this game will be worth the price of admission because along your journey in Rondo, you can unlock probably the greatest game of all time, Symphony of the Night.When you finally manage to unlock Castlevania Symphony of the Night (which by the way, is no easy task) this game alone would have been worth the price you pay for the game, that's how good it is. Before I get into the game itself, I have to slap Konami across the face not allowing people to play this game right out of the box. And considering it's right on the cover as one of the game choices, I was a bit angry myself when I turned the game on and couldn't jump right into Symphony. If you need to know exactly how to unlock it, there is a nice video of a guy on the youtube that shows you the path, that's probably your best bet unless you want to waste time looking for it yourself, because I will tell you, I would have never found it without knowing first.Symphony of the Night orignally released in 1996 on the Playstation. It was kind of a rebirth for the series. Going back to it's roots with awesome action and incredible presentation.  Considered by many to also be the best orchestrated score for any video game, ever, is quite a statement. And considering the gameplay is almost as good, you can't really pass this game up.  What's so great about the game too is its' enormous size, it's a pretty long game, especially considering it's age, and once again, it's still considered by many to be the best adventure games ever. I actually didn't think the game would be awesome like it was on the PS1, boy was I wrong. The music, the graphics, the gameplay, it's all better on the PSP. Heck, they even redid the characters voices with all new dialogue.  You need to crank this baby up with some nice headphones, wow!  The game has an enormous amount of depth, the weapons, the magic, the things you can do seems unlimited and the amount of levels is astounding. Defintely take this game for those long road trips.If you're looking for a PSP game that is worth money, you really can't go wrong with Castlevania Chronicles, it's three great games in one. I personally bought the game for being able to play Symphony of the Night in the palm of my hand, but amazingly, Rondo is very very fun too as long as you can deal with it's difficulty spats. Great sound, great graphics, fast load times, and 3 games in one. Sound good to you? Me too.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2008"}

{"product_name":"PlayStation 3 40GB System","reviewerName":"D. Roberts","summary":"Just like the 80GB with these differences","reviewText":"See my 80GB review for a full and detailed look atht ePS3, it's capabilities and games. The 40GB was a very smart move for Sony. Let's first address what detracters will say is a problem. Lack of backward compatibility with PS2 titles. First, almost all people who own PS2 games currently, own a PS2. The disadvantage is they can't sell it off and have to support running two consoles. Of course, selling it won't net you the $100 price drop this PS3 gives you so financially it's still advantages. Some XBox owners will use this as a point to detract people from going with the PS3. They fail to mention that the XBox core edition also has no backward compatibility. In fact, it doesn't even have a hard drive. The XBox premium edition has somewhat poor backward compatibility as well.Really, people are buying PS3s to play PS3 games and watch high definition Blu-ray movies. For $399 you get two in one. Back to that in a second. What else in the 40GB missing? It's missing memory card readers. Rarely to people use these. Most people use USB and/or already have a USB memory card reader for their PC which will work fine for the PS3.It also has 2 USB slots instead for 4 but USB hubs are dirt cheap. Lastly, it uses a 65nm process instead of a 90nm meaning the chips are smaller and use less power. This is good.It has all the same movie and gaming capability, built in wireless internet, Blu-ray, HDMI 1.3, etc...So for $399 you get a high definition player and a next-gen console with wireless internet. The cost of this for the 360 would be:1. $349 for premium (20GB) 3602. $179 for HD-DVD player3. $100 for wireless internetTotal: $628That's expensive! If you don't need wireless internet you're still paying $528! You might as well go get a cheaper HD-DVD drive on Ebay but of course now you probably have multiple consoles and movie players.Of course the PS3 upscales regular DVDs to 1080p as well so you can get rid of your old DVD player.Some people will argue the games aren't there yet. See my 80GB review for details on that. Here's some quick examples of great games for the PS3 in stores now or released before the end of 2007:I've rated each game from 1-5. I've excluded many games and tried to focus on the games I like.1. Heavenly Sword (Exclusive to PS3) 4/5, incredible game, just too short.2. Warhawk (Exclusive to PS3) 5/53. Folklore (Exclusive to PS3) 4/54. Guitar Hero III 4/55. Eye of Judgement (Exclusive to PS3) 5/5 - Niche audience6. Haze (Exclusive to PS3) Not out yet7. Ratchet & Clank Future (Exclusive to PS3) 5/58. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune (Exclusive to PS3) Not out yet9. UT3 (Maybe for this year) (Timed exclusive to PS3) - only console version that supports PC mods, and mouse/keyboard10. Ghost Recon ADW2 5/511. Rainbow Vegas Six 5/512. Ninja Gaiden Sigma 5/513. Fight Night Round 3 5/514. Super Stardust HD 5/5 (Exclusive to PS3, downloadable under $10)15. Everyday Shooter 5/5 (Exclusive to PS3, downloadable under $10)16. Calling all Cars 4/5 (Exclusive to PS3, downloadable under $6)17. Super Puzzle Fighter HD Remix 4/518. Madden 08 4/519. NHL 2K8 4/520. NBA 2K8 5/521. MLB 07: The Show 4/5And there's a lot more to come. For instance Gran Turismo 5 Proglogue is free this year, with Gran Turismo 5 coming out next year. Little Big Planet may be the biggest and most innovative title since Mario and will be out in January/February time frame. And of course there's Metal Gear Solid 4.

Playing the game is like watching a movie, complete with a title sequence and music.There are the dungeons to explore, with multiple levels and various 'medals' to win by doing special feats on each level. You're given incentive to go back and replay them to achieve all of the special requirements.There are your weapons, which you can customize in various ways, build up into better levels and combine together. There are towns that have vanished that you have to rebuild, adding in an animal crossing/sim feel that lets you wander around the town you have built and admire your achievements.There are so many built in subgames that the game can literally keep you occupied for months. There is fishing. Sure, you say, you can fish in several other games. But in this fishing world, you can sell your fish. You can eat them. You can put them in your aquarium! Each fish is different. Now you can watch them interact with other fish, or even breed them!There's picture taking while you explore your world. But the snapshots aren't just used for decoration.

{"product_name":"B00APBF8A6","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"A very good re-release of a previously Japan only game ~","reviewText":"SMT Soul Hackers is a remake of a late 90s game that was released in Japan (on the Sega Saturn no less! Then on the Playstation) but Atlus was not allowed to localize the game in the US for some odd reason (not sure why Sony blocked them - but it was Sony that stood in the way - maybe Atlus still owed licensing fees for Ogre Battle (PS1 version) or something!).I'll just point out a few things that might make the decision to buy or pass easier for folks. For the record I am a long time Atlus fan and have enjoyed most of the SMT and Persona games over the years.This is 3-d style dungeon exploration, not top down. Encounter rates are high. Difficulty varies, but it is generally tough. Difficulty can be adjusted at any time in game (even in battle) - not a feature I used.  I cranked up the difficulty and subsequently had my --- handed to me on several occasions, especially bosses. Coercing demons to join is typically tougher than in other SMT and Persona titles.I did enjoy the story. The English voice acting is actually very good (more than I can say about Atelier Ayehsa...). Characters are all likable and interesting. Hitomi/Negissa is a favorite of course, but the rest of the Spookies are all very welcome additions to the cast. The main character is a non-speaking protagonist, similar to Chrono Trigger, Dragon Quest, and Mario RPG titles. It works. They do the voice acting thing where your character's name appears but they say something else out loud that makes sense (such as \"Oh he is here\" instead of \"Oh Max is here\").  The one problem I hear is that the mixing and audio quality varies.  So one person might be speaking in a normal volume level, the next person might be at a lower volume level.  This is not intentional, it's just a result of sloppy editing of the audio tracks.The characters and plot are what kept me interested. Battles are fast thankfully. Sometimes so fast that you can't really see what just happened! Leveling is quick and easy, so grinding isn't too much of a chore. And luckily demon fusing in this title is a lot of fun.So to sum up. Should you buy it? As a fan of the series I say yes wholeheartedly. It's a great story and a very fun game. Those not used to the 90s style RPGs might find it tedious at times, but if you played Persona 1, 2 or 3 you have a good idea of what to expect. Buy Etrian Odyssey IV first, or pre-order SMT IV first. Buy this if you love the series or if you are over Etrian Odyssey IV.One other note, the 3-d is pretty useless. It does work well on the exploration of 'dungeons' and such, but it's not necessary. It's not to the level of say, Etrian Odyssey IV.Pros:+ Great story+ Interesting characters+ Demon fusion!+ Music (I actually really liked it! Dated or not)+ Pre-order came with a short remastered soundtrack (6 songs I believe)Cons:- Dated (mainly in the graphics department - it is a pretty accurate remake of a 1997 game after all)- 3D not really necessary or welcome- Old school style might not appeal to all- Can get very difficult- No option for Japanese voice track (I'm not even sure one exists though!)Update:So later in the game you really must balance your magnetite. It depletes as you walk around while you have demons in your party. And then it costs a set amount to summon demons. This makes it very interesting for using demons. You can't just stack super strong demons and expect to not run out of points. Add to it that this is used to exchange for currency, that makes for a very interesting game balance. Or you can put all your demons back into the comp and then go to the sea ark and beat up weaker demons just with the humans in your party...Also, sometimes the game gets cheap. If your hero dies then it is instant game over. I highly recommend keeping him equipped with a death proof item. I got hit with that cheap a$$ death spell and instant kill game over. It also helps if you install the save anywhere function to your comp. It takes 2/5 blocks, but might be worth it.Some bosses are easy, some are cheap. Of note: the dolphin boss. I don't want to give anything away, but the game really doesn't make it clear what to do. Just keep hitting it with spells. It absorbs them. Eventually it just dies. Really funny and lame because I read that a lot of folks keep hitting it with normal attacks (3 - 10 damage) and you CAN kill it that way, but over about a 30 minute grind. But I feel that a lot of folks might get 'stuck' on that part. I don't want folks to drop the game because that battle is right in the middle of some of the best moments of the game. (Entering the paintings was very cool indeed!)Another interesting aspect is to continue to improve demon loyalty. The stronger demons tend to be less loyal and as such they won't listen to your commands. It's expensive, but worth it to build loyalty. It transfers over somewhat after a fusion as well. But it will save your butt on some tough boss battles if you can command your demons to use specific attacks. Also, befriending demons is tougher than in Persona 2. You don't really have the obvious choices like you did in the previous game. But with some comp installs you can improve linking chances.Again, I am not using the 3D and it's just fine. The 3D adds very little and if you plan on playing for a couple of hours per sitting, it's probably best to NOT have the 3D on (headaches and all).The game keeps impressing me, mainly because it's over 15 years old! I have it at four stars, but I might bump it up as it continues to improve. I think it's better than the remake of Persona 2 Innocent Sin for PSP.Update:The story as we progress towards the end of the game gets VERY interesting.  It's classic 90s style anime/manga/video game story.  It reminds me of a few of the sci-fi anime titles of that era.  Very high praise from me.  I also like that the characters are all interesting and enjoyable.  Nemissa doesn't just pine after the protagonist like many SMT female characters do.  This is a welcome respite.  The Vision Quest back stories add a lot.  You get the sense that you just stepped into this situation which has been building for awhile.  And getting to see the history of several of the principal villains as well as the former 'would be heroes' is also interesting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2013"}

This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Seppo Helava","summary":"A counterpoint to the effiusive praise this game gets.","reviewText":"I understand that many people love this game. I understand that people love the characters, the storyline, and the visually stunning cutscenes. There are even people who like the levelling up system, find the combat fascinating, and feel that the emotional development of the characters is well done and genuinely touching.I am not one of them.There are a lot of things wrong with Final Fantasy X. One of the first, and most noticable changes from previous Final Fantasies is the completely voiced dialogue. This lends itself to a more natural and immersive feel when done right, but FFX's dialogue is so poorly delivered, it is more cringe inducing than inspiring.As though the scriptwriters felt they had to come up with dialogue to match the lackluster acting, the storyline is one of the most blatantly obvious and hamfisted statements I've ever seen in any medium, poorly written children's books included. The main enemy is &quot;Sin.&quot; Please.In regards to the game itself, the gameplay consists almost entirely of walking towards a red dot. I understand that that statement may seem confusing, but on the &quot;map&quot; on screen, there is a red dot pointing to exactly where you need to go to progress in the story. Looking for secret items? Head exactly in the opposite direction from the red dot, and you're more than likely to find some helpful items. This is not &quot;gameplay.&quot; This is merely the illusion of interaction in between movies. Movies that will make you want to tear your ears off, the dialogue is so horrific.The combat system is rote RPG fare, with subtle alterations to the norm that don't end up making it a better or worse experience. Grandia II's combat system stomps all over it, and honestly, after Grandia II, no company, big or small, should be making &quot;turn-based&quot; RPG combat systems that are as dull as this one.The new level up and skill development system supposedly allows for character customization, but there's simply no point. Each character starts out on the grid in a position that has an optimal path, and the *only* benefit to diverging from that path is for the novelty of having your brawler actually be a weak spellcaster, and have no brawling abilities. Whee!I played about 25 hours of FFX, before finally realizing that not only would I never bother to finish this game, I found that I hated it. Hated it with a passion. The insipid storyline, the pathetically stupid main character, the horribly written relationship between the two leads, and the god-awful, ham-fisted, ridiculous writing makes this a game that I simply cannot recommend to anyone. The fact that it's as popular as it is is a strong statement about how much influence marketing and pretty graphics have on the game buying population as a whole, and it's not a statement that I could repeat here without it getting edited.I love videogames. I love RPG's. I love a quality story. I do not, however, have any love for Final Fantasy X.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"Chad E. Munn","summary":"It's Halo, 10 years later and 10 years copied","reviewText":"I remember the moment I put Halo into my Xbox drive 10 years ago. I remember that it was not the FIRST game I'd put into my shiny new Xbox (not really shiny- more matte black or dark green) but when I put Halo in and I ran around the desk of the Pillar of Autumn for the first time... then when I pulled that trigger on the pistol and The Duke rocked in my hands- WOW what a moment. 10 years later the game has returned with a new coat of paint on it and a new sound library to go with it. The memory is VERY strong and the feeling is spot on. The new Pistol sound it great, as is every other weapon... everything looks and sounds amazing on this game. More importantly though, the gameplay is just like I remember. That's a very, very good thing. It's not like I haven't played Halo in 10 years, I played through the game less than a year ago. It's that they actually remastered it to make it look brand new and coupled with the sound effects, it FEELS brand new yet perfectly familiar. Each level is painstakingly perfectly replicated yet vastly more beautiful. A simple touch of the button takes you back or forward and it's worth looking at both. The Library level is now, comically enough, one of the most beautiful in the game. The addition of the Terminals and Skulls is GREAT! So are the features they put in with Kinect. So called \"core gamers\" need to get a reality check and realize they can turn 13 years old and still play Kinect games. The fact that you can scan each item in the game to later check out in the library is cool, but the adjustments of the graphics (not just old and new, but brighter, darker, more or less contrast) on the fly is great! I recommend going darker with less contrast and seeing how cool each level looks! Overall this was a great blast from the past and it added 7 new levels to Reach's multiplayer experience. I will, without a doubt, play the whole game over a few times, but if I get distracted and move on to something else in between plays, this was still worth the price and then some.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"Alabaster Jones \"perpenhopher\"","summary":"Fun, but frustrating and a bit disappointing.","reviewText":"I'm an old school Nintendo fan.  The Legend of Zelda for NES came out when I was like 13, and I must have finished it a dozen times or more.  I've also played every Zelda game since (except for the gameboy ones), and I've always loved them.I love Twilight Princess too.  It's a great game.  It's probably got the best story of any of the Zelda games... or at least the way the story is presented is the best.  Unfortunately, there's a lot not to like about it.  First of all, there isn't much to do.  There are only 2 side quests that I can think of (collecting bugs and poes), and doing them isn't really the height of fun.  Also, I hated every second of being stuck as a wolf.  It was okay when I could switch back and forth, but way too much of the beginning of the game forces you to be the wolf, and the game is extremely limited when that happens.  Also, the targeting system isn't so good.  It's inconsistent at best, and downright broken at worst.  This was also kind of a problem with Ocarina of Time, but it's more noticeable here for some reason.This is a huge game world.  At completion, I had clocked in at 72 hours of play, and there were things I still hadn't done.  I really explored the hell out of this game, though, so if you're a fast run and gun type of player, you can probably beat it in 40 or so.  The thing is, for all that exploring, I didn't find much.  If I was lucky, I found a hidden cavern with rupees or possibly a heart piece, but mostly it's just empty space with a few scattered enemies.  The dungeons were really well made, with interesting puzzles, but most of the time, the special items you get from the dungeons will never be used once you've completed them.. and that's kind of a waste.So... I guess that my review is all over the place, but so is the gameplay in Twilight Princess.  One minute you'll be swearing that it's the best game ever, and the next minute you'll be bored stiff and ready to get somewhere interesting.I say it's worth it for the well told and tight story (a first for a Zelda game).  If you can look past the shortcomings, you'll have a lot of fun with it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002Z7BE24","reviewerName":"B. Mills","summary":"What RE5 should have been the first time around","reviewText":"First off, the gold is nice looking I guess, but I wish it was the same cover as the Japanese version and shipped as the original game in the first place.The cover is better in full cover, and it's kind of BS to re-release the game with the much superior DLC and then essential \"Mercenaries Mode\" and ask people to buy it again.  As its own game the so-called \"gold Box\" is a nice little package with a lot of content you'd EXPECT from an RE game (some of which was absent initially and made into DLC) and a worthy purchase for RE fans.I digress; I picked up this game for cheap when Game Crazy Liquidated (R.I.P.) and was hesitant...  My initial experience with RE5 wasn't the best.  I rented it ( i say rented but what I really did was buy it used from Gamestop and then return it within 7 days cause you know, screw them) and my friend did the same.I'm a long time RE fan with fond memories of RE1 on the PS1, he owed a N64 back then.The game was fun for a little while with a friend, because you can coordinate attacks, etc: \"you stand here I'll shoot the barrel\".  But he lost interest half way through because the story this time around isn't as good as in the past... and left with only an AI driven Shiva, I just called it quits.There's no coordinating with AI Shiva, and, she's dumb and a poor shot.  At times I withheld ammo from her on purpose.  To make matters worse the whole \"ownership of items\" issue in RE5 due to potential to play with a real person is abysmal.  When my friend left he took all \"his\" weapons\"  and all I had for Shiva was sniper-rifle, which she proceeded to shoot at enemies 3 feet away?As dumb as Shiva is, I guess as a means of realism, Chris is even DUMBER!  I guess all those roids took their toll (though he was never a brain-trust)  but man is it irritating to play with a comp, and playing with a random person feels weird, and doesn't work well in terms of them \"jumping in\" (they have to wait for a checkpoint, or I can restart, hooray)So as I said, I never finished the game, and then I got this one, but the save files used to be locked, so all my progress?  Lost.  They released a patch but my PS3 got YLOD before that so when I backed-up my hard-drive, those files were omitted, thanks Capcom!The save file thing and the aforementioned weapon ownership silliness is representative of an irritating attitude Dev's have about their games this gen... Why lock save files?  And who cares it an advanced player can share endgame guns with someone else (which they can't in RE5) I mean it's our foretime we choose to spend playing your game, what is the harm, remember back when games had cheat codes?  It's supposed to be recreation not an Olympic event, jeez!  This is the drawback to \"trophies\" but these people are taking those a little too seriously if you ask me.Once again I digress, I got this to play the DLC, so I had to rebeat the main game, and with the right motivation it was somewhat enjoyable, especially when I got to the new stuff.  But no puzzles or really anything other  than shooting zombies faces off was a disappointment for the main game but it did that well I suppose,  You won't hear any complaints out of me about the controls, they work for the game, end of story, you want gears of war or uncharted?  Go play them instead.The DLC which I finally unlocked... great stuff!  Puzzles, like more than one, and Jill is back (although a little fuglier than her RE3 role)  and most importantly the game is fun to play on your own in the DLC where the main game is clearly only meant for two actual people, who know each other by their real names.  The competitive mode is a lark for a bit.  It would have been nice if they also included the 2 dollar theme off PSN as part of the Gold Box.The Mercenaries mode is of course great just as it was in RE4.  I would give the 2 DLC packs a 4-5 for game play and I consider all the other stuff (which hI reiterated was NOT IN THE ORIGINAL&lt;have I said it enough?) the extra bump from up for the main score, so if they made the whole game as fun as the DLC, this might have been a 5-5 game.The DLC is like 3 hours total if you don't rush, but then again so was RE1 back in the day.  And its not as if the Main game doesn't have its moments.  It does, it just has, other moments.Overall, if you're a RE fan and you don't already own this game this is a good purchase even at $ 46.  If you haven't played the main game yet you might genuinely enjoy your first time through, and if you have a friend who is also interested, then you win!  The DLC is great, both of `em, the mansion is still a great setting.  Mercenaries is back in this edition, why it was absent in the original is beyond me.If you owe RE5 still,... that sucks, but sell it I guess and get this.  You could buy the stuff of the PSN but I personally hate not having the content on a disc and in this version (unlike the 360 version, FYI) this all there.  Having two PS3's ignite with the YLOD makes you appreciative of what you can physically own.If you just want at shoot `em up which you can play with a friend there are many, many better options.  But this time around this is a worthy Resident Evil for fans of the series!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2010"}
