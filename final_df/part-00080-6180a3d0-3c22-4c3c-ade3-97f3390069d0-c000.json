In the beginning of the game, we see our hero, Tal'Set, fighting nemesis Captain Tobias Bruckner in 1886 Texas. During the battle, a rift between their world and the Lost Lands opens and Tal'Set is sucked into it.Features and enhancements to this new installment in the Turok franchise include the groundbreaking Squad Dynamics System (SDS) for realistic enemy and allied squad AI, and an entirely new game engine built to take full advantage of the next-generation hardware platforms. All-new weapons including Variable Payload Cruise Missiles, Gravity Disrupter Beams, and the Swarm Bore--each with unique traits and damage. Flight sequences now enable players to soar through the skies on a winged pteranodon, and scripted event sequences bring the world to life with stunning detail.Turok: Evolutionfeatures 32 types of prehistoric and indigenous life rendered with frightening realism. The game is full of destructible objects and environments: shoot down trees over your enemies and collapse massive rock spires onto dinosaurs. The environments consist of lush, living jungles. Plants move as dinosaurs brush against them while trees sway in the wind. The game also includes stealth- and action-based gameplay directed by context-sensitive, mission-based sequences. Great care was also taken with the multiplayer modes, which were developed by a dedicated team of designers, programmers, and artists.","reviewerName":"Void Zero","summary":"Ultraviolence, but still just another first-person shooter","reviewText":"I rented this game because I was a huge fan of Turok 1 for the N-64.

For example, there is a weapon called the \"swarm bore,\" which is a gun attatchment that fires hundreds of tiny fast-spinning screws that bore into the enemies (lizardmen) flesh and tear off its limbs and head, with much blood and drill in bone and flesh sounds.

Sly 1 was a very fun, if not rather ordinary platform game that introduces gamers to the principle characters and builds their relationships. Sly 2, however, is enough of a reason to buy this entire collection. It shines. Everything that could have been imporved from the first installment was, and it even has a great replay value, as well as a much mor open-worlded feel. Rather than having a very linear, get the keys from beating each of the individual zones and then beat the boss feel of the first game (reminding me of Crash Bandicoot), Sly 2 actually had a larger world to roam and a grand hesit at the end of each zone to which all the previous quests had been leading towards.It is unfortunate, however, that Sly 3 did not provide the same sort of excitement that Sly 2 did. Not only did it take away the grand heist concept, but it unfortunately, for reasons that still ellude me, also removed the bottles, chests and treasures that made the first and second games so great. (Treasures were a great addition to SLy 2). The missing factor of these in Sly 3 almost makes me want to give the entire collection a 4-star rating, but I just loved Sly 2 too much to do so.

{"product_name":"B002I08DQI","reviewerName":"romevi","summary":"Just what I've been waiting for.","reviewText":"About a couple years ago I heard Nintendo was planning to dish out a black Wii.  I told myself I'd wait and hold off the white one, but what with all the great games already out, I couldn't resist.As with most Wii purchasers, I added another Wii remote (or \"Wiimote\") and Nunchuk.  The white's fine and all, but I really wanted the colored controllers as in the initial advertisements for Nintendo's Wii.Remember the lime green and red ones?Nevertheless, with two white controllers, I really didn't need any more.  That is, until the black one finally came out.I was initially baffled upon spotting the device because I hadn't heard anything about its release, and just happened to stumble upon some at my local Target.  I asked the nearby clerk, \"When did these come out?\" but he didn't know (apparently they came out a week prior to this review).  I rushed home and placed an order for the Wiimote and Nunchuk through Amazon.com (price-sensitive, I wanted the best deal; I could wait for Amazon.com to deliver).The black Wiimote feels and functions superbly.  Sure, it's the same as the white one albeit differently colored, but the blackness just gives it a supreme look--in my opinion, at least.  The front side with the majority of the buttons has a glossy finish, which emits a radiant shine, whilst the back side with the battery door has a matte look and feel.  The gloss may get dirty in the long run with fingerprints and skin oil, but for now it's staying shiny.  The black rubber jackets may eventually attract dust and lint, but, again, for now they're as clean as can be.Also, and this may just be the fact that it's still new, the speaker sounds louder and crisper than my other Wiimotes' speakers.  I thought I accidentally had it on a louder setting, but when I checked my Wii it was the same setting as my white ones, so I figured Nintendo improved the sound chips.In this package you get the Wiimote, MotionPlus, batteries, wrist strap and two rubber jackets--one to hold the MotionPlus and one to hold the Wiimote without (which I'm currently using for New Super Mario Bros. Wii).  Plus, you end up saving on this bundle over the white set, which can only be purchased separately as of this review.  On Amazon.com, you'll end saving $5 or so.All in all, it's the same ol' Wiimote, but in black.  It has that new, stiff button feel, which I personally like, but give it some time to break in.If you like black, opt for this controller.  This is my \"special\" one that no one but me will use; friends and family can use my other white ones.Oh, and Nintendo has some blue and pink bundles coming in February 2010 (but with white jackets and MotionPluses).EDIT 11/2/10As many of you might know, Nintendo is releasing an updated Wii Remote with MotionPlus built in, calling it Wii Remote Plus (http://www.amazon.com/Wii-Remote-Plus-Black-Nintendo/dp/B0045FCKVI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1288713131&sr;=8-1).  This review, published a year ago, was for the Wii Remote that came with an exterior MotionPlus, hence \"Bundle.\"I'll be getting the FlingSmash bundle that comes with a black Wii Remote Plus and reviewing that later.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"J.

{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"Adventure Fan","summary":"PS3 vs XBOX 360 Review of Dragon Age (Bioware's KOTOR 2)","reviewText":"The PS3 version is 17.3% better than the 360 version for 4.2 reasons.The 360 version is 13.7% better than the PS3 version for 2.4 reasons.Which version is better for you will be determined by your saving throw.NO SPOILERSI picked up both versions. I have two identical TVs, one bedroom, one den, both 50\" 1080p Panasonic G10s. For this review I put them side by side in the den, PS3 hooked up to one, 360 to the other, and choose the same origin story. I played the PS3, my wife played the 360, we both took the day off of work, a \"Bioware Holiday.\"BIOWAREThe Bioware RPG is one of my favorite video game genres. KOTOR 1 is still my favorite story. I played through Mass Effect 7 times. If you like Bioware, you will like Dragon Age.KOTOR 2 GRAPHICSBioware didn't make KOTOR 2. Until now. Dragon Age's graphics in general look like a last generation game, upconverted to HD. And why should they not? This game was 5 years in the making. Personally, if I could wave a magic wigglestick, I would magically wish the graphics into the year 2069, to play in my PS9 in my flying car. Unfortunately, I live in a condo that doesn't allow wigglesticking. So the choice is (A) Play the Bioware game. (B) Don't play the Bioware game. (C) Eat a cup cake. No one plays Bioware games for the graphics. You play for the CYOA storytelling.6 COMPLETE CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE NOVELSDragon Age is 10 Novels long. With 6 unique hero journeys. That can be twisted good or naughty. Warrior. Magic. Thief. Hybrid-Hybrid. Bioware is the only developer on the planet that makes this kind of beautiful uniqueness. This kind of awesomeness only comes around once every few years. Is this flavor of awesomeness perfect? No. Is amateur pornography perfect? No. Sometimes the pacing is off, or the dialogue excessive, but it gets the job done. The job is to experience a genuine human story--even if you're a lesbian elf. Dragon Age is fantastic video game storytelling. And better written than most fantasy novels.BLOOD SPLATTER OR POTPOURRI?I'm going to give Bioware the benefit of the doubt and believe that after battles my characters are splattered with blood and not potpourri. It's hard to tell visually, but I don't think they would censor themselves because this game is, like, totally Mature.GAY SEX - NO NUDITYMy wife likes lesbian threesomes. In books. In movies. In video games. In our kids' crayon drawings. She had never played a Bioware game before, but she likes role playing, and I told her Dragon Age has lesbian threesomes. Now, like with most video games, the depiction of sex isn't much more sophisticated visually than taking two barbie dolls and slapping them together. And there's no nudity. Because Bioware understands the genuine human condition--that people make the special love with their cloths on-- even if you're a bi-sexual dwarf. So if you like realisticly-sized breasts well-covered with beige felt bikinis, then you, my friend, are in for a PG-13 flavored treat.CASUAL VS HARDCOREMy wife played on easy, I played on normal. If you're an uber-genius, like me, who enjoys micromanagement, obscure RPG tactics, and general strategery... Then prepare to spend a lot of time, with the game paused, in clunky interface menus, because that's how real men play. That's how my grandpappy played his Bioware games, and his grandpappy before him, back when Bioware wasn't even Canadian, when they were still French, and the TVs had 11\" screens and were powered by fire--usually dry hickory. So if you want that kind of authentic gaming experiece, you can have it. But if you just want to enjoy the story, crank that menu to easy, slump back in the couch, and unbuckle your pants for a good time.PS3 VS 360Like with all games, it's a choice between graphics vs framerate. The PS3 has slightly better textures, color saturation, contrast level, resolution. The 360 is less pretty but smoother. The PS3 is the supermodel with arthritis. The 360 is a Ukrainian gymnast. You get to choose who you want to take to bed. But since all you're going to do in bed is talk... It's not such a big deal. Unless you put two 50\" plasmas right next to each other, you're not going to see the difference. I'm going to keep the PS3 version (because I like the controller better) and give my 360 copy to my favorite charity FVGFBO that provides fantastic video games for blind orphans.BUY IT, PLAY IT, LOVE IT* UPDATEI have played 115 hours, beaten the game twice, tried three of the six origin stories, watched every sex scene, won every topless hottie boss battle, and found \"teh secret nipplz.\" Personally, I feel this is the best Bioware game to date, the best written video game of all time, and a genuine evolution of the Bioware formula. For those of you fleeing in terror from Adult Content, know that, like in real life, bi-sexual dwarf sex is awkward, optional, and over in less than a minute. You can get through the whole game without \"going hairy.\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005Y4Q1","description":"Unreal II: The Awakeningreturns to the fascinating futuristic setting ofUnreal, first visited in 1998. Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach. They've made a solid shooter that takes full advantage of Epic's state-of-the-art graphics engine, but did nothing to set the shooter apart from the crowd.

While a lot of the weapons are kinda [weak] and could be done without, some of them are just plain cool.  I personally loved the very last weapon in the game although a bit overpowered.  Some of the weapons could have been more balanced but you certainly have a wide variety to choose from.I have heard mised things about the AI, while I didn't pay much attention to thne AI I've heard it is extremly good however it can't live up to its potential because of the restricting corridors that plague the game.This game is full of action and most of the time you won't have trouble finding where to go.

What is annoying is from time to time the camera's do odd things that make it difficult to do some moves.Its apparent that from the very beginning that you will have to remember a bunch of special moves. They do a good job building this training into the narrative of the story. What really doesn't work for me is the overall game play.Yes, it looks awesome, and is fantastic to go into the album covers of my youth. However, when it gets to the game play and doing moves with others that are supposed to assist you, it is often hard to pull off, not in a you suck and cant do it hard, but in the WHY WONT THIS WORK sort of way. I can abide some minor frustration game play, sometimes this game has more than tolerable issues with movement or fighting. This level of frustration ruins all of the fantastic artwork, open world, and even the excellent narration.About the narration:Jack Black is really funny with the context specific comments. He comes at this from the viewpoint of a monster roadie that has been stuck doing a boy band for some time. He is set free when he is killed by the massive stage set. Kind of weird; when did New Kids on the Block ever have a metal god as their stage set. Anyway, from this beginning Jack Black takes you on a journey that is both interesting and funny.It is a very well made game, just needs some help with the controls. This may be patched at some point so keep tuned, seems like it is fixable. As it stands its a pain in the buttocks.Pros:>> open world that is both fantastic, and \\|;;| a joy for us over 30 that can remember vividly the glory days of metal.>> Narration by Jack Black and guest appearances by Lemmy and Ozzy + more.>> Funny charactersCons:&lt;&lt; ControlIf your into metal and enjoy Jack Black and his humor then this is a fine game for your library.

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Saikron","summary":"Worrying Future of The Gaming Industry","reviewText":"First, the game is fundamentally pretty good and stays true to the old formula. It's about exploding demons with flashy skills. It's about starting out weak and then developing your character into a supernatural badass. Outside of the historical context, and without regard to the future of the industry, I would give it a solid 9/10. Two of Blizzard's main achievements are 1) that every character feels cool, and 2) progression is balanced so that you will get to max level by the end of Hell without having to repeat areas for experience. In spite of all of the bugs regarding performance on Mac, general AI and pathing fail, server downtime, auction house downtime (all of which are still ongoing as I edit this), I think the majority of young males would like this game and not care about the remainder of my thoughts below.I'm just worried that after the hype and commercial success of Diablo III - more publishers and developers will want to jump on the bandwagon. Diablo III and WoW are not perfect (in fact I would contend the latter sucks), but to some people \"perfect\" means they sell a lot of copies. WoW is still having a major negative impact on an interesting and innovative MMO coming out, because there is so much pressure to if not be a lot like WoW, to at least sell a lot of copies like WoW.I love action RPGs, but playing Diablo III has me convinced that Blizzard will fumble with patches, the obligatory expansion, and maybe a self degrading sequel because they started with the \"how can we make a ton of money off of Diablo\" foot and not the \"what would be something cool, new, and fun to do with the franchise\" foot. I'd rather see somebody take some real risks like Diablo and Ultima Online were in their time. Even Diablo II went as far as having server-side characters and a new set of active skills.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2012"}

I found myself either bored or frustrated half the time, and  didn't really find it scary either. I have considered the possibility that after so many years of console gaming, it is harder to find something fresh and something that really grabs me. The first person control works the best, but the 3rd person is somewhat of a nightmare, esp in the era of 'next-gen'. Hand to hand combat is awkward, and while this game is very beautiful to look at, it just wasn't enjoyable. In many ways it reminded me of Condemned 2, which was also very hit and miss; But that's just me. It should also be noted that I have little to no tolerance for a game that doesn't control well. Decent story and voice acting, but the visuals are the best thing this game has going for it. Playable, but a mixed experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2008"}

Here's the deal, it is definitely fun. I know people have talked about lots of problems , i have had none, maybe the new dlc improved the things that didn't work well. This game is different than most multilayer type of games, it is a bit more complex for 1 thing but not that bad. I was afraid there wouldn't be a lot to do. There is a lot . First you can do the challenges. You can play the campaign on your own, or go back and compete against others. The bots seem to be really quite good, so playing on your own is actually quite fun but a bit too easy on normal to me. There are messages to get that explain the story, i recommend that you do the campaign on own to get the story, if you play competitively you will need to go back to understand what's going on. The graphics in the game are okay, nothing close to crisis 2 for example. The parkour is fun, but could have been better. One additional button command would have made it really good. I do not like that you just push one button and you go where you want, you should have to do a timing jump or something like in mirror's edge.Other complaint is i wished people played campaign online as well and not just the competition mode. Anyway, game is really good and would be better if more people would play.The free dlc has really improved this game. For the price its a good buy.I will update in a few days.Update: Game is better than I thought. It is for sure the best multiplayer game I have played. Stay with it a wile and it gets better. The light build as an engineer is really fun. the park our is excellent with this build. Really fun game if you give it some time you will agree.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2011"}

Wells","summary":"Action Packed Shooter","reviewText":"I am a little surprised to see all the negative reviews surrounding the Medal of Honor relaunch title. I am having a blast playing it.  Overall, MOH stands up well next to the current reigning champs of the first-person shooter genre (Battlefield: Bad Company 2 & Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2).Single player campaign is great fun.  The graphics are intense.  Many fire-fights in urban environments which seems to intensify the experience: enemies can come from a number of directions and will shoot from neighboring buildings.  Tactics including cover and stealth are needed to deal with foes.  The story is in many ways better than the Call of Duty one because it IS grounded in the bloody reality of our current war in Afghanistan. I am not a \"expert\" gamer by any stretch of the imagination, but I found the single player campaign both fun and challenging on \"Normal.\"Multiplayer is also a blast.  I found lots of people online and never had to wait for a game.  There are several modes to play but nothing revolutionary as far as the modes (team, deathmatch, domination, etc).  The action is strong and here again I enjoyed it more than the Call of Duty online play.  In Call of Duty, I tend to just get killed as soon as I step out of the respawn area.  The maps in Medal of Honor are huge and detailed, so you have room to manuever towards objectives.  There are several classes, but none of them allow simply to run and gun. Taking cover, talking to team mates, and identifying objectives is key.Medal of Honor has a place right next to my Call of Duty games and Bad Company 2. My final estimation is that I enjoyed the Medal of Honor single player best out of all three games.  The Bad Company 2 multiplayer is still probably the best out of all three.  But I can see myself spending a solid number of hours playing Medal of Honor.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2010"}

As the Sorceror returns, Mickey makes a hasty exit after realizing that he has fouled up quite a few things and creating a monster resembling a gigantic ink blot.  Fast forward a little and Mickey is suddenly seized by the Ink Blot and cast into the world of nightmares, armed with a paint brush that can either create objects or destroy them with thinner.The paint brush is a very simple game mechanic, but clever.  There are levels within the game where you may need to selectively paint and THEN remove something in order to solve puzzles, unlock hidden items (and there are treasure troves to be had in unlockables!), etc.  Also, defeating enemies with paint thinner or making them friends by heaping generous amounts of paint on them have impacts later on that I won't spoil here.  Suffice it to say that decisions that you make have impacts.What I love most about this the game is the Disney memorabilia and attention to Disney lore.  Not many will be familiar with Oswald (who appears in the game), but he was Disney's first (and failed) character to attempt to grace the screen.  There are loads and loads of unlockables of Disney stuff that makes the Disney enthusiast in me fully appreciate the game not only for its gameplay, but for the rewards that it delivers.Some have complained about the camera during gameplay and I can honestly say that I haven't encountered the same issues.  There is a button to recenter the camera, as needed, and I find that utilizing that command from time-to-time is necessary and does not detract from gameplay whatsoever.  Admittedly, however, we did have issues with making the paint land where we want it to, but we never found ourselves wanting for paint as needed even with our trial-and-error moments.All in all, this is a solid effort from Disney/Junction Point that is full of whimsical adventure and rewards for those of us who truly love what started Disney off in the first place...one little mouse.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2010"}

Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"Technohead","summary":"I got 1 in white...","reviewText":"I got an original white 1 of these.

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"MurphysLaw","summary":"Good but not without flaws...","reviewText":"The atmosphere of 'Dante's Inferno' is truly stunning.  Far too many PS3 games have mediocre graphics but that certainly can not be said about this game. The attention to detail is just amazing.  A rich, saturated color palette, fine texture patterns and the amazing attention to detail is impressive. For the voice work, all of the characters do a good job but the script can be cheesy and the comments often seem misdirected.  Dante is the least likable character by far.  The sound effects throughout the game and most notably during battle are quite good. The music is also spot on.For the overall look, sound and atmosphere, this game succeeds.The game progresses as Dante works his way down through the different circles of Hell, each filled with grotesque, twisted souls and various creatures that usually drop in from out of nowhere to attack you.  Dante is armed with a rather wicked scythe that was wrestled from Death himself.  As for weaponry, it's nice to see something other than the old run-of-the-mill sword.  The game presents choices during gameplay...such as absolving or punishing a soul.  This allows you to level up as you collect experience and you have lots of choices as you progress. Your player can be balanced or lean more toward one side or the other depending on the choices you make.  This has a direct impact on your magic and weapon abilities however, some upgrades appear to be more gimicky than useful.The controls of the game are tight and intuitive.  The only complaint is while fighting, Dante seems to lunge around a lot.  I fell off quite a few cliffs during the course of battle.  Other than that, the controls were very responsive and moves and combos were easy to learn and master.  I enjoyed the ability to conquer and control the large creatures.  It was kind of like being Godzilla for a few minutes but the cumbersome, bulky creatures move very slowly and I sometimes found myself growing impatient especially when traveling longer distances.  Initially, there is a wide variety of demons/creatures though once you hit about the half way point, the creatures are the same, you'll just get more of them in a different combination. There are several difficulty levels but normal seems more like easy and once you determine how to most efficiently dispatch an enemy, you can zip right through most battles and challenges.  Playing a higher difficulty adds slightly to the play time only by making each creature require more hits before dying. Still, few battles pose much challenge and most times I was killed was due to a mistimed/mispositioned jump and not during the heat of battle.  The same is true for boss battles.The game is extremely linear. There are very few places to search or secret items to find as most are laid out directly in front of you. Even the puzzles are very straight-forward and often simplistic. It's quite clear what you are supposed to do so those looking for more challenging puzzles should look toward other games such as 'Darksiders'.  The game is also very short and can be completed in 10-12 hours.  Replay value is minimal.The story...well, it's certainly an interesting and unique approach.  Fighting your way through the depths of hell...I mean come on, talk about potential.  The problem is that you whip through each section so quickly that you often don't realize you've completed it til you see old Virgil glowing in front of you.  There is all of this build up as you approach a new level and then after one or two small battles and a few minor obstacles to overcome, that's it, you're done!Overall, its a good game but kind of a let down.  I would rent instead of buy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2010"}

For every one great stride the development team made they took two huge steps back somewhere else.  In trying to gather new audiences, they piss-off the old fans.  In order to appease the fans, they just confuse everyone.They highlights are high.  Albion is huge, bigger than ever, with more side quests and things to explore and caves to get lost in and many, many more enemies to face than Fable 2 (not more TYPES, just more spots to find the same old cast hanging around waiting to get killed).  The visuals are smooth and the textures are lovely.  Character animations are better than ever and the combat is downright sexy at times.  The NPC's wandering about are more of a challenge to win over, so they act less like a mob of lunatics when you wander by.  Some of the side quests are long and have multiple stages to them and unlock new areas and are INCREDIBLY satisfying.  And the use of a wardrobe and an armory -- where your weapons and clothing are laid out all pretty and neat and super accessibly -- is now solidified for me as the standard.  I know it appears in other games, but its fluidity and ease of use in Fable 3 are so good that anything less will be a step back in any game moving forward, ever.  One of my favorite things to do, as silly as it seems, was mix and match the different outfits to make all new ones and then playing with the color dyes.  The idea was introduced in Fable 2 but, if you remember, was a slow and bulky process.  It's streamlined and easy as pie in Fable 3.  Ditto the concept of \"living weapons\", the weapons that change shape and size as you get stronger in the game.  It's a bit of an unrefined process (they seem to just grab a random trait from you as you increase in skill) but is the beginnings of a stellar idea and another notch in the old \"things that are awesome\" belt.Sounds like a list of improvements you would expect moving from sequel to sequel, right?Well, then there's this...The dog works worse than Fable 2.  The \"breadcrumb\" trail is worse than Fable 2.  The expressions wheel is simply gone and now you get two (sometimes three! gasp!) ways to communicate with people.  The characters are completely forgettable: you won't find a single one half as memorable as freaking Barnum from Fable 2, despite the impressive voice acting talent they wrangled (Ben Kingsley!!!).  These are all such obvious and pathetic steps backward (aside from Ben Kingsley, that is) that I have to scratch my head and stare.  How?  Why?And then... oh and then...The story is the weakest of all three.  I know there were complaints about the \"unfinished\" quality of Fable 2's story line, but I had always seen it as a solid middle chapter: setting up pieces of a story so that Fable 3 could drive it all home with a satisfying conclusion.  That... doesn't happen at all.  Theresa and the spire and the events thereof get cursory appearances only.  None of the threads hinted about are followed up on and we've got this weak, weak tale of \"revolting\" against your tyrant brother who's thrown you out of the castle for no good damn reason at all.  And for all its talk about being an \"open\" game with \"choices\", Fable 3 is as linear as they come.  It holds your hand and moves you from place to place, giving you an arbitrary \"good\" or \"evil\" choice each time, before moving on with no real consequences or results.There's an incredibly compelling and surprising bit in the middle, in the desert, where things take a turn for the worse and you're left with a terrible and weighty choice to make but (without ::SPOILING:: too much) it ultimately has no effect on the rest of the story.  You THINK it will, but it won't.Sorry.This linear quality is most apparent in the last third of the game, after becoming King or Queen.  From this point out you are literally led by the hand from one event to the next, asked to make a choice (\"good\" or \"evil\", completely over-simplifying the implications of what you're deciding), the result of which has only an aesthetic effect on the rest of your journey.  The end is coming, one way or another, and you've got no power to stop or even alter it; no matter how well or awfully you treat people. The feeling is that of emptiness and straight up impotence.I'm being cruel, but that's because I wanted so much MORE!  Fable 3 is a fun trip, no doubt, but all of the conclusions are just... so underwhelming and unsatisfying.  I love Albion: I love the design, the sounds, the color palette, the mythos and, if you like these things too, there's a ton of fun to be had.  But Fable 3 is a game that is GUARANTEED to disappoint everyone who plays it at least a little bit.I'm NOT saying avoid it, not at all.  Play it, play the hell out of it, it deserves that much.  But be forewarned.  Maybe, just maybe, if you able to take it for what it is (more than I was) you'll enjoy the trip more.At this rate, though, I wonder if I'll even be able to play Fable 4... whatever that hot mess turns out to be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0009IX7K8","reviewerName":"Brian M. Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"","summary":"San Andreas--Fun on a Faultline","reviewText":"I've been aware of the *Grand Theft Auto* series from the beginning, but it took the controversial and revolutionary game play of the third outing to grab me. *GTA III* essentially stands as the beginning of an epic remake, and at last developer/publisher Rockstars bring out the conclusion. *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas* not only brings together the previous two titles, but realizes the world of the original. It's the best of the series--and a big bite to chew.San Andreas, like Vice City and Liberty City before, was one of three cities in the first *GTA*. Now it's a state of the union, and the child hood home of Carl \"CJ\" Johnson: once a proud member of the Grove Street Families gang alliance, now a buster living in the relative safety of Liberty. Then a phone call brings CJ back to the streets of Los Santos, San Andreas. His mother has joined his brother in the afterlife, the alliance has collapsed, and rival gangs threaten to flood the streets with base. Carl must not only prove to his surviving family and friends he's down for life, but must ultimately save life.This requires CJ to kill and destroy an awful lot. Not much has changed in the series on that end. But while the silent protagonist of *GTA III* was a cold-blooded mercenary to the end, and Tommy Vercetti was a sociopath who became kingpin of Vice City, CJ operates from a pirate's code of honor. His pride in family and gang contributes to the most ambitious and coherent story in the series. Major characters take a more compelling, frequent, and usually logical role than in previous installments. While *GTA III* and *IV* amounted to a succession of mercenary missions loosely bound by a drive for revenge, *San Andreas* weaves a number of plot threads through the length of the game, with story and missions mutually bound to each other.*San Andreas* suffers from a few snares though. My new DVD-RW drive successfully installed the game, but couldn't detect the disc whenever I tried to run it. Technical support insisted my firmware needed to be updated, but updates didn't help. My newer DVD-ROM drive likewise failed at first. Then tech support had me disable all Startup options in msconfig; only then could my ROM drive detect the disk, and not 100% of the time.  Finally, I discovered that disabling Drive Letter Access on my RW drive would allow my ROM drive to reliably read the disc. This hasn't prevented the occassional Blue Screen of Death, but otherwise I have not suffered the audio and video bugs reported by others. Such problems nevertheless spoil an otherwise clean record between my PC and Rockstar.So imagine my mood when I also discovered a significant control change from previous PC ports. The ability to mouse-look and strafe with the keyboard arrow keys seemed absent. Having only tinkered with the PS2 version, I didn't realize *GTA:SA* incorporated a weapon skill system. One must gain proficiency in a given weapon before CJ can strafe, while mouse-looking with a target reticule requires one to hold a lock-on key, though it's still easier for me than using a console gamepad.This being part of a simple reality check for the series. Unlike his predecessors, CJ can't just drive a Banshee or pick up an M4 like a professional. Practice make perfect: or rather improved control over vehicles and weapons through experience. CJ can also improve a wide range of attributes, including muscles, fat, respect, and sex appeal. Improvements unlock many abilities, like climbing walls, recruiting gang members, and picking up girlfriends-which in turn unlocks still more features. Skills and most abilities don't degrade, but CJ must continually exercise and eat to maintain feats like sprinting and swimming underwater. *GTA III* and *IV* tracked some use-based skills and abilities too, but with number V, the stat screens finally show exactly where CJ stands. The game gently and clearly reminds players of CJ's current condition. When a significant change happens, popups explain why it matters.And things matter here. Within an already epic series, *San Andreas* takes players on a 100 mission journey across three cities, five regions, and the communities and countryside in between. Layers of activity cover the landscape: CJ earns respect to recruit gang members to seize enemy turf to earn tribute to buy fancy clothes to impress girlfriends who grant CJ gifts to better complete his story missions... and so on. CJ has reoccurring, freeform missions and one-shot missions so linear they put the Brown Streak railroad to shame. Ya want stealth missions? Check. Shoot `em ups? Here. Car chases may apply. Dancing, swimming, trucking, racing, bicycle riding, sky diving, dating--even automotive mods and low rider hydraulic competitions. And if CJ needs to take a break, he can always find a basket ball, pool table--or even a video game.The only things missing are jet skis and skateboards. Come to think of it, the more the game adds, the more it seems to need. *GTA:SA* approaches being a comprehensive if simplistic world simulator. I want to see a fatigue meter as well as a breath meter. CJ should be able to buy ammunition instead of having to buy a whole new gun to replenish his ammo pool. Let's bring back convienence store robberies from Vice City. Perhaps players should have to start worrying about broken bones and rent... so long as it all remains fun.In the end, Rockstar has a hell of a PC title on their hands, in both a positive and a negative sense. It's an almost boredom-proof game, though the sheer size of the maps may become tedious and overwhelming to some. Yet the graphics and level design ensure the scope massively immerses me. So long as we can play around the bugs and software conflicts. Let's get some patches out so this doesn't have to be last word on this latest game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2005"}

Arguably, it was a very decent system that was reallt ahead of its time, and very revolutionary with how we play video games. Nevertheless, with the shadows of Playstation 2 lurking, Sega lost a lot of ground, and then became a software company, rather than a system company. As for Sonic, Sega's master sponsored mascot, he made a great pair of games from the Dreamcast. The launch pad, Sonic adventure was very challenging, and made a crossover toward its former rival Nintendo to bring the classic to the Gamecube.Sonic Adventure DX for the Nintendo Gamecube, is a real delight where Sonic, Tails and friends go all out with each of their battle to deal with the mega-headed mad scientist Dr. Robotnik. The game isn't much for fans who've played it on the Dreamcast, but for Gamecube players, it is worth a challenge. The graphics are very beautiful, and have been mastered nicely with this version. The worlds are beautiful whether it is the Casinopolis lights, or the Robotnik airship Sky Deck. Each character has a different challenge, which also adds a bit of bulk to the game. The manuverability also works very well, but is easy to build up on with practice, especially when you're playing charcters like Big the Cat, and Knuckles. This edition also has some great games from Sega's Game Gear days that are here from Sonic, which personally is a little more definitive than the recently conjured Sonic Gems Collection with greats like Sonic 1, Sonic Chaos, Sonic Drift 2, and the prequel Sonic Labyrinth of the Sonic 3-D Blast Genesis masterpiece to name a few.Sonic Adventure DX for the Nintendo Gamecube is a great video game for anybody who enjoys Sonic and his fast ways. This isn't as definitive for people who've conquered the Dreamcast version. But, the game is a absolute challenge for anybody who loves this speed devil.Graphics: B+Sound: A-Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+Overall: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2005"}

There were some glaring problems with Tools of Destruction; and I wondered how great of a game it would be if those issues were corrected. Well, A Crack in Time is pretty much Tools of Destruction on steroids; massive steroids. On the surface, it may seem like a easy baby game - but once you dig in, it's more than meets the eye.Combat - Fighting mechanics basically consist of the traditional hack n slash along with third person shooting. I would honestly consider this game to be a third person shooter because melee combat will become less and less effective as you proceed through the game. So, if you're not a fan of third person shooters, I'd recommended you stay away from this game because you're going to come away feeling extremely frustrated. Not that the shooting mechanics are 'lousy' or anything, it's just that you'll often have to hit moving targets while being in motion yourself, and that can get difficult sometimes. Overall, I'd consider the combat to be solid and much more challenging than it's predecessor, which is a good thing.Weapons - This is where the game sets itself apart from many other games. I don't recall the exact number, but you'll get a chance to use at least 10 different weapons throughout your journey. I'm far too dumb to try and tell you the name of each weapon, so I'll just give a brief overview. The weapon select menu is set up like a 'wheel', and you can just scroll around the wheel until you reach your desired choice. For those of you who've played [Prototype], you'll feel right at home. As you scroll around the wheel, the action stops so you won't have to worry about being beaten to a pulp while you change weapons *COUGHS transformers war for cybertron COUGHS* Sorry, my cough medicine must not be working... You'll be able to use bombs, land mines, missile launchers, shot-guns, rapid fire guns, spikes, disco balls, storm clouds, super soaker waterguns, etc (yes, I said super soaker water guns). Some Amazon reviewers claim that you can use the same weapon throughout the game and have no need for the others. I'm assuming I played a different version from them because I had to empty out the ammo in every single weapon just to get past some of the battles. So I guess I'm playing the \"I hate Leohlyon version\" of Ratchet and Clank.Enemies - There is not a HUGE variety of enemies, especially when compared to some other games. But, there's enough variety to keep you interested. You'll find some on the ground, while others will hover around overhead. When you first start off, you'll notice how easily the bad guys can be defeated. This had me concerned at first because that was one of my issues with Tools of Destruction, too easy. Thankfully the enemies got MUCH harder as I progressed through the game. In some cases, I actually died multiple times before progressing. I absolutely loved the boss battles! Each battle was different than the previous boss fight. You won't be able to hack n slash your way past one of these guys/gals because many of them move around pretty quickly. Be prepared to use every weapon at your disposal when fighting bosses. I may be a prisoner of the moment, but the final battle was one of the tougher battles I've encountered in a game NOT named God of War.Miscellaneous - I read about this being a very short game. Well, it took me about 20 hours to complete. In all fairness, I probably spent about 5 of those hours getting my butt kicked in something called 'arena battles'. Enough about my videogaming ineptitude, time to move on... Each planet I encountered was well put together and very nice to look at. Some of the environments were outdoors, while others placed you inside. Although the game did have side missions, they're really not worth it - I basically did the same thing over and over again. I usually try and complete all of the side missions in a game, but these were so bad that I couldn't do it. I also liked that I had a chance to play as Ratchet and Clank separately. I played a mission as Ratchet, then the next mission belonged to Clank, and so on; nice variety. Speaking of Clank, if you enjoy puzzles, you'll get a chance to indulge in some very complicated puzzles while playing as Clank. This was a great game, but I do have one gripe. I enjoyed this game the most when I had an AI companion like Qwark or even Azimuth helping me fight. I really wished that someone could have fought alongside me the entire game.I loved the game, and I thought it was much better than Tools of Destruction. If you thought Tools of Destruction was too easy, pick this game up because you'll be pleasantly surprised. Thanks for reading, Darksiders 2 awaits me!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2012"}

Last generation, they brought us new IP's such as Heavy Rain, Uncharted, Little Big Planet, Infamous, The Last of US, Beyond Two Souls, ModNation, Flow, Flower, and Journey.  In addition, they own some great franchises.  Although we haven't seen some in years, there were several notable ones such as God of War, Twisted Metal, SOCOM, and Killzone.Make a list and compare, Do you want to play Nintendo's Zelda, Metroid, Mario, Donkey Kong, Kirby, Fire Emblem, X, Super Smash Bros, and Mario Kart? Or, Microsoft's Halo, Gears of War, and Killer Instinct? Perhaps it's God of War, Uncharted, Infamous, Little Big Planet, Heavy Rain, Killzone, and ModNation games that mostly peak your interest.Since Sony is a Japanese company, they're likely to get some superb role playing games.  Persona and Ni No Kuni come to mind.Controller: It's fantastic and definitely an improvement over its predecessor.  This time around, it includes a speaker, touch pad, and an interactive light.  Nintendo holds the crown when it comes to the D-pad but Sony is a close second.  The analog sticks are further apart which is an improvement.I don't care if a console has Netflix or Pandora.

People couldn't adequately transition it to the console market and we received nothing but shoddy ports usually of awesome games on the PC.  Then came a company named Rare and two breakthrough games, Golden Eye and, later, Perfect Dark.  Both of them were made expressly for the console and worked wonders in getting a new market of people interested in FPSs.Now, we finally have a follow up in Perfect Dark Zero, after having heard whispers of it back on the Gamecube, the Xbox and now finally the 360.  I wanted to get a review out as soon as possible but decided early on I would give it more time before I made my final decision.  I'm glad I did.The game doesn't give you the best of first impressions.  The graphics are mostly impressive, but the level design in the first level is pretty boring.  It wasn't until the frantic pace of the 3rd level that I started thinking the game was interesting.  PDZ is a mixed bag of good and bad things.  There are times the single player portion frustrated me to no end.  In a couple levels where you have a companion, like when you are on the rooftops and your father is below, the game is a pain in the arse.  Having to not only protect yourself but baby-sit your father was incredibly frustrating.  Why a game that relies on using coverfire would put a character that not only doesn't use cover but also stands in front of the enemy fire is beyond me.What further aggravates some of the frustrations is the save feature.  The game requires you to beat each mission without dying.  Sure, there are some checkpoints filtered throughout each level but should you die, you start the checkpoint without any of the secondary missions completed, even if you completed them prior to dying.  A minor problem?  Not so if one of the secondary missions allows you to have better weapons later in the mission.  It requires you to never die.  I'm not even certain why they would include a checkpoint if it doesn't save your progress.The level design is also a mixed bag of great, exciting gameplay and shoddy design.  For every awesome level there is at least one that you will go \"meh\" at.  Trying to be stealthy can also be a problem.  I have played and love games like Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell and understand the concept of being hidden.  This game doesn't have a great stealth system.  In levels where you are encouraged to be stealthy, I found it easiest to just go in guns blazing because chances are someone will pull an alarm or see you regardless of how well you \"hide.\"The multiplayer is terrific in my opinion.  32 people are able to play at once and you can have some fantastic games going.  Can't find a lot of people but want to play more than with a couple people online?  No problem, add some bots.  The bots in this game are difficult and at higher difficulty levels will make you work for your kills.  Its fun making a team of players versus bots.  The customization of the matches also hearkens back to the original Perfect Dark.  There are a million and one ways to manipulate the online experience.  Its terrific.Some problems do remain, however.  I find that aiming is a bit more loose than what I'm used to and like.  Its sometimes hard to get a good shot and I've found I get more headshots in this game by accident than on purpose.  The individual balancing of the guns is a bit off, as well.  Some of the best settings to use, I've found, is the heavy weapon settings that give you machine guns and other spray type weapons.  Using the sniper function of non-automatic guns is a pain, but you can be unstoppable with the power of a zoomed in Super Dragon.  In the same way, pistols will always been weaker in games than an automatic weapon but sometimes it gets frustrating unloading clip after clip and not killing someone due to the bullets not doing much damage and the very loose aiming.  Stick with a machine gun setting, it will ramp up the game's enjoyment a ton.One old school gaming mechanic I don't like very much is the lack of a jumping ability.  Its not noticeable in the single player mission very much, but some of the multiplayer levels feel nerfed without that ability.  In the Desert level with the roofs that are close to one another, I want to be able to jump from one to the other.The graphics is both are usually very stunning.  There's a lot happening, the blur in the screen when you turn is handled well and the game is very shiny.  The physics engine is...interesting.  Seeing dead bodies try to do the splits post-life can be morbidly funny.  Watching them twist, roll end in very...weird...positions is a sad example of an engine that needed a little more fine-tuning.Perfect Dark Zero is a mixed bag.  On one hand, I'm not too fond of the single-player campaign (although playing it in Co-op online is a stroke of genius that needs to be used more often and makes it more enjoyable) but I really like the multiplayer.  The other big FPS released is Call of Duty 2 and it is a better experience than PDZ for me...if they could fix their multiplayer search/pary functions.  As it is, if you want to play with friends online and not a lot of nameless people, PDZ is better equipped to do so a lot easier and without heart ache at this point in time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2006"}
{"product_name":"B002673XJA","reviewerName":"GameMaker","summary":"Would have impressed 10 years ago","reviewText":"I really enjoy MMOs, but the ones I'm playing right now have grown stale, and being a trekkie I definitely looked forward to this game.  After playing it though, I am very very disappointed.Where do I start?  Lets start where the rubber meets the road: the gameplay.  It's awful.  Controlling the ships is an exercise in frustration, and the battles are really lackluster.  They seemingly drag on forever at a very leisurely pace.  On the ground, things are even worse.  Again very counter-intuitive controls and slow boring battles.The other area that sorely disappoints me is the \"Star Trek\"-iness of the game.  They really failed miserably to capture the whole \"what it would be like to be in that universe thing\".  I created an Engineer, but immediately the game had me treating people in the medical bay, conversing with aliens on the bridge, and a half hour into the game I was already piloting my own ship.  In other words, there was no sense at all that I was like \"Scotty\".  I simply had some \"bonuses\" to repair things *rolls eyes*.  It was very clear to me that they simply lazily plugged the tired old \"DPS, Tank, Healer, Mezzer\" forumula into this game, and gave it a new \"skin\".The other disappointing thing was the graphics and sound.  The graphics definitely remind me of games 10 years ago or more.  Although the graphics are rendered in a more modern resolution (filling up my big monitor and not looking stretched), they simply look bad, like they were done by strictly second rate artists.  The same goes for the sounds/music only more so.  Compared to other existing MMO's, the poor audio for this game is a bit shocking.All in all, I see no reason to play this game (so I no longer do).  Poor gameplay, they failed to capture the feel of the Star Trek universe and characters, and artistically this game is a mess.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2010"}

Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions.

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

It's another stone on the wall shooter in a generation full of them.Chest high walls, monotone color schemes and general broness about are all present.However, Binary Domain is a little more than it initially seems. Coming from the Yakuza team at Sega Japan, it's not really what you think of when you think of Japanese gaming and it's bits of eccentric design shine through. Lots of very interesting quirks, great animation work and enemy design, and a very fulfilling combat model round out what should by any rights be a sale-only type of title.While the console versions struggled in spots with frame rate and other technical bits the PC version is fairly easy to get up and running at full speed @ full HD.Let it be known though, this is very much a controller based game. If you're the type of person who has to have that very specific authenticity to things then, well, stop buying Japanese games. Works nicely on a controller, standard plug and play, yadda yadda.While it's a console port through and through, it's a solid one, and it'd be nice to get more Japanese games rolling here when they make sense (cough, Dragon's Dogma, cough), as it's rare with the differences in platform adoption and digital distribution from coast to coast.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2012"}

That's your cue to draw your sword and join the fray.","reviewerName":"S. Morales","summary":"Is and Is not an amazing game...","reviewText":"I must first start off this review by saying that I genuinly had a lot of fun playing Rygar on PS2. This sequal to the original NES classic holds up well in some departments, and fails in others, but nothing that would keep this game from well, being any less fun to play.Now let's start with the goods: The graphics. Yes, the graphics have to be the number 1 thing to mention first because they have got to be probably the most amazing things I've seen in a video game. Now, if you play this you may disagree with me because  a lot of the graphics seem more \"fantasy\" oriented then in a game like Metal Gear Solid, but talking in that point of view I stick with my previous statement. Rygar is created with the upmost detail and his movements flow very well, offering plenty of realism. The levels are monumental, everthing from shadows, to different auras of light are absolutely flawless and breathtaking. I swear some of the levels were just so vast and beautiful I couldn't help but just stare and say \"WHOOOOAHHH!\" This makes exploration in the game very fun. The controls in the game are also very crisp, responsive and variable. Using your diskarmor (you can knab 3 kinds) you will hack and slash you way through levels being able to use different combo's of moves to destroy your opponents. The diskarmor is truly one of the best and most fun weapons you will use in any video game available today. And third, the soundtrack consists of a very creative and enjoyable symphonic orchestrial type music almost to be able to match wits with Castlevania on PS1. Now, there are other things that make up a good game, like story, challenge, and creativity. This is where Rygar falls.When it comes to a good story, Rygar is pretty basic but still very tolerable. It's not very fun to follow, it's a little uncomprehendable and sometimes boring where you don't care for the cinematic sequences but just to get on with the action. You come across lot's of different writings which you pick up throughout the game, these are like memo's and such to those who are familiar with Resident Evil or Silent Hill games. You read these to figure out what actually happened to this ancient Greek world, who the bad guys are and what they are doing. Unfortunately for these, they're also not very interesting, and not very easy to follow, so you end up discarding the information as it doesn't seem relevent to the game as a whole. Another dissappointing aspect is the overall challenge in the game. It's too easy. Now, a lot of video games lately have been too easy for the simple fact that games that have too much challenge tend to turn off today's gamers and are seen as unmarketable, so this in turn makes a lot of games nowadays too easy, like this one. The enemies aren't very smart, as they will mostly dance around you and hit you about every 4 or 5 seconds and at the same time, take off very little energy. So all you need to kill these baddies is just the tapping of one of the attack buttons. This is dissappointing seeing as how the diskarmor is such an amazing, versitile weapon but seems never to have to be taken full advantage of. The first couple of bosses add some of a challenge but then as you go further, these guys just become so easy to kill it's almost laughable, it's just too hard to die. Something else that most gamers will find dissapointing is the game's length. I found to not be too long or too short but if you're a die-hard gamer looking for something that'll keep you busy for a while, don't look towards this one. One 5 day rental from this one and you'll most likely be done with it within the first 3 days. Those who don't have as much time on thier hands will find this game a decent length, but will ultimately be unsatisfied with how quickly they got to the end.Unfortunately due to these downfalls, I had to give this 3 stars, but I do HIGHLY recommemend a rental on this one as it is a whole lot of fun to play without any technical problems like controls to be frustrated with, and if you ignore the bland story and lack of challenge which don't ever hurt the gameplay as a whole.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2003"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Jason A.

Schultz","summary":"Out With a Bang","reviewText":"On November 15, 2002 the original Metroid Prime released and to great acclaim.  It was widely regarded that the series' first step into 3D was a very successful one and the game was loved.  I only rented it at first, never having played a Metroid game before, but soon fell in love with it.  About half way through the game I stopped and bought it.On November 15, 2004 Metroid Prime 2: Echoes went into stores with anticipation.  Sadly, it wasn't as good as the first in the series and received sales that matched its decline.  I bought it on release and enjoyed it, but it simply wasn't as good as the first in the series.On August 27, 2007 Metroid Prime 3: Corruption jumped onto the gaming scene.  It was much looked forward to by fans of the series and sported what was called \"the best control style ever made for a first-person-shooter.\"  I looked forward to it after playing the first two, but was somewhat skeptical.  It looked amazing, but I wondered. \"Did they turn my Metroid into a FPS?\"  It was said over and over that there was more emphasis on combat and shooting, but also that it was still Metroid.Two days after official release I got the game and realized after only fifteen minutes that this is what Metroid is supposed to be.  First of all--there's voice acting.  Don't worry, Samus doesn't talk, but everyone else does.  Personally I think it's a step forward.  The graphics are stunning and everything looks flat out amazing.  If you were waiting for good graphics on the Wii, well here they are.  These are, for now, the best on the console.  It might not have the power of a Halo or something like that, but it uses its graphical abilities in better ways.  Next is the control set-up.  Whoever said it was the best for a first person shooter wasn't lying and they weren't paid to say that.  You'll never want to play an FPS again with dual-analog.Now I have to say a few bad things.  First of all--the original Prime and even the sequel had these gigantic worlds to explore.  There were huge areas all inter-connected with doors or blockades you couldn't get past without a specific weapon and you never really knew what weapon that was.  But here... there are short paths and one-way areas where you have really no choice but to go forward.  And the Galactic Federation always seems to be telling you where to go over a headset.  It kind of breaks the silence and feels awkward.  Reminds me of the Navigation Rooms in Fusion.  Maybe I'm just over-analyzing...  Next: the game babies you too much.  Reach a door you can't open and when you scan it it says \"You don't have the upgrade needed to open that door.  A blast of extreme heat/cold/whatever might open it.\"  I don't like that.  It makes it too easy.The same thing goes for bosses.  If you scan one you'll basically be told exactly how to beat it.  Too easy.  Sure, the bosses pose some amount of challenge and can take a while to beat, but I like to figure stuff out.  Okay, last complaint: you'll get to places where you're constantly being shot at while you try to operate some levers or something and you'll get hit over and over and over again and when you've finally done with what you need to you'll see that you've only lost about one energy tank!  It's like their shots don't do anything!  Too easy.  I recommend you put it on professional mode if you want a real challenge.  Don't get me wrong--it's not a cakewalk, but it's not hard either.Okay, enough bad.  I love controlling the ship.  I love operating levers and stuff where it actually makes you turn the Nunchuck or Wiimote accordingly.  I love Hypermode.  I love rapid-firing the Plasma Beam.  I love the Sky Bridges and the Steam Lords and all the kooky robots.  I love not having Light and Dark worlds and not having to run around the world endlessly, though some wandering is good.  This is probably the best of all three Metroid Primes, but it doesn't come without minor flaws.  If you're a shooter fan you'll love it.  If you're a Metroid fan you'll love it.  If you're a video game fan you'll love it.  This is one of those games that anyone can enjoy and if you have a Wii there's really no excuse to not getting it.In closing, this is just an amazing game.  I wish there was more memorable music like Phendrana Drifts and Magmoor Caverns and the ship landing area of Prime 1 or like Torvus Bog or the opening theme of Prime 2, but I guess I can look past that.  It's a tad short as I completed it in just under fourteen and a half hours, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and it kept fast-paced.  I know I've said a few bad things about the game, but that's really just nit-picking.  This game is still amazing and worth every cent I paid for it.  Go out and buy it now.  If you don't have the money for it then go make the money because you should have this game.  I would make this review longer, but I'm going to go play Metroid now...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2007"}

I wasn't sure whether to get the DSi or the PSP and choose Nintendo because the battery life was longer. It's a choice I haven't regretted.My son plays with this system all the time. It was well worth the money.  The variety of games available for the system is top notch. It's nice that it can fit into my purse or his backpack when we're traveling.We haven't been able to get the online portion of the system working yet but I have to admit that we only tried a few times and I suspect it involves my wireless internet at home.A fun feature on the DSi is the camera.

Generally speaking, the side scrollers were difficult affairs...requiring you to practice for weeks and weeks on end, chipping away and learning each level and enemy movement pattern.  It took some work, but finally clearing a seemingly impossible level just felt so gratifying.Enter Ninja Gaiden Black for the Xbox.  Despite being in 3D with the usual next-gen eye candy, Team Ninja has somehow made this game play like the old 8 and 16 bit action classics of yesteryear.  That said, they make no apologies as to the game's difficulty.  It's hard, yes, but never really in a cheap way.  Observe and experiment and you'll no doubt see that a solution is always at hand to clear any given situation.  In essence, Ryu is the ultimate defensive master so use the block command often.Ninja Gaiden Black is a worthwhile addition to anyone's Xbox collection.  Those who own or have played the first NG installment may have some of the extras unlocked from the get go.  Those new to the series are in for a battle as just the main game is available to them at first with other stuff (like the new mission modes and arcade version of NG) being unlocked when certain conditions are met.  Either way, there's lots here to keep you playing for weeks if not months and the price is more than reasonable.  Give it a shot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2005"}

From there, the plot takes off in directions that are familiar to fans of the series.Some gamers have told me that this game was easy compared to the rest.

Without giving too much away, the game's final boss battle had me wondering (several times), \"How many times do I have to kill this guy?\"The third and fourth act of the final battle just seemed there because the creators wanted the game to be longer.

God of War II brought more of everything to the table, from gameplay to graphics.  Since God of War III represents the series' first entry into the PS3, a simple graphics upgrade would have been enough to set it apart from its predecessors...but the game designers were far from content to do just that.The God of War games are third-person and action-based.  In all of them you play Kratos, a mortal who made a deal with the gods, it all fell apart, and now he's out for bloody revenge.  You use various weapons and items to accomplish your goal, and as you go through the game you can choose which items to \"level up\" and make more powerful.  Just like God of War II, God of War III has more of everything.  Graphics are stunning.  The scale of massive, realistic environments and architecture is breathtaking.  Gameplay is improved and there are new weapons, techniques, and ways to balance your upgrades as you earn 'skill points' (power orbs).  This game was programmed from end to end for the PS3's hardware:  it has rich lighting, intricate textures, massive open levels, plenty of physics effects, and in case that wasn't enough, the developers have added the ability to tear apart and disembowel your opponents in the most hideously gory ways I have ever seen.  There are effects here that would make the Lord of the Rings movies seem dull and simple, and there is violence and gore to make Tarantino blush.  The grandeur of God of War III shows us that a movie might be a step down for Kratos.The storyline of God of War follows the same pattern as its predecessors:  Kratos lost everything, Kratos wants revenge, Kratos has to climb up the celestial ladder to get to the top.  Lest you think this leaves the battles as simplistic as the earlier titles, rest assured that on Normal difficulty, some battles can be a nightmare, and took me MANY tries to get through.There's one huge obstacle with a sequel like this one:  you earned a ton of amazing skills and powers in the last game--enough to kill a God of Olympus.  How could you start off the new title with all of that stuff and still be challenged?  God of War II handled this by taking away all of your powers, and I was worried that I'd be blown completely back to square one.  Instead, God of War III handles it well:  you lose a lot of your abilities, but still keep some of the most useful ones (for example, Icarus Wings).  As you progress through the game you will receive items that change the way you play (such as a bow & arrow or magic boots).  Suddenly, using your head and being creative get rewarded.  Without giving away too much:  there are parts of the game where the environment changes significantly, and moving around in it gets infinitely more interesting.  For example, you earn ways to find hidden goodies and you earn the ability to run along walls or move incredibly fast.All isn't perfect with God of War III.  If you pause the game, you may see a 2-3 second \"freeze\" before unpausing resumes.  I've seen Kratos do finishing moves in the middle of the air on an invisible enemy because his opponent died a few seconds ago.  These are fairly harmless.  Most frustrating is some inconsistency:  you're supposed to jump off a ledge, but you can only do so at one particular spot.  Or you're walking along a protected edge when you fall off for no apparent reason.  There's also a 'musical puzzle' a la Guitar Hero that was difficult to use and didn't really add anything to the game.  That said, if you were pleased with the other God of War titles, you will very much enjoy God of War III.  If you're new to the series, you couldn't have picked a more stunning place to start.BONUS TIP:  When you defeat Hades and swim the river Styx, don't go downstream right away.  Go upstream as far as you can, dive down to the bottom, and you will find a secret item that becomes unlocked when you beat the game.  Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2010"}

Despite some highs and lows, it's endured over the years. Finally, we're graced with a new Mortal Kombat. One that, basically, takes us back to the beginning with Raiden attempting to change the Present as he contacts his former self in attempt to save his fate at the hands of Shao Kahn. Although set directly after the events of Mortal Kombat Armageddon, this game focuses more on reliving the events of the first three Mortal Kombat games in the series.Although we've seen changes in Mortal Kombat before, this time around--it can,honestly, be said that Mortal Kombat is finally a legitimate competitive fighter. This change is brought about with the Super Gauge, which fills up as you give and recieve damage. It's divided into three segments. Three segments that you can use anyway you want to. Using one segment can enhance your character's special move. This is where alot of strategy comes into play with the game. You can also use it to break out of an opponent's combo or to unleash an x-ray attack. This can change things quite abit when in play. While the fighting is fast and furious, it's a little more deliberately paced than with previous games in the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

And a great bonus in addition to being fun is that it provides a fantastic cardio workout.The first impression was how easy to game was to use. Calibration is super easy just point once at the screen. Then when you are dancing you just hold the motion controller in your right hand and there are no buttons to push. When a song is going you have an icon in the middle showing you what to do and then video plays in the upper left-hand corner. While as a 40 something I knew some songs but not all, they are mostly well chosen and fun. I would have chosen a much different set of 40 but I ended up enjoying most of them.There is a cool feature that shows you from a scale of 1 to 3 how intense the song is going to be. You also get your choice of doing the whole song or part of the song. The eye camera captures video that you can play back, save, and or share on facebook. The eye also takes a few pictures during your dance.One of the things I LOVE about Everybody dance is how good a cardio workout it provides. Just dancing it provides a workout. But you also have a workout mode where you enter your weight and it keeps track of calories. You can choose the intensity of the workout and select various song combos. Really weight and strength training is easy to do. Pushups are great. So if I could find a good way to do cardio with the PS3 that would be a good thing. And Everybody dance does that.With two controllers you can have a 'dance off' and you can do party mode with up to 20 people. My wife and I have had a lot of good laughs watching each other and doing dance offs. Sony really put some thought behind creating a very easy to use game that just gets you right into having fun dancing and/or having a fun dance workout, with enjoyable sharing and video options. Highly recommended one of the better move games so far.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00004YRQA","description":"Building a better system from the ground up sometimes involves digging into even the most mundane components. Take memory cards, for instance. To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file. The 8 MB Memory Card allieviates that problem by organizing and storing files much more like a computer hard disk.","reviewerName":"N.

{"product_name":"B000069BD9","description":"Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancebrings theMortal Kombatseries a new 3-D fighting engine, adds tons of features and extras, and still offers up classic gameplay.This installment features a 3-D battle system that still manages to maintain a 2-D feel. For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings. The plentiful additional content offered with this title includes special movies ofThe Making ofDeadly Alliance andThe History ofMortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancesuccessfully reinvents the series by offering up a unique mix of improved graphics and stylized gameplay without compromising any of the features that made theMKseries popular over the years.--Carlos RodelaProsComplex gameplayRealistic 3-D graphicsHundreds of unlockable featuresConsWeak storylineUnbalanced combo system","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Mortal Kombat:Deadly Alliance raises the bar on MK..........","reviewText":"Depending on who you talk to, you'll find people who love/hate the series with a passion.

Taking cues from games such as Tekken, Virtua Fighter and Soul Calibur, they give you extras in this game that are well worth 'fighting' for(pardon the pun).

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

Even though Hail To The King was), that, as you all know, was disappointing. Then I waited for this game reviews to come.. EGM said it was really bad, IGN said it was average... \"Heck\", I said... I'm gonna buy it anyways!I'm glad I did, I'm glad I didn't listen to those critics! The game is awesome. I've been a fan of the Evil Dead Trilogy since I was a little kid and this game is what I've wanted... Of course it's not as good as the movies (if only Sam Raimi could be the game director, just like the Wachowsky brothers in Enter The Matrix...), but this is the Ash as you've always wanted. The funny yet tough guy, with all those one-liners! It's all in the game!The graphics are average, there's nothing to complain about them, but don't expect Final Fantasy X or Silent Hill 3 in here, buddies (even though the animations are unbelievable, so perfect)! The soundtrack is pretty good, classical songs, nothing to complain, even though they're not composed by Joseph LoDuca (the guy who composed the trilogy's soundtracks). Talking about sound, the voice acting is also a great thing... Mainly because Bruce Campbell (Ash in the trilogy) does the voice of Ash in the game, which makes the whole thing much better. The other voices are pretty good, and there are subtitles as they speak. You can control the camera though the analog sticks, so the camera is not a problem in here. There's a big variety of weapons (chainsaw does not need fuel, and that's a great thing). The camera-lock mode on an enemy is awesome too, because you can shoot backwards with your trusty boomstick (among other weapons such as pistols). There's no problem with controls after all, you'll learn them in the first five minutes of gameplay...So, you see, the game is highly entertaining if you are a fan of the trilogy... If you aren't, it will still be, but not as fun as if you were one, because you can finally control Ash in a very good game. It has six long levels thoughout the town of Dearborn, in Michigan - USA (now only in nowadays, there are also levels in the Civil War and in an Evil Dearborn). You can't forget that, as you finnish these levels, you unlock Arcade Modes, that have different missions, which makes the game challenge much more entertaining. Another thing: there are lots of hidden items throughout the game. Can you find them all? The coolest extra of all is here after you beat the first level. It is a video showing how the game was made, incluiding speeches of Bruce Campbell and the guys who made the game.The reason I do not give this game 5-stars is because it is not perfect... It's not a masterpiece, though it is a highly-entertaining game that deserves your attention. You could buy it even if it costed 50 bucks! But this game costs 20 bucks! THQ is almost \"giving\" this game to you, you can't miss this oppotunity! This is one of the best PS2 titles ever!If you want a game full of blood and gore (no game has more blood and gore than this one, believe me, as an expert gamer), with an amazing character, a great story, among other things... This is the game you've been looking for!If you want to play a game as Ash, forget about Hail To The King.

{"product_name":"B003GT8IL0","description":"","reviewerName":"Some Guy","summary":"Not bad, but not half as good as the first two","reviewText":"I have to admit I'm a bit torn about the 3rd installment of FEAR, and I'm a big fan of the first two.  I've just finished the single-player campaign as Point Man, but most of what I have to say will probably apply to co-op.  I'll admit that I haven't played through as Fattel yet, so I concede that I have no idea what the game is like if you play as him.On one hand, they've polished the gameplay to perfection.  Character movement is smooth and feels natural, and target assist helps you spray bullets a little less than the first two required.  The armored suit parts are fun (if a little short) and as with FEAR 2, help break up the pace.  Creeping around enclosed environments is fun, but a good old fashioned blow everything up mech segment is a nice way to give yourself the occasional reset.On the other hand, it's just not that interesting.  You end up back in the city that got the \"physic nuke\" from Alma in the last game, and it's crawling with crazed people who've been whacked in the head by the Alma bomb.  Sadly, unlike the interesting and weird soldiers and warped entities from the first two, the people in this one basically act like rabid zombies.  So, most of the game feels like a mix of gunfights against conventional soldiers and a rabid axe-wielding zombie hunt.  The weapons are less interesting, too, although the duel-wield, full-auto pistols are way cool and better than similar guns in any other game.The scare factor goes way down, although unlike some critics, the Alma-pops-up-outta-nowhere-then-vanishes moments are always fun to me.  But that's it.  This isn't really creepy the way the first two were.  And the enemy AI is almost TOO good.  The level of difficulty is ramped way up, and you get mobbed by soldiers a lot more than before.  Whereas in the first two you might find yourself facing a dozen enemies, it was almost always in an enclosed space like a large office or cellar, with plenty of opportunity to pick them off.  Now they throw a dozen soldiers at you within an open plaza or yard that, yes, has plenty of cover opportunities; but you get flanked so quickly and often that cover doesn't do much good.  Or, along with a dozen soldiers coming from all directions, they throw an enemy mech at you along with them.  A shame, really, because the new cover system is simple and works well.  And this game badly suffers from \"alternate universe grenade syndrome.\"  Yours suck, yet the constant hailstorm of enemy grenades (and they throw a LOT of grenades in this) are near-fatal.To sum up, FEAR 3 plays like a missed opportunity.  They did polish what needed polishing, but the stuff that made you say out loud \"oh, cool!\", like the ash people in the street in FEAR 2 that puffed away when you touched them, is completely absent.  FEAR has become a by-the-numbers shooter with a good story and controls, but nothing worthwhile to add for atmosphere or enemies.  And, for a FPS junkie like myself who's played dozens, it's, well, kinda hard!  And I'm playing on \"recruit.\"  Barely surviving an overly-frantic gunfight really isn't as fun or satisfying as more moderately paced action.  You finish, the screen a red haze, and just feel relieved that you made it, not satisfied that you did a good job.I knew FEAR 2 would be hard to follow up, and I'm sad to say they failed to live up to it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

Once you got the hang of it, you could move through it and dig deeply into the story and make the choices that made the game so amazing.  It had it all, fighting, potions, magic, sex, choices, and a wonderful quirkiness.I simply could not wait for Witcher 2.  I pre ordered pretty early on, and (rare for me at least) counted down the days when it would be released.  Now for my thoughts.....World and Environment:Just beautiful and immersive.  You FEEL like you are in the place.  The scenery and artwork are amazing, deep and remarkable.  Details abound, with stuff laying around all over the place.  There are zillions of NPCs to talk to, and tons of missions to take on.  Unfortunately, where Witcher 1 was a massive world that was about as non linear as it comes, Witcher 2 has TOO MANY boundaries.  There are just too many places you can't go, and it becomes tiring to navigate.  The map system is absolutely terrible, bordering on useless.  And sometimes, you can wander around for an hour and end up back where you started.  Just awfulControls and Gameplay:A MAJOR step backwards, sideways and downhill.  What was a quirky yet predictable system for swordplay and inventory management in the first installment, has now become painful and tiring.  I'm all for a hard and challenging game, but something is terribly awry here.  Controls are just non responsive much of the time, which results in you dying over and over again, because the keys don't do what you need them to do, or they do random things (Darksiders PC did this too, and made a fun game tiring).First of all, when the game begins it is absolutely beyond difficult.  You just die over and over again.  I would expect the difficulty to ramp up as you level up, but here its the opposite.  Makes continuing really painful.  I had to stop and do something else, as it was so annoying, it made me either mad or bummed out.Next, in general while part of the swordplay has been improved, moving fighting modes to mouse buttons for example, it is pretty unpredictable.  Also, the whole potion issue, which is an integral part of fighting now has to be done WELL AHEAD of the fighting, which is totally dumb.  Its idiotic because you never know when enemies will appear, so how can you plan.  Just dumb.  What were they thinking.Also, while loot from fighting has been moved to a small brown pouch, you either can't find the pouch because of the very brown environment, or if its in a woodsy area, you simply can't find it at all, because you need to be nearly on top of it to find it.  In Witcher 1, you could find loot from a reasonable distance, now, you need to be on top of it.  Timewasting and annoying.Another completely stupid thing are traps.  When you wander around woods for example, there are traps all over the place, which wound you, but DON'T wound or kill enemies, NPCs or monsters.  Huh?  There's one place in a lake area, where there are bandits living.  Their house is surrounded by 20 traps or so.  If you try to get to them, you get hurt over and over again, but the enemies step right through them and nothing happens.  If they follow you into the traps, you get hurt but they don't.  Crazy and frustrating.Inventory management is radically changed, not entirely for the best, but not terrible either.  It is nicely organized, and you now have a weight approach to maximum stuff, versus total slots like in Witcher 1.  Either way is fine, but finding stuff now is painful in inventory because you have to page through 20 categories.  Books and recipes are now even more bizarre, where you MUST have some basic things just to play, but no where to find them.  While the mission narratives try and clue you in, if you don't know where to get a book or a recipe, you're hosed and wander around like a moron for hours.Witcher 2 adds Crafting, which is ok, but not necessary.  You go to craftsmen to make things, but none of them is particularly meaningful, other than the silver Witchers sword.  Crafting is not a bad addition, but not needed.Navigation and organization:This is where the game went absolutely downhill.  Navigation and maps are now almost completely useless.  Most RPGs, including Witcher 1, point you in some direction for your mission.  You have at least a CLUE as to where you need to go.  In Witcher 2, what feels like 90% of the missions have ZERO directions and locations on the large map.  So you wander around for hours looking for a fight.  And the mini map is completely useless too, as it has no directional reference (ie North, etc).  Completely worthless.  Combine this with the severe linearity of most of the game, and you are constantly running into barriers and having to go around obstacles, and ending back where you started.  Ouch!Organization has gone downhill too.  Where in Witcher 1, you could bound between your Journal, Map, Inventory, etc on 1 screen, now you can't.  One of the nice things about the Witcher 1 approach, is you could see what missions were near you, by selecting one, and seeing where you needed to go on the map.  Now, not only can't you do that, but the map doesn't tell you anything anyway.  I'm befuddled over this one.Conclusion:So far, this game is a profound disappointment in many ways.  I love the story, the characters, the political intrigue, and the setting.  But I just deplore the gameplay and mechanics.  I don't mind dying in games, and each game has its quirks that you need to learn to deal with.  Witcher 1 was very unique and a bit hard to get into when it first was released.  You had to stick with it to get the addiction point, but once there, it was awesome.  I have many hours into Witcher 2, and I'm just struggling to connect with the gameplay.  I can only play for an hour or so, sometimes less, as its so painful.  I don't mind the harder swordplay, but the navigation, the linearity, the obtuse nature of so much of it just makes it a bad experience.The good news is that CD Projekt is VERY responsive and listens to their fans and customers.  Witcher 1 received a total game changing (and improving) update/patch a while after it was released, which made playing it even more pleasurable.  I hope they do the same with Witcher 2.

Your A.I. partner, while he generally didn't perform that poorly when it came to performing first aid on me he didn't always make good decisions, standing in an area where he could easily get shot(and standing between me and the enemies shooting at him so I can't cover him I might add) instead of stopping to kill the enemies shooting him he will keep on with his fruitless endeavor until you're both dead.  Secondly, the friggin' parachute is almost impossible to control.  The second level has an area where you parachute through a canyon and I was only able to get through it on easy mode and that wasn't so much a matter of getting through as of surviving getting slammed against the rocks.  Thirdly, the game is kind of short, but in a way this helps the story as every level helps move the plot along.  Still, a few 'filler' levels would have been okay.  A few levels where Rios and Salem weren't arguing about some conspiracy.  The game play can be a little erratic when you get close.  It's surprisingly easy to miss people at point blank range and then they toss you to the ground and shot you.But on to the good, this game has quite an impressive arsenal of weapons which is cool.  Being able to upgrade your weapons is also a neat feature.  Going back through the game a second time with a full arsenal of gold plated diamond studded is quite fun.  I enjoyed ordering my partner around once I figured out what the heck I was doing.  Having my partner hold his ground while I swoop behind the enemy and take them out is awesome (when it works)  On the flipside when you try holding the aggro and then order your partner to advance it tends to not go so well, as he doesn't always kill as efficiently as a human would.  When he would advance is when he got into trouble, he would sometimes wander out too far and get shot and then I would have to dive into a hail of bullets to retrieve him.  In general though if you make smart decisions and keep your partner out of the red mode he shouldn't die too much.  The overkill mode and back to back are fun for some over the top action.  Being able to plow through people like ther are standing still is quite the rush.  I thought this was quite a fun game.P.S.  What is the deal with the deal with the language?  I don't mind a little swearing but this game is a bit much.  As Troy McClure said at Krusty's funeral(random Simpson's reference) 'it get's a little blue'.\"'F--k O?'

Let's just get that out of the way right now. I found it was too short, the gameplay too straightforward and repetitive, the characters too sticky-sweet and friendly, and the visuals completely lacking for a first wave next-gen title. Where it did shine was in the gameplay, although even that had a few hiccups, and in the occasional character and level designs. It was, generally, a really fun game to play, but you had to be willing to ignore a few bugs and completely shut your brain off during the storytelling sequences, which were yanked right out of a Saturday morning cartoon show. I felt like I was playing something marketed toward seven year olds, and that worked to put me off of the package as a whole.That seems to have been a frustration heard by the developers at Naughty Dog a time or two, as well, as it's precisely that image that's confronted and shed like an old skin within the first five minutes of the sequel. They even played off of that old vibe by totally cheesing up the opening moments of Jak II, only to hurl the cast into an entirely different, deeper, darker, more mature-themed universe before the player hits button one. Where you wouldn't be surprised to see the Easter Bunny stashing eggs behind a bush or a unicorn prancing by in the bright, obnoxious world of the original game, the setting of Jak II is more along the lines of Blade Runner.It's a cold, dark, repressed new world, complete with downtrodden, defeated city residents and a stuffy, filthy rich ruling class. Nothing that hasn't been seen in the realm of gaming before, but also a complete about-face for the series... and the immediate improvements you'll notice are more than just environmental. Though the entire cast of heroes returns from the first game, (albeit mildly altered and scarred by their experiences in this new world) an entire platoon of darker, grimacing new faces is there to join them and, strangely, don't seem out of place or at odds alongside the more innocent characters from chapter numero uno. What's more, the visuals are much better realized, most of the blips in the gameplay have been ironed out, and the experience as a whole feels twice as deep. In short, my immediate impressions were universally goodThe mission-based system of objectives from the first title has returned for round two, and remains your only true means of progressing through the main story, although it's been revamped and improved to function a little more easily within the broader scope of this large new world. Where the first game was divided into a half-dozen themed chapters, with no overlapping missions in between, Jak II's basic structure feels a lot more like the games in the Grand Theft Auto legacy. The entire story takes place in one enormous city, with Jak taking instructions from a few key characters spread around the map, and involves frequent backtracking and re-explorations of familiar locales.Perhaps the most noteworthy change from part one to part two is Jak's occasional Incredible Hulk-like transformation from heroic humanoid to killer albino rabbit, seemingly implanted during his years under the knife at that evil military lab. After absorbing enough dark eco from the bodies of fallen enemies, (and, naturally, accepting a gentle prodding from the player) he grows white fur, develops sharp black nails, dark black eyes and a penchant for hurling purple lightning at anyone in the remote vicinity. After a short period, Jak returns to his normal state and things pick up where they left off. In action, it's a quick way to get yourself out of a tough spot, and if you build up your dark eco and save it for just such a moment, you'll step out of the smoke feeling like an action hero.Also worth noting is the sudden introduction of gunplay and weaponry to the series, which was lacking entirely from the previous chapter. It goes hand-in-hand with the coming of age of the characters and the story, as well as with the tone of the new environment, but was actually pretty shocking to see after the simple punches and kicks of the first game. One of the characters you'll wind up accepting missions for is actually a weapons smuggler, and your association with him leads to bigger and louder toys as the yarn spins longer. They're somewhat cumbersome and underthought, just as the vehicles were in the last game, and though they play a much bigger part in the overall story than the bird and scooter did in The Precursor Legacy, their inclusion leaves something to be desired and overall they felt clunky and unnecessary.The flaws in the previous game's control scheme have been addressed and largely ironed out here, leading to a much more enjoyable, less distracting in-game experience. You'll occasionally run into an undetected double-jump, which was a huge issue in chapter one, but it's a much less common occurrance, and the issues with ledge detection and Jak's refusal to grab onto some cliffs after a death-defying leap have been completely erased from the picture. I did continue to notice some problems with out-of-bounds areas that were somewhat bothersome: if you try to leap up to an off-limits zone, Jak will go into this strange floating crouch and slide around as though he were on ice until his feet touch solid ground again. The idea in itself wouldn't really be so bad if that disembodied slide didn't have such a penchant for hurling you off into a bottomless pit.One of my major gripes about the first title was with the graphics, which I perceived to be lacking, especially for an early next-gen title. When the PS2 and Xbox were first released, it seemed that everyone set out to impress, to flex the new hardware's muscle, and The Precursor Legacy looked like the nerdy guy who gets sand kicked in his face at the beach. In this area, the sequel provides a much better showing. The characters, who were primarily lumpy and dull representations of a truly gorgeous original design, are much more finely detailed this go-around. Eyeballs have the right glint to them, skin doesn't look like it's wrapped around a pile of rocks, and clothing is finely textured and well done. The environments are suitably decayed so as to meet the vibe put out by the story, but to also not lose touch with the fact that this is supposed to be a somewhat cartoony setting. Even more exciting, HD output is supported with beautiful results, although the option to turn it on is buried deep within the options menu and is turned off by default every time the game loadsOf the game's vital components, only the audio leaves much to be desired. While the voice acting work is usually in the \"good to very good\" range, with a few characters in particular standing out from the pack, the in-game soundtrack is extremely dull, not to mention maddeningly repetitive. For the main cityscape, where you'll spend about three quarters of the game moving from zone to zone, point to point, to only have a single, minute-long looping theme, is beyond inexcusable. It's downright lazy.In all, I came away feeling much more impressed with this sequel than I expected to be, considering the quality of its predecessor. It is in every way a successful step forward from the ideas and executions that came before: the graphics have improved boundlessly, the controls have been nearly perfected, the characters have grown and developed of their own accord, and the difficulty has gone up considerably. This is a much, much deeper, more involved game than The Precursor Legacy ever could've been, and earns special marks by not only shifting the series into a more contemporary, interesting setting, but by doing so in a way that also makes the first game seem a lot more intriguing and thought-out than it ever really was. There's still room for improvement here, which means I'm expecting a lot out of Jak III, but this is in many ways the Empire Strikes Back of this trilogy. Dark, and in many instances utterly hopeless, but a much better tale than the first, with a better cast, better effects, more variety and a great open-ended story that leaves plenty of room for expansion in the threequel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2006"}

The biggest gripe regarding the previous 2 offerings was that the game was too hard. The learning curve was steep. It made the game hard to get into. This version -- while similar -- is easier and more welcoming than those before it.Roster: There's one thing that no one will deny regarding this game -- the licensed roster is huge and accurately resembles it's stars! Biggest roster of any MMA game ever, including the lower weight classes -- not featured in previous UFC Undisputed's (since UFC/WEC had not merged as of then). One negative -- Overeem & Nick Diaz have to be obtained via pre-order codes & Facebook contests/DLC. Companies continue to milk consumers:(Presentation: Overall, the content in this game seems endless. The game has tons of game modes (career and online) and now features PRIDE (yes, head stomping!). To me, that is huge since it takes you out of the Octagon and into the ring where many UFC stars became famous (ie. Liddell, Rampage, Hendo, Silva, Gracie, etc.). The graphics look great -- from player models, crowds, etc.Gameplay: At the start of the game, one can pick Amateur Controls or Pro Controls. For those looking for a less daunting scheme, Amateur controls is a welcomed edition. This mode will even teach you controls as you're playing (ie. about to do a takedown or a submission). The submission controls have also changed for the better with a sort-of mini-game (Octagon shaped gauge). Create a Fighter is average at best -- most characters look similar. Career mode is improved -- it focuses on fighting, not time wasting tasks and allows you to use a Roster fighter if desired.Overall: 9/10. THQ took their time and you'll feel like you got your money's worth (on content alone). For those who've played the previous versions, you'll feel as if THQ listened to you and improved the game. Having played them and EA Sports MMA, I like this one the best.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2012"}

One thing that was odd is that she played VP on my pro system and when hooked up to the HDMI at 1080p it looked far superior than any of the old systems that i use to have. Sure they looked great but the new system looked more colorful and vibrant than any i had seen, i work on computers so i read into to things, sometime a little to deep. Well, i noticed when i went to play PURE and RE5 on the arcade version(with my hard drive on it), that on the same TV at 1080p it was fuzzy and the colors didnt look nearly as sharp. First i thought it was just me, or my eyes, well come to find out after reading on a website a LOT of the arcade versions still have the older Falcon chipset in them, even ones made in 09!! It went on to say you may notice a difference on many HDTVs at certain resolutions that pictures may be dull, or colors may look washed out due to this fact. Afterwards it stated that the new jasper chipset not only fixes the RROD problem but also the HDMI output has been improved and modified for better picture quality on all new HDTVs. Never had i heard of such a thing but its true, so if you get an arcade version, you may wanna remember that, i would say 90% of people wouldnt notice any difference while hard core gamers like myself could see if largely. Still a great system either way, i still dont trust it 100% though.

Since it came out in 2007, it has re-shaped the way Nintendo has delivered its favorite pint-sized plumber. The game really delivered in a whole new dimensiion by showcasing Mario in Zero-G with more excitement and challenges than you could definitely imagine. Now with all that hype Super Mario Galaxy 2 has finally came out and fans all over want even more of their Mario mayhem in spades, but the question is that does the sequel lose any of the formula that made Super Mario Galaxy so superb. The answer is absolutely no, it just simply adds more challenge and more mayhem to it.Super Mario Galaxy 2 is definitely one of the must-own games of 2010 that really is worth the money that is spent on. The game takes on new challenges as Mario is again sent into space trying to rescue Peach from the clutches of Bowser, accept this time the challenges are more extreme as Mario faces new worlds from a intergalatic Giant World, to tougher foes than before like Peewee Pirhana and king-sized Bullet Bills, all the way to a even more challenging Giant-sized Bowser that is even larger and fiercer than before. But Mario isn't alone in this game to face them. He has Yoshi as well in this game, and the use of Yoshi here is well worth the effort as you control him and Mario in levels that are beautiful and bolder than before.There are also new power-ups here too from the cloud suit, where as you jump you can make clouds become simple platforms to help you on your quest which can help you earn those extra stars, and the Rock suit that can make you Invincible as you can easily smash your way through foes and rocks to uncover hidden star bits. that'll help you earn lives as well as defeat harsher enemies. Yoshi as well has some tasty power-ups like the blimp fruit which makes hime float on air and help you get to certain platforms you couldn't do alone, the bulb fruit which helps you see certain levels that might dissapear when you're in the spooky levels of the ghouls and Boos and levels that might be spooky in the night, and the dash pepper which makes Yoshi move like a speed demon through to help you try to race your way around the extra Zero-G madness.The graphics are absolutely amazing through the game, and picks up nicely where the original Super Mario Galaxy has left off. The control also is strong here, with the aid of Yoshi as well, as it is easy to manuver with him as he can easily swallow Bullet Bills and Pirhana plants that'll help you on your quest, and spit them out at other goombas and lakitus that won't take no for an answer. The music though does bring back at times classic melodies from past Super Mario Brothers titles like the first Super Mario Galaxy did, but remains as epic to appease the hard core Mario fan. Nevertheless, the fun here is absolutely well-worth the effort from each and every level with new challenges and mayhem that is sure to keep your Wii plugged in for days on end.All in all, if you're a owner of the Nintendo Wii and you've loved the original Super Mario Galaxy, than I absolutely recommend Super Mario Galaxy 2 as a great addition to your Wii library. It really does the job where any Mario game really should, and is a real treat for the gamer in all of us. I really love this game from the moment I've seen it and laid eyes on the madness, and trust me you'll not even be dissapointed with it either. It is well-worth the wait and Super Mario Galaxy 2 delivers from start to finish on the fun.Graphics: ASound: A 1/2-Control: AFun & Enjoyment: AOverall: A","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2010"}

The realism in the boxer models is rather impressive.We know that the XBox 360 has great graphics, but looking at the characters in many other games, you might think that human beings were made out of plastic. When you see the characters here, they look *real*. Their skin has pores and imperfections.On to the game. You get to customize your character both physically and skill-wise. You can make a small, quick hispanic, or a large, bulky, strong-punching dark skinned fighter. You can alter the hair style, tattoos, and much more. As you earn money, you can also buy new trainers and customize your skills further.Your main career path is a mix of training and choosing contracts to fight. In training mode it's a series of standard button-pushing games that in some cases are just reflexes, but in other cases are actual combo practicing that serve you well in the ring. The training increases specific skills, so you can further customize your character by deciding how to train.In the fight, it is of course you against a given character. There are varying levels of difficulty and we found that they did a good job of providing fun gameplay for different types of players. The beginner levels were good - although sometimes challenging - for a person who had never played this sort of game before. The higher levels of difficulty meant you really had to focus on what you were doing and land the combos to win.Your character has a variety of fighting styles to choose from, and you can buy more - including taunts. You can even play as historic characters if you want, including staging fantastic fight pair-ups that would have been fascinating to watch in real life, if we had a time machine to get people into the same ring.The in-fight graphics were pretty slick. If you hit someone in the head, a spurt of blood came out of their mouth. Characters had definite personalities - some were arrogant, some were hesitant as they entered the ring. When a really solid punch was landed, time \"slowed down\" a bit as adrenaline kicked in. Most people in real danger situations know how this happens.There were a few down sides here. One, the training mini-games can get a bit repetitive. I would have liked to see more variety. You can skip them if you want, just accepting a \"medium\" level of skill increase. Also, you choose a \"nickname\" that the announcers refer to you by during the game. This is a neat idea, but it gets to be a bit much when they use it all the time.Also, the commercialism in this game is just WAY over the top. There are Burger King displays all over creation. There are promotional items left and right. I realize that sports TV can be like that sometime - but you watch the TV show for free. They are paying their fees with that advertising. With Fight Night, I've already shelled out a lot of money to play the game. I didn't spend all that money to watch a multi-hour long commercial for Burger King.  It certainly didn't make me want to go out and eat Burger King food - if anything it made me pretty annoyed with them, and unlikely to visit them in the future.So in general, I thought the game was great, but that the \"environment\" you have to play in was really annoying. I would almost pay extra money for some sort of a cheat code / hack to replace all of those ads with blank space. Maybe they'll let me download that from XBox Live in the near future.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2006"}

The characters seem a little more childish than other final fantasys, but dont let that drive you away.  You play as several characters and go through there lives including zidane, a thief that has a monkey tail and the hots for the princess, vivi, a cute shy mage who tries the entire game to discover his origins.  Princess Garnet, a princess with the power to summon all powerful eidolons, Steiner, the princess's knight in shining armor...sort of, as well as many others.  It is a classic turn based rpg.  There are so many things to love about this game.  The music for one, is so beautiful, i actually have the soundtrack and i can play some on the piano, ive never fell in love with the music of a video game like this one...especially the piece \"loss of me\".  Also there are tons of little items to find all over the land which makes you want to explore.  Many rpgs nowadays have great graphics such as when you enter a house but its just for looks theres nothing to find...not so with this game.  You also have a sidequest where you can collect cards and battle others in the game to win cards...kinda like pokemon or yugioh.  You have a tons of cool weapons and armor to get throughout the game and theres plenty of awesome abilities to learn and plenty of sidequests to complete so it will take you quite a while to complete this game.  It has a very intense story and the cutscenes are amazing and very captivating.  The story is amazing...you start out in what is like a medieval setting and towards the end you end up on another planet and you go all the way to the end of the universe even.  This is a great game for anyone who loves rpgs.  So if you havent played this one, GET IT!! You wont be disappointed","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2010"}

The rebellion's only hope is a mysterious young hero riding a dragon. In aerial-combat action gamePanzer Dragoon Orta, you are that hero, and you'll employ multiple weapons and dragon powers against a variety of enemies. The game features unlockable subquests, that allow you to play the game from the enemy's perspective, and a branching story line with unique encounters.","reviewerName":"ACEMAN1 \"HERE TO PISS YOU OFF\"","summary":"ONE OF THE BEST FANTASY ADVENTURES ON THE XBOX YOU NEVER PLAYED  9.5 OUT OF 10","reviewText":"I really don't understand why Sega only really ever does re-releases for Genesis titles, yet completely ignores the plethora of classic Saturn and Dreamcast titles which are waiting patiently to be resurrected. The Panzer Dragoon series was born on the Saturn, and did not resurface again until Orta was released on the Xbox, where the franchise, along with many others would die. This game did not sell very well, mostly over the fact it was hardcore, and did not reach out to a broader Xbox audience. And let's be honest, this game is bust-your-balls hard.WHAT THE GAME IS: The follow-up to the classic Saturn franchise comes to life on the Xbox as a gorgeous on-rails shooter (Think Starfox, if you don't know what I mean by that term), with an amazing fantasy backdrop that no Xbox game can compare to. You play as a girl named Orta who was kept imprisoned because she is basically a war machine that the empire is trying to capture. When the village she is imprisoned at is attacked, a mysterious dragon rescues her, and from then on it serves as your form of transportation and your war machine. So you fly to different locations and try to discover the secrets of your past.GRAPHICS: Old, and dated, but they really milk Xbox for all its got with its vast environments, plethora of enemies on-screen, many explosions, and more. It was real eye-candy when it released those six years ago.MUSIC: It fits, and it's nice, but I expected a little more from a fantasy title.SOUND: Explosions, decent voice-acting, even with the made-up language in the game. That's right, the game has its own language.GAMEPLAY: The game is very difficult, do not make the mistake I did and put it even on normal because there are ten missions in the game and they're pretty damn hard (Hope you played a lot of Starfox at least). The controls work great, and are what you'd probably expect. It can be a little difficult to avoid obstacles sometimes, but the bosses are the things you want to worry about. Also worth mentioning, if you play up to five hours or beat the game you unlock the original Panzer Dragoon game because there is a crapload of stuff to unlock.OVERALL: An amazing game that you never played, shame on you. But maybe it was because of the punishing difficulty and unfair save system (be warned) or perhaps you owned a PS2 instead of an Xbox and this game is an Xbox exclusive.THE GOOD: An amazing on-rails shooter set in a wonderful fantasy backdrop, good controls, challenging gameplay, decent graphics.THE BAD: Punishing difficulty, unfair save system (WHY?!).PANZER DRAGOON (SATURN, PC, ARCADE) SCORE: 9 OUT OF 10One nice feature hidden in Panzer Dragoon Orta is you can unlock the original classic if you beat the game or have five hours of recorded gameplay data. The original game is quite beautiful and mesmerizing and I was amazed by it.WHAT THE GAME IS: A space shooter similar to Starfox, though not quite as good. A mysterious blue armored dragon is being chased by another dragon, and when the rider is shot, he flies down towards a guy who was just so happened to witness what happened and gives him the duty to ride the dragon to a specific location before he dies in front of you. So you ride the dragon, shoot things, and accomplish you goals.GRAPHICS: This game came from an old 32-bit system and relatively looks bad, even compared to the original Playstation which was also a 32-bit system. But when I played the game my eyes lit up and I loved the graphics and environments no matter how ugly they were. Cutscene graphics were impressive however.MUSIC: Feels a little cheesy, and out of place, but relatively good.SOUNDS: Shooting, explosions, characters speaking the bizarre language featured in the game.GAMEPLAY: Playing this port of the game, the controls are a little confusing and difficult at first but easy most of the time. This game is surprisingly easy in comparison to Panzer Dragoon Orta and I was able to defeat bosses pretty quickly.OVERALL: Impressive, even by today's standards. Now I definitely want a Saturn, but the question is; Do I buy the Saturn or the PS2 first? Saturn for the Panzer Dragoon games? Or do I buy the PS2 for RPG Maker and Resident Evil 4? Someone help me decide.THE GOOD: Good shooting gameplay, and it still feels like a classic.THE BAD: Ugly graphics, confusing controls.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2008"}

I think you can handle a $10 game after that huh?  LOL.  The server complaints aren't as valid as these haters are saying.  #1 they are hyper children that want everything yesterday.  They got the game many of them one day before it was supposed to be released.  They installed it and a patch was still coming.  They forgot to delete the game saved beta and the game wasn't loading properly.  They say the patches took to long, as well as the updates.  it took me about a 1/2 hour to get the game up and runnign that was it.  The headset is a little tricky, but it's a good headset.  my only problem with the headset is that it's not that comfortable.  Other than that it's a solid buy.  Any SOCOM vet that doesn't get this game is going to miss out.  IMO they will eventually all come.  But I also think people just love to bitch itf it's not perfect.  Now it is having little to no problems.  i've had close to no issues.  BTW COD4 had server issues early as well, everyone forgot about those.

Players can execute synchronized attacks and collaborate to unleash a deadly blow to the enemy. While moving from one section of the game to the next, fully polygonal graphics create a magnificent environment for one to explore.

The story begins asStar Ocean&Otilde;s protagonist, Fayt Leingod, brings his family and childhood friend, Sophia Esteed, to the Federation-managed resort planet Hyda for a vacation, but the dreamy holiday is abruptly ended when Hyda is attacked by an unknown space military. In the heat of the attack, Fayt is separated from his family and Sophia, and he begins an emotional quest into the unknown to find his loved ones. Along his journey, he gets caught up in the war of an uncharted planet, but in the end, he learns the terrible untold secret about the world and himself.","reviewerName":"L. J Lewis \"Miss Amii\"","summary":"A Swirling Black Hole of Awful","reviewText":"There is in no arguing that Star Ocean: Til the End of time is a large, long game. In playing it from start to finish, you will definitely get your money's worth as you traverse two disks packed full of content. The question is do you really want to spend time on this game? The third is a cult console RPG series, Star Ocean 3 isn't a broken game, but in almost every aspect of the game is suffers from serious flaws that, like a big black hole, sucks whatever enjoyment might be had far away into its mysterious depths. It all builds up to make this one of the most awful games I've played this console generation.In a fifty+ hour long RPG, story is a major element. Star Ocean's is bad, very bad. It takes about three hours until you really get going. It begins with a whiny young man named Fayt and his irritating friend Sophia on vacation on some resort planet. Suddenly, an intergalatic army of invaders storm the place looking for Fayt and his father, a famous scientist. Fayt escapes to find himself alone on a backwards planet. He is rescued by a group called Quark, but then the space invaders show up again and Fayt and his new allies are marooned on another backwaters planet, this time involved in a war. The plot is not that interesting, but when you get to disk two along comes a plot twist that is so horrible it just sinks the rest of the story. This plot twist is like something M Night Shamalan would come up with while drunk. On top of the bad plot, there are tons of poorly directed cut scenes. The dialogue is circular and meandering. The game is almost entirely voice acted. Only a few of the voices are really bad, but mostly it sounds uninspired. It all comes together to create an atmosphere that watching Star Ocean is like watching a bad community play.And then we come to the battle system, the other major aspect of Star Ocean 3. The main problem with Star Ocean's system is that the ally AI is abominal. Your two computer controlled allies will be little help to you at all as they almost always attack by uncontrollably kamikazing the enemies. They don't dodge at all, so when the big bad monster gets ready to attack, they rush right into its waiting claws. Also, you have a life bar and a magic bar and if one of them reaches zero, the character will die. You have magic attacks and special physical attacks that deplete these bars. Your allies will use them indiscriminately, so its a constant struggle to keep them alive. When you realize that this is actually the directors cut version of the game, it is inexcusable that the programmers could add in alternate costumes for a fighting mini-game but couldn't fix the deplorable AI. Besides the deadweight allies, the difficulty curve for this game is broken. Instead, of getting just a little harder in each new area, Star Ocean 3 throws out any kind of natural progression. Enemies that are simple to defeat will be replaced with enemies that are about five times harder. You'll need to spend hours leveling to stand a decent chance.Another really awful of the game is its main side quest: item inventing. This thing is trap. It's an impenatrable, costly system meant to seperate you from your money. I tried desperately to figure this system out. I spent tons of game  money only to be able to have success inventing the most useless, low grade items around, and then find myself unable to buy more useful items readily available in stores.If its an RPG you crave, you can find a much better game out there. Star Ocean: Til the End of Time isn't worth your time.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2006"}

How much money do you think Take 2 Interactive is getting from selling your consumer rights by forced registry?#4- Does not work with SLI, has many rendering problems, and the solution is to use a beta driver which in my case BRICKED my computer.#5- Does not work well with background programs. (Many people recommend shutting down key security programs like your firewall or anti-virus.)#6- Several errors with multiplayer (remember those 2 mandatory online registration processes, they don't work too with multiplayer)This is hogwash.

PLEASE!","reviewText":"Everyone( including me )was thinking that True Crime would crush the afforementioned titles, but they were wrong. DEAD wrong. In attempting to seamlessy blend in elements of Max Payne, Dead to Rights, and Grand Theft Auto, they forgot several things-story, replay value, and controls. The replay value consists of playing as Snoop Dogg. Whoop-de-stinkin-doo. The controls, while aren't the worst kind of controls, they definitely should have been tweaked better to outmatch GTA,MP, or DTR. The driving isn't bad, but it certainly not going to beat Grand Theft Auto. The fighting is very weak,depending on button-mashing more than skill and the moves are extremely slow, unlike Dead to Rights, which requires actual skill. And finally, the shooting. The aiming is cumbersome and will require patience and a keen eye. Plus, it rips off both Dead to Rights and Max Payne with the slow-mo dodge, but fails to outdo either one. Also, is it just me or does every pedestrian fight like they've spent time in a Shaolin temple? Believe me, you'll be in tears when you're getting (...)kicked by winos and Martha Stewarts-lookalikes. The soundtrack is supposedly made up of rap songs. I'm not a big fan of rap or Snoop Dogg. However, only the rock songs are the good songs on here. Now, aside from all the nit-picking I've done, there is some good here. The shooting system allows you to pick up 2 guns at once( for example, you could have an M-16 in one hand and a shotgun in the other ) which is kind of fun. One thing the driving does have on GTA is the ability to aim inside your car, which is neat too. The graphics are pretty good. The voice talent, consisting of Christopher Walken, Michelle Rodriguez and Michael Madsen, is interesting to hear. Unfortunately, the bad outweights the good. If you're smart, you'll either rent True Crime or go and buy Max Payne, Dead to Rights, or GTA. They may be slighty older games, but they're definitely a lot better than True Crime.

It's still the Elder Scrolls so all of the things in terms of gameplay that made Morrowind such a fun game are still here, with a shiny new coat, but it just doesn't have that epic feeling that Morrowind had. Don't get me wrong, this is a great game, but as a fan of III I can't help but compare the two and Oblivion falls short in a few areas. For instance the map itself doesn't hold a candle to Morrowind. Morrowind just seemed freakin' HUGE! And it wasn't just big, it was diverse. You had forests, deserts, mountains, crazy mushroom tree like areas, beaches, swamps etc. Oblivion's map is all pretty much the same. It's a forest, and...  oh yea! Some mountains. My biggest gripe is how the map ends with an invisible barrier. The visuals in this game are absolutely gorgeous, and the landscape just begs for exploration. Venture too far however and you're stopped in your tracks and get a \"You can't go this way, turn around\" message. Frankly, I thought that kind of thing was behind us as a society. I understand that the game world can't go on forever but couldn't they use impassable mountains or water as the boundary instead of an invisible barrier and a scolding? One star off for that alone. Fast traveling is a nice convenience but it makes the game world feel small. There is no need to plan your route and the fact that the world looks the same everywhere you go just doesn't deliver the immersion that Morrowind did of having a huge and diverse continent at your fingertips. The towns all look the same too. No cultural or architectural differences worth noting between settlements. I miss the Telavani towers and the ashlander camps and the way the human and elven towns looked and felt different. Oblivion's map is pretty bland in comparison. On the plus side the game is beautiful. While lacking diversity the world looks fantastic. The hours of voice work they recorded is amazing as well. The options to personalize gameplay are vast and the story is great. The interface is better than Morrowind in respect to keeping quests organized too. The journal in Morrowind made it tough to pick up where you left off if you took a lengthy break from the game. That has been fixed here thankfully. I know I've been griping but Oblivion is definitely worth several play throughs. This game is another example of a sad trend however. Ever since the \"next gen\" thing happened a couple years ago developers have been sacrificing content for graphics. In order to put a shiny sheen on this game we lost a vast and diverse world to play in. I hope someday we can have both.-1 star for the invisible \"end of the world\" boundary.-1 star for a small map that lacks diversity.+1 star for no freakin' cliff racers!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2009"}

{"product_name":"B003IEBO9Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Marvel vs. Capcom 3 Review","reviewText":"Marvel vs. Capcom is one of those cross over fighting franchises that make certain gamers salivate. You will have your choice of 3 characters to go up against another team of 3 characters. If you can master the moves, as well as master when to bring a different character in, you could find yourself a champion. Now as with most fighting games, there's not a whole lot to the story portion of the game. Yes, Galactus is trying to consume your world, and you're going to need to defeat all the fighters between you and him, but other than that, its basically knock out your opponent with skill.Graphically this game looks great. In my opinion there will never be anything wrong with a 2D fighting game. You're also going to have quite a few of very intense attacks that run smoothly when executed. I have to give it to them, there isn't much, if any, jittery motions or graphical issues when trying to do so much on the screen. The backgrounds will give you a sense of nostalgia for the most part. I personally really like the Ghost 'n Goblins board.The music is your standard affair fighting music. Sure there's some special flair for the characters and franchises represented, but you're probably not going to be paying any attention to it as you're going to be solely focused on your opponent.The controls for this game will basically have you utilizing every button minus the select button. You'll notice that buttons for different characters will do different things, as well as combinations of buttons. The thing about fighting games is that there's always going to be different combinations of buttons to create some very devastating attacks, and if you can master those, which I have to say most of them aren't too difficult to get down, you're going to have quite a bit of fun with this game.So as stated above this is a fighting game where you get to choose from several members from the Marvel Universe as well as the Capcom universe. Sure there were a ton of characters that I'm sure people wanted to see in the mix, but overall I think they did a pretty good job capturing some of the favorite characters from respected franchises. My personal favorite combo was Arthur (Ghost 'n Goblins), X-23 (Xmen), and Trish (Devil May Cry). Sure they aren't the heavy hitters of the bunch, but man can they deal out some punishment when you get their moves down. Personally I'm a button masher so I know that online competition is a bit out of my range, but facing off against friends is a lot of fun, and if you liking fighting games, and have a competitive streak, you'll find you've played more matches than you intended to. Take Jesse and I for example, we ended up playing 30+ matches, sadly we split them down the middle, so I couldn't show my awesome supremacy, but it was enjoyable every time.So if you're looking for a solid fighting game that gives you more than kicks and punches, and has a cast of characters from different Capcom games as well as characters from the Marvel Universe, then this is the game you've got to try. I may not be the biggest fighting game person, but I have to say that I highly enjoyed this game, and also the fact is that if you button mash there's a good chance that you'll last a bit through a match/game. This game gets an 8.8 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"","summary":"A Post-Nuclear Elder Scrolls","reviewText":"Straight out of the vault, *Fallout 3* is awesome. Bethesda Softworks mated the Gamebryo engine with Fallout's environment, to birth a squalling mutant beneath the Wasteland sun!About time too. It's been ten years since *Fallout 2*, the critically-acclaimed king of computer post-nuclear role-playing. And after 40 hours of game-breaking play, I'm ready to report on this latest installment.---Fallout Never Changes---Despite pre-release concerns, the spirit of Fallout possess everything. Comedy runs from black satire to silly jokes. Characters strut in Mad Max leather and wield double-barreled shotguns. Our Pip-Boy is present, guiding the player in HUD announcements, or providing permanent stat-boosts in the form of collectible bobble-heads. Even the classic button bleeps are here. An exception: the pop-culture references are considerably more subdued.*Fallout 3* does not continue the original Vault Dweller story. And like *Fallout Tactics*, story elements have questionable canonicity. Continuity freaks like me may be ruffled by this, but the journey is something to behold.For *F3* provides what its predecessors could only approximate. One night I found myself blasting mutants in slow motion, gibs flying around the screen, with classic 1940's jazz playing on my Pip-Boy radio. The cheery, upbeat music strikes a perfect contrast with the ruins of civilization and people alike.---Son of Oblivion---With the leap to 3D, gameplay is striking. The engine was the weak point of the Fallout series: being flat, distant, and low-res. Whereas I found Bethesda's *Oblivion* to be immersive: from graphics and Radiant AI, to the crafted go-anywhere maps and the piles of physics props you could steal or knock around.For *Fallout 3*, the developers apply similar mechanics--along with some lessons learned. It still boasts a giant outdoor map, albeit streamlined with fewer \"dungeons\" or \"villages\", while debris barriers prevent players from wandering into the tougher neighborhoods too soon. The maps also seem optimized, as objects have longer draw distances and advanced textures without crippling my machine.You can't enter every building, unlike previous titles, but interiors seem extensive and detailed. I was pleased to board a warship and find yellow battle lanterns set in the bulkheads, just like the real Navy! The Anchorage War Memorial, meanwhile, is a multi-level maze full of monsters and loot. At the same time, Bethesda tried to preserve performance by reducing the amount of prop clutter compared to the last Elder Scrolls.The NPCs have gotten a face-lift from the rather generic folks in *Oblivion*. Faces offer more expression, with more body language during conversations. Stronger writing and more voice actors diversify the personalities.Unfortunately, Bethesda sometimes stumbles in the Fallout spirit here. The player's own dialogue is often flat. I have yet to get into a wonderfully silly conversation, like the \"Rocket Man\" routines with Rensco in *Fallout 2*.I also notice some cut corners; characters tend to glide across rough ground or up inclines, or get stuck in level geometry. There are no laughing animations to accompany the dialogue.--The Issue is Control---Also unfortunately, controls need work:>My character sometimes seems to bump forward an extra step or two, or move a bit sooner than I expected when pressing keys.>Like *Oblivion* the game also has some problems with mapping to my Razer Diamondback mouse--I can bring menu screens up, but I have to use the keyboard to close them back down.>It also needs FPS-style weapon scrolling via the mouse wheel.Combat itself is a mix of *Oblivion* and *Tactics*. Players can battle real-time in first-person or over-the-shoulder (this time, Bethesda provides a crosshair for third person view). At any time, players can enter Vault Assisted Targeting System, pausing the game for hit-locations. Targeting costs actions points. Your choices play out in a cinematic mode before returning to real-time. Because the enemy tends to glide about, it can be a chore to hit your opponents in real-time, so I often take cover until my points regenerate.Now, I was surprised when I watched heavy Paladins whipped by raggedy mutants with pop guns. In contrast, the fighter companion I recruited seems overpowering. I'd like to see these friendly and neutral NPCs balanced.I'd also like to see shield combat and two-weapon fighting. This would add depth and variety, since players could chose between being a heavy weapon fighter, a twin gunner, or a shield fighter.---Irradiated Dice---Otherwise, *Fallout 3* is still a role-playing game. The Capital Wastelands are dangerous, and unlike previous games, you can't hire more than one gunslinger at a time to protect you. But you can sneak, hide, and even outmaneuver dangers.Karma affects your progress, as killers, patrons, and recruiters will seek you based on your actions. Even the radio commentary reflects the results of deeds and misdeeds.Non-combat skills matter a lot; the player needs to hack computers, break locks, repair weapons, craft equipment, and interrogate characters.Hacking and lock picking occurs in mini-games, like *Bioshock*, but the UI is more realistic. You have a pick set and a lock you must twist and turn intuitively. The Commodore-like computers use a password decipher game to match correct letters.As part of the streamlining, Perks and Traits combine. Since the level cap is set at 20, you can pick a Perk every level from the diverse catalog. This helps to refine characters as a Combat Boy, Diplomatic Boy, or Stealth Boy. The SPECIAL attributes system remains, and you cannot level them up through use as in *Oblivion*.---In the Nuclear Sunset---Forget all that pre-release apprehension. Nuts to those Internet nerds whining about shooter elements. Whether it's slap-stick humor, a splat of sticky brains, or a stab of HDR lighting in your eyes, *Fallout 3* invigorates the series.P.S: Due to word count limits, please see the comments section for DRM, system performance, and final thoughts.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2008"}

Ending Spoiler...","reviewText":"I suppose the most important part of this review is that I want to point out that this is NOT as great as Fable. It seemed a little more forced here to make it magical and it just wasn't as good. I loved it anyway though.The Goods:-Graphics are great, environments are great, and the customization levels are fairly decent.-The decisions are a lot of fun. It's fun building a good character, building a bad character, and having another to do whatever it is you would do case by case.-Game length is decent. It's no 40 hour RPG, but you'll have plenty of options to keep you going. You can get through the main story VERY quickly if you choose to go linear and play only the main story line.-Platinum includes all add-on material, which saves you a bundle from buying it in the arcade.The Bad:-The boss battles are NOT epic. There are not many large bosses, which is something I love about action games, and something that Fable has the ability to throw in since it's such a magical and fantasy based game.-*SPOILER* The final boss battle is obnoxiously short. Most games build up to that awesome final battle. This one would surely disappoint you like it did me.-Gambling (Pub Games) are kind of stupid for achievement hunters. Take a long time.Overall:-This game is definately worth picking up at the listed price. It's a fun and simple game. Great for the family, though you may want to allow older kids to play as the action, while not bloody, does have certain over-the-top elements such as keeping the heads keeping bad guys heads as trophys to show off. Some of the bad elements are hilarious, but crude, like farting. The game is a lot of fun.Achievements:-The game has a lot of easy achievements that you get as you go. Some require you to play the game multiple times (choose the different endings, be good or be bad). Some are just play tough. This is not an easy 1000 (more if you have the platinum version or DLed material).Recommended Price: $25","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E800","description":"","reviewerName":"Tristan A. Hayes","summary":"An Enjoyable Game for the 3DS","reviewText":"Now, I will start off by saying that I will not reveal any spoilers at all for the story as it is pretty good once it gets going and is quite compelling! But in review, the game follows the tale of a young boy as he goes on a quest to save the tree in his village and eventually the entire kingdom as the evil Ganon attempts to rule the world with the ultimate power!This is simply a basic action adventure game littered with over 40 hours worth of gameplay including numerous sidequests, minigames, and weapons/items at your disposal. Players traverse numerous intricately well designed dungeons to access the goods within. There is limited backtracking into the dungeons fortunately. Gameplay is solid and enjoyable with some gyroscope controls implemented to say, aim arrows, and touchscreen controls for item management.Presentation wise the game looks nice in 3D as well as in 2D. Many of the textures look decent in their retouched forms. However, character faces look primitive in their static flat designs, characters look like they need many more polygons dedicated to them, and there are jagged lines and rough edges everywhere. Some environments do look gorgeous though with water and lighting effects. Boss designs look amazing.  Though more could have been done to the graphics.The greatest flaws of the game however lie in its lack thereof of modern mechanics, such as its incompetent targeting system and  its annoying camera. The game lacks save points within and around dungeons. If one saves and quits the game then they have to restart the dungeon from the very beginning even if they had saved right before the boss door.  This decrease portability of this title.  Furthur, there are limited in game context clues so players feel lost occasionally.  Most of this led to great difficulty and constant deaths as the game doesnt exactly provide information on how to defeat some bosses or even some enemy types. Nextly, no health or magic regeneration system, means that players have to constantly search around for healing items or MUST do sidequest to get some upgrades for more health or item carrying capacity. Its pretty punishing and makes fights more difficult for those that havent played before. Lastly the music could have been done better with an orchestra and higher quality, maybe some more voice acting could have been added.The targeting feels broken in which one needs to angle the camera in the right way for the target icon to be on the target for accuracy, and hope that the target icon doesnt just jump, which happens often. The camera is honestly terrible in that each method to control it results in some aggravation and annoyance as none are as free reign as other 3D adventure games. Rather than using the D-pad for some preset camera angles the screen must constantly be fiddled with to get Link back into the center of the displayer, or the circle pad must be used to swing the camera slowly around, or the touch screen must be pushed in order to just look around which can be slow. Its also difficult to mess with the camera while targeting. If they had enhanced this, then some of the game wouldnt feel clunky and slow.All in all, it was an enjoyable and decent game for the 3DS but one that probably cant live up to other games in the genre this day. Fortunately, it is the only game of its type on the 3DS and for better or worst, at this point in time it is the best experience on the system.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00006M3R6","description":"Metroid Fusionis a side-scrolling action game that's more in line with the series' NES origin than its GameCube contemporary, the first-person action gameMetroid Prime. In this one, players take the bounty hunter Samus on an extermination mission through a research facility to kill X parasites--nasty creatures that absorb and assimilate the powers of their host. After she survived an X attack through the use of a vaccine made with X parasite DNA, she can now absorb the parasites to regain health and obtain special powers, like the morph ball, space jump, and wave beam. The problem is that the parasites are quickly making their way through the research lab's many dangerous projects and subsuming their abilities.As a special bonus to GameCube owners,Metroid PrimeandMetroid Fusioncan each unlock special features in the other game via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable. For example, by completingMetroid Fusion, you can unlock the original NES version ofMetroidinMetroid Prime. By completingMetroid Prime, you can unlock Samus's fusion suit for use inMetroid Prime.","reviewerName":"Anthony Peak","summary":"As good as you hoped and more.","reviewText":"It's a wonderful time to be a fan of old school. Metroid Fusion is quite simply the closest thing to a new SNES Metroid adventure possible. From the very beginning it's clear nothing was sacrificed and much was gained. Samus is back and every bit as incredible as she was before. I must admit, I have a definite soft spot for Samus Aran. She's by far my favorite video game babe, bar none. I think just about the only thing that can irk me more than someone calling Link \"Zelda\" is someone calling Samus \"Metroid\". The graphics and sounds of Metroid are simply etched into my mind for all time so I had high hopes in starting up Metroid Fusion.Don't let the fact this is a Gameboy Advanced game fool you. This could very easily be a SNES game and you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference. Samus starts the game without most of her abilities, but regains most of them and several new tricks throughout the game. Some are simple but well though out, like the ability to automatically grab ledges and pull yourself up. Simple, sure... but you'll be surprised how much jumping it'll save you. Other abilities are newer and cooler, like charging freeze missiles that freeze a room at a time.The difficulty of the game is pretty much spot on. Early in the game things will flow smoothly, not too tough and not too easy. As the game progresses though, the challenges get harder and harder until things really heat up. By the end of the game, you'll be fighting for your life. Unlike previous Metroid adventures, you won't be running around aimlessly this time. You'll almost always have a near complete map, and an idea where to go thanks to your new AI commander. Your CO will give you objectives and help you out along the way, so you're rarely running around in circles. This is a very welcomed switch as it not only gives a better storyline, but less repetitive exploration looking for a missed entrance.The downside to this however is it severely shortens the game's length. I finished the game my first time through in about 4:33 play time. That translates to a few days counting replaying saves, breaks, and such. It's not a very long game. A casual player would probably take a week or maybe two at the most to finish the game. A hardcore player could do it in a day if they really wanted to. It's reply value is about the same as the previous Metroid titles were. Personally I doubt I'll be replying it too many times. Not because the game isn't worthy of replying, but it's like a movie I've already seen. Speaking of movies, there's several very nice little cutscenes where you get an insight into the past of Samus Aran through her own words. A very nice touch that's sure to please any fan.My only real gripe aside from the somewhat short length the new Samus's new powersuit. The blue/yellow color scheme just doesn't look right. She just looks wrong in anything but the original colors. As the game moves on the suit upgrades of course, but you'll spend the majority of the game looking at a strange color scheme that just seems wrong. I'm not a vain person, but looking at this suit just bugged me the whole way through.All in all though, Metroid Fusion will be pure bliss for any Metroid fan out there. This is what we've been waiting on for years now, and it's finally here.- Rirath_com","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2003"}

This is the first and only Guitar Hero game for any Nintendo system. Currently onlyRock Band Special Editionhas been released for Wii, there are no plans for any of the three other Guitar Hero games will come to Wii. In other words this is the only game in town for GH on the Wii and sadly the game plays songs only in Mono. This means if you have a fancy surround system, the music would only come out of the center speaker. You can rig it up so that the same mono sound comes out of other speakers, but that is not even an approximation of Dolby Pro Logic II. This is a negative, but shouldn't really prevent anyone from picking this game up.The game itself is still as good asGuitar Hero 2 Bundle with GuitarorGuitar Hero (Game Only). In fact I would say that generally on the same difficulty level this game is a bit harder that the others. The set list, like the others, is a combination of classic and modern music. This is an online game, so you can play against people online and they claim that at some point additional songs will be available to purchase (not likely).The new feature for this one is the battle mode. In these special boards you will face off with Slash, Tom Morello, etc... and instead of star power you get attacks to use against your opponent. It is well done, but since it is only a few songs it doesn't play a major part in the game.The Gibson branded guitar looks great and the Wii-mote actually plugging into it allows for better tilt functions. Also it rumbles and sound comes out of the controller, though it is rarely used (rumble for star power and speaker mostly for missed notes) it does put this version over the other guitars.The big negative is the mono sound from the game. Even though the packaging clearly says Dolby Pro Logic 2, it is only in that sound format for the menus and whatnot. [On 12/6/07 Activision acknowledged this bug and offers a disk exchange.]Since this is a music game, the mono sound is a negative, but really it shouldn't prevent anyone from picking this up. There will be a disk  exchange coming in the future [I totally called that one], in the meantime, rock on.EDIT: Here is the press release from Activision spokeswoman Rhy-Ming Poon:\"We recently became aware that some consumers have not been able to enjoy the full audio output in the Nintendo Wii version of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. We are currently working with Nintendo and are planning to issue an improved audio experience in future versions of the game.

Starting off with it having a proprietary usb connection meaning that it is not very flexible if you lose your cord. The system has displayed some improvement on size but now has a smaller battery and a smaller amount of juice to \"balance\" it out. Another major flaw that has to do with the battery is you can no longer switch it out with an extra battery. Meaning that if your on a long road trip and you drain the battery your little system now is useless in till the next overnight stop. The biggest flaw design wise is where they placed the analog nub it is now even harder to use do to it's placement. Sony could have at least swapped the D-pad and the Nub around for more comfort. A good thing about the PSPgo is that when you buy it you get 4 free games. But the counter side to it is the PSP's wireless hardware it well not good enough to download the sheer size of the games. Another problem is if your doing downloading over wireless connection and you go out of range you have to start the download all over again which can be very aggravating if you forget about the download. If i were to designing this thing would I have at least upped the wireless speed and being able to continue a partially completed downloads. Another thing that i would have added is the ability to use homebrew apps which older PSP's already can do if you can hack them which most PSP's (100x-200x)are able. The x is the digit of which region the psp is from and it is variably of each region US or NTSC PSP's are 2001 for example. The only ones that are not completely hackable of the older PSP's is the 300x's (the brite in other words) and some 200x's (the slim in other words). The fact that it is a all digital system meaning that you have to download each game through a wireless router or the MediaGo software (which is very slow and clunky just like the software before it), is a good idea on paper but the system just doesn't deliver. The missing UMD drive is something that I do miss a little bit because if you do own any UMDs they can't be played on the Go. And man, I have so many UMD games from US versions to Japanese versions. But a plus side is that it doesn't have a massive amount of drain on the battery anymore. But sony could have fit the UMD easily on the go with no problem and keeping the form factor pretty well. the UMD drive only takes up about eighth of a inch in thickness and about 2 and 1/2 inches in length and the goes fold down bottom (the section were the buttons are) could have easly made the system rounded and slapped it on the back there. The raised back would have also added a little more grip on the system. out of every console i have bought from Sony (which means the ps1-ps3 and PSP 100x- to Go) this is the only system that disappointed me and i didn't even get on to the insane $*** dollars price tag. Which $*** of the price is for the air inside the system.Cause I mean, c'mon.  Why would you pay that much for a tiny system like this?  You could get a Wii for that price, or a ps3 just with a couple of more dollars or so.  But, if you're already a gamer with a regular psp, please keep it.  If you're a new comer to the psp...I guess you could get it, but I suggest not though.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00CX8VY4S","description":"","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"Middling sandbox title with potential for greatness in a sequel","reviewText":"The one thing that really stands out to me about Watch Dogs is the way that it contradicts itself. The developers have obviously gone all out in creating this super realistic world, yet there are certain things about the game that are so unrealistic that they kill the entire vibe that they're going for, effectively taking you out of the game. Having a phone like the one the main character does in the game is one thing in and of itself, an impressive piece of tech that can hack just about anything you see onscreen. It's something you can sort of believe as in today's day and age we continue to hurtle towards an all digital world where just about everything is accessible and able to be connected to. Having that same phone be able to detect when a mugging is about to take place when the mugger himself hasn't even decided to commit the crime is where we start to venture into the outright ridiculous. It's things like this that serve to ruin the atmosphere that the game strives to achieve. You can't help but feel that a lot of the logic in the game wasn't entirely thought through in the design process.The graphics and sound are both impressive and at the very least, Watch Dogs manages to recreate Chicago in a very convincing manner. I've never been personally but in comparison to all the films I've seen that take place there, I was able to recognize quite a bit of the locales I was looking at. I had heard that the vehicle control in the game was awful and while I wouldn't go that far, it's definitely lacking and should be revamped in any potential sequels. Control of the main character is pretty good and is an obvious culmination of character controls from earlier released Ubisoft games such as Assassin's Creed and Splinter Cell: Conviction. If you're familiar with those games, controlling Aidan Pierce will come as second nature to you.Another problem I had with the title is one that seems to pop up in other open world sandbox titles. There's quite a lot to do in the game, enough that it distracts you from the main storyline of the game. I was constantly getting hit with other tasks to complete and it always seemed to happen as I was trying to get to a story marker. At first it wasn't so bad but it feels like the balance of mandatory versus optional missions butts heads with each other more often than not. At the time of this writing, I haven't completed the single player campaign but the story did come off as somewhat engaging. There's one character in particular, an aging crime boss who's really creepy and worthy of a film appearance, that should be noted.What works in the game works really well. It benefits from that sense of randomness you get in these kind of games, where anything can and will happen and will probably be the only time you see anything like it happen at all. The multiplayer component is also really interesting, with random players online being able to jump into your game and cause general havoc. It's the one area of the game that they really got right and it's truly nerve wracking when you get a notification on your screen that you're being targeted by a random fixer and your data starts to get hacked, giving you only a few moments to capture the culprit. The game is almost worth playing for this alone, a truly remarkable and welcome addition to the overall gameplay.In the end, I'm a little perplexed. This game has all the makings of a hit yet I can't help but feel &#34;meh&#34; over it. It's both bland yet exciting, technically impressive in familiar ways and sort of all over the place. There's a lot of potential here and I think that a sequel will bring it out better than this flagship marker of the series has. What truly perplexes me is the fact that a game on the scale of this one can feel so average. Years ago, this game would have been something for the ages but as of now, Watch Dogs straddles the fence between being a superior and a so-so release.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2014"}

Although many of its elements tie into the greaterFinal Fantasyuniverse, this is but a faint echo of what you have come to know and love.While it can be argued that this is a new direction for the series, and therefore shouldn't be put on the same level as the other games, fans have come to expect the best fromFinal Fantasy, and with each passing release, Square has delivered.Crystal Chroniclesmay break new ground, but it lacks the creativity and passion of its role-playing brethren.As stylish as the character designs may be, they are completely void of personality. The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. TheFinal Fantasygames are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought inCrystal Chronicles. Cinematic flair is also noticeably&nbsp;absent.The gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything.When a player accesses the GBA, their character on the TV cannot be controlled. Not only does this leave them open to attack, it more or less halts any progress that the group can make. So basically, you still find yourself sitting around waiting for your buddy to make preparations, but instead, you're doing it with a controller that has fewer buttons and dying batteries.To make matters worse, players must also keep an eye on a bucket. To prevent characters from scattering and trying to run in different directions, the bucket emits a field of energy that covers roughly 80 percent of the screen. If you go outside of this barrier, you'll take damage. So you basically must stay huddled together as one person carries the bucket throughout a stage. Without question, this is one of the stupidest ideas in the history of video games.When it comes to the basics of gameplay, the combat is respectable, but by no means great. I really like the timing-based combo system that accompanies both magic and general hack n' slash, yet I absolutely despise losing all of my magic with each new area that I enter. Hence, classes are not defined, and you never really get the impression that your character is growing in power.There's little here that truly excites.Crystal Chroniclesplays like an experiment gone awry, and is unfit to bear the sacrosanctFinal Fantasyname.Concept:A hack n' slash with inventive, yet highly aggravating GBA-based multiplayer connectivity, and a worthless bucketGraphics:Stylish character designs, gorgeous particle effects, and awesome boss designsSound:Not the familiarFinal Fantasymelodies, but memorable nonethelessPlayability:Steers away from button mashing with timing-based chains, manual spell aiming, and multi-person combosEntertainment:A cookie cutter adventure with a lackluster story, poor character growth, and frustrating playReplay:Moderately HighRated:7 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Crystal Chroniclesis here to remind us that every so often, Square Enix actually puts out an average game. It seems like for every thingFF: CCdoes right, it does two things wrong. Combining spells with your teammates is awesome, but half the time it's less effective than two individual castings, and you lose all of your magic between areas. The effects and character models are cool, but downtimes really drag and many cutscenes look awfully similar. The worst part, though, is that character advancement is the slowest I've ever seen. Beat a boss and get your choice of +1 to one of your stats! Thrilling. There is certainly some enjoyment to be had here, but it's sprinkled somewhat thinly among all of the lame and boring parts.

For me, that is a pretty big risk to spend $60 and not be sure I am going to love it. Like I mentioned, I got it for a birthday gift and when I started it was a little difficult to get used to the controls as they do something a little different that really has not been done before and once you get used to the controls and the story, it works great. I think the bad reviews were from people that really did not appreciate the new controls, and they did not really play around with the combos you can create. The game is called \"remember me\" so they took advantage and make you use your memory to remember the fight button combos, or hints on where a treasure might be if you can remember where it is on the next map.The other thing I was worried about was the story \"stealing memories...really, how could that be a story\", again I was pleasantly surprised with the sci-fi writing, turned out to be a gripping story and you do start to get deep feelings for the main character. Overall I give big kudos to the developer for taking the risks on this game and I think it paid off big time. The only downside I had is that I wished it was a little longer, however the time frame it took to beat it was 10-15 hours, and replay value is very high. I think if it was a 30 hour game, I would not be as willing to start another session. The night I finished the game, the next morning I started up a new game on the plus mode to see if I could get more trophies (and I think it will be much faster on the second play through).I also liked that there is a good mix of puzzles, that are not too hard that you have to go online to find the answer, but hard enough that you will stop and think for 10 minutes. The game also does this great thing with manipulating memories, where you actually edit memories to change the outcome to get a bad guy on your side. Hard to explain, but when you get in to that mode, it is more fun than I imagined. Overall it is a fair mix of game play, puzzles, memory edits, and story, you never get bored, the action is challenging but not frustrating. Great game, very happy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2013"}

Pretty stunning, for lack of a better term. The only thing I have an issue w/somewhat is the hand to hand combat, but even that is workable.  The cityscape is amazing, and as usual it's just as fun to walk/drive around and take in the sights...The textures and lighting, esp. the street lights &  car tail light reflections at night. One cannot even begin to describe how this city comes to life. At first I thought the graphics were kind of murky, but the more I progressed the more I found myself stopping to take in the sights; Alot reminds me of a 'French Connection' type of thing; And where True Crime NYC had some success in recreating the whole NY urban setting, GTA4 runs rings around the competition. The city seems very Sims-like at times. The character controls well for the most part, and the added cover features are nice.  The gunplay is fairly fluid, but as of yet I haven't had too many opponents; Driving is a blast, esp stealing cars from the street. Some have car alarms that sound after you bust out the glass. The dialog is actually entertaining, and the addition of the autosave feature is nice. Other than that, it's your good old GTA in terms of mission types(so far...). Great looking, truly fun to play.I have not tried co-op or the online modes yet....I beat up one Russian guy and his 2 friends came to his aid; I tried to fight them off and run, but they chased me all over, cursing in Russian. I tried so hard to carjack someone, but they kept dogging me until finally I got hit by 2 trucks. And I was laughing hysterically the same time.  Those are the types of moments I live for in games, and unless this game suddenly sucks all of the sudden, I can only imagine the fun that lies down the road.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2008"}

It's buggy and online is just a mess for PS3. CoD games get frequent updates and I'm sure they will have this sorted out in a couple weeks. So if you can avoid freaking out and melting down, read on.1) If you gave this one star, you probably shouldn't have bought it (or didn't and are trolling). It is exactly what you expect from any CoD game.2) The PS3 version online is jacked up in the first couple day. THIS IS NOTHING NEW FOR CoD OR ANY OTHER FPS. It is simply a continuing tradition of shooters not working right on release. A couple weeks from now, things will smooth out and the game will work fine.3) Zombie mode is bigger and better. It is really fun and a great co-op mode. It's still not Left4Dead, but it does offer some replay and something for people that don't like being cursed at by ignorant people online.4) The campaign has MORE to offer than any of the recent CoD's. I still don't like it, but I never have.5) When online works, the game is okay. It's super fast, twitchy and the guns all feel \"samey\", it's more rock paper scissors and online connection speed than my gun is stronger than yours (not including shotguns/snipers). Killstreaks have been dialed way back, so that's a plus or minus depending on your take. I'm just getting into league play, but it's interesting for people that enjoy playing right and work as a team. The perks and unlocks have been changed, but it's still the same fomula. Perform missions, get kills, get XP and unlock things; it's in a new wrapper though.All in all, it's a CoD game. It's not the worst game ever and even though there are bugs on release, the campaign is super high quality, zombie mode is terrific and with the addtion of league play, online could have some legs for people like me that would rather play with a team that works together instead of a bunch of boosters and corner campers.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2012"}

It's one of the four launch titles that I purchased for the 3DS, and it's in my top three 3DS games. The cameras and gameplay is nice, and the 3D graphics look amazing. The characters are cute, and the sounds they make sound strangely amusing. However, there is one big flaw. I couldn't save the game during the middle of the game to quit and get back later, and if I quitted, I would have to restart the level. I found this very annoying, so I wouldn't play this game if you have a strict bedtime.Overall, this game is a lot of fun. However, like the other Ubisoft 3DS games I've played, there is the Black Screen of Death. If you don't know what this is, let me explain. Ubisoft is known for rushing launch titles, but to me, it's acceptable. A larger library is fine for me even if it has many things that could have been improved on. For the 3DS launch titles, all of the Ubisoft games has a flaw called the Black Screen of Death.

It's pretty looking, solid dialogue and voice acting, but the open world is dull to tears. If you're a full-blown completionist like me, this game will upset you because there is literally no point in finding all hidden items or completing all side quests. The hidden items to collect give you backstories that are uninteresting, and the side quests are very forgettable. After literally doing everything on the first island- this includes all hidden items, outposts - I'd already unlocked all perks/special abilities so I just simply rushed throughout the rest of the game seeing as the main storyline is really the only thing that's interesting in the game. There is nothing here that's pushing you to explore the world as a lot of it is just recycled graphics. The story is cheesy and seems to be on the bridge between reality and fantasy rather than simply choosing one. The gunplay is the best part of the game, the RPG elements do not hold up whatsoever. Comparing this game to Skyrim, as reviewers like IGN have is laughable. You may find this game enjoyable if you simply stick to the main storyline- do not make the mistake of exploring the world fully like I did.These five star reviews I'm seeing are made by people who did not fully explore the world and did not get to see how dull it really is.There's also a multiplayer and co-op, but these are both extremely forgettable- pinned on for extra game value.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2014"}

Molyneux, Wright, and other developers should take notice. I made a legit Casey Jones from TMNT.+Fun tracks, and the user-created content is already top notch. I spent an hour last night on an \"infinite drift\" track somebody uploaded. Crazy fun.+Everything \"fits.\" The environment/character/track/kart designs all mesh, and it feels like a fun little cohesive world.CONS-Load times. Word on the street is that a patch is on its way.-As with any kart racer, there is a certain level of cheapness. In action races, you might be first the whole race, and then get blown up 10 yards from the finish line for 3rd place.-I've experienced framerate problems in the ModSpot (the home world/hub). However, I have never seen jankiness in an actual race, so that's good.Most definitely recommended.Weird side note -I want UGF and Sony to continue the ModNation franchise.

{"product_name":"B002I0J4VQ","reviewerName":"Q","summary":"Even the updates have updates!","reviewText":"Let me first make clear that I am comparing the PS3 to the 360. There is slight mention of the Wii, yet, the Wii is an entirely different game experience not directly comparable to the 360 or PS3, so it will remain in a class of it's own (on a side not, a lesser class to this old school gamer).Having owned most systems, current Wii, XBox, Xbox 360, PS2, and other older and handled, I found, in comparison with the other aforementioned systems, the PlayStation 3 sub par. The running joke is that it's the update machine, that you spend a ridiculous amount of time patching with updates. This is absolutely the case. Compared with the two other major systems, which update as well, the PS3 updates take hours compared with their minutes. Even the Blu-ray movies require updates (and, by the way, even though probably not specific to only the PS3's Blu-Ray player, the Blu-Ray movies are now downloading previews from the internet). The interface is sub par compared with both the Wii and 360. Though the games tend to look a little better based on the slightly superior hardware than the 360 (and incomparably better than the slightly improved Gamecube, also nick named the Wii), the game specific features exclusive to consoles, when both systems offer the same games, however, are far better on the XBox 360.Though there are some really nice game exclusives on the PS3 (Infamous is a great example), the XBox 360 generally has more exclusives than the PS3.A definite positive over the 360 is the lack of hardware failure. So far I am on my second 360, having had the last hardware repaired once, and failed twice, I purchased a newer edition. Though, I've still months of playtime to log on the sole PS3 I've owned, versus even the first iteration of my 360.The exclusive online game selection is not bad, however, still lacking versus the 360. As far as I can tell there is no indie game support on the PS3. Having worked developed on both platforms, I can easily see why. The PS3 is far more difficult to code on than the 360.In summary, if you are trying to pick between the PS3 and the 360, the 360 is your best purchase. Having both, I can easily see life without the PS3. Though having a Blue-Ray player is nice, most movies don't benefit noticeably from the quality improvement, and with the load and update times of Blu-Ray movies, if you are like me and don't notice the difference, then the PS3 has very little redeeming value versus the 360. Now, if we are comparing the PS3 to the PS2, Sony has done right by themselves. The menu feels slightly improved, the added internet support and downloads support is great, and the game visual quality makes me soil myself (not literally). All in all, compare the exclusives. If, however, you just want one nice system that gives you the most bang for your bucks, then the 360 wins (especially as its cost continues to fall, and the latest systems don't suffer from the same failures the previous incarnations did).But that's just my opinion.Edit: I've raised the rating of this system. Though tempted to lower it due to the Sony system wide hack, and the removal of Linux support (though I never took advantage of said feature, I appreciated the option), in this case I raised it as I've found the system's Video features FAR surpass that of it's competition. It is an excellent Media Streamer receiver that can play most file formats, and displays entire file names.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2010"}

The wifi is easy to configure and I haven't had any problems with it so far.Playstation Online is a great feature, having a store on your console to download new games and demos, and even find classic PSOne games is just amazing to me.All in all, this is the best console I have ever owned, and apart from the Xbox, I've owned them all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2010"}

Saying that, I think this console is very intuitive.  I am still figuring out all it can do.  The biggest difference to me was the fact that it is super quiet!  You can barely tell that it is even on!  Plus I love the feature of having all your downloads/updates occuring while the console is off.  But if you are storing your console in a drawer of some sort, make sure you leave it open as it is always somewhat on standby (you can toggle this, but I love the auto updates that occur in the background)All these kids are complaining about the need to install each game, but that is a **MUST** for your game to run smoothly.Kinect has yet to be unlocked from what I can see, however it is nice to have this bundled as well since I know I will be getting the dance games in the future for the family.  Party games rock!Last summer I was so upset with Microsoft's push to make all games digital.  however, now that I have both, I feel that it is a chore to switch out discs...crazy right?  The Titanfall game comes as a digital download, and how nice it is to say &#34;Xbox play titanfall&#34; and not have to even move from the couch.  Dunno...I think its ingenious!  But then you don't get the resell value if you ever decided to trade it in- so there are definitely pros and cons.Give it a shot, it is a nice upgrade from the 360.  Titanfall bundle is nice as it comes with the free game, very fun and fluid.  I give this console 5 stars.&#34;Prepare to drop!&#34;","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"ahw","summary":"Campaign: Not Quite As Good As Halo: Reach","reviewText":"Halo 4 is a strong entry in the Halo series.  It demonstrates that the Halo franchise is still in capable hands after the transition from Bungie to 343.Halo 4's story begins with a somewhat tangential bit of Catherine Halsey fanservice.  Right off the bat, 343 shows that they know what Halo fans like to see.The production quality remains top notch.  The voice overs are mostly strong.  Oddly enough, the weakest link in terms of voice acting was the formerly less-talkative Master Chief.  He's rather monotone and emotionless--which I get is part of his character but also has the consequence of sapping the emotion out of his speaking scenes.Therein lies the problem in Halo 4's narrative.  It is hard to convey emotion in a scene when the main protagonist seems to care very little about what's going on.  Halo 4's story centers around a two-layer conflict: first, the obvious threat-to-the-galaxy posed by the guys you're fighting throughout the game (no spoilers here).  Second, the race against the clock to save Cortana, who apparently is liable to go \"rampant\" at any minute, which the game explains as basically meaning Cortana is going to go insane then die.Admittedly, I am not too familiar with the rules of the Halo universe, but Cortana's imminent death-by-rampantcy plotline did little for me because she's basically a computer fergodsakes, right?  There's gotta be some 1,000 TB Cortana backup flashdrive somewhere in the universe.  CTRL-C, CTRL-V, anyone?  There's probably some rule of Halo physics out there that explains why they can't create another Cortana, but I'm not aware of it, ergo I couldn't care less if Cortana version 1.0 falls victim to a virus, rampancy, or whatever.  And judging by Master Chief's voice over, he didn't care much either.I'm being overly harsh.  Overall, I really liked the game and give it 4/5.  However, I will note that, in my opinion, Halo: Reach's narrative was much more engrossing and emotionally enthralling than Halo 4.  This is not entirely 343's fault, as I am sure that they realize that there's very little they could do in terms of character development for the Master Chief, lest they test the wrath of the fanboys.  343 played it safe and kept Master Chief a typical, one-dimensional, down-to-business and emotionless video game protagonist.  Now that 343 has proven its worthiness to carry the Halo flag, maybe they'll take more risks with Halo 5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}

One of the characteristics of this game is that it adds even more styles of action, besides firearms and swords, to the mix. Players are free to choose your own fighting style by customizing Dante to your advantage.","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"An insanely hard and fun game","reviewText":"I wrote short reviews for the first and second Devil May Cry games years ago and unlike most of my other reviews at the time, those two specific reviews do not effectively represent my true opinions on the games. I gave Devil May Cry four stars and Devil May Cry 2 five stars... those who have played those games will know that those scores are indeed flawed, so let me rectify them now. My true opinion: Devil May Cry, a classic game, should get five stars easy. Devil May Cry 2, a flawed but still fairly decent game, should get three stars. Now lets get to Devil May Cry 3, a perfect fusion of its predecessors. This game will make you love and hate it at the same time. It is a prequel to the first game showing our favorite demon slayer Dante in his younger days right before he opens his titular demon hunting shop. He is challenged by his twin brother Vergil (before he became Nelo Angelo) to a confrontation and naturally, Dante can't refuse having some playtime with his bro. Dante then sets out to stop his brother from effectively destroying the human world with the demons he has set free. The story is more meaty this time around, offering a larger number of cutscenes like the second game, but with the superior flair and classic style of the first game (and much more dialogue). The graphics are a lot like the ones in the first game, so the environments look nice and detailed, but the character designs fall a bit short compared to those in the second game. Dante in his youth has his cockiness and trash-talk meter turned up to max, which makes sense and shows how much he grows up between this game and the first one. His attitude makes for some entertaining (and corny) scenes of him fearlessly bad mouthing his intimidating enemies and making inappropriate jokes and comments in moments devoid of humor, specifically on his numerous encounters with the female demon hunter known as Lady. While occasionally funny, Dante mostly comes across as immature and annoying, and appears to be initially incapable of having a genuinely serious moment... or simply shutting his mouth. Fortunately he begins to calm down towards the end of the game. Plus, as mentioned above, this game introduces Dante's totally cool and bad@ss twin brother Vergil, who is the exact opposite of Dante in terms of personality. He is a cold, ruthless, and determined villain, as well as universally loved by fans of the series. In short: Vergil is to Devil May Cry what Albert Wesker is to Resident Evil.Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening is a difficult game. The first game was difficult to newcomers, but manageable to those who persevered, while remaining challenging. The second game was far too easy, no doubt in an attempt to be more fair than the original. Now, once again trying to learn from past mistakes, Capcom ended up making the third game twice as hard as the original could ever hope to be. Even the weakest of enemies could take half of Dante's health away with just a couple of hits, so be prepared for a world of hurt when you face off against the large and powerful bosses. Many of them have far reaching, all encompassing, nearly undodgeable attacks. The final boss battle is an especially memorable bout of infuriating cheapness and unfair difficulty. The first time I faced the final boss I was close to tears and died literally 20 times before I finally defeated him. Those who are willing to put in the time and effort will find that this game is plenty of fun despite its raging difficulty. A big reason why is the fact that the game's controls are tight and responsive, though not quite as much as the first game's. The selection of melee and firearm weapons are appropriately varied like the first game, but more numerous. You can also switch between different weapons on the fly with the shoulder buttons like the second game, only the switching is no longer exclusive to firearms and now includes melee weapons. You can also choose between four upgradeable combat styles you can activate with the circle button that expand on Dante's repertoire of demon butt kicking moves. The styles are Swordmaster (involving his melee weapons), Trickster (improving his dodging abilities like in the second game), Gunslinger (involving his firearms), and Royal Guard (allows for blocking and counter-attacking enemies). The different styles let players pick and choose the way they prefer to fight their enemies and not stay stuck with just one fighting style (I personally prefer Swordmaster and Trickster). The music is mostly the same kind you expect from DMC, which pumps you up for all the fast paced action you encounter, with more heavy metal and rock tracks this time around. In closing, Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening is ALMOST the perfect game. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because of the insane difficulty, but otherwise the game's story, graphics, music, and gameplay is what all DMC fans would appreciate. Fans and non-fans should all get this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2010"}

I enjoyed to degrees most of the GTA games, but I never felt compelled with the later games to sustain gameplay. So I wasn't sure what to expect from this game, but I was looking forward to a game that allowed me a change at emulating the Man With No Name (Clint). In most ways, I was not disappointed.The controls are pretty straight forward, and not over demanding. Pretty much GTA. The Dead Eye feature has about 3 (or four) different modes your character evolves through based on quests. Unfortunately, the first level, and last level are the only Dead Eye modes that I could use properly. I followed an online post that suggested hurrying to a particular quest that gets you the final Dead Eye. Most of my frustration in controls vanished once I had that. For those who are unfamiliar, Dead Eye is a limited, replenishing meter that lets you slow time for a short period, and better target multiple enemies. Worth pushing through to the last level.I was disappointed that your character, in comparison to the traditional movie cowboys resembles Jimmy Stewart, than Clint. Your character consistently sticks to his moral guns, so there are few moral choices, as far as I recall. This isn't horrible, I just wish it was more like the GTA moral sways. Seems like they wanted to keep this game less controversial.The world is very big, and there are quick travel abilities, however, they aren't fully encompassing. They don't all interconnect, so you will find yourself racing on your horse from place to place much too often.There are several bugs and design flaws. I fell through the ground ONCE. If a snake or wild animal attacks you, and you shoot at it, anyone around you will agro and attack you - you will be considered the wrong doer. Quests will randomly get confusing, but not often.Being a Romero fanatic, I was pleased to find the Zombie modification DLC. It's, well, OK. That's about it. Not really worth it in my book.I spent a good deal of time, on and off, playing this game. It wasn't too hard to get back into after a distance of time. All in all, this is one of the more recent games that I was very pleased with.Some features I found missing, or, \"opportunities for a sequel\" would be: more moral choice, perhaps a survival mode (you can collect stuff from creatures, but they are only useful in trade and some minor quests), more HUD info, like on horse types for collection side quests (you have to guess what type a horse the wild ones are - and there are a lot of different types).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2011"}
{"product_name":"B005J5K9EI","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A brief fun rental, but nothing more","reviewText":"The Good: Tons of visual flair and sex appeal, oozes style, lots of fun mini-games games and quick time events, fun boss fightsThe Bad: Cumbersome and sluggish combat, only 6 levels, characters aren't as interesting as they could have been, not much reason to go backMost of the time when a sexy protagonist is on the front cover you know you're in for a bad game. Lollipop Chainsaw is actually quite enjoyable if you look past the flaws. You play as the sexy cheerleader Juliet Starling who is part of a zombie hunting family. You must stop a goth kid from turning everyone in your high school and town into zombies. The story is pretty thin and not very interesting because the game isn't even long enough to dish out a meaty story. With only 6 levels you're looking at a weekend rental at best. With this being a Suda 51 game you can also expect crazy out the you-know-what. The game is oozing with style and visual eye candy, but is it any good?The answer is yet, but with flaws. The first issue is the combat. There are plenty of combos you can buy and unlock at chop2shop.com stations. You can buy health and other items like art, threads, and music. Once you start unlocking more combos the game is more diverse, but Juliet doesn't feel like the limber cheerleader she should be. Basic attacks use her pom-poms, but it takes forever to make a zombie groggy enough for a chainsaw kill. I rarely used basic attacks and just stuck to chainsaw attacks. Her chainsaw is cumbersome, and the combat system in general needs more polish. I felt like I was controlling a giant fat guy rather than a nimble girl. Her animations are too long and you get constantly knocked back which means tapping B to recover every time. The combat is just sluggish and not as limber as games like Tomb Raider or Bayonetta.The combat is even flawed with the chainsaw blaster. Aiming the thing is a pain because it always sticks to enemies like there's a magnet. I can't go for precise headshots or aim at barrels. You can use Nick Tickets which are special mini-games that use Nick's head (her headless boyfriend) as a weapon. These are pretty crazy and funny like shooting his head out of a cone like a topper or swinging him around on a rope among others. You can use your rainbow power to become invincible for a while and start sparkle hunting. If you kill three or more zombies in a row you will a trippy girly pose scene of Juliet and earn bonus coins.The combat is obviously the main focus because there's not much else here. There are a few mini-games like pole dancing, jumping on zombie heads, and the few mini-games that are level specific, as well as a few chainsaw dash areas. The 6 levels are interesting and keep things mixed up, but it's the bosses that are all different and interesting. Each one has some sort of musical skill from a different genre of music. Having to kill them is awesome and full of gore and guts which you will see plenty of.Lastly, the graphics are not technically impressive, but have lots of visual flair. The blood from zombies flows pink with rainbows, sparkles, and stars flying out. The game is very girly, but appeals to men due to the sex appeal and violence. Juliet herself is hard to like and is not as memorable as other females like Lara Croft or Bayonetta. She's a dingy preppy cheerleader and is the exact stereotype of one. Nick says funnier things than she does, but the sayings just get repetitive and annoying after awhile. Juliet is hard to like because she acts dumb, and is weak and selfish personality wise. The game just isn't long enough to flesh out the characters and story more.After you beat the game there's no reason to back except for ranking mode to beat scores and unlock new stuff. The game has a lot of potential, but needs some more polish before it can sit among the action/adventure kings like God of War, Tomb Raider, and Bayonetta. The combat is sluggish and cumbersome, the game is short, and the characters aren't developed as well as they could have been. There is tons of visual flair, but the game is lacking technically with some low resolution textures and poor lighting effects. Lollipop Chainsaw is fun for a weekend, but nothing more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2012"}

While astronomers and cosmologists probably wouldn't agree with the game's use of astronomical terminology, it is no matter - the gameplay is awesome.

The gameplay in Galaxy is so good that it elevates the game in spite of the flimsy (though traditional) story, but even then, on more than a few occasions I was asking myself, \"What's the point?\" Unless the franchise can keep innovating with the gameplay, Mario needs some new story elements. It worked for the classic NES and SNES masterpieces (not mention Super Mario 64), but I regret to say it's starting to get stale.Other than that, Galaxy is a blast. And the music is amazing!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00006418I","description":"Wouldn't it be nice to play games without a cord stretching across your  living-room floor, especially if you have little kids or large dogs in your  household? Nintendo's Wave Bird isn't the first wireless controller ever brought  to market, but it's a whole lot better than what came before. You may remember a  brief fad a few years ago with spotty infrared devices. These units failed  because they were a lot heavier than standard controllers, and also because they  required a direct line of sight between the controller and the infrared  receiver. The Wave Bird is much lighter (it weighs a bit more than a regular  controller) and uses radio frequency signals for reliable game control at  distances of up to 20 feet. Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough. The unit will last for about 100 hours of use  on just two AA batteries and has 16 channel frequencies, so you'll easily be  able to hook up four controllers without interference.","reviewerName":"David Kauffman","summary":"Wavebird takes controllers to a whole new level","reviewText":"When I first got the gamecube and logged onto Nintendo.com for more information, I received an outline for a new type of controller.

The box says 20, but the controller goes 30, 50, and people have claimed even 100 feet sometimes. It comes with batteries, which is good because you will want to use it right away.IT has 16 radio frequincies, which can be annoying. You need to rotate the dial on the controller until it matches with the same position as the base and input of the radio signals. We'll take off -0.5 for that.The other problem is the no rumble. I understand the batteries get in the way of it, but it still would have been nice. We'll take off another -0.5 for thatEverything else is perfect.

Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done.

It&#8217;s one of the scariest yet on the seventh generation of gaming. Released in 2008 on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows computers with Electronic Arts being the developers and publishers, the game puts you in the control of Isaac Clarke who boards an interstellar mining station whose entire crew has been slaughtered and reanimated into creatures known as &#8220;Necromorphs&#8221;. The game is played from an over-the-shoulder third person perspective which is similar to games like Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube and PlayStation 2. But don&#8217;t be deceived that it&#8217;s just another Resident Evil 4 clone; it has a lot of originality.For one, the game features no heads-up display and instead places all information that is relayed via holographic projections from Isaac&#8217;s Resource Integration Gear (RIG) spacesuit and the weapons ammo counter is holographic. The health meter indicating Isaac&#8217;s condition is integrated into Isaac&#8217;s suit on the spine. The player can access the RIG at any time to view a 3D map, the inventory screen to manage items and checking your mission objectives. However, the game still progresses in real time so only access the RIG when you&#8217;re certain that the room is clear of enemies in order to prevent yourself from getting harmed.Believe it or not, shooting your enemies in the head isn&#8217;t the effective way to eliminate them. Instead you must cut off the limbs of the Necromorphs to defeat them whereas shooting them anywhere else will have very little effect. There are a variety of enemies but the game revolves around shooting off their limbs which will weaken them, slow them down of even kill them. Never before in my life have I played a video game where I had to shoot off the limbs of so many monsters, I did plenty of games in the chest and head, but never the limbs. The enemies prove to be fast, deadly, scary and it is very satisfying to kill them. This game also happens to be very violent and bloody, if you&#8217;re looking for a gore fest, then this is the game for you. You can even shoot off the limbs of human corpses you find laying on the ground and you can even decapitate them. I know it sounds sadistic, but it&#8217;s pretty fun to do this.The weapons are surprisingly original and most of them are improvised mining tools such as a plasma cutter (for horizontal and vertical slicing), rotary saw, a hydrazine torch (also can be used as a flamethrower), a high-energy contact beam and a force cannon that emits powerful shock waves. The only firearm available in the game is a military grade automatic rifle. Every weapon also features a secondary function so the weapons are actually very unique and fun to use. I especially love the rotary saw and that weapon is very useful in defeating small and fast enemies.Like in Resident Evil 4, the game has a lot of ammunition and items lying around the ship and even dropped by Necromorphs when they are killed. The game also features a store where you can buy and sell items or store them in a safe for later use. The player can also upgrade Isaac&#8217;s suit and weapons with &#8220;power nodes&#8221; which again is something we see a lot in Resident Evil 4. There&#8217;s also a melee attack but it kind of sucks and I never found the right time to use it.Isaac is also equipped with other tools to help him survive, solve puzzles and combat enemies more effectively. Isaac has a Stasis ability which can be used to slow down enemies and objects temporarily and a Kinesis module which allows Isaac to pick up items and throw them which is like the gravity gun in Half-Life 2. There are also times when Isaac has to proceed in the vacuum of space and zero gravity which allows Isaac to stick to walls due to his boots being magnetic. The suit prevents Isaac from suffering from radiation like in real life, but his oxygen supply is limited and he will suffocate which forces the player to get done quickly.The music and audio quality is also very good and got several awards for best audio and sound design. The flaws with this game are kind of minor such as the fact you can hear sound in the vacuum of space which is an impossibility in real life, the 3D map kind of sucks and doesn&#8217;t really let you explore it, the puzzle to solve are too easy and the fact the game can tell you at any time where to go by activating a blue beam of light for a couple seconds which points you in the right direction, but it&#8217;s still a very good game. I know this game was made by Electronic Arts and they&#8217;ve recently developed a reputation as being one of the worst companies in America, don&#8217;t let that stop you from trying out this game. If you are into survival horror and action, this game is a must have. It&#8217;s one of the best survival horror action games out there. It has both action and intense scares and not for the faint of hard. There are even some mini games such as a shooting range and some kind of futuristic form of basketball in zero gravity. I&#8217;d say this game is a combination of Doom 3 and Resident Evil 4 and a very epic game. And no, I don&#8217;t side with EA, I think they are terrible, but they got everything right with this game, I promise.RATING: 9.5 out of 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00008URUF","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Monkey On The Brain","reviewText":"Nintendo has recently started to make it a habit for all of their video games from the Super Nintendo era in the early to mid 90's, be reissued for the Game Boy Advance, and its similar systems, Game Boy Player, and Game Boy Advance SP editions. That has proven to be a smart thing, especially giving new chances to play games that were missed a decade ago. It has happened here with Super Mario World, Yoshi's Island, and to the ape itself. Donkey Kong really took its prime here in more than one way. The game also introduced his partner Diddy Kong, which appeared in several games on his own including the sequel to Donkey Kong Country, and Diddy Kong Racing for the Nintendo 64. Still, the game here made its mark very well again.Donkey Kong Country for the Game Boy Advance consists very well here as Donkey &amp; Diddy try to go through six different worlds and over 30 different levels, trying to reclaim all your bananas from K. Rool, and his henchmen pals. The game follows very well, from its originator back in 1994 for the Super NES. Arguably, the games graphics are very well conjured and created. The game itself can be frustrating at times, only if you're using trying to spell out &quot;KONG&quot; on each level, and trying to access the hidden bonus areas. The game also includes 2 bonus games that weren't here in the Super NES version: Candy Kong's Dancing Contest, and Funky's Fishing. Both mini-games, can be optional to all, but not as exciting as the courses itself. The dancing one is sometimes very difficult to beat and can take you days to beat. Still, they are worth trying, if you want to play those alone. Another downside is the controls. They can be difficult at times to control Donkey at certain times, but thankfully you can allow Diddy to maintain the control, if optional. The game itself does seem like an all around challenge for veterans and newcomers to the ape kind alike.All in all, I suggest you buy Donkey Kong Country. It is just a great game, and I missed it the first time out for the Super NES, becuase I didn't own the system. The game does show a little more promise here on the Game Boy Advance. I truly suggest this as a must have for any Game Boy Advance owner. You truly should consider having monkey on tfhe brain.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2004"}

{"product_name":"B004FYKWZU","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Best of the series, if not perfect","reviewText":"I love Bioware RPGs and Mass Effect in particular, and even if it doesn't entirely live up to the hype I'd say this is the best of the three Mass Effect games.Gameplay is very similar to Mass Effect 2, but wildly improved.  The action sequences were fun enough in previous games, but didn't really encourage re-play.  Here, though, I really enjoyed them.  There's lots of set pieces which overwhelm with hordes of enemies being thrown at you, it can feel really outrageous.  The weapon choice system gives the game a lot more balance (you basically could beat ME2 with just a sniper rifle) and it's fun strategizing which weapons to take with you on a mission.  You can move more fluidly on the battlefield, the level design is better, and there's more emphasis on flanking and so forth.  So there's less of the feel of just walking around from one series of chest-high embankments to the next.  Control issues do remain - they're annoying, but not the death of the game.Jut in general, the game is to be lauded for getting rid of what was annoying about ME2 (in particular, scanning for raw materials), and bringing back what was good about ME1 (more customizable weapons/armor, more feel for the universe than just one arcade sequence after the next.)I haven't seen reviews talking about the atmosphere, and that's one area the game really shone.  Previous games limited it to PA announcers discussing your recent events.  In ME3, refugee camps spill over, long lines form around the Citadel, families cry out for lost members, galaxy maps get overwhelmed with enemy invasions, and things generally get more and more grim.  It really adds to the sense of dread over the reaper invasion.I also very much enjoyed seeing so many characters return from ME1 and ME2, and seeing choices made in those games reflected in ME3's game world.  It gave the game an epic scope, really unlike any other game I've ever played.  Actually I'd recommend anybody to first play ME2 and perhaps ME1 as well, and import the character over.*******NON-SPECIFIC SPOILERS**********The raison d' etre of these games is the storytelling - however it may have been slightly short of ME2.  ME2 was like the first half of \"The Seven Samurai,\" if the samurais also had a lot of family issues needing assistance.  Kind of silly and repetitive, but it did a good job introducing many characters and many worlds.  Rather than pick up where you left off after ME2, ME3 starts a couple years later, with the hero racing around the galaxy, at every stop coincidentally bumping into the people met in the first two games.  Some of them can join you, but most of them end up sacrificing themselves with a suicidal gesture.  It was very dramatic and there were moments I gasped more than I have since Aeris bit it in FF7, but over time it got repetitive and the game sort of took on the character of being in the Imperial Japanese Air Force.There was plenty of dialogue, but not as much as ME2, and if ME2 gave you three to five dialogue choices, ME3 limited it to two or three.And yeah, the last two minutes did kind of suck.  Giving the game 1 star over that is a bit crazy, though.  It's the journey, not the destination, and that's particularly true with video games, and that's also particularly true when we're just talking about pre-rendered CGI that all takes place after gameplay is finished.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

I've always owned console systems like Nintendo, but there's just something about being able to take the games with you that make it such fun.The Game Boy advance is the most fun console system I've owned and here's why:Pros:Backlit (major pro!)Battery Life - The system has a fairly decent battery life, and since it is recharged, you don't have to worry about buying batteries every week.Size - Much smaller than the Original Game Boy advance, but easy on the hands.  When I first saw it I thought the small size and square look of it would be uncomfortable and thought about getting the original Game Boy Advance instead.  The SP version is actually much more like the original Game Boy once it's folded out and very easy to use.  It feels very natural to me.Graphics - The 32 bit graphics and colo are excellent!  The first game I bought was  &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and I was blown away by a short cinematic sequence from the movie that it reproduced.  It was like I was watching a portable TV.  Whenever I want to impress someone with my Game Boy I show them that scene.Cons: No headphone jack - It's unbelievable that they did not include a headphone jack on a portable gaming system.Sound - The sound on many of the games is a bit choppy.  Given what Cell Phones can do now with polyphonic ring tones, and how great the graphics are, it's surprising that they didn't put in a better sound engine.  The sound quality should be at least twice what it is.Price - Without a bundled game, the price of the SP should be closer to $70.  All console systems should be packaged with a game.

Also, I think Airy should have been the final boss! She was way more interesting! All in all, this is an okay game. I don't believe it deserves 1 star, but I also don't think it deserves 5 stars.

I am currently at the final boss, which I have to say blows, not because the game is almost over but because the boss just feels cheap and lame all in one big package or overkill.  The online play takes some getting used too because i is very melee focused.Transforming is great, and character customization is solid...i do wish there were a few more chasis available for each class, as i really want to make a Hot Rod or Rodimus Major.  The level design makes sense, although I do wish it was easier to see the enemy as everything kind of blends in when fighting decepticons, i'm sure it is the same in reverse for the initial chapters of the campaign.As for the multiplayer I wish we earned experience for our classes playing Onslaught.  It is nice to use the game characters online but once you start putting time into  your custom characters you want to continue to unlock their abilities.  as for the online community it isn't too large, this weekend has been an exception as a number of players are on for the double xp weekend but once that is gone it will be hard to find games again that don't require the $10 DLC.  I might buy the DLC anyway but it makes me wonder why they don't make 2 playlists one for DLC owners and one for non DLC owners.If you like transformers then I would recommend buying this game, if you love them then go out and buy it right now if you haven't already.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2010"}
{"product_name":"Logitech G600 MMO Gaming Mouse, White","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"For Gamers Only","reviewText":"The G600 is the mouse a gamer (and probably only a gamer) would love. My son is a gamer and he loves it. According to him, the G600 would be the absolute best, perfect gaming mouse he could imagine IF 'wireless' was an option as it is in the more versatile G700.Let me begin with features that would make some not to want a G600 with the understanding that many gamers would not be bothered by these or even view some as positives.- MOUSE MOVEMENT issues - If you click to fast, something that DOES happen while gaming, the pointer quickly jumps across the screen instead of registering the click. This is annoying and, depending one what you are playing it can mean 'death' to you. See my note below on how I believe I was able to solve this.- WIRED only - The wire is braided which makes tangles less likely but it's a wire nevertheless. Gaming mice as a class tend to require more power than regular ones and you don't want your mouse to give up on you while playing but it would have been nice if the G600 was configured as wired/wireless. The G700 is that way but it comes with much fewer buttons.- THREE-BUTTON mouse - By default you have the right-click, the left-click and the G-shift (alternate settings for all configurable buttons). It takes some getting used to it before you learn how not to press the G-shift and my kid simply assigned the G-shift button to something else and moved the G-shift function to a different button.- NO THUMB REST - My G700 is shaped in a way that allows my thumb to rest when not pushing a button. You don't have this on the G600 because the 12 side buttons take all the space. Again, it takes some getting used to and I know that my kid no longer minds this. He believes that having 12 buttons at his thumb-tip is worth it.- RIGHT-HANDED ONLY - The side buttons are meant to use with your thumb so there's no way you can use it efficiently if you are left-handed. I don't know if they make a left-handed version.- IT'S WHITE - Logitech sells the exact same mouse in black but you'll have to pay more. A black mouse tends to look cooler but most gamers don't show their mice around so it doesn't really matter and I would not pay more for the black version.And, now, for the good things:+ TWENTY BUTTONS - This is huge. For comparison, my G700 has 4 thumb-buttons vs. 12 on the G600. Add to this the G-shift function which doubles the amount of configured buttons and you should be okay no matter what game you may be playing.+ LOTS OF PROFILES - The mouse itself can store up to three profiles in its own memory but once you install Logitech's software you can store many, many more on your computer and load them as you need them.+ DISCOVERABLE GAMES - Logitech's software scans your computer and if it has a preset profile for any of the games you have installed you will be able to use it. I see that they keep adding more profiles as they create them.+ CREATE YOUR OWN PROFILES - Not surprisingly, you can create you own and you can store them either in G600's internal memory or on your computer.+ CUSTOMIZABLE - And it's almost to the point where you find that it's too much. Just about everything can be changed: mouse operating parameters, keys assignments, the buttons color (set differently for different profiles), the 'mode' as in 'gaming' vs other uses and so forth.In the end, no matter how well a product performs, the questions anyone is probably asking are: 'do I need it?' and 'is it worth it'? For anyone who is not a dedicated gamer, the answer should be 'no' and 'no' for some or all the reasons I listed in the 'issues' section above. Casual PC gamers like myself are likely to find that the G700 is the ideal pick because it can perform reasonably well as a gaming mouse and it's one of the best mice overall I know. If you ARE a gamer and are willing to spend some time getting used to it then the G600 is very much 'it' unless you are willing to spend a lot more. It allows you to set (or download) separate profiles for every single game you play, assign dozens of macros of keystrokes per profile, instantly recognize the profiles you are playing because you can set your buttons colors that way. The 'jumping cursor' bug was extremely annoying but I seem to have found the fix at least for Windows 7.Even though I won't be using the G600 myself and I would not buy one for me, I will be granting it five stars because my kid who, as a gamer, is the intended user does use it and he loves it.________________________________________________________NOTE: I was able to compile an executable that appears to be addressing the jumping cursor bug. I can send it to anyone who needs it and emails me asking for it. I will also post the links to the compiler and the script as a comment to this review. The source script was a little buggy itself and I had to modify it a little but it appears to be working now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2012"}

Chances are, if you find yourself here, you are probably a Metal Gear fan, and don't need to be told anything about the superb story. Metal Gear Solid is one of the most interesting and engrossing collection of games spanning across many generations.Disc Two of this collection is the HD Collection (MGS 2, MGS 3, and Peace Walker), plus the two Digital Graphic Novels in movie form. This marks the first time that the Digital Graphic Novels are released in the States. Once you input the disc into your PS3, you will find the Digital Graphic Novels under the videos section of the XMB. This, for me, is worth the price of admission alone. I own a physical copy of the graphic novels, but it's so much better to see them in action with full voice overs.Disc One is Metal Gear Solid IV. No frills, no extras.The voucher was not working earlier today, but this was a mess up on Sony's part. The scheduled PlayStation Store update came much later than usual. The voucher nets you Metal Gear Solid, and Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions. This also marks the debut of the VR Missions on the PS3 and PSN. I'm not sure if it'll be sold as a stand-alone, but it might happen.The 100 page art book is the size of a blu-ray case. It has a neat collection of promotional materials for all games of the Metal Gear Solid series. It's not hardcover, but it does have a neat embossed cover. All in all it's pretty great.If you're not all that interested in the Digital Graphic Novels, then you could pass this collection up. Essentially, what you are getting here is a repackaged HD Collection, and a repackaged Metal Gear Solid IV. It's really awesome to have almost every single game in one box, but I can understand why some people would not be eager to double-triple, or maybe even quadruple dip.I, for one, am very happy with my purchase. 50 bucks is cheap for 8 games and 2 Digital Graphic Novels.The entire list of games is as follows:Metal Gear (Accessed through the Metal Gear Solid 3 menu)Metal Gear 2 (Accessed through the Metal Gear Solid 3 menu)Metal Gear Solid (Digital only)Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions (Digital Only)Metal Gear Solid 2: HD EditionMetal Gear Solid 3: HD EditionMetal Gear Solid 4Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walkeras well as:Metal Gear Solid: Bande Dessinee (Digital Graphic Novel)Metal Gear Solid 2: Bande Dessinee (Digital Graphic Novel)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Rafael Vazquez","summary":"Best GTA game so far!","reviewText":"Man, this game is great. I'm not gonna lie, when I first I played the game, I only did about 1 mission and messed around for the rest of the session and I Felt kinda underwhelmed, I can't really explain why, though. The next day I played the game again, I started to do more mission and more and more things started to unlock like Clothing stores, Properties etc... That's when I started to enjoy the game, because I could customize my characters and vehicles. 'Most'  missions were great, the heist ones were amazing, GTA5 truly has the best missions out of all the GTA games that have been released so far. What really got me was the 'Little Things', The 'attention to detail', it's just mind blowing. For example,  The GPS doesn't work when going through a tunnel, you could hear the vehicles cooling off sounds, when you turn them off, If you follow random female NPCs around the city they will sometimes get nervous, look over their shoulder, and start walking faster etc... There are way to many things for me to list. GTA5's world is the most alive city I have ever seen in any game before. If you just stand there you could hear birds singing, People walking by while talking on the phone or having a conversation with each other, Heli's  and planes passing fly over you, the bass of music in random houses, shooting in other streets etc... Again, it's to much for me to list, here. The 3 characters are pretty good main characters, my favorite one is Michael, though a lot people prefer Trevor. 'Trevor' is just a psychopath, 'Michael' is a retired 'heister' (if that's even a word) with family problems and 'Franklin' is a guy whose trying to get out of the gang life and go for something bigger.  The game looks better than the previous GTA game, you will probably be surprised by how good it looks for current gen consoles. Overall the game is amazing, and a big step up from GTA 4, I really recommend you buying this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2013"}

With gorgeous next gen visuals and style, a unique battle system, and a captivating story, Eternal Sonata promises to give Xbox 360 fans the RPG they've been waiting for.","reviewerName":"citan-uzuki \"citan-uzuki\"","summary":"Mediocre JRPG","reviewText":"This is a mediocre Japanese-style RPG for the XBox 360.  It's worth your while to play it simply because there aren't many JRPGs on this platform.  How much you will enjoy this game depends on the particular type of JRPG that you prefer.Forget this game if you like your RPGs to have grand, epic storylines.  If your preference tend to lean towards the likes of Final Fantasy and Xenosaga, with their deeply-emotional storylines, well-developed characters, grand orchestral soundtracks, and elaborate cinematics, then please stay away from Eternal Sonata.  You will find none of those here.If you don't really care to have a grand story, or an intriguing plot, then you might like this one.  What Eternal Sonata will give you is a battle system that is easy to learn.  There will be huge dungeons to navigate, and many, many opportunities to get lost in them.  These dungeons also have many dead ends.  Basically, the game will keep you very busy, and at the same time the story unfolding very slowly.  The enemy battles in the dungeons are highly repetitive.  Every time you engage the same type of enemy in a particular dungeon, the battle will play out exactly the same way.  It will get old rather quickly if you're accustomed to a lot of variety in your game.  There's definitely plenty of \"activity\"; however, whether such can be called \"gameplay\" depends on how you define the latter.If simply navigating through lots of wrong turns, fighting the same exact battles over and over again constitute gameplay for you, then you will be happy with this game.  If you're like me and prefer your gameplay to have a point (meaning it moves the story forward and unfolds the plot in a logical way), then you will be unsatisfied with Eternal Sonata.Eternal Sonata is made by the same developer (Tri-Crescendo) that made Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and Baten Kaitos Origins.  Monolith Soft, the developer of Xenosaga, had a hand in developing the first Baten Kaitos.  However, ES is nothing at all like Xenosaga or your typical Playstation RPG.  Eternal Sonata plays more like a Nintendo game.  Which the two Baten Kaitos are, by the way.Eternal Sonata is not at all what I would expect from an RPG that was designed for a next-generation video game platform.  There are no grand cinematics here.  As a matter of fact, you will have to do a lot of reading because just about all of the lines are not \"spoken\".  There's very little spoken dialogue in the game.  I almost felt like I was playing on a Gamecube!  As I said, Eternal Sonata is more like a typical Nintendo game, which tend to eschew deep plot, character development, epic story, and grand soundtrack in favor of puzzles and repetitive battles.The story begins at the deathbed of Frederic Chopin.  As the hours of his life tick away, he begins to dream.  And the game takes place in his \"dreamworld\".  There was a lot of potential here to develop a truly moving and epic story.  However, Tri-Crescendo chose to keep the story light and character development became just an afterthought.  The dialogue in the game are oftentimes awkward.  It's not a problem with the voice-acting though.  If you have played any of the Xenosaga and Soul Calibur games, the voices will be instantly recognizable to you.  Rather the lines themselves are awkward.If you only have an XBox 360 and you like JRPGs, then you simply have to give this game a try.  It could very well be the best of the genre on this platform.  For now, anyways.Update (November 13, 2010)I am now re-playing this same game, but on a PS3.  I decided to replay the game and bought the PS3 version.  It seems I may have judged the game too harshly the first time.  It is a very good game.  The gameplay is entertaining and fun.  I would now like to revise my review and give this game 4 stars, instead of 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2007"}

Well a gaming mouse is optical so it is more precise and accurate than a standard mouse. This is important when you are playing first person shooters (or games like that) where every move counts.  They usually have a better button arrangement and programmable buttons so you can access in-game features quickly. They are also ergonomically designed so they are more comfortable so you can spend hours playing your favorite computer game without straining yourself. All this may not seem that important (after all it is just a mouse) but to a gamer it is all about split-second decisions so a high standard mouse is a must.The Sidewinder name has been linked to gaming for a long time and has always been known for quality and high standard.  TheMicrosoft Sidewinder Precision Pro Joystickis probably the most popular joystick ever made and theMicrosoft Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 Joystickis often acknowledged as the best one.  The name also stands for reliability so it was interesting see how the Sidewinder X5 Mouse would shape up.I hooked up the mouse to a Windows XP Computer via the USB socket.  I didn't use the software, it installed automatically.  When I decided to install the software to get extra features, I realized the Sidewinder X5 was not in the list but the Laser Mouse 6000 seemed to match.  It didn't matter; the features are all still there so it just took getting use to it.  This is pretty easy; the mouse acts as standard mouse for most things.  It is just when you play a computer game that it comes into its own.  I had previously struggled to playBioShock(PC Game of the Year 2007) with a standard mouse so here was the test.On playing Bioshock, the mouse was a joy to use.  I set it up so I could have certain features ready at the press of a button so it made the game easier to play.  It was also very quick and responsive to every move I made and very accurate when I was shooting or making any quick moves.  It blows a standard mouse away (even an optical one).  The reason why is because this mouse uses an infra-red laser instead of a LED so the resolution of the image taken by the mouse is better and it also tracks a lot more efficiently (20 times better than a standard LED optical mouse).The built quality of the mouse also looks pretty sound, it has a smooth design and it feels comfortable.Overall I would recommend this - another option is the original Microsoft SideWinder Gaming Mouse but both are comparable in speed.  Microsoft claims the Sidewinder X5 is built to last and it should be good for around 10 million clicks!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong.

I have owned at one time or another, many of the the nintendo, sony, and microsoft consoles, and love them all equally. After selling my cube recently to get a Wii, I recollected my memories of the cube, and pondered over whether it was a good investment.The answer, I found, was a hesitated yes.Here's why.Games-There are about a dozen really good ones, but overall, there is nothing special at all about the cube game library. Unfortunately, Nintendo had no third party support because of it's special discs and development kits, that were much harder to program than a PS2 or XBOX game. That was a huge mistake for nintendo, bacause it is very unlikely that a console can be successful without third party support. But when you do find one of the few rare jems, then the cube really shines. Examples of these would be:1. Super Smash Bros. Melee2. Mario Sunshine (kiddie, but fun)3. Resident Evil 44. Mario Strikers (sleeper hit that was suprisingly violent)5. Zelda Windwaker/ Twilight Princess6. Metroid Prime7. Tales of Symphonia8. Timesplitters 29. Mario Tennis10. Paper Mario11. Mario Kart12. Pikmin 2These games, while mostly kiddie (though a few are very violent), are some of the most fun you can have on a console of the gc/ps2/xb generation. These games alone make it worthy of a purchase, but maybe not strong enough to stand against the quantity of great games on other consoles.Design-This referes to only the design of the system and the controller. This is mostly a failure on nintendo's part, due to a couple key mistakes. First of all, the standard gamecube is purple. It is also a cube. Both these factors make looking at the gamecube extremely hard on the eyes, and those looking for a sleek addition to their home theaters will be extremely disappointed. But the interface of the system is wonderfully easy, and the inclusion of four controller ports made party games easy and fun.But another mistake was the the disign of the controller. First, there is the rediculous ABXY setup, which makes the A button too big, the B button too small, and the X and Y buttons positioned so akwardly, that playing games becomes a chore. The C stick is also a chore to use, because it is an unresponsive nub of a stick, that would have greatly benefited by becoming a full analog stick, like the main one on the left. The shoulder buttons could have also used a second set of triggers, instead of the completely useless Z button. But the controller is easy to get used to, and the big A button does mean simpler mechanics for simpler games. But considering the other two consoles had very similar controllers, this akward controller made porting games over to that cube increadibly wonky and undesireable.Hardware-Im not going to go into details, but the Cube's hardware is generally good, and graphics can almost compete with the XBOX (almost). Gamecube games also put you through much less loading times. the cube is also very reliable, and you will rarely, if ever, suffer through a crash. Cube discs did not allow developers to do as much as a PS2 or XBOX disc, but they work and there is not much to get offended by here. No online play is a big letdown, but the party games on the system almost made up for that as far as multiplayer goes. DVD functionality is somewhat of a letdown as well, but DVD is really not very important, when almost every other elecronic device can play DVDs. The lack of DVD support did not hurt the quality of games, so in the end who really cares?Price-Origionally $199 ($100 less than the competition)Dropped to $99 a few years later (much less than competition)You can now find them under $50 (still much lees than competition)nuff said.Overall-The cube is not nintendo's best effort, and I'm sure we will see much better from them in the future. But this is still a fun system to play with, and still has great value. Considering it is much cheaper than all the other consoles, it amounts to much less than it's competition, but much more than failure. That is why I give it an overall 3 out of 5.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house.

I have played only a few good PS2 games, and zero good Xbox ones, but nearly every game I own for Gamecube is a winner.Yes, I am well aware that it cannot go online. Who cares? If you want to mindlessly battle over and over, on and on, over an ISP, go ahead and skip this console. But if you want true gaming brilliance in GC-exclusive titles like The Wind Waker, Paper Mario 2, Pikmin, Animal Crossing, Super Mario Sunshine, Metroid Prime, and every other amazing game that is available solely on this system, then I welcome you to the crowd of real gamers. Gamers who appreciate art and innovation in development, not pretty graphics and a bunch of shotguns.The bottom line is, if you don't buy this, you will never experience some of the most beloved franchises of gaming in all their next-gen splendor, nor will you witness the birth of countless promising new intellectual properties.Therefore, I declare the GameCube the system for the true gamer. The gamer who would rather play a real adventure on an older console than a slapped-together fragfest on an advanced graphics engine. The gamer who would rather live through an emotional adventure in single-player than play hundreds of identical battles with their friends. The gamer who shakes their head sadly whenever another exclusive deal or hostile buyout is announced, knowing that it only results in less originality.Does the gamer described above sound like you? Then buy this (but then again, if you're like that, you probably already own this console).

Can the company that has changed the face of arcade racers do the same to the FPS genre?Black begins with a video introduction that features live actors and sees your main character being questioned by a mysterious man. He wants information and claims that if you tell him what he wants to hear, you just might be saved from going to prison for the rest of your life. While the story that is there is suitable, don't expect to be blown away by the revelations in the game. This game is all about the intense, adrenaline pumping, hands sweating action. Black delivers this in spades and must be commended for the insane action that is seen and heard onscreen while you play.As the man questions your character you relive past events and see what unfolded. This is how the story progresses and you will find out while you are being questioned. You're a no-holds barred man and do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of the problem. You start the game off in what could seem like a city under attack. The enemy has made you and all hell breaks loose and once it starts it hardly lets up. You are allowed to hold two weapons at a time in and there is always plenty of ammo around. Enemies drop health packs, grenades, and ammo. While making your way through the eight levels, you will experience moments that seem pulled right from the biggest action movies seen. Crumbling buildings, explosions, cars blowing up, shrapnel going everywhere, dust flying in the air, and debris being scattered all over is just about all that will be left when your done with the levels. This game focuses all on the action and does it so well that you can't help but be in amazement and it definitely helps cover up some of Blacks other problems, which I'll get to in a bit.The game looks and runs amazing for current gen systems. This is easily one of the better looking FPS on Xbox and I wouldn't be surprised if some people thought the game could almost be next gen. The guns all look very realistic and have a nice shine effect to them went moving around and reloading. The reloading animations are done quite well and really show the time and effort that Criterion really put into the look and feel of this game. Enemies look good but they unfortunately don't have too many different looking ones. You're stuck with about 3-4 of the same looking enemies the whole way. Levels are varied and wide. Urban streets, dark forest, and old cemetery are just some of the places you will travel through while fighting your way through many enemies.What adds to Blacks great feeling of action is the sound. Sound plays a key role in delivering the intense action experience and giving you yet another reason to play this game. Explosions will rock your speakers to the max. You hear the deafening sound of the concussion shock wave from grenades and RPG's. When things explode you know it and the game constantly keeps you on your toes. The enemies constantly taunt you in their foreign language and they go screaming when you throw a grenade. The soundtrack, while not constantly playing, chimes in at the right time to add that extra feeling of being in an action movie. All the guns give off a unique sound and even when equipped with a silence they give a piercing, silent yet deadly effect.Control-wise, the game plays like most first person shooters. At first the aiming seemed a little different and unfortunately there isn't anyway to calibrate the sensitivity for it. After a while though I became used to it and was killing soldiers left and right. If you've played one FPS before then you'll get the controls down just fine.Now where Black seems to fault is in a few key choices and I do believe if they had just mixed the game up a little bit more they would have had a greater title on their hands. First thing that comes to mind if the fact that there is no multiplayer, off-line or online. For a shooter this is just strange since these games practically all require multiplayer in some form. The story is an interesting one but just when things are heating up, the game ends. Also, aside from all the shooting, well you will shoot and shoot and shoot some more. The game revolves around pure and constant action and that's about it. Considering the game only has eight levels and the action is fast, don't expect this game to last you more then six to eight hours, if that - I clocked in about four myself.While Black does a lot of things great it took a few steps back and didn't really add anything new to the FPS genre. Interesting mission objectives and story really lacks. What Black does do right is the fact that you are almost guaranteed to not find another game this action intense in a long time. I've never played a FPS with this much going on and stuff flying around on the screen. So while the game may be shallow in some ways if you're a hardcore action buff then you should enjoy Black immensely. Does killing nonstop and blowing everything to smithereens interest you? Then give Black a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2006"}

The 360 version crash and freeze while the XB1 send me back to the dashboard for no reason but they are few and in-between.  The achievements are the same and the DLC will be the same for both version but the best comes from the XB1 version since their is only 1 disk vice 2 and the amount of players has been increased.  I have already put 2 days of gametime into this game and I am ejoying it very much that I will buy the season pass only because all my friends are premium members and playing on massive conquest battles with 64 players.If you choose to wait, then just wait for the Premium Edition like Battlefield 3 that will include all the DLC.

{"product_name":"B003C1I0CO","reviewerName":"Gearhead Mania","summary":"Voice acting is superb, great graphics, fun","reviewText":"Batman Arkham Asylum Game of the Year Edition, Xbox 360Having been a big fan of the original Batman Animated Series from the early 1990s, I started playing Arkham Asylum not realizing that most of the main voice actors from the show provided their voices in the game! Kevin Conroy as Batman, Mark Hamill as the Joker, and Arleen Sorkin as Harley Quinn. A co-worker and I discussed the game as well as the Batman universe, and she mentioned that she actually met Paul Dini at a local Halloween party because his wife was originally from the area and recognized my co-worker's Harley Quinn costume. Nonetheless, the voice acting is SUPERB and makes the game in my opinion.Anyhow, back to the game itself! The Riddler Challenges are typical Achievement-fillers, providing you hours of trying to find every trophy/challenge which requires lots of backtracking and detective mode scanning. The game is very immersive at first, it felt almost like an open environment. Once you get towards the middle of the game, the areas start to feel familiar and it becomes a very small game space. There are lots of ways around solving problems/combat, but usually the gameplay is fairly linear. I had difficulty figuring out where to go or what to do next in a few instances.The music was mediocre. I always imagined the Batman Animated Series theme song when you open up Batman's cape to glide and hoped that the game developers would make that music come on when you glide. Unfortunately, most of the tunes in Arkham Asylum are bland. I found the PA system chime to be very annoying after hearing Joker blab on and on for the umpteenth time. The combat system gets VERY repetitive very early on. I got fairly bored of the combo moves and fighting sequences. Since I'm used to playing FPS games like Halo or Call of Duty, I kept wishing that Batman would just waste the bad guys with a few grenades or a carbine - but that's not his style. He seems to be a fan of job security and has a fetish for pain and suffering.Overall: 4/5 stars, repetitive combat system, great voice acting, awesome graphics, but I didn't care too much for the bazillion Riddler challenges.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"J. McWhirter","summary":"The X1 is a great upgrade from the 360!","reviewText":"--UPDATE 12/15---OK, so after using the console for several weeks, here's a quick update of my review...I'm taking my review from 5 stars to 4 stars, and here's why....The HDMI pass through feature...that's a neat feature...but honestly, right now it doesn't work 100% of the time. Even after a 'software update' yesterday, I still have times where I go from gaming back to whatever is plugged into pass through (cable or Apple TV) and I have no sound. And the only solution - given to me by MS help desk themselves - is a console restart. And yes, it does restore the sound...but calling a restart a solution...pretty bad...So, I've abandoned the idea of the HDMI pass through or having the X1 as a hub of entertainment for the following reasons...1-HDMI pass through isn't 100%...when it comes to sound...2-HDMI pass through isn't really a pass through - as you have to have X1 console on in order for it to work...3-Video adjustments - MS expects you to adjust the video on your TV - no console adjustments - this may work for gaming, but it certainly doesn't work for pass through sources...I found the adjustment for games to be way to bright and too deep of color for movies and cable...4-Game clip sharing is still arduous on X1, when compared to PS4...I know they say twitch app will be updated at some point...but today it's still load to cloud, and share via some other source...So for me, it's still a great gaming console...love snapping apps via voice, love Xbox Live, love the new graphic capabilities...but, it's a far cry from being the 'hub' of my entertainment system...______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________I have no idea what people are complaining about - the X1 is a great upgrade when compared to the Xbox 360. For me, the system has worked very well, with few flaws.---What I love---Graphics -Graphics, graphics, graphics. Games have more graphics when compared to 360. AC4, for instance, has more foliage detail, more reflections in water, more boat detail, etc etc....COD Ghosts had more smoke detail, foliage detail, surroundings detail, etc etc.  And graphics on RYSE and Forza 5 are just beautiful - absolutely beautiful!  Unfortunately, for me, I find neither game very inspiring - Forza is a same old race game, and RYSE is nothing more than hack and slash - and I do mean HACK and SLASH - but the graphics are beautful! RYSE and Forza 5 show what consoles are capable of...and it's exciting!In addition, I found playback graphics through HDMI pass through to be outstanding - I have no idea what others are talking about. I've played both ATV movies, and cable movies through HDMI pass through, and it worked and looked great!Voice Control -I love the voice control. I love being able to switch between HDMI pass through, apps, and games, just by saying a command. When you first do it, it's mind blowing. It's nice being able to pause a game, and go right into an movie, or cable tv, when my wife comes in the room....then after the movie, jump right back into the game where I left off...just awesome.Quietness -The 360 was loud - I mean vacuum cleaner loud - especially when the console was accessing the CD-ROM. The X1 is quiet, whisper quiet...it's nice.Switching -As previously mentioned, I love being able to instantly switch between games, TV, movies, etc. etc.HDMI pass through -As you can guess, I like using the HDMI pass through - I am currently running my ATV and Cable Box via auto HDMI switcher through the pass through - and it works great!Audio -The X1 has more surround settings than the 360 - I'm currently using the digital out, with DTS surround.UI -I have a love hate thing going with the UI - the X1's UI a lot flatter than the 360's UI - meaning more things are accessible at one level, which is convenient.---Minor complaints---UI -Again, love / hate....I thought the UI would be better. While the UI is certainly pretty and a lot flatter, and I realize it's going to take some time to get used to, the 360 UI actually seemed more intuitive to me...Is it just me, or is that UI font really small? Goodness...Voice control -Again, not intuitive. In one area you use 'Xbox watch TV', and in another area you use 'Resume TV'....Games -There only two games specifically for the console right now RYSE and Forza 5 - and they are s n o o z e r s - I only play them to remind me of what's possible...Apps -I know the console is new...but there's only a few apps available for the X1 right now - ESPN, Twitch, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Skype are the ones I'm using right now, and that's about all there was in the app store...---Notes---The X1 has the ability to run your entire entertainment system via voice control and menus. it can turn your TV, cable box, and A/V receiver on or off. And it has a cable box menu that you can navigate around in via controller, or voice control.  And setting this up on the X1 was extremely easy - however, after using these features for a day, I ended up resetting my X1 to factory specs and skipped this neat little offering from MS. For me, it seemed clunky - and I kept getting stuck in some help menu while trying to navigate around via voice. I might set it up again later, if they update the cable box menu - if I do, I'll update this review.Overall, I would definitely recommend this console to anyone considering upgrading their 360!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}

Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course.

I never figured this game would end up being #1 on my top ten favorite games list(especially since it's surrounded by shooters, and loads of other genres that don't include the RPG genre), but somehow won over me and I grew to love this game with a passion because it's so f***ing amazing. I have never experienced a game this epic before in my life, which is another reason why you must buy this game(Either for SNES or PS1).

I played the elven sorceress and was able to beat the game.  Having been a DM for a group playing AD&D; with dice and paper in the early 80's, it was fun to see so many of the monsters and some other elements that were a part of our game back then.  I even got out my old, beaten-up Monster Manual book to look up some of the monsters for old times' sake - umber hulks, lizard men, etc.  Who knew that gelatinous cubes were so fun to fight?!  Some elements of the game are not in keeping with old D&D;, but those are largely for better gameplay, such as recall potions (to leave the dungeon, get supplies, and teleport back to the same point in the dungeon a short while later), spell-casters wearing heavy armor, using spells in rapid-fire and replenishing MP's with potions on the fly with the L2 button, etc.  I thought it took the best of AD&D; and made a really fun adventure game.I thought the graphics and sound were very good, considering how long ago the game came out.  Exploring dark tunnels with the only light coming from your magic sword and shield was cool, as was knowing enemies were near when the flaming sword lit up suddenly.  The game had a lot of moments where I was leaning forward in my chair trying to see just a little further around a corner (as if that would help), but the camera and lighting were effective in giving me the feel of a dangerous dungeon.This was my first venture back into the D&D; world in a long time.  Most of my gaming has been RPG's like the Final Fantasy series, the Shadow Hearts series, etc., and sports and other games.  It was a fun, nostalgic return and a really fun game too.  I will definitely play it again and try to beat it with the archer and dwarf fighter.  I'll also probably try 2-person with a friend, too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0021TVYCG","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"This is why you don't release beta products","reviewText":"Never having played the original Two Worlds, and seeing the rather virulent hatred or defense of this, I figured I had to give this a stab. I expected a Oblivion-esque free world RPG setup, which is essentially what it is. However, development and display is where this totally trips over its own two feet, and its a real shame.Graphics are rather nice. I keep hearing comparison to Ps2 graphics,and while its true that the polish is not up to current spec, it makes up in depth what it lacks in detail. Creatures are almost WYSIWYG, very difficult to do if you're planning on making eq drops nearly random. However, there are so many clipping and coloring errors that its hard to go more than a few minutes without encountering some.Audio is almost rather decent. Your character needs to lighten up a little, as he sounds nearly robotic with some of his delivery, as if he's expecting to strangle you and your little dog too during every conversationControl and HUD display is where this starts to be completely crippled. Setting up your controls is painful and while quite a few controls are actually rather well put together (same button controls crawl and sprint, for instance) others are extremely ham handed. Targeting is a struggle, and certain item classes are bizzarely handled for how they appear in the inventory. It almost looked like they were trying to go for a Demon's Souls control scheme, which would've worked beautifully had they used it.Story and characters are where this starts to die. In the opening sequence, Enemy General fights Friendly General, and beats him. And rather than kill him, cripple him, or even wound him, he spouts off an Evil Overlord quip and turns away, allowing Friendly General to kill him. I actually had to turn off the game and restart it, as my brain refused to believe something so trite and dated could happen in a game that otherwise appeared to take itself seriously. And while the advancement scheme is at least somewhat original, its so poorly executed that its a struggle to find your way through the maze of skill advancements.Characters at least seem interesting, but the conversation scheme is bizzare it its setup, as you only have two dialogue choices, which 4 or more relevant options. Some characters have outfits so hackneyed and overdone that they're completely ridiculous, and its a struggle to interact with.Further hurting chances are the absolute deluge of glitches. Graphical, audio, handling, and freezes abound.Overall, this had some serious promise, completely obliterated by aspects of the delivery that totally ruin suspension of disbelief, as well as the feel that you're playing in an epic. A major overhaul of certain scenes and interface could change this from 2 stars to 4.5, but without a serious polishing, this is clearly still a beta game.

And yet, after Silent Hill 4 managed to avoid going to the actual town at all, it's actually good to see a new story told in that famously scary place. And in typical Silent Hill fashion, that story is disturbing to the core.Silent Hill: Origins takes a jump back in time, to before the events of the original Silent Hill. Travis Grady, a lonesome trucker on the road, takes an unexpected detour and finds himself lost in Silent Hill as the fog descends. His exploration of the streets of the town is also an exploration of his past, into the depths of his own psychosis that he hints at even as the game begins. As the story progresses, we learn more about Alessa and Dahlia Gillespie and the history of the cult of Silent Hill, but we also learn about what in Travis' dark past has drawn him to this place, at this time. It begins when he saves a young girl, badly burned and unrecognizable, from a building in flames. He just wants to see how she is...then he just wants to get out, away, far away from Silent Hill and the memories he has.The gameplay in Origins is pretty much on par with the rest of the series, you play in third person perspective as you explore each area, solving puzzles and riddles and fighting the creatures that come out of the dark. Camera control and combat are somewhat clunky, but unlike most people I appreciate that. The characters of Silent Hill are not heroes or combat veterans, so they shouldn't be really skilled or have lots of amazing moves. The camera angles are there to enhance the overall effect of fear, and they do that job well, even (maybe especially) when it means you can't see what's coming up behind you.Origins' graphics are impressive, especially considering this is the PSP we're talking about. The graphics are roughly similar to those of Silent Hill 2, not quite as amazing as 3 and 4, but quite good, and certainly detailed enough to create an atmosphere of fear and creeping dread. The audio of Silent Hill is also right up there among the best in gaming, with another soundtrack provided by Akira Yamaoka -- this one may actually be his best yet!Origins brings a few new features to the table as well. Melee weapons are now breakable, meaning you'll usually only get a few good whacks out of a knife or tire iron before it is useless. There are also some weapons (including televisions and file cabinets) that you can throw at an opponent from a distance for a quick damage. And in a surprising move, Travis is the first character to be able to move between the \"normal\" world of Silent Hill and the shadowy, dark world at will, using mirrors to transition from one to the other. Many of the game's puzzles use this feature cleverly, actually requiring you to do something in one world that affects the other. And there is an Accolade rewards feature that encourages multiple plays through the game to get multiple endings, new weapons, and as many as 13 different costumes.There's a few innovations in Silent Hill: Origins that keep it fresh and interesting, but what's more important is that the core of the Silent Hill experience is here. The things that keep fans like me returning again and again -- deep psychological horror, an engaging and rich and disturbing story, interesting characters, moody music, incredibly creepy graphics, and a layer of pure fear covering it all like a dark shroud. It's all here, and I'm inexplicably glad to see it.Come back to Silent Hill. Come see what happened before it all began. If you dare.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0KP4G","description":"","reviewerName":"Gargus","summary":"I feel like Blizzard is holding my hand the entire time.","reviewText":"The same things I didn't like about StarCraft 2 wings of liberty are back again for Heart of the swarm (which Ill just refer to as HOS) only in greater quantity this time. Don't get  me wrong HOS still has that great polish that Blizzard puts into all of their games, a good balance for the races, a fleshed out storyline and the usual quality they put into their products but it is still lacking in several areas with their old trappings from SC2 back again, only much more this time around.I really don't like how HOS is constantly holding your hand the entire time. I never felt like I got to really chose my own strategies and I constantly felt like Blizzard was right there holding my hand and telling me what to do. Every mission you are guided along being told which place you need to build on, which unit to use, how to use it, what you need to accomplish and such. Some missions do give you a bit of freedom but for the most part you are directed on what to do. I just wish I had more freedom in more stages of the game because to me that's what a strategy game is, getting to use strategy and come up with ways to win and it just isn't that much fun when the game is always telling me what strategy to use. I never felt like I got to stretch the old brain out and flex it somewhat with the game doing your thinking for you. You can definitely tell this is from Blizzard because hand holding has become their thing even like World of Warcraft is based around quests and dialogue that guide you, tell you exactly where to go and what to do when you get there with even raid encounters telling you what to do and warning you before a boss does some special attack. The entire time I'm playing HOS I just feel like it's one great big training level that never fully removes the training wheels. Age of empires or civilization would hold your hand but it wasn't long before those games would let go and let you go off on your own. HOS feels like an overprotective mother that won't stop looking over your shoulder.\"Hero units\" are also a bit overplayed. While it is cool to occasionally play as someone that's very powerful with unique abilities it does get tiring when you spend the majority of game playing as one. Actually building, evolving, creating units and such always take a backseat when you control a hero unit. The missions where you actually have to mine resources, create troops, upgrade them and so on like you would in any other strategy game are in the minority here as usually you have to play as Kerrigan, and a ship and other hero I wont mention for sake of not spoiling anything. Even the missions where I got to play as the hero as well as my regular units I found regular units to be pointless really since I could easily finish any mission with the hero without alone and sometimes found bothering with making other units pointless and that to me seems like lazy design.The storyline which at its core was good and an interesting continuation it feels overly padded that gets a little long in the tooth after awhile. It had some great ideas in it that I enjoyed but there was too much of it constantly being shoved in my face. I don't always need every single detail of everything that's happening no matter how insignificant explained to me. The problem is a lot of the dialogue in the game just feels so needless and doesn't make me feel like I'm learning anything because it just feels pointless a lot of the time. I'm all for extra story and dialogue if it helps you feel more \"in the games universe\" because characterization is important but when it just seems like filler to pad out the game it means nothing to me.I felt too rushed in most missions. It always seemed like there was a timer, or there was always something forcing me to constantly be moving ahead. Either I'm going to be destroyed, some beam is going to kill me unless I slow it down, a giant ship is heading my way, the enemy is going to escape, I have to gather something before the enemy does or something else. Which being rushed goes back to lack of freedom and lack of the ability to use strategy since those missions usually just mean you bulk up on troops and run out as fast as you can. I mean a good timed mission can invoke a sense of urgency and make you sweat a little but when you get 4 or 5 of them in a row, or every other mission is timed it gets old real fast.And maybe this is just me but I felt like there was no strategy in the game at all. There wasn't a mission I couldn't easily finish using just the hero unit with hit and run tactics, or just creating a mass of some regular unit and running across the stage. I mean I tried to use strategy and plan things out but honestly I had to force myself to do that, and forcing myself to use strategy is a sign of poor design because the game didn't present me a challenge by properly setting the stage and forcing me to think outside the box or use tactics. The game basically just sets it up so you can overrun everything easily. Like the game dishonored, sure I could run through and kill everyone but I could also use tactics and take the long way by sneaking and each option was viable and each option was fun. It was fun to go in guns blazing, it was also great fun planning my routes and avoiding detection but in HOTS neither plowing through everything or trying to be tactful was very much fun.This is a game worth playing but I can't recommend it for more than 20 bucks.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002BRZ9AG","description":"No More Heroes 2 Wii","reviewerName":"OoAK","summary":"Good sequel to one of the Wii's best titles.","reviewText":"First off, I was and still am a huge fan of the original No More Heroes. It has fun over the top gameplay, funny dialogue, and trippy visuals. NMH2 expands upon that in every good way possible. My one and only complaint about this game is they ditched the free roaming in favor of a more stream-lined \"click 'n go\" interface for navigating the city. I sometimes enjoyed just hopping on my bike and burning rubber through the city, burning out and popping huge wheelies. But, I will say this new interface does make it alot simpler and quicker to navigate. Another plus is the throwback low bit side job mini-games. If you're a fan of old school games like myself, you'll definitely appreciate this addition as it adds a unique element to an already great package.The story follows the same formula of fighting through the ranks to once again become the #1 assassin. The supporting characters are great, there's alot more insane ranking battles(my favorite being an epic giant robot fight above the city). The fighting system is still pretty much the same, but a nice addition is you can battle with dual katanas this time around. The visuals have been stepped up a bit, especially noticeable if you're using the component setup.Overall, anybody who enjoyed the original will no doubt enjoy this one. Even if you never played the original, you can still get into this game. It even acknowledges the fact that some people will go into this game having no experience from the first game in the opening sequences. Nevermind people saying the Wii doesn't have hardcore titles, it's usually just people who are somehow intimidated by using motion controls in games. Bottom line, this is a great core game for the Wii that deserves praise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2010"}

I mean I loved FNR3 and thought FNR4 wasn't as fun but still passable so this new one should have corrected the mistakes of FNR4, and have improved graphics and mechanics to boot.  Boy, I was wrong.  I'll admit that I didn't finish the game, but that's because the game is punishingly difficult at certain fights.  From the very first bout, I got decked within the first 10 seconds and I thought, this must be part of the tutorial or something...nope, it's just the actual gameplay and I proceeded to get my ass handed to me a couple more times before I got the hang of it.  So with my newly discovered skills, I make it to about 3 or 4 hours into the game (or what seemed like it because it would take me multiple attempts to pass certain fighters), to a fighter down in Mexico who I just couldn't imagine beating so I just gave up and traded it in. I played on normal and it seemed like abnormal because I game quite a bit and consider myself somewhat of a capable gamer, but this one was just painful to play (perhaps a sick, metaphoric joke from the developers of a fighting game).  The reason it's so difficult is because the game tries to make you fight in certain ways during certain fights, e.g., they want you to use hooks during one fight or body blows or whatever they can conjure up, which doesn't sound too bad, but then they intentionally play with your stamina meter so you can't use a consistent style from one fighter to the next.  I was punching away like Pacquiao in some fights without tiring and then in another, I'll throw 3 or 4 punches and tire out for the whole round so I keep backpedaling until I finally get tagged.  This game could have been great if it just kept your fighter consistent throughout.  Perhaps that's what the multiplayer and quick fights enable you to do, but I was just sick to my stomach after EA sucker punched me with this title.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2011"}

The 30% lighter weight vis-a-vis the original PSP makes holding it so much easier and comfier.  I used to need a case/comfort grip (PSP Comfort Grips Black) to use the old PSP -- BTW, the case/comfort grip/screen protect/stand 4-in-1 product in that link still works for the PSP slim! -- to use the PSP but with the new slim version I can hold it comfortably.The other big improvement is in UMD loading time.  It's noticeably much faster than before, making watching UMD movies much easier.  BTW, this is achieved through caching on the MemoryStick, so if you don't have a MemoryStick in the PSP slim, you won't notice this speed-up.Sony also bumped the internal memory from 32MB to 64MB.  Maybe this will help game-loading times, but early reports indicate the extra memory will mainly used for improved texture rendering.  We shall see if any software improvement will come out.The screen also seems brighter than the original PSP's, and mine doesn't have any dead pixels. (My old PSP's LCD had 3 dead pixels, including a fairly bright green one.)Another new feature is the ability to output video (movies and games!) to an external TV, via an optional component AV or composite AV cable.  I just ordered the $20PSP 2000 Component AV Cableand really look forward to watching my collection of UMD and MemoryStick movies on my HDTV.Otherwise, it's pretty much the same as the original PSP: same screen size and resolution, control layout, etc.  Not a bad thing since it takes no time at all to get acquainted with this baby.  The wi-fi button is now located on the top, and Sony took away the rarely-used IR window.One thing, though, is this Daxter pack does not come with headphones or the wired remote control, and you cannot use the wired control for the original PSP (\"PSP-1000\") in this new PSP (\"PSP-2000\").In short, I think the lighter weight and faster UMD loading time make this a totally worthy upgrade for those of us really into our PSPs.  For casual PSP owners, though, this is probably not all that interesting; the original PSP should be good enough for casual use.  Those looking to get into PSP gaming should definitely get the new PSP Slim / PSP 2000.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2007"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"One of the best FPS' to ever see the light of day","reviewText":"To call Halo 3 eagerly anticipated is saying it quite lightly.  Thanks to Bungie, the game has been more than worth the wait, and the end result is undoubtedly the best first person shooter to hit the Xbox 360 yet, and maybe ever.  Picking up after the cliffhanger ending of Halo 2, Master Chief is in pursuit of the Covenant, who is hell bent and heading to Earth.  You'll be happy to know first and foremost that Halo 3 improves on everything that has been seen in the previous two installments of the series, from the game's epic story to the overall gameplay mechanics.  The story provides enough closure and answers many of the questions raised in Halo 2, and nicely ties things up while leaving enough room open if there ever are any more installments in the series.  As for the gameplay, which is the reason enough to pick the game up even of the story were a disappointment, is everything you could hope for and more so besides.  The single player campaign is lengthy enough to satisfy jaded gamers angry at the incredibly short length of Halo 2, but what even makes it more enjoyable is the four-player co-op mode, which can even be taken over Xbox Live.  And yes, speaking of Xbox Live, the multiplayer options is where the real meat and potatoes of Halo 3 is to be had, but you already knew that.  Besides the standard deathmatch modes, there are some new options, most notably Infection, which involves zombies trying to convert you.  New map modes and options really let the player let loose with creativity as well, and result in an incredible amount of replay value that an FPS hasn't seen in quite some time.  There are new weapons, brilliant graphics, solid voice acting, and the game isn't hard at all for new gamers to the series to pick up either.  Yes, Halo 3 is finally here, and it's quite simply the best FPS to hit the Xbox 360 yet.  Whether or not you'll prefer it over Gears of War is another story entirely, but needless to say, there is plenty here to keep you occupied for quite some time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2007"}

There are only two actual explosives: pipe bombs and cocktails. There are only around six different types of special zombies like the Tank, Witch, Boomer, & Hunter.There are no REAL mission objectives in the game - it's just surviving and getting to another safehouse. Also, at the the end of each campaign you have to radio in for help and then wait for like ten minutes to get picked up and have to shoot a horde of zombies until help arrives, fun but repetitive.Even the versus multiplayer is kind of stupid because you fight other characters as zombies which makes it kind of predator-prey instead of a free-for-all or team deathmatch style match.The graphics are standard, but not mind-blowing in any sense.There is no story whatsoever.

There is no character development, plot twists, bosses, nothing at all.Don't get me wrong, this game is a lot of fun, but it's dumb fun, similar to games like Crackdown.All in all, if you want a game that has simple gameplay, good graphics, and is just mindless fun because you get to shoot and kill all the time - then go pick this sucker up. If not, maybe you should lean towards other shooters like Fallout 3, Mass Effect, or Halo 3.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2009"}

You play a series of battles as part of a greater picture, and you command one or more teams.  Each of your units can perform one action per turn, and when you are finished with all your decisions, the computer (or another player) gets their turn to move.  Single player campaigns push through an ongoing storyline complete with its own characters, and often you make the choices about who should command your units:  is this battle map mostly water?  Better get a good naval commander.  No docks to build water units?  Grab a commander who's good with planes and use the airport.  Each commanding officer (\"CO\") has special skills they can \"charge up\" and let loose, and it is balancing your resources with the units you build and the way you fight that all combine to determine your success.  Believe it or not, the above details only scratch the surface of the Advance Wars series.I've played the entire Advance Wars series, and up to this point it's been kind of cheery:  cartoony animations, cute characters, and often missions play out like a Chess match:  \"Oops!  You got me that time!  Drat!\"  This time around, the gloves are off.  Days Of Ruin begins with the premise that in the middle of a global war, the entire planet was smashed by meteors.  Civilization fell apart, and now everyone's scrambling to survive.  Everything--from the artwork to the story flow--has been reworked.  Days of Ruin plays along a darker theme, but is still faithful to the core gameplay that has made this series work so well.Just as with other titles, as the series grows, so does the complexity.  While earlier games would walk you through tutorial levels via the single player campaign, Days of Ruin leaves that out of the single-player campaign (you can still access plenty of in-game  training though), and gets straight to the story.  It still offers network play, unlockable content, and custom maps, but it also adds in some interesting touches throughout.  For example, there are small \"Practice Maps\" that you will find along the way:  they're simple, quick-and-dirty skirmishes that you can play any time you like without breaking the story thread.  Concepts like \"Fog of War\" are now counter-balanced:  you can build a \"Flare\" unit that will \"light up\" a certain radius of squares before your units move in.  Transport vehicles can now double as mobile construction vehicles, unpacking over two turns into a \"Temporary Airport\".  It's intriguing, but it might also be difficult for a player new to the series to get into without some practice.If you like strategy games, particularly when they play out like a complex chess match, Advance Wars is an excellent choice.  Initiates may have a learning curve adapting to the system, but the effort pays off handsomely:  as you learn the ropes, you really start to see how carefully balanced this method of gameplay can be.  Creativity is rewarded, and the planning you find yourself putting into your moves is really engaging.  Highly recommended, although new players may want to try their hand at one of the earlier titles first.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2009"}

You could be a gamer of the casual or hardcore variety, and this game will still be the ultimate test of patience and knowing when to hit the mark when the need arises.Demon's Souls walks a very fine line between love and hate. As an RPG, lovers of that genre might get turned off by this one, as the combat is no longer turn-based or hack'n'slash, but still a unique aspect to this affair. The game is comprised of 5 stages(if you get past the beginning points, in which it will take time). You get a choice of where to start off at. You'll encounter enemies, but if you die, 3 things will happen.1: You have to start the stage all over again.2: You will become a Soul Form and your health bar will get cut in half and stay that way until you reach and kill the level's end-boss.3: You will lose all your souls you've collected, which serve as your money for supplies and experience to level up your character.Just becuz you die at a stage and lose your souls doesn't mean they're gone forever. If you reach your bloodstain(the spot you died at), you regain your lost souls back. However, if you die before touching the stain to attempt to regain your souls, they'll be forever, insisting you start over on collecting if you were intending it.This is not a game for those who expect to go through stages on first tries. The reason Demon's Souls is getting the rating I'm giving it is becuz after beating it this was probably the greatest gaming experience that I intend to go back to again soon, but just becuz I rated it awesome doesn't mean this game will be for everyone. If you play and you hate it, I won't blame you if you quit. This game doesn't want you to beat it, and believe me: This game will do everything in its power to prevent you from beating it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2012"}

It was one of the highest-rated games of all-time, and rightfully so. Now it's here for PlayStation 3 owners to embrace, but this time around, it's even better.Mass Effect 2 is a highly-customizable game that allows you to assume control of the protagonist, Commander Shephard, who can be fully customized to your specifications including gender, face, and even class. The narrative is incredibly dynamic, and as a result you can choose how you want the game to play out however you like.The game looks good, but most of all it has an outstanding presentation. Animations are smooth, and the user-interface is always easy to navigate. Audio is golden, with high-quality voice work from every character in the game, and even a great soundtrack to boot.Gameplay is much better this time around in the Mass Effect universe. The shooting gameplay is precise, and commanding yourself and your squad is always easy to do. There are also some extras in the game like hacking, mini-games, and more, and each of these help add lots of variety.Given the fact that the game offers so many different experiences including classes, dialogue options, and more, you'll have plenty of reasons to come back and experience some more. This is a game that many people play several times over, and you likely will too.Mass Effect 2 is one of the best games this generation, and the PlayStation 3 version is the best version yet.

Some have said it's an RPG, I don't agree with them. Was Mario 64 an RPG? No!You begin your quest as either Lui Kang or Kung Lao, depending on who you choose, and beating the game with Lui unlocks Scorpion to play as, and Sub-zero when you complete it with Kung Lao. Don't worry, there is cheat codes to unlock Sub-Zero and Scorpion if you wanna use them right off the bat. An intro movie plays and then you are underway fighting your way off of Shang T-sung's island, where familiar areas bring back memories of Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat II. With areas like the Pit and Goro's lair, you will feel somewhat familiar with where you are, even tho it's a totally different style of Mortal Kombat game. Eventually you will make your way to other places like the Monk temples, Portals, Out-world, Living Forrest and a few other places.. all in a 3D environment that has been all-round well made. You can work up some Fatalities to do, and be told how to do your new moves when you come to them, however a lot of fatalities are never shown how to preform, so get google ready to look for FAQ's.The controls are very easy to get used to, and set out very well, there is no fault in them, they work great. The graphics are good enough for a PS2 game of it's era and the sound is excellent. The only thing I have people complain alot about is the voice acting, I dunno, I thought it was OK... just thought Shao Khan could have sounded scarier and less informative. (The end movie scene before the big fight is pretty lame)Amongst the game you will come across boss fights, putting you up against guys like Baraka, Reptile, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Kitana, Jade, Mileena, Goro, Shang T-Sung, Kintaro and of coarse Shao-Khan. There is even sub bosses you can choose to fight if you want, Ermac, Kano and Mileena. Noob Saibot makes a quick appearance, as does Smoke who sends you on a few missions to unlock Mortal Kombat II if you wish, and also Kabal can be found to rescue and make you wonder why the heck he is mask-less and sounds and looks like Elvis?During game-play there is heaps to unlock, by collecting red koins or secret medals or accomplishing things. For the most part it is just concept art, which is pretty boring and almost useless to me, but here is why I can't give the game 5 perfect stars. If you select VS mode, you can only select Lui or Kung, you need to play through story-mode and find coins that unlock Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, Kitana, Baraka and Johnny Cage, (reptile?). Those are the only people you can select in VS mode. No Sonya, Shang T-sung, Smoke, Jax, Raiden, Goro or anyone like that :(VS Mode is not like any other MK either, it's a small area like in the game where your moves are done the same as in game... not a lot of fun.There is also Ko-Op mode where 2 players can play as Lui, Kung (Subzero/Scorpion if unlocked) and play through story mode together. However what annoys me is that once I completed story mode by myself, I didn't want to ask a friend to play it with me so we can unlock the rest of the concept arts and maybe a cut scene from in the game which should be accessible once you have watched it anyway. What kind of bonus for you is that? I was also disappointed that the PAL version that I own had Mortal Kombat II removed from it. WHY??? Instead of being rewarded with the classic Arcade game when completing the 5 missions Smoke gives you, he awards you 10,000 xp points instead... and by that time I had bought every upgrade to get, and XP points where useless to me. But what irked me was Smoke still says in the game \"You have unlocked Mortal Kombat II\", but no, I didn't, it was removed from the game... couldn't you at least remove that line if it's not in the PAL version?At present time, I have only completed about 81% of the game. I am over it now, and won't be asking a friend or looking up where every little thing is to get 100%, just to see some boring Koncept Art and pictures of arenas. Who cares? I don't. I beat Shao-Khan and all the bosses and sub-bosses and did all the sub missions, game over, I win, screw your red koins. If you are wondering, once you beat Shao Khan, you can still continue your saved progress and go and do whatever you want again ... but what puzzles me is why you beat Shao Khan, and anytime you return to that part of the game, he's back again and you can do it all over again and again and again... which might be fun for some, but unfair to the other bosses of the game that you can't return to fight once again. Nope, gotta start all over again fresh to do that, and without the abilities you have gotten used to having, and having to play through painlessly again to unlock it all once more... euhh, it's just not worth the time.Overall, great game while you are playing it the first time around. Should only take a day or 2 to complete. But once you have unlocked everything, you feel it's pointless for all the effort you put in. No replay value other than you might pop it on one day when a friend who has never played it before shows a curious interest in it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2013"}

I am not going to spoil anything here, the story is nothing new, but it is solid and keep the player interested in the game. The graphics of Vanquish is beautiful, it might not be perfect, but it is well done and fit the style of the game. The characters are generic but they work well.The game play of Vanquish is that of a third person shooter, you run around in your super suit which have a few special abilities, you pick up weapons and you shoot enemy soldiers and robots. The bosses are giant and there are more explosions than you can shake a stick at. The controls of the game is not very intuitive, but they are solid, making Vanquish very playable.Me and my hubby enjoyed Vanquish allot, the only downside to it is that the game is very short, I think we played through it in five or six hours and there are no extra missions, item collections or multi player to add to the short time it takes to finish the game, Vanquish might however just be fun enough to play through a few more times, but all in all it do not give allot of back for your buck, however if what you are looking for are a science fiction shooter with a interesting plot and giant robots then I think you will definitely enjoy this game.My recommendation is that you either rent this game or wait until you can get it cheap. The game is great so is warrant a play through, but it is to short to justify the full cost of a Playstation 3 game. Oh and before I end this review, I just have to mention that this game have the most creative end credits I have seen in a long time, I love shooting the game developers. :P","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2011"}

At first, I was kinda losing hope for this game after hearing that it wasn't as good as MegaMan 3 or 2. But you know what? The people that said those things were wrong. MegaMan 6 was totally worth it.As always, you have eight robot masters to fight. You know what's different here? Two of these guys were actually made by the FANS rather than the creators! Nintendo Power (the magazine) held a contest for designing new robot masters. The winners' robots in this game were Knight Man and Wind Man. Congratulations, guys.The basic gameplay is fun and unharmed in this game. In fact, there are cool new additions here, such as using Rush as a new set of armor. Using the armor, you can either fly (That comes in handy at times) or use super strength. Other fun elements include charging up your Mega Buster and sliding through gaps.While the game is fun, the story feels a little lacking for some reason. In this game, a new villain named Mr. X has attempted to take over, but as it just so turns out, it was Dr. Wily's doing all along. I feel like since this IS the 6th game, it would be expected that Dr. Wily would be doing all this. After all, we are aware that he is a mainstay to the series.As with all of Capcom's 8-Bit games, the graphics are extremely detailed and cool. The music is also well-composed, but I'm not sure if it will remain to be as memorable as the early MegaMan games' soundtracks.But overall, this is a great game and I think you should go buy it. If a copy's too expensive, buy MegaMan Anniversary Collection for Xbox, Gamecube, or PS2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2011"}

I brought it home and became bored pretty fast. This is what everybody is after? If it wasn't so cheap, it wouldn't be nearly as popular as it is. The Wii remote isn't as advanced as you see on the TV. I was hoping that the motion sensors would actually copy the player's movements, but it doesn't. It just knows when you move and does it's own thing. Not to mention, the graphics aren't as good as the PS3 or 360 and the Wii doesn't release nearly half the games the other two do.Overall, this is great for families looking for fun with the kids or a cheap system to buy if they can find it. If, however, you are a serious gamer, then this will only be impressive for the first few days. Afterwards, it definitely just isn't that fun. The best game is Super Smash Brothers Brawl and you don't even use the motion sensor in that game.

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Wii Love It","reviewText":"When Nintendo felt lost in the shuffle for teh past few years, they definitely needed to find a new way to get back in the console wars. Although they have had a very strong lineup with the Gamecube including Super Smash Brothers Melee, The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Super Mario Sunshine, many people seemed to really be more interested in the Playstation 2 and Xbox. Nevertheless, the company needed to find a new way for gamers to play all sorts of great games. That definitely hits well with the Nintendo Wii. Since the hype grew back last year with the new methods we can play video games, can this new system can redefine video games at home forever? The answer is really YES!!!The Nintendo Wii game system is a new system that really changes the way we play video games. The gameplay on this system is all featured on a wireless remote which you can use your body to move your characters around in new ways. The system comes with a wired remote, a nunchuck analog controller attachment, and has a internal memory where you can store all your video game data. The system does include Wii Sports, which is a fantastic mini-game compilation that warms you up to the new ways you can play baseball from swinging the controller like a bat and a racket to play tennis, to a simple pair of boxing gloves in Boxing that you can use to knockout opponents. The remote also works great for games like Excite Truck, that you can use as a steering wheel to drive your car, or a fishing rod to catch reekfish in The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess.The compatability with the system also works great for Gamecube owners as well. You can also play your classic Gamecube games on this system like Mario Kart: Double Dash, and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. All you need to do is simply plug your gamecube controllers into the specialty port, and you can play all those great games Gamecube lovers know and love. The only disadvantage with this is that you can't turn the system off with the Wii remote whenever you play a gamecube game. Instead, you have to turn it off from the main console itself, whcih isn't a big problem. You also can download a whole deal of great classic games from Nintendo's past into the virtual console, and play wonderful games like Super Mario 64 from the Nintendo 64 system, and The Legend Of Zelda from the NES era. You can also download great games from other classic consoles, including the Sega Genesis and Turbographx 16. You can play classic games like Sonic The Hedgehog and Bonk's Revenge that you download from the Wii's online shop, and just play away.While other systems like the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 are more about the hype and cost more bang for your bucks, the Nintendo Wii really does deliver in a fantastic system that does deliver in changing not just the way we play video games, but keeps the fun alive for everyone young and old alike. Although I had a tough time trying to find the system, it is really worth the purchase. I love this system, and if you're a die hard Nintendo fan or someone who doesn't yet have a video game system, you'll love the Wii too.Price: A-Setup: B+Gamecube Compatability: AGraphics: ASound: AControl: AFun & Enjoyment: A 1/2+Overall: A 1/2-","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2007"}

Fans of the original Star Wars Battlefront will also enjoy an all-new single-player experience that takes players through an epic story-based saga where every action the player takes impacts the battlefront and ultimately the fate of the Star Wars galaxy.Star Wars Battlefront II improves upon the original game s single-player experience with open-ended mission-based objectives inspired from all six Star Wars films. The pelling storyline spans more than 16 new locations many from the Episode III movie including volcanic Mustafar and the space battle above Coruscant. All-new classic movie moments plete the Star Wars Battlefront II experience as players battle within the interior of the Death Star and visit Princess Leia s blockade runner the Tantive IV as seen at the beginning of Episode IV A New Hope. In addition at certain key moments within the battles players can earn the opportunity to wield a lightsaber and use the Force as a Jedi.For the first time ever Star Wars Battlefront II players can engage in space bat and during the same battle board enemy ships to attack from within. Starting on foot inside a capital ship players can enter the starcraft of their choice and travel into space to dogfight with the rival faction. From there they can dock within the enemy s capital ship overtake the ship s mand posts man its turrets to disable its shields and destroy it from within!

Williams \"zerokoolkw\"","summary":"Great Improvements but H-HARD!!","reviewText":"I haven't played through the whole game yet but the improvements I have seen so far are very good. However before I get to the changes in game play I have to say that this game makes Battlefront I look like a walk in the park. The space battles are HARD and when I say \"HARD\" I mean borderline \"IMPOSSIBLE\". Flying over to land on an opposing ship with turbo lasers frying anything that gets close to it only to land (if you make it) and have 10 enemy pilots waiting to blast you when you step out of the cockpit as well as automated blasters guarding vital systems that you need to blow up equals a lot of controller hurling frustration.On the positive side the playable heroes are powerful but unfortunately seem to function more as temporary bonuses rather than \"characters\". Heroes can only be accessed during certain points in a battle and are limited to their own boards. For example you can't play as Han Solo during the Clone Wars. Once a hero is killed you'll be waiting awhile for them to respawn unless you change the settings.The graphics are much improved over the first game but as a trade off (on the PS2 version) the game does suffer from choppy animation and even slowdown at times. As far as sound goes you will still get tired of hearing \"They've captured a command post!\" but having voice actors that at least sound similar to the each of the heroes was a nice touch.Battlefront II also ushers in some new game play modes including the 501st mode which is Battlefront's version of a story mode that follows the storyline of the films.  Some older modes have been given a new amount of depth including a much deeper, sophisticated Galactic Conquest mode and better Instant Action mode that lets you incorporate heroes right from the start (rather than having to unlock them)All in all this is probably the most comprehensive, \"all purpose\" Star Wars game in awhile. While most Star Wars games focus on the events of specific movie or on characters that don't even appear in the movies, this game spans ALL the movies and has every major character, minion, and vehicle represented and playable in some way.

The Battlefield series is the greatest first person shooter experience without a doubt.  The Battlefield 4 installment is another great creative achievement in terms of game play, map design, and graphics quality.  This is in contrast with EA's epic failure yet again at the basics that I take for granted with other games.  The game crashes every few rounds.  This is so frustrating that I may just give up for now and try again in a couple months and maybe they'll have patched it by then.  The origin client is annoying as it takes over my web browser and changes setting that I have to change back later.  Basic menu navigation is confusing, although a minor issue in the grand scheme.  Why do I hold on to the foolish hope that EA will learn from past failures and do a better job?  Probably because aside from these issues, every game in the Battlefield series, including this one, is amazing.Update:  I'm upping my rating because it seems that the issue with the game crashing has gotten much better.  Now it only happens about 1 in 10 rounds instead of 2 in 3 like during the first week.  There's a couple more good points.  The commander mode has returned, although not quite as good as BF2.  You can call in UAVs, cruise missiles, and gunship support; but can't zoom in on the map to spot individual enemies and there's no means for special ops to take out the enemy commander's abilities.  The sea warfare is much improved with powerful patrol boats and choppy waves in inclement weather.  The destructible environment is great, as advertised, really changing some levels as buildings come down.  The graphics are amazing, especially the different optics in vehicles.  In short, the game produces an incredible immersive experience, just still a little glitchy with the crashing.2nd update:  One more problem, the game doesn't support my logitech joystick.  I read forums with many other people having problems with this.  It's calibrated correctly and I was able to test it in another game.  I read that there's a couple of complicated workarounds like binding the joystick to keyboard inputs or editing a file certain BF4 file.  I may try this eventually, but it's really annoying.  Just one more failure on EA's part.  On the bright side, the game hasn't crashed on me in quite a while.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2013"}

Van Wagenen","summary":"The only must-have accessory for the Xbox One","reviewText":"Though your Xbox One controller runs on AA batteries and includes one pair of them, it's so much nicer to have the Play and Charge Kit rather than burning through costly AA batteries. Even rechargeable AA batteries aren't as good, they don't last quite as long per discharge, and you have to remove them to recharge them. It's much easier to just plug in the charging cable when your juice is low.These rechargeable batteries seem a little smaller than the Xbox 360 ones, but worked great all through my Xbox One's launch night. The only very minor downside is it takes a few seconds longer to swap these batteries out than it did to swap out an Xbox 360 battery, but I like the tradeoff of having the Xbox One controller be slimmer and sleeker since there isn't a big battery jutting out the back. The swap time doesn't really matter anyway since you use the cable to recharge it, where on the 360 I usually swapped one out of my Quick Charge kit (Microsoft hasn't yet released a similar product for the Xbox One yet).The charging cable is sufficiently long to play from my couch (8 feet away from my TV). Took an hour or so for the initial charging to finish from whatever capacity percentage these come from the factory. Don't bother with the third-party junk batteries. While the cable is just a basic micro USB and interchangeable, off-brand rechargeable batteries are rarely worth bothering with for the small difference in price. The cable itself seems pretty high quality too though, it snaps in and has a very solid connection, which I like.My only complaint isn't about this product, but about the Xbox One design. The single USB port is on the console's left side instead of how the Xbox 360 has two ports on the front. This makes it not reach quite as far, and is also more risky in the event of someone tripping over the cable. Instead of it just yanking out, it might tug the cord in a bad way and damage the cable or the USB port.I recommend buying the bundle with the controller for a $10 discount though ($75 instead of $60+$25=$85), unless you only ever plan on having one controller I suppose. Amazon is sold out of those at the time of this review, but my local Best Buy and Walmart still had stacks of them, so you may want to try a local store.Update 2013.11.24: I've gotten at least about 20 hours of on-time without the battery dying since I got my Xbox One. I didn't go until it died before plugging in the cable, but it seems to have about as much life in it as the old Xbox 360 rechargeables. Maybe even a little bit more since all my 360 ones are aging and gradually losing their charge, though this one will probably do the same over time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

For those who haven't played any of the previous games in the series, the Paper Mario series is different from typical Mario games in the sense that it combines elements of RPG's with the tried and true Mario style platforming.  Graphically, Mario and the rest of the characters on screen look like animated cardboard cutouts, though this is a lot more charming than it sounds.  For those who are familiar with the series, you may be pleased to know that the turn based fighting style is gone and in place is the typical Mario branded side scrolling, platforming adventure style that we all know and love.  What really makes Super Paper Mario so engaging however is the game's combination of 2-D and 3-D elements which switch on the fly during gameplay.  This feature allows for the player to discover new paths and hidden secrets that really up the replay value and overall gameplay experience, while providing solid and fun support for the Wii remote as well.  The game itself is lengthy and holds your interest, while offering typical Mario mainstays like Luigi, Princess Peach, and even Bowser as playable characters that join our favorite Italian plumber.  A previous review stated negatively that Super Paper Mario is a game for children.  While all Mario games have a childlike aspect and feel to them (then again, how old were we when we all discovered the joys of playing Mario), the gameplay itself is timeless, and regardless of age, is as enjoyable as ever.  All in all, Super Paper Mario is one of the best games available at this moment for the Wii, and further proves the notion that Nintendo's magic touch is as prevelent as ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000MUXLOK","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"The logical next step","reviewText":"This is by far one of the most interesting and fun games I have ever played online. Where the first few games in the series really just focused on the severity of destruction you could cause, this game adds a huge open ended map that allows and encourages exploration of the deepest sort. The element of auto related carnage is still very much a part of the game, it's just not what I would call the main focus of it. There are an obscene amount of things to see and do in this game and with the ability to play with up to seven other players over Xbox Live, the game becomes something that is quite literally insane in its overall design.The sheer amount of things you can do in this game is just mind boggling. There are literally hundreds of events you can partake in and dozens of cars to unlock and turn into heaps of broken metal and glass. The city itself is pretty large and has more hidden passageways and shortcuts than most other racing games I've ever played. This is the kind of game I like because when a game has this much to do and this much to explore, it gives the game replay value in spades. In an offhand way, it reminds me of the snowboarding game SSX3 (one of the ABSOLUTE best games I have ever played and I say that with no exaggeration) in how much there was to simply DO in the game. This is a game that I think will keep someone who's not playing it 24/7 busy for months.Playing this on Live however is where this game takes it to the next level. There's a seamless functionality where you can literally jump online at any point in the game by pressing the D-pad and pulling up the online options. There's something really enjoyable in working together with other players in trying to beat the 300+ challenges spread out all over the island. Couple that with the ridiculous speed and total mayhem that occurs when cars go flying into other cars and guaranteed that you along with your online buddies will be cracking up. You can race each other, create rivalries, steal people's victories... there's just no end to it. Also, now's a good time to mention the Xbox Vision camera's functionality. The game allows you to take pictures for your driver's license and also sends you a picture of any particular gamer who you've just taken down. It's great to see a game use this peripheral in such an imaginative way, something we don't see often enough except in games like the Rainbow Six: Vegas series.The graphics in this game are absolutely beautiful. Everything from roadside details to general scenery and something small like the glare of the sun in your eyes is replicated perfectly and believably. Just on graphics alone, this game gets high marks. The sound as well is off the wall and if you're playing this late at night, your neighbors are liable to think that they might open your door to find you buried under a 24 vehicle pileup. This game sounds great and the music selection is pretty nice, even if you've heard some of the songs in other games.I'd like to end by saying that whether you're playing this game alone or on Xbox Live, you are bound to get a healthy dose of satisfaction with this title. There is just way too much to do in this game and to me, that's better than not having enough to do.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"Mark Twain \"Sr\"","summary":"If you missed playing Halo when it originally came out, this is a good way to get up to speed.","reviewText":"When Halo came out, I didn't have an XBox and so I missed out on the magic of Halo.  Fast forward to 2007, I picked up an XBox 360.  In 2008 I bought the original Halo, plopped it into the 360 and gave it a try.  It was brutally hard compared to the shooters that were coming out in 2008, and had an atrociously unforgiving save and checkpoint system.  I could see why people liked it (great atmosphere, story, controls) but I just couldn't get into it, mainly because the checkpoints were so unforgiving.Fast forward again to today.  After reading reviews for Halo Anniversary, I read they fixed the checkpoint system, they updated the graphics, and they added achievements.  Awesome, I'm in.  I installed it on my 360, and over the course of 2 days played through the entire game.  I rarely get hooked that quickly.Story:  Anyone read Larry Niven's Ringworld?  If you're interested in, or love Halo, you MUST read Ringworld and vice versa.  It's basically a similar concept to Halo, and one of the greatest SciFi novels of all time.  I'm a huge Ringworld fan, so this setting sucked me in immediately.  For a game that came out 10 years ago, when story telling in games was pretty terrible, this is a jewel.  It was way ahead of its time and stands up very, very well today.Gameplay:  The shooting and on foot controls are superb.  Everything feels great.  The controls when you're in the Warthog, which is a minor part of the game, are very bad.  I'm actually surprised they didn't fix the controls.  If memory serves, the controls on the warthog are pretty universally hated.  They should have updated them, or fixed the gravity, or something.  In the warthog you're all over the place, the controls are super noodly and you spend as much time crashing and spinning out as anything else.  The warthog adds size and depth to the world, allowing you traverse large areas, but they just really blew the controls.Overall, 4/5 stars.  It's a great game, and I hope they give Halo 2 the same treatment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2012"}

The controls handle really well, areas are easy to navigate, and nothing about the core gameplay is overly frustrating for no reason. The developers got that much pitch perfect. Graphics are decent, but aren't going to win any prizes. Fighting and shooting are not realistic, but they're very satisfying. And that's what you hope for in this sort of game. But there are some minor flaws that really should have been corrected.Enemy AI is almost non-existent. Practice dummies are what you can expect for the most part. The arm doesn't function perfectly at all times, and this can result in needless deaths. Still, it controls accurately about 95% of the time. So this won't frustrate you too much. What might make you overly frustrated however is the fact that dying drops your characters goals back to what they were at the last checkpoint. In some games this would make sense. But it just cheapens this one. For instance, if one of your challenges is to shoot someone zoomed in at close range; you do this, get the trophy, die, and (although you have the trophy) have to redo the challenge in order to open the next set of challenges. This is especially annoying when it comes to the collectibles. Often times there are multiple collectibles to be found between checkpoints. If you're having trouble staying alive towards the end of that checkpoint, get ready to pick those collectibles up again and again and again.Mostly, it's the trophy hunters (like me) who are going to dislike this aspect of the game. Players taking a quick spin through the campaign may not even notice this drawback. And, even with such negatives, I still felt that this game was a lot of fun. Too few games exist in this era of gaming which can simply be picked up and played, and still be a blast. This is just such a game. A 3.5 star experience, in my opinion. And, since it's so cheap to begin with, invest with confidence.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

Combining two gameplay elements, a first person shooter and a third person adventure, King Kong provides a good amount of fun gameplay and actually has some great looking graphics for being a PS2 game, but in the long run the game is too short and too linear, which is a big disappointment for something that could have been something really special.  As you've heard by now, you play as Jack in the first person shooter elements dodging dinosaurs and other monsters on Skull Island; all the while following Jack Black around.  This element is fun for a while, but it becomes repetitive after a while as well.  The game really kicks into high gear when you are able to play as the big ape himself in a slam bang third person beat 'em up as you swing around, go toe to toe with T-rexes, and beat your chest a lot.  As the game winds up, you are Kong again in New York, leading up to it's inevitable conclusion.  The sad part is, it doesn't take long to finish the game, and when playing as Kong, how linear the game really is can be seen.  It's sad that King Kong is so disappointing in terms of it's length and overall delivery.  However, King Kong isn't a bad game at all, and it's definitely worth a rental at least for those looking for a good action game, it's just a shame that it could have been so much more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2006"}

My cerebral palsy is not severe but it is just bad enough to make playing most video games impossible.  I tried lots of video games looking for the one that would let me honestly enjoy it. To let you know how much I love this game, you should know I brought 3 copies for myself alone.  Once I find something I REALLY LOVE I NEVER WANT TO BE WITHOUT IT!  Also the game includes all the add on content on a single disk now.  I found the General Knoxx content the best and most challenging but I do have cerebral palsy so you normal folk will likely breeze right through it.Being disabled I am sensitive to the needs of the mobility impaired. I am a mobility impaired autistic man. Playing any video game is extremely difficult for me. However most of my friends are hardcore gamers. I am already autistic which means making friends come very hard for me. Most of the people I know (Computer geeks like me suggested I get into gaming to fit in better.) I tried many video games and was a disaster at playing them. Borderlands was different. Borderlands was immediate hit with me. First I love the strange mix of horrid Wild West poverty and Star Trek like high technology that is Pandora. I love how all the buildings and structures have that ugly, seed bar room dive neglected look.  I love how all the characters have a Film Noir meets Star Trek type dark side to their personalities. Don't get me wrong what I love about Borderlands far exceeds anything I do not like. I finally got past fighting General Knoxx he was a hard man to kill indeed.What I do not like is that there is no provision for disabled people who might need longer to process and respond to what is happening on the screen than their non-disabled gamer friends. Think about it for a minute. As a mobility impaired person, man, lady or child we are by physical disability already excluded from most of the phyiscal aspects of childhood.  Now with video games like Borderlands that make no allowances for disabled gamers mobility impaired and other disabled people are written out of the script in the video game world too.  Some video games are not designed to accomodate the special needs of disabled people so Borderlands is not that different from others.Borderlands has no easy or casual mode of game play that might be more disabled friendly so that is a big flaw in my eyes.  What is even more sad is Borderlands does not even need a special mode to become disabled friendly.  The mechanism to make Borderlands the most dissbled friendly game on the market already exists.  The Borderlands shield techniology offers a built in way to give disabled gamers more time to process and approprriately what is happening to their in game character.  Just offer the disabled gamer the opportunity to become a (BadA**) character since they have extra staying power in the faces of whitering fire.I grew up physically disabled and I know first hand what it is like to be excluded from the fun things of childhood due to a mobility impairment disability you did not ask for.  I give speeches to parents of autistic and mobility impaired kids  and too many times I hear the heartbreaking horror stories of how disabled kids are shut out of the fun of video games played by able bodied siblings because, no allowence can be made to accomodate the fact that a disabled kid might need longer to process and or respond to the challenges faced by his character.  I single Borderlands out not because; it is such a horrible game but because it is so much fun and its present form does not have to be changed much to make this the perfect game for someone with mobility and or cognitive challenges.  I single borderlands out because this is an awesome game that would be a lot of fun.After 52 years of life and lots of searching, I am  so happy to finally find a video game I was able to play.  Of course I could only play Borderlands in the early stages where its weapon's and shields offered more closely mapped to the players level of game skill attainment.  If I had a longer lasting shield like those of the so called, Bad*** characters I would have been able to reach the higher levels.  I am sad that Borderlands does not make any adjustments for the fact that not all gamers are quick in cognitive ability or able of body.  I brought three copies of Borderlands because; I have three friends who are parents of disabled kids that need to learn better hand eye coordination skills.  The parents tried every all kinds of \"therapy\"  to get the kids interested in trying to better their hand eye coodination with no success.  The kids saw me playing Borderlands and were immediately interested and willing to try it with my encouragement.  After just a few minutes time the disabled kids were hooting and hollering with joy as they sat shooting Skaggs and bandits in Fyrestone. Finally they had a video game they were able to share with their older able bodied siblings. To see the transformation in a mobility impaired kid was nothing short of awesome. Borderlands made learning to do everything simple because almost everything is done by pointing your gun toward the thing you want to manipulate or access. The controls are very simple and straight forward making them easy to comprehend and remember.Borderlands also does not berate you for making a mistake.  The Borderlands characters are mostly foul mouthed old so-n-so's that berate everyone disabled and non-disabled player alike. All I can say is I wish there was a Borderlands around when I first attempted to play video games in the 1970's. Yes Borderlands is still not what I would call disabled friendly but, it is the most disabled friendly first person shooter RPG game I have seen.  Borderlands forced me to buy three Sony Playstation 3 systems so disabled kids could enjoy the prospect of being disabled gamers.  I enjoyed Borderlands so much I brought 3 more PS3 systems so I could enjoy playing video games against my adult disabled friends so I guess we are neophyte gamers too.  I say thanks to the people who make Borderland's but ask them to please consider making adjustments so mobility impaired people can play as a \"BadA** character so they have the extra time needed to understand and respond to the events their character faces. Borderlands is a great game disabled friends and I love it, but it could be made better.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2011"}

It's truly remarkable.Second, Ops delivers so much content. Again - so much content. No arguments here: you get the single player campaign (about 12-14 hrs.), zombies (which has spawned DLC Rezurrection), and multiplayer (brimming with tons of accessories for weapons, callsigns, different game types). On top Treyarch also released DLC for Ops, meaning more maps and more hours of fun.Third, the game looks fantastic, a clear step up from Modern Warfare (yeah, I know it's two different companies producing titles). There are more shadows, realistic environments, and moving objects. There are also contracts you can buy to increase your stats and your money. The end battle report is more detailed and fun to read.I didn't give Ops five stars for technical reasons and for the new money system used to buy weapon add-ons and callsigns. The game lags sometimes and drops the connection more than I expected. I assumed they would've dealt with this problem before. Also, I didn't like having to buy everything, especially weapon add-ons that I unlocked already, and the emblems for weapons, reticle types, camouflage design for weapons, and callsigns. I loved earning callsigns and emblems from MW2. Buying them isn't as enticing.That's it. Black Ops is worth it. Any reviewer who writes using words like \"sucks,\" \"worst,\" \"terrible,\" or any other dysphemism better give a good reason to back up their argument. Otherwise, STFU and play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2011"}
