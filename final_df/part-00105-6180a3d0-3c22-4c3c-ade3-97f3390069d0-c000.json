Killing zombies, and occasional fetch quest. But Dead Island over does it in the fetch department. They should have named this Dead Island: The Servant. The story is so lack luster, its almost none existent. The cut scenes have no dept, meaning, or real concern. Im a story person,....I like to have a reason why Im doing things,...a GOOD REASON. Dead Island does not supply that at all.The gameplay still sucks. Its like the zombies have a 6ft reach and you have a 1 foot reach. They hit you even when your re no where near them..yet your re swinging like a mad man and you  barly make contact on them. And the zombies still just magically end up behind you and start attacking from a blind spot. Stupid developers. WAS THIS INTENDED TO BE CHALLENGING OR WAS THIS JUST YOUR DUMB LACK OF MOTIVATION TO MAKE GOOD AI?The graphics are ok. Screen tearing is often. The scenery is nice to look,and that's probably the best part of this game.I like the looting and upgrading....but there are far too many flaws in this game that just make it un enjoyable. I gave up after 2 days, because I started forcing myself to play. If you liked Dead island part 1, you ll love this...because its EXACTLY the same, with one character added, a few different zombies and dialog. Its the same ol fetch quest, bad story, horrible control, terrible ai game. New comers....AVOID THIS TRASH. IT MADE ME NAUSEATED.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2013"}

Sneak and jump around. Kill the target. It worked in the other games, it works in this one too.It's the other part of the game that will raise some questions.

First and for most the game looks goooooood, hell just as good as the N64 Mario Kart!  Nintendo knows how to take advantage of what they have instead of putting alot of there machines graphics to the test.  The sound is great as well, same old classic mario kart music levels but what Nintendo also did was add a storylike mode where you play missions and bosses which was another great addition to the series!Nintendo also hit the mark by adding new characters to unlock which you have to do by playing abunch of race tracks and getting first place.  This it self gives the game alot of playing time(man i remember i was playing this allllll day!)and much of its needed replay value.  Sure you thought unlocking, getting 1st place in all and mission mode was enough but no Nintendo even added ONLINE PLAY!!!!  Yes but beware 1000000234523% of the people snake there asses to win.  So if youre in the mood to play some people from around the world just hit up your wifi connection and play till your hearts contend. Everything about this game just screams AAA work!The Good-Hours of playing-Highly addictive-Lots of missions and characters to unlock means you'll have your hands wrapped around your DS for days to come!-Online is a treat, Thanks nintendo-The Brand New Mission Mode is another great addition to the MARIO KART series-perrrrrty graphics!!-A crap load of karts to choose from for yourself-New Tracks for the DS only!The Bad-They could have added some other things for online-C'mon nintendo you could have added some really good tracks instead of some of the SNES ones dammit!..Overall if there is one DS game you have to get this year its Mario Kart for the Nintendo DS.  The game is literaly THE BEST AND ULTIMATE MARIO KART GAME EVER!  N64 like visuals, great music, BRAND NEW RACE TRACKS JUST FOR THE DS!!!

Now the time of writing this review BF4 on the PS4 is having major issues but they will eventually get ironed out I can assure you. But battlefield is a game that when things happen your mind will be blown away. I will be the first time I saw building collapse and just the rubble in the wreckage it was awesome and worth the price of admission. Another thing that Battlefield does amazingly well is the sounds the sounds of distant gunfire your team communication and callouts it's just incredible to hear and adds a depth of realism that other first-person shooters do not have. And I bought Battlefield 4 for the PS3 because it was only $10 to upgrade to the PS4 version (a deal which is going on I think until February 2014). And I spent 30+ hours in the multiplayer and do enjoy it a lot.Battlefield 4 to me has some serious issues in relation to partying up with friends as is not very intuitive and easy to do. Nothing against me is why can't you customize your soldiers loadout or gear when you're not in a game (in call of duty you can do this before you even start looking for match but not in Battlefield). But with these two complaints aside the rest is pretty amazing.Now want to write this review to let you know that for a limited time I think until January or February 2014, you can upgrade to Battlefield 4 on PS4 for only $10. and really on the next-gen systems is really where you see what battlefield 4 can truly accomplish. And I recommend it highly even if you just want to see some of the most amazing first-person shooter graphics you've ever seen. And for only $10 it's a great price for an upgrade to an amazing game even on an older generation of consoles.Thanks for reading!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

I loved the original as well and usually I prefer platform over handheld but I am usually pretty open to trying different games so anything I can get my hands on I will take it. This is one of those popular must have Nintendo DS Games that no gamer can live without. I am definitely one of those people. I got this game at a used store for $20.00 plus the case was free, and it had the cover the manual, precaution booklet and everything else.There are actually quite a few pros and cons in the game itself, so let me start with the negatives then I will talk about the positives,Cons/Negatives and Postives/Pros about the game:Pro/Con #1: No M, W or L Caps in Bowser Worlds:Con: Whenever you go into one of the Three encounter worlds to face Bowser for example Bowser in the Dark World, Bowser in the Fire Sea or Bowser in the Sky there are no Mario, Wario or Luigi caps available anywhere in the level so if you enter for example as Yoshi, Mario, Wario or Luigi then the player is that character and there is no cheat code that can change that, thats the way game is formatted when you enter Bowser's world that requires taking him down.Pro: Though there are no caps if however one is not trying to get to Bowser and lets say you only entered the level to get the 8 red coins star and/or get the star switch star or both then it would be perfectly acceptable to enter as any character but the character I recommend that you enter any one of the Bowser levels is Mario and Mario alone. Though any Character can take Bowser down easily.Pro/Con #2: Big Fingers  Small Buttons and Small D-Pad = Big Pain in the buttCon: If this game is played for too long and you have big fingers then your hands might hurt and one should not spend all day playing video games depending on the model of Nintendo DS or 3DS you have.Pro: However it depends on what model Nintendo DS you have, for example it might not be a good idea to play this game for too long especially if you have a Nintendo DS lite because a DS lite is more of a Nintendo DS that is for traveling or everyday on the go. If you have a DSi or DSi XL or a 3DS or 3DS XL then you might be OK because those buttons tend to be bigger. If you have an Original Nintendo DS the D-pad is no problem or the buttons. But I might be wrong about the DS model.Pro/Con #3: Moves are difficult with the Stylus depending on what mode your playing in.Con: Throwing or Ground pound or long jumping etc are difficult.Pro: But it depends on if your playing in Standard Mode, Touch Mode or Dual Hand mode so I guess if your a pro with your stylus then maybe a more advanced mode is for you, but were all different.Overall that's all the pros and cons I have about this game but I still give this game 5 stars because its like playing the classic N64 version only better for handheld. My final thoughts was why a game like this was never put into development for the Wii or Wii U or 3DS, but you know maybe just maybe Nintendo will make this game for one or all of those systems. I still recommend this game for the Family and for kids its a Family oriented game. I highly recommend it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2013"}

Lucrative contracts on the rich and powerful in high profile locations make killing for money good business.  But when a rival agency enters the scene it's war, and only the best man will be left standing.","reviewerName":"Cobalt","summary":"It's amazing, but it doesn't feel like a true seventh-gen title","reviewText":"\"Hitman: Blood Money,\" developed by IO Interactive and published by Eidos, marks the official seventh-generation debut of the series.  In many ways, it is a major improvement over the previous three games in the series.  However, it doesn't really feel like a true seventh-gen title; instead, it plays more like a high-end sixth-gen title with slightly better graphics.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, however; it's just that if you expected something absolutely revolutionary and mind-blowing, you may be slightly disappointed.HBM adds some new touches that make for a more exciting experience and are also crucial to completing the game on the highest difficulty, Pro.  You're able to take human shields for protection to help you clear out an area.  You can switch from 3rd-person to 1st-person view for more accurate targeting.  You can hide in special locations like closets and boxes, where you can also store dead bodies.  Most importantly, however, you're able to use disguises to gain access to certain areas without drawing anyone's suspicion.  At the end of each level, you'll receive a newspaper article that's been written about your exploits and takes into account your weapon accuracy, the discreetness of your kills, how often you were exposed, and how many witness were left alive.  It's very entertaining and empowering to read about how much you're a \"Silent Assassin\" that everyone is absolutely terrified of.The first level is the most linear of the entire game, but it acts as a tutorial that covers every aspect that's included in the game, so I guess it can be forgiven.  You taught how to silently kill with your fiber wire, how to hide bodies and yourself, how to use human shields for extra protection, how to use disguises to gain access to restricted areas, how to use a sniper rifle, and how to make kills look like \"accidents.\"  It's extremely diverse and then gives you free reign on how you wish to complete the missions for the rest of the game.The production values of HBM are a definite mixed bag.  The Xbox 360 version obviously looks better than the other versions, being the most advanced system.  Agent 47 looks really badass and animates very well, too.  There's some awesome blood splattering when you shoot an enemy, and their death physics are funny and entertaining.  However, overall, it's not as polished as a true exclusive seventh-gen title.  Other characters' animations can get incredibly stiff, jerky, and robotic at certain points.  They can also be incredibly stupid, not bothering to seek cover when you're using a human shield and instead just strafing awkwardly out in the open.  The aiming is also hit-or-miss, as sometimes you'll think you'll score a definite headshot, but it misses the target anyway.While it has definite strong points, HBM, at it's core, feels like just another sixth-gen Hitman title, even the Xbox 360 version.  It's still enjoyable, but it's not a completely mind-blowing masterpiece.  To add on to the missed potential, it would take more than six full years for a new Hitman game to be officially released.  Nevertheless, HBM is a really good game that makes you feel like you're an extremely lethal assassin who kills without a trace and strikes paralyzing fear into the general populaton.  For that, it's all worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2014"}

I just failed to enjoy the single player campaign so much that I had to dock it down to 3.The multiplayer in MW2 is pretty slick. Excellent presentation, great visuals, a deep leveling system, well though-out maps, and fun gameplay. My only criticism of the multiplayer is that is seems to owe an awful lot to Halo...but it is difficult for modern shooters to escape that sphere of influence isn't it? I also enjoyed the Special Ops section, which was fun to play with friends split-screen.The single player campaign didn't do it for me. I found the plot to be ridiculous, and so over the top it was almost comical, except when it wasn't. And it wasn't a lot of the time. I felt that the infamous airport scene was shameful. There was no valid reason to force the player to mow down masses of innocents. The story attempts to justify this by saying you are trying to keep your cover, but that is just too far-fetched for me to even think about buying into. What agent or soldier who is working to stop terrorism commit an act of terrorism to maintain his cover? Shouldn't he be trying to stop the act of terrorism in the first place? I is confused.Simply put, the campaign was just too unbelievable for me. The game sold itself to me as a somewhat-realistic simulation of \"modern\" warfare and instead was a clumsy exercise in poor storytelling. I'll admit there were some large-scale, epic firefights, but what shooter these days is lacking in the epic firefight department?Good thing the excellent multiplayer modes make the title worth having at all.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2010"}

With that said, I also hate to wait for things so I went ahead and got the early access to Fifa 13 last Friday. I'll quickly tell you what's different between Fifa 12 and Fifa 13; whether you should throw your money at EA or simply wait until Black Friday or later.Attacking Intelligence - Translation = Players with higher ratings will relentless run towards the goal without you pushing LB/pass.  They'll usually draw a defender who has marked them and you'll be able to make more plays.Complete Dribbling - Translation = You get to dribble in a 360 degree manner and exit in which ever direction you choose. Admittedly I'm not the most amazing player but to those who are talented at Fifa games you will surely be able to make use of this.1st Touch Control - Translation = Players lose control of the ball when receiving passes and holding down RT. To avoid losing the ball just let go of the RT and receive the pass before sprinting again. This was a very nice example of addition by subtraction. No matter the difficulty, AI will occasionally lose control of the ball and allow you to poach it away. I really enjoyed this \"new\" feature because it did make games more interesting and fun to play.EA Sports Football Club - Translation = Use the EA Points you collect by doing in-game tasks and skills games to \"buy\" virtual items. These virtual items range from boots (only about 12 available), \"retro\" kits (only about 8 available), balls (only about 8), and other in-game \"bonuses\". These in-game bonuses range from things like increased coins per FUT games, \"financial takeovers\" where your club in manager mode is bought and you get a large sum of money to spend, etc. The `selection was awfully disappointing and I'm hoping they add throughout the year.New Teams = Basically all of the same leagues and clubs from last year with the exception that they added the Saudi league.New Stadium = They added White Hart Lane and King Fahd Stadium but lost Nou CampInternational Manager = This is built into the manager mode where your performance at your club will attract offers from many National teams.  You would then be manager of a club and an international team simultaneously. As the IT manager you get to select your 25 man team from the entire pool of international players and then play all the friendlies, qualifies, and tournament matches.Manager Mode= They added in fake World Cup, Euros, and other tournaments. Also you can now play their fake Champions/Europa league in the first season rather than wait until the second.Transfers = The transfers system is given a face lift. The transfer screen is now a note book where you are given new options when buying and selling players. When attempting to buy a player, you may \"enquire\" about them from their clubs as to whether they would sell the player and also how much you would have to offer them. You're also allowed to include players when trying to buy.When selling/buying a player, you are told a range of how much the player is worth or how much you should offer depending on the player's form.  I read that they tried to cut back on the ridiculous transfers, especially in the first transfer window of each season... THEY DIDN'T.  There is still massive movement between big time players; for example, Higuain to Inter, Ozil to Chelsea, Prince-Boateng to Man City. Every transfer window afterwards continues the trend.Match day = A nice addition.  If you're not into playing season mode or ultimate team.. then whenever you play a match day game.. commentary and players ratings will be affected by their real life counterparts. I always hated hearing the same commentary for a year and I think that with this new addition it will lessen the game from getting stale.Animations = They added a few new player celebrations which I didn't really care for but they did include more realistic player celebrations, albeit, only between two players where they will embrace like they did in real life.Impact Engine = This was a great addition to Fifa 12 and in this year's rendition they improved the physics and removed the comical flopping.Skills Games = They added 8 \"mini games\" with a variety of objectives ranging from chip shots, penalty shots, passing, dribbling, etc.Layout/presentation = They changed the presentation this year but I could not have cared less.  The presentation now includes a soccer ball in the background that opens and closes whenever you select things; also when you start games the opening presentations include the clubs badges on these soccer balls that open and close, etc. You have to see for yourself.Conclusion: I think that EA was especially conservative this year.  They opted to \"perfect\" (or at least try to) rather than innovate with another truly new feature. Gameplay is more fun with the \"one-touch\" because mistakes can become costly or rewarding and it adds another variable onto the pitch. The improved impact engine makes the player collision look very life-like and because they took out the crazy flopping makes it that much more realistic.  Although with yet another yearly game, I find that EA has either given up or been too cheap to add new leagues to the game. They also need to add more stadiums.  How can they go through each year and add one league or 1-2 new stadium? My biggest gripe is that I'm a shoe buff and to see only 4 pairs of Nikes and only 5 pairs of adidas (albeit in several more colors)? This is why I like 2K sports more than EA sports, they is no stone they leave unturned. With that all said, if you are playing Fifa 12 and completely satisfied with it, you probably should not fork over another 60 bucks to get Fifa 13.  There are no game-changing new features that will make you throw your money at them.  However, if the gameplay from Fifa 12 left you annoyed or unhappy, then Fifa 13 is worth getting because EA tried to fix the rough patches. Personally to me, this game is Fifa 12.5. But at least EA is making their Fifa franchise better every year and not letting them regress like NCAA and Madden. Cheers.Pros:-1st touch control +++-Better manager mode ++-More realistic Impact Engine ++-Skills games +++-Match day games +Cons:-Lack of new teams, especially South American leagues and the Turkish league-Lack of boots-EAS FC catalog was a huge disappointment in the selection available-Still no licenses to major tournaments-No innovative new featuresUPDATE:-The more I play the Skills challenges, the more I enjoy them. Each of them: the penalty shootout, passing, dribbling drills, etc help a certain part of your game that you would not really have had a chance to PRACTICE otherwise.  What did Fifa have before? The practice arena where you're literally mashing buttons to try moves and ultimately just fool around? Not every one is a pro when it comes to this game and EA actually came up with a good idea to help newer and less experienced players become BETTER at the game they made. Kudos for that.-I find it especially annoying during Manager mode when a robotic British voice reads off the scores of games that are not my own, but simply the ones in the same league. I don't really care to hear a creepy voice talk when I'm playing.. I haven't found a way to disable this.-Resigning players has reverted back to before Fifa 12. By this I mean your players will NOT accept your offers no matter how much money you offer if you do NOT offer them the years they \"want\". So if you want to lock up your stars, you're not going to be able to. This minor detail annoys me because when you offer them extensions and they don't sign, then the fake news reel goes BALLISTIC and says, \"oh, Xavi is refusing to resign with Barca\"...... SMH like that crap would really happen.-I take back the whole \"EA removed the comical player collisions\".  They DIDNT. It does happen RARELY but I just saw Messi get KNEED  and fly 10 yards in the other direction.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000ZJVDA2","reviewerName":"R. Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"Gimmicky, Cliched, and Fantastic","reviewText":"This game has its share of cliche. The dialogue is sometimes very stiff, and your character, Kaim, is pretty disconnected during the first half of the game. The game tries to make his seem more caring...but when he opens up it seems strange and awkward. But perhaps being an immortal does that to people.Anyways, what sets this game aside from other games, and I won't call this an RPG, since you have very little choice in anything...are the stories. The unlockable memories. They are deep and immersive, and they make you care. I won't lie, more than once they had me in tears. The man who wrote them can really paint with words. The stories are beautiful. I read someone else's review of that and scoffed. It's a video game...yeah. It is.The story spans 4 discs, and it's long. I think I'm over 60 hours of gameplay now. It's my first time through, so it's probably not actually that long, but it had a long learning curve for me. I still haven't beat it.

{"product_name":"B000PS4X7S","reviewerName":"R. Nicholson","summary":"Left 4 Dead, a co-op FPS...2008 Game of the Year!","reviewText":"Original L4D review of Nov 18, 2008'Left 4 Dead' is a great new 4 man co-op or single player FPS game from VALVE.The GAME:This game is a 4 player journey of survival; it can be played as single player (with 3 computer comrades) or with 3 other people on-line. The trek begins in any of 4 different locations and ends in another part of town with an extraction to safety if you survive. (or a nice mention, in memoriam, if you don't)The Pros:1.)Great graphics and audio. The atmosphere is very dusky and eerie; lighting is sparse in buildings except for your flashlight (kind of reminds me of 'Doom 3'). Creeping into a pitch black room with only a flashlight to find it either empty, full of zombies or even worse, harbouring a super mutant is visceral to say the least.2.)The action is fast paced and hectic; there is not a lot of down time between one attack and the next. Attacks either by a hoard of undead or a super mutant comes at a fairly regular clip. Half the fun here is trying to find out what weakness the monsters have and what works best against them.3.)Weaponry come in the form of guns (shotgun, sniper rifle, automatic machine gun and pistols) explosives consist of pipe bombs and Molotov fire bombs.4.)You can start the game from the beginning any one of four campaigns OR at the beginning of any chapter within a campaign. Each section of the game is reasonably short, so you don't have to redo the entire game if you have to shut down for a while [see Cons: 2.) below]. Also, if your team dies while playing, you restart from the last 'safe-house' you made it to.5.)The game resets weapons, monsters, and health packs for every new game; so each game is slightly different than the last, although played over the same geographic area.6.)Certain 'achievements' are awarded throughout the game for accomplishing certain things. I initially thought these were a perk or upgrade, but now I don't think so...they just recognize certain 'accomplishments' i.e. setting a 'tank' afire or pushing away a 'hunter', and many others.They add absolutely nothing to the game play and they were not available in the demo.7.)You have the ability to set up a game from the Undead point of view; haven't tried this yet.8.)A couple of nice on-line game features:a.] you can change the difficulty setting ANYTIME; great if it's too easy or if your taking a continual poundingb.] if you have a player that is 'disruptive' to the team play, you can kick that player out of the game by simply taking a vote among the other three on-line players. (I was surprised that this actually happened a couple of times while I was playing)c.)And finally, a truly great feature; You can 'Take a Break' from an on-line game by pressing ESC> Take a Break> anytime while playing; great for a call to the BR or to take a phone call. When you 'Take a Break' you go 'Idle' while your away and your computer player takes over until you get back into the game (by pressing the left mouse key).The Cons: (all minor)1.)A fairly linear game; only a little room to travel off the prescribed path. Yet, in retrospect, having played this game many times, it would be difficult for this game to function properly with a 'open world', given the fighting style required for on-line co-op; each segment is a fairly short 'meat' run from point 'A' to point 'B'.2.)No game saves...none; and this is understandable from the 4 player on-line game. However with the single player game, the chapters aren't terribly long BUT they do require a degree of concentration and work to finish, especially on the higher difficulty levels. And somehow losing all your hard fought gains if you have to leave the game unexpectedly, seems a little unfair; you'll understand more clearly what I mean once you begin to play.3.)The AI of your comrades in the single person game needs one small modification; your buddies will guard you, heal you and stay near you BUT, they won't pick up the extra pipe bombs or Molotov bombs that often sit there before them. And it would be really helpful in the single person game-play if they did, especially on advanced and expert.Suggestions:I can not stress how much headphones/microphone add to the enjoyment of playing this game on-line; especially with communicating with your on-line playing partners. If you can, try playing with a headset, you won't believe the difference.Conclusion:A new FPS that requires 4 player co-operation (in both single and on-line play) to be successful.  You may get away with a little 'individuality' on 'Easy',  but on 'Normal', 'Advanced' or 'Expert' forget about it; if you don't travel and fight as a pack, your toast.The on-line co-op version is one of the greatest games EVER...IF played with the 4 players who have an understanding of the game concepts and are willing to work together. And that being said, having a maximum of 4 players for on-line play is probably the perfect number; 3 would not be enough to fend off the hoards (except on easy maybe) and with 5 players you'd be getting in each others way.The game chapters are fairly short and there are no game saves. However the game play is intense and visceral and you do tend to become wrapped up in the action that is taking place around you.And finally, this is one of those rare games that I just don't ever get tired of  playing, (at least, with the on-line game)...and a game with this quality has to be in the running for game of the year.4 1/2 to 5 StarsRay Nicholson (cujo)Addendum: Oct 07/09\"Crash Course\"...some commentsFirst impressions from a co-op viewpoint...initially disappointing, but better since they've updated it (see comments below).A very short game...maybe 30 minutes or so consisting of only two segments. The map is mostly made up of streets littered with abandoned cars and trucks, and the buildings are mostly warehouses. This added map, although playable as single player or co-op, was primarily intended I believe, for Versus players.This map has improved since its original debut; updates have apparently removed a lot of the excess ammo and guns, making it a better challenge.The finale...interesting and takes some planning (although the final run to the rescue vehicle is extremely easy). Which leads to the one drawback in this new map...if you all die in the finale, you must restart at the last safehouse...about 15 minutes of travel to the ending.Conclusion:Now that the game (with the removal of all the extra guns and ammo) has become more of a challenge, I'll probably play this map a bit more...too bad they didn't make it a full map like the others (probably didn't want to divert too much attention away from the upcoming L4D2).Addendum: April 22/09\"Survival\"... some comments,Well the much anticipated update for Left 4 Dead has finally arrived. The new game is call 'Survival' and it IS aptly named. There are several new individual mods to this new game that use slight variations from some of the different sections of the 4 established games i.e. No Mercy, Death Toll, Dead Air and Blood Harvest. There is one brand new locale called 'Last Stand'; its setting is at a lighthouse and it's probably the most difficult game of the lot.Rather than a prolonged campaign these games are very short; and make no mistake about it, you are going to die. The challenge here is to see how long you can last; 4 minutes gets you a bronze medal, 7 minutes a silver and you get a gold medal if you last for ten minutes. Unlike the regular game, there is NO option for easy, normal etc. difficulty; just the one standard for everyone; \"brutal\" might be a good name for this newness addition.In the regular game you get attacked by hordes of zombies, with an occasional smoker, hunter or tank thrown in, but usually not all at once. However in this game, you get attacked by ALL types of infected, all at once. In addition, there is no long stretch to outrun a tank; not that that matters, as you are fighting the horde, smokers and hunters the same time as your trying to fight off the tank...yup, just about impossible.Impression:Intense...yes. Gut wrenching...yes. FUN...hmmm, I'm not sure. One of the great strengths of on-line Left 4 Dead was the co-op fighting style needed to get through the advanced and expert campaigns. Here in 'Survival', co-op is needed but somehow, after a battle that begins with about 1 minute of 'easy', all chaos breaks-out. And because your being attacked from all side by ALL types of infected, the co-op gaming style, that made the regular L4D sooo enjoyable, is gone; gone because at this point, it becomes a game of personal survival, rather than the group...and that's the real shortcoming of this update.And finally, I could play the regular on-line L4D for hours and never (well almost never) get tired. But with this game, I found that not only did it take quite a lot of time/effort to strategically set up gas cans, propane tanks etc. in the area you want to TRY to defend, but also, that after 3 or 4 tries I was  frustrated, weary and eager to return to the regular game.I must admit, in fairness, that I've never been a great fan of time based/get the highest score, type games, so I'm probably a little prejudiced. I'll continue to 'give this a go' for a while; maybe it'll turn out to be a great game. But somehow, I think I'd have liked a new regular campaign map better.R.N.

With Kinect you will need as much room as possible in front of your TV. I've found that even 8 feet away, while playable, still isn't ideal. You really need like 10-11 feet away from the Kinect for the best experience with todays Kinect and 360 firmware. The extra foot is needed for some buffer when you accidentally move out of the zone, preventing you from hitting furniture.

This game is by no means perfect, but I believe its alot better than people give it credit for. I will say that I love hack-n-slash / MMORPGs games more than any other genre, but I never played the previous Dungeon Siege games.Pros:-Each of the four characters is very different and has a different playing style-You get to choose an NPC to play along with you, this gives several different combinations of a party-The NPC side kick is very helpful in combat and picks up loot-Many people have said the game is around 12 hours. I disagree. The game is easily 15 hours, especially if you take time to interact with characters. This is short, but its also has a positive side. Your character is constantly developing during gameplay. Theres no grinding or dull moments. And interestingly enough, you can easily beat fallout 3 in 7 hours if you dont take time to enjoy the story.-The environments are gorgeous and diverse-Your choices have an impact on the story-All the skills learned can be useful depending on gameplay style-loading times are almost non-existent-I actually found several items at a merchant worth purchasing-blocking and dodging add depth to gameplay-Also there is an enhanced mode of each skill that can be used-There are two different stances for each character, each with different skills-This is not something many people notice, but the online system is very easy to use. With the click of a button you can make your game public, private, or offline.Cons:-Online mode was half hearted at best. The loot system is first come first serve. This needs to be done away with.-Although there are 3 difficulties, you dont carry one character to the next difficulty keeping their equipment. You can switch difficulties anytime during the game. This kills replay value.-Alot of attack / dodge /attack / dodge-As with alot of games, I believe there needs to be a much better tutorial explaining specific aspects of combat.-The world is closed, not painfully so like FF13, but its nothing compared to Sacred / Diablo-All skills have pre-assigned buttons. This is completely uneccessary, the player should assign the layoutWhat the game needs:-The game needs to have a more open world, Period. With this, a higher difficulty setting that opens up after each play through.-There needs to be a way to continuously develop a character. In Dungeon Siege III your character and skills are fully developed by the end of the game.-The loot needs to be randomly assigned during multiplayer, not first come first serve.In conclusion, if you give this game a chance, you will enjoy it. Its not revolutionary nor is it the best. But it will provide you with a quality 15 hours of entertainment. More so if you play through with each character.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2012"}

E Jackson","summary":"dated video game system","reviewText":"The Saturn was a briefly popular 32-bit video game system created by Sega in the 90's.  It was designed to compete with the Sony Playstation and Nintendo 64.  Unfortunately for Sega, the Saturn ranks a distant third in terms of enjoyment value.Looking back, I'd say the Sega Saturn really isn't that bad a system.  I used to play it with my friend and I'd say I had a *little* fun.  It's just that Sony was pumping out an *unbelievable* amount of excellent games during the EXACT time Sega was trying to market the Saturn and, as you know, Sony came out of nowhere and grabbed the attention of millions and millions of video game fans.  This made it VERY hard for Sega to keep up with the surprising success of the Playstation.  Sony wasn't fooling around back then- they were on a mission to dominate the video game market and BOY did they ever succeed.  It permanently changed the video game scene; destroying the console wars between Nintendo and Sega.  Sony coming out of nowhere and almost *immediately* ruling the market pretty much spelled the end of Nintendo and Sega being the only two video game companies competing with each other.  Now a THIRD company entered the mix.  To put it another way- Sony temporarily brought Nintendo to its knees and, in the process, knocked out Sega forever.  Sega was never able to recover from the damage Sony had done.  Everyone thought Nintendo would be the company to destroy Sega.  Nope!  Nintendo came close a few times, though.  With Sega's well-known history of bad marketing techniques, this might have been for the best.  I bet Sega would have continued to struggle if they had made the decision to keep themselves in the console-releasing market after the Dreamcast was finished.  I bet Sega would be looking pretty ugly right now, in terms of sales.  Good thing they pulled away.Because the Sega Saturn didn't have a long life, the few people out there who actually own one HAVE to notice its main weak point- not very many games to choose from.  The good Saturn games you CAN choose from are either really rare and expensive, or import games never released in America. That's the biggest problem with the Saturn.  Just not enough.To give Sega credit, the Saturn DOES have some quality games such as Virtua Fighter 2, Guardian Heroes, Radiant Silvergun, Shining Force III, Sonic Jam, Nights and Dracula X.  BUT- and here's the important thing I want you to remember- it would be IMPOSSIBLE to ignore the many crappy games released for the Saturn.  Worthless games such as Corpse Killer, Bug Too!, Incredible Hulk: The Pantheon Saga, Hi-Octane, G-Vector and The House of the Dead don't exactly show off the Saturn's amazing capabilities.  Also keep in mind that the Sega Saturn was an *extremely* awful system when it came to sports games.  Just about every basketball and hockey game released for the system isn't worth a darn.  To me that's surprising when you consider the Sega Genesis was known at one point as the best video game system for sports games.  You'd think Sega would have continued the trend of releasing quality sports games for the Saturn, but they didn't.  Another disappointment.Everyone likes to point out that the Playstation is the video game system with the highest amount of crappy games.  That's only because Sega gave up halfway through the competition with the Playstation.  Argue with me if you must, but the Saturn was basically dead by the end of 1997.  The Playstation was just getting warmed up by that point.  If the Saturn had continued to compete with the Playstation until say, the year 2000, the Saturn probably would've ended up with JUST as many horrible games.  Sega gave up in 1997 when it finally dawned on them that Sony was putting them out of business.Mostly jealous Sega fanboys like to point out the high amount of terrible Playstation games, while Playstation fans correctly understand that you have to sort through a lot of junk to get to the GOOD games- and believe me, the Playstation had a LOT of good games.  In fact, the best Playstation games are better than the best Saturn games, in my opinion.  Give me Silent Hill and Resident Evil 2 over Nights and Shining Force III ANY day.  It's a shame Sega fans will never stop defending the Saturn with the same old argument.  Time to give it a rest.In case you haven't noticed already, it bothers me that Sega fans don't seem to mind all the junk that was released for the Saturn and instead point out all the crappy games available for the Playstation.  That's like saying the mosquitos in Miami aren't NEARLY as bad as the ones in Tampa Bay.  Doesn't make much sense does it?  So why am I defending the Playstation's crappy games?  Because I find it a little bit inaccurate (and rude, to be honest) that Sega fans completely ignore the crappy games available for the Saturn and instead focus on the crappy games for the Playstation 1.  I just want to point out that yes, the Saturn DOES have its share of horrible games as well, despite what Sega fans would like you to believe.I think Sega fans are confused when they say overall, Saturn games feature less loading times than the Playstation.  For a supposedly powerful video game system, you sure had to wait a LONG time to play a game on the Saturn.  For example, you have to sit there for an eternity to play games like WWF: Wrestlemania: the Arcade Game and Mortal Kombat Trilogy.  Compare those loading times to the same games on the Playstation, and the wait isn't NEARLY as inconvenient.What makes the lengthy loading times on the Sega Saturn even MORE frustrating is how, right after the \"now loading\" screen goes away, the screen turns black for a few seconds making you wait even LONGER.  There's no 3-seconds of blackness on the Playstation.  The *very* second the loading screen goes away on ANY Playstation game, the actual game comes in.  Sega fans like to pretend those few additional seconds of loading aren't happening.  Trust me Sega fans, I DO notice them.  I DO realize that I'm waiting 3 extra unnecessary seconds to play the darn game.  The Saturn is MUCH worse when it comes to loading times.  It's SO slow.  None of this matters anyway, because by the end of 1997 loading times were almost completely gone anyway!  If only the Saturn had survived long enough to see that.Besides the loading problem, most of the time the Playstation had the superior version when the same game was released for both systems.  This was because the graphics were always clean and sparkly on the Playstation.  On the Saturn, after they finished creating a game it was like they rubbed the graphic engine in the dirt.  Either that, or the person who put the colors in all the Saturn games could only see in black and white.  All the bland, colorless backgrounds on most Saturn games make me feel like I'm digging a hole to China.  Poor, severely-dated graphics.  For a good example, compare the two versions of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  Once again, the Playstation version smears it.  The Saturn version features ugly, grainy and ugly-colored graphics.  If a game appears on both the Saturn and Playstation, compare the graphics and I guarantee the Playstation version will look better.I can think of only one thing the Saturn did better than Sony- the CD Player built into the system is actually more interesting on the Saturn.  On the Playstation it's just a boring, predictable layout of hitting \"Play\" \"Pause\" \"Forward\" etc.  On the Saturn you have a LOT more options, and the neat-looking background showing a countless amount of shooting stars is pretty impressive to watch while you sit back and listen to the music from the CD you put on.  None of this means the actual quality of the CD player on the Saturn is better- just that the outer space background and addition of more options makes it LOOK better.  They both play CD's very well.It's a shame the Saturn couldn't hang with the big boys.  It couldn't hang around long enough to see sequels to many popular games such as Resident Evil, Mega Man and Tomb Raider.  All those sequels went to the Playstation and turned out to be VERY successful.  If a game like Resident Evil 2 had appeared on the Saturn, who knows how successful it would have been.  Sony seriously put a hurtin' on Sega.Funny how the Playstation's gray-colored ordinary-looking system design is actually more attractive than the Saturn's silky-black \"cool\" color.  What's that expression?  Never judge a book by its cover.  Right!  I think back to that Sega commercial ten years ago showing a Playstation falling from a building and a guys voice saying \"fly, play thing, fly\".  hahahahahahahahaHAHAHA!!!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2006"}

Happens about 20% of the time - an example of what I mean is I had to cross this field on foot with a chopper chasing me.  The nearest farm house for cover was a long way away - I had to run for literally minutes and several times kept getting killed before a checkpoint and.... you guessed it, after running for minutes and then getting killed, I respawn where I started and had to run for minutes again.

The grim Necromancers worship in the wastelands of Heresh...and the ravenous demons are immured in Sheogh, their prison world.    During certain lunar eclipses the walls of Sheogh weaken and demons burst forth, plunging Ashan into war. And since the dawn of times, the demon legions have been repelled by the allies thanks to a powerful artifact known as the Blade of Binding.    Once again the armies of Sheogh are coming and the Blade will be wielded...     Your journey in the world of Might and Magic will be punctuated with riddles, extraordinary encounters and epic battles against creatures searching for some fresh hero blood. Your hero will travel thanks to a node system, so watch your step as some of these nodes might trigger special actions, hide terrifying traps or even legendary treasures such as forgotten artifacts or secret units.    To stand a chance against your enemies, your hero will have to equip magical artifacts and build up the most powerful army. Your army will be composed of Core, Elite and Champion units, each of them having specific sizes, strengths and abilities. It&#x2019;s up to you to choose wisely each of these units combined to the appropriate artifact and work out the best strategy to wipe out your enemies.    While roaming around Ashan or winning battles, you will discover new artifacts and gather different types of resources such as Ore, Gold and Blood Crystals. These earnings can be used to buy new Elite or Champion units for your army through specific Creature Dwelling buildings. Make sure to look everywhere as you will be able to unlock and collect powerful hidden units and artifacts!    You will be confronted with many challenges such as defeating the enemy heroes by crossing their armies in standard battles or launching into special challenges and Boss fights where your strategic skills will be put to a severe test.

Of the three, this one is definitely my favorite.  Subrtract the bejeweled/match 3 gameplay of the first two and trade it for a completely different setup.Although you do \"match 3\" in this game, it's nothing like what you might think.  As you play through the campaign you acquire various units to use in battle (each having their own stats).  You combine the same color/units vertically to create an attack formation that will unleash on the opponent in a set number of turns (depending on the unit type) to deal damage to their units and hopefully the enemy Hero's HP if you can get through everything else.  Horizontal formations create walls for defense.There are artifacts to wear, providing different effects, and each hero has a unique spell at his/her command after enough damage has been delt/taken.  There are larger units that are more powerful, but if they are destroyed by your enemies you must buy more to keep from running out.  There is no exploration in Might and Magic: Clash of Heroes, so it's very similar to Puzzle Quest in that you move from point to point (although you're moving through cities and dungeons rather than across the entire world map).  There are random battles to encounter for leveling up/earning gold and there are sidequests to acquire new artifacts and treasure.The graphics are beautiful and the story is actually pretty decent.  The music is appropriate, but nothing special if you ask me.  You play each hero separately (all part of the same story, though) as you progress through the game, and after finishing with 1 character and working on my second I have already played over 8 hours.  Playtime seems pretty impressive so far.  You can also play multiplayer locally, although there is no wireless play.  There is also an option for a quick game just for some fun battling that doesn't impact the story.  Nothing about Might and Magic leaves me with any complaints to speak of, so this is definitely one of my most recommended titles.Overall: 9.5/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2010"}

This has been the standard (for the most part) ever since.  Second, the story in FFIV is outstanding, and even surpasses other FF titles that have come out on next gen systems.  Third, the game has been given all new voice acting, been retranslated, and made much harder than previous releases of FFII (the US got the \"easy\" version).Graphically, this game pushes the limit of the DS.  Both the CGI's and the Summon animations are outstanding.  Backgrounds have been enhanced and look nothing like the blocky SNES ones.As for sound, FFII had a great score (again, some would consider it the best of the FF games), and while some found the voice acting terrible, I had absolutely no problem with it and it added to the experience.For the DS, a new Augment system was added, and pretty much is mandatory to learn and use if you want to beat the two new optional bosses in the game.  It definitely adds a new level to strategy (and, you have to play through THREE times to get all the augments and special bosses!).  The replay value was significantly increased by these actions.However, the one thing that may hold FFIV DS back in terms of being perfect is the difficultly level.  This is not an easy game.  Whether you are a FFIV newbie, or played previous versions, you are in for a shock.  Message boards have filled up with people dying in places that would have been considered ridiculously early in previous versions of FFIV.  Be forewarned:  Level grinding is definitely required in this version.  And, I would not have this be the first RPG for someone, let alone they get frustrated and chuck their DS!Overall, this game is an awesome walk down memory lane for some, and introduces others to just how great RPG's have been in the past.Definitely pick this product up.  For sure one of the top 3 RPG's on the DS, and miles above FFIII DS!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2008"}

I purchased this game from STEAM a month ago when it was on sale, but just wanted to let potential buyers know how great this game is.It is my understanding that many of the original developers from the Diablo 1 & 2 games (including the music person) have migrated over to Runic Games to make this fantastic RPG.  Anyone familiar with the Diablo games will instantly recognize the music, the menus, and the gameplay ... but with many refinements and upgrades.  The graphics are very nice, the music if fantastic, the gameplay is addictive, the quests are fun, and there is an abundance of loot to collect.A nice plus that I like with Torchlight is that when you exit your game and return at another time your character is at the same location and your progress picks up at that point ... no starting from town everytime like in Diablo 2.  If you leave a town portal open upon exiting, it will be there when you come back.  Another revision with Torchlight is if your character dies, you now have a few options to chose from on how you want to respawn (from the exact spot where you died to back in town) ... no more repawning back in town regardless and having to slog your way back to where you died to get your stuff back like in Diablo 2 ...A demo is available to try out before buying if interested ... just Google search for it.I highly recommend this game ...

Well, at first, getting used to the controls, it felt a little bit stupid.  The auto aim was awful, the graphics didn't immediatly impress me, and the overall gameplay was just boring.  But I kept playing, and soon I found myself on the second mission, kicking butt, and realized 2 hours had passed.  I had to stop and tell the world!  \"Why?\"  THIS GAME IS AWSOME!!!!!1. Gameplay: First off, if you're an expierienced gamer, shut the auto-aim OFF in preferences.  It really kills the gameplay.  Second, realize how cool the gameplay is.  There are dozens of guns to try out, the graphics are awsome, and your enemies actually use their brain.  That's what made this game such a challenge.  To begin the game, you see a little movie about an Alien race called the \"TimeSplitters\" .  They travel through time, and are here to take over the world.  So Earth sends out a last hope with a group of Marines.  They send 2 (you and if you have a friend, a second person) marines on to the Alien's ship.  They battle their way to the bridge, where 9 Aliens have already disapeared into a time warp.  Each is in a different time with a time crystal you have to retrieve.  So you follow these Aliens through each time period, shooting your way through anything from zombies, guards, aliens, other marines, spies, robots, etc...it's really cool.  Once you finish the game, the world is saved.  The thing is, once you beat a game on the hardest level, u unlock an even harder difficulty setting.  Can u beat it on a harder level, than the next?  Really cool, and you can re-do any level on any setting, at any time.  And you can do all these levels in one player, or 2 player.  So me and my best friends could go through the story as a team.  What a blast!You have anything from grenades, snipers, shotguns, pistols, machine guns, etc... and it just gets better.  This is just the story.  Should I move on?2. The graphics: Not the greatest we've ever seen, but still quite good.  You see gun shells fall to the ground, watch water spray down from a waterfall, see heads fall off and roll to the floor (only from zombies, no gore here!).  When u shoot at wall, the gun marks appear and stay for the game.  Glass shatters, people fall back when u shoot.  Good explosions, etc...  It gets the job done and a little bit more.  Graphics here are good, but don't expect HALO.3. Sound: Very good.  Each gun makes it's own sound, voice acting is pretty good, the alarms make u jump with the realistic screech.  Unfortunantly, you don't here the people walk.  Little things like that aren't here, but once again, it gets the job done.  3.5 out of 5 stars in sound.  But u don't really notice anything bad during the awsome gameplay.  As for the menu music, FANTASTIC!  Very good game, and the music really gets u excited for the games.  I love this game, and the sound was part of it!4. Multiplayer: AWSOME!  4 player, 3 player, and 2 player.  You can play through the story through 2 player, and have 4 player fighting frenzy after that.  You can do a deathmatech (where your 4 players fight off impossible odds working together), challenge (where you make a challenge and face it), campaining (where you have 2 teams with dozens of people going through all out war!  Players pick their side), and the good 'ole 4-player killing spree.  You all face each other, battling for kills, points, and the right to stay alive and call yourself the champ!  These are just a few (to give you an idea).  And with over a 100 characters to choose from, dozens of levels to fight in, and a ton of game types, this game will keep you entertained...for awhile!Overall, this game rocked.  I wasn't expecting such a fun game when I picked it up.  Definantly worth the buy.  And if you share an XBOX with good friends, room mates, brothers and sisters, etc.. you can work as a team in multiple ways, including going throug EVERY singlr mission in story mode, guarding each other's back.It wasn't HALO, but it was a great game.  No gore, and a ton of awsome fun, TimeSplitter's 2 (the sequel to the classic TimeSplitter's for the PlayStation) lives up to the hype, and can be compared to games like Perfect Dark, Golden Eye, and even HALO in some terms.Hope this helped, now I gotta go play TimeSplitter's 2!!!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2002"}

Namely:1.  The way this game was marketed promised a lot of hack-and-slash action.  Really, though, the lion's share of your time is spent doing timed puzzles, moving blocks around, pulling levers, turning cranks, etc.  Lord, if I haven't had an a**full of these!  Still, I must admit the gamemakers here were being faithful to the original text, since Dante actually says in his poem: \"ch'i' non averei creduto il numero di leve nell'inferno!\"2.  The actual adventures your guy goes through get mind-numbingly repetitive, even if you're playing through the game for just the first time.  Nearly every encounter is based on the \"cage match\" paradigm:  your character trips some sort of switch, whereupon some sort of of walls come up, and some sort of monsters continue spawning until you manage to trip another sort of switch, whereupon the walls come down and you are allowed to continue.  Yawn.3.  There's no way to turn off the music!  I hate that!4.

This game has too many boss monsters and not enough pure adventuring.  It recycles monsters, too.  Admittedly, hopping on the back of that giant beast was pretty cool the the first time, after having to do it so many times it got old rather quickly.6.  The game shamelessly recycles other elements too:  all doors open the same way, for example.  You stab some demon guy until he relents and the door opens.  Again, cool the first time.  Not the fiftieth.  Same thing for crawling across the walls filled with downcast souls.7.  This game is too short for the price!8.  Why were there so many gratuitous shots of people's private parts, starting with Beatrice all the way up to Satan?  The game couldn't have got by without this?  There's one scene where you're about to fight Lucifer himself, and as he's talking to you, his devilish dong is hanging out all over the place.  It's distracting.9.  Your character's main weapon is preposterous.10.  It's like the makers of this game were deliberately trying to anger people:  in addition to the completely unnecessary shots of people in the nude, did you know that Electronic Arts admitted to actually staging a fake protest in Los Angeles (putatively by an outraged religious group).  Look up the details on Wikipedia if you're curious.  How shameless.  Genuine religious groups ought to carefully consider this incident:  corporations not only love your outrage, these days they're actively trying to provoke it (as long as it's not Muslim outrage)!11.  You cannot control the camera at all, as you can in many games of this type.  This is a shame, since there are some good visuals along the way.  This drawback gets pretty infuriating in some of the puzzles where you need to move the camera around a bit to get a good sense of what you're looking at.  Heck, even when it's not a question of a puzzle, the camera is awfully dumb about framing relevant elements.  As a result of this, the game has a very restricted, cramped feel, since what you see depends not on what your character wants to see but rather what the camera wants to do.12.  The \"easy mode\" really isn't . . . the monsters are easier to kill, but the abovementioned timed puzzles still manage to infuriate everybody.13.  This game is way too dark to see what you're doing.  If you turn up the gamma, it just bleaches out.14.  The actual combat is exceedingly dull, although it may not look like it to somebody watching the game.  Although there are a plethora of combos available, nearly all monsters -- including all boss monsters -- can be safely dispatched by simply pressing the same button over and over again.15.  The game forces you to go through a whole bunch of jumping and swinging challenges, but the graphics and shading aren't good enough to tell where your character is, so success in these is mainly just a matter of luck and memorization, not skill.16.  There are extensive flashback scenes where Dante is fighting in the Crusades.  Don't you love how the cowardly dhimmis at Electronic Arts evidently instructed their graphic artists to obfuscate the fact that Dante & Co. were slaughtering Muslims during this time?17.  Having to listen to the ponderous, sententious Virgil all the time gets old pretty fast, and you are forced to do it if you want certain relics.  Not only is his information useless for beating the game (he never tells you where hidden power-ups and stuff are), but it doesn't even help you understand the poem the game is supposedly based on (at one point, Virgil, speaking to Dante, speaks of \"our faith\").18.  I hate the mandatory slow-motion during the combat scenes.  All fights regularly speed up and slow down without you having any say in the matter.  There should be a way to control this.  Curse your influence, Matrix trilogy!19.  I hate watching the same cutscenes over and over again.  Why doesn't this game let you skip them?There were, I must admit, a few things I liked about this game:1.  There really are some stunning graphics in this game.  Those background artists are the real heroes of this production.  What amazing stuff.2.  Danged if this doesn't get you jonesin' to read the realDante's Inferno.3.  When all is said, the game is playable.  At no point will you ever throw the controller across the room pronouncing it too buggy or too poorly thought-out to play.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2010"}

Also you have a night vision mode which works and looks like the one from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.- Intense multiplayer versus action either by yourself on a team; the mode has plenty of different options to choose from. This is a pretty good upgraded version of the famed Halo 3 multiplayer that now has new maps, modes, abilities, and graphics for you to enjoy.- Fire Fight mode allows up to four players to fight waves of enemies on unique maps (based on those in the campaign) using team work and skill.BAD:- Some slight lag and slight blurring at the more intensive moments in the game (with lots of things happening all at once).- Can't play Forge maps in Fire Fight mode.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A Sci-Fi First Person Shooter with quick pacing and intense fire fights. Note: that unlike Call of Duty: Modern Warfare this is a sci-fi First Person Shooter and as such your guns must first break an enemy's energy shield before you can really hurt them also everyone is wearing battle armor so you'll still need lots of shots to kill an opponent. The thing to do here is make your shots count more so you will need to do overall less of them to an opponent; example use energy type guns to break an enemy's energy shield and always try to do head shots to your enemy for extra damage. Coming at an enemy guns blazing and either not using the right guns and/or not aiming well will only get you killed pretty quickly.- Gameplay wise this plays pretty much like Halo 3 but with the life bar from Halo 3: ODST. The missions themselves are pretty fun and take the best bits from Halo 3 and ODST into new experiences.- The campaign levels can be played by either yourself or with up to four other players cooperatively at one time on any stage.- The Story is an overall a combat story going from mission to mission with nothing really tying into the overall Halo lore until the last chapter.- Intense multiplayer action online through Xbox Live with matches as small as one on one and as big as 16 players (and even offline without using Xbox Live using either spilt screen, or system link). Halo Reach is set up similar to that of Halo 3 but with some new modes and all new maps. But much like Halo 3 in the sense that you're given a rank when you play multiplayer (this rank can go up or down at any time) this rank is representative of your skill and your matched with others of your skill type, that way new unskilled players and hardcore veterans will not often play against one another, unless they make a special match themselves that ignores rank.- An all new Fire Fight mode (Fire Fight was originally in Halo 3: ODST), Fire Fight which plays similar to Hoard Mode in Gears of War 2 is a mode where either by yourself or with up to four other players cooperatively can play a stage about the size of a multiplayer stage and you fight against enemies that are found in the games story campaign levels in waves. You get points and an overall score on your performance for these stages.- There is no Master Chief in the game as well (the famed character from Halo's 1 through 3). Instead you play an assortment of different SPARTANS who were on the planet Reach when it was attacked. As far as the overall Halo story goes, your team is made up of SPARTAN IIIs (with one SPARTAN II). SPARTAN IIIs are cheaper to produce and have a bit less overall combat ability then the famed SPARTAN IIs (Master Chief is a SPARTAN II). Luckily for your team they have been given all sorts of prototype armor and weapons normally left only for the SPARTAN II's to have (note not even the Master Chief had a chance to get this stuff yet).- NO FLOOD, it should be noted this Halo title has no FLOOD aliens within it (if you've played Halo's 1 through 3 you'll know what I am talking about).- Forge World works like a much upgraded version of Halo 3's Forge mode is a mode that lets you make and edit your own map and build your very own maps from the ground up but adding/placing walls, ramps, towers, ect you can add or take away any and all of the objects, weapons, vehicles, spawning points and flag zones. This is all done in real time in one huge worlds (and not separate maps like in Halo 3) and you can even invite your friends into this mode while you're making the map(s) or just goofing off.- Theater Mode works just like in Halo 3 it is a video editor that lets you record and play back any and all matches from Campaign, Multiplayer, and Fire Fight, and even Forge World from the point of view of any player that was there in either first person or third person (you can even swap to a in a orbit-cam where the camera circles around the player) all of this in real time. You can also pause the video/action at anytime and still look around as a camera as well as well as fast forward and rewind the events as they unfold. BUT don't forget you must save your videos before you turn off the game or you will lose the ability to save those matches. Also note that while viewing these \"videos\" you can take a picture or record a snippet of footage at any time and save it to your Xbox 360 and have your friends check them out later on your profile.GAME IT'S MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Halo 3: ODST (Xbox 360)- Halo 3 (Xbox 360)- Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (Xbox 360/PS3/PC)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- There is three small cameos from characters from previous halo games, honestly the cameos are very small and are not earth shattering to the games over all story.- Don't put down that controller once you beat the game as there is a surprise post credits.- People who pre-ordered this game either at Amazon.com or Gamestop got a preorder code for some extra armor parts for their characters.- The Limited edition comes with a download code for more extra armor parts for your character as well as a Halo Reach patch and a mini book with some back story on the game from the point of view of one of the stories characters.- The Legendary edition comes with everything found in the limited edition plus even more download codes for more extra armor parts for your character (like giving you a avatar a flaming helmet much like the Bungie staff had in Halo 3's multiplayer) as well as a small figure set of the games main characters design by Todd Mcfarlane of Spawn fame.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0009IX7K8","reviewerName":"E. David Swan","summary":"Incredible City, Cludgy Controls","reviewText":"At first glance the average person might assume that the appeal of Grand Theft Auto is in the graphic violence, swearing and mature content but the truth is the GTA series is revolutionary technological achievement and remains one of the most impressive experiences you can find in gaming. The first time I ever tried GTA: Liberty City I was absolutely blown away by the size and scope of the fully realized, living city. It was the same feeling I got the first time I played Mario 64 in that I recognized that I was witnessing a major leap forward. Now almost 10 years later Rockstar has treated us with their latest effort, GTA: San Andreas.Liberty City was the prototypical big east coast city while Vice City was a combination of Vegas and southern Florida. San Andreas takes gamers to the west coast with shades of San Francisco, LA and points in between. As always the city is gigantic and fully realized in a way that the True Crime series could only dream of. In fact I noticed a billboard in San Andreas mocking True Crime. GTA has always been about freedom; the freedom to walk, drive or bicycle wherever you want, the freedom to walk up and pop someone in the mouth if you want. Sure it's violent but consider it wish fulfillment for those of us with an inner anarchist who desires expression without the messiness of accountability. The only other game that even approached GTA's scale was Mafia but Mafia was saddled by unforgiving law enforcement that wouldn't even allow players to run red lights.Unfortunately, not everything is sunshine and palm trees in San Andreas. The vehicles are extremely difficult to control. The problem is that the vehicle movement and camera angle work independently which means that when you make a turn using the keyboard you have to quickly swing the camera around using the mouse to realign yourself. Even after considerable practice I still found it very challenging and awkward. Shooting is likewise rather challenging to perform and I just don't remember it being this hard in the two previous games. The other surprise was how taxing the game is on my PC. I played the first two GTA on a significantly weaker machine and was surprised that I couldn't max out all settings on San Andreas. I had to pull in the drawing distance significantly to keep the frame rate up while using a P4 3.0 GHz with 1 Gig of memory and an ATI RADEON X600 graphics card.I have to knock one star off because of the awkward controls but GTA is one of those games you could spend a month on and never get board. Just exploring the city is worth the price of admission.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2006"}

{"product_name":"B006WJ6YH6","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Second Chance to Play a Fantastic Platformer","reviewText":"When Rayman Origins debuted on the console in 2011, it didn't exactly debut big.  Gamers seemed a little apprehensive about paying sixty dollars for a platformer of its kind.  Strong word of mouth has actually helped the console variants get some much needed success.  Still underplayed, but at the very least the word of mouth was strong.  Vita owners now have a chance to experience this game for themselves.  The differences between this one and the console versions are quite small, though.  There is one, however, that just might make potential players go for the console version on it's own.Since the difference is so minor there isn't much that can be said here that hasn't already been said before.  And thus this review isn't going to be that different than the one I already posted before:As you can imagine there's pretty much no plot to Rayman Origins. And beyond that, Origins isn't really about any origin whatsoever. Rather the \"origin\" refers to how Rayman used to be. A 2D Side Scrolling Platformer. In other words, Rayman gets back to its roots. There are no raving rabbids here. Just pure amazing level design. The game is incredibly simple in its mechanics and that's part of what really makes it work. Just about anyone can pick up the game and learn the basics of the mechanics. Mastering the game, however, is another story entirely.The game begins simple. The first level is inviting. And when you first begin you'll soon earn the ability to punch before later on getting other abilities such as the ability to fly or shrink later on. The game paces itself well by holding back on most of your abilities. Only giving them to you when you rescue certain characters. And mostly making sure you utilize them well in the environment they introduce them in. The learning curve in Rayman is almost non-existent. You'll slip right into the game real easy and the game gives you ample time to practice your new abilities.It's a good thing that Rayman Origins doesn't punish the player when things are grim, however. The game is challenging. It begins quite simple enough, but before you know it the game ramps up in difficulty rather fast. You won't even be halfway through before you realize just what's being thrown at you in each level. And some are going to require some good pattern recognition or some trial and error to get down just right. Regardless of this, however, you rarely feel like the game is being unfair. Most enemies are easy to take out. It's not the enemies that'll be a problem, however, it'll mostly boil down to the environmental hazards mixed in with the well tuned level designs. Each failure doesn't really feel like failure either, because the game isn't out to punish you. There are a decent amount of checkpoints scattered throughout, and there isn't a limit to how many times you can fail.This is also good because Rayman Origins has A LOT of levels to traverse. It's about as robust as a 2D platformer can get. Each level ends when you rescue a bunch critters (called Electoons) but the game demands replay because you'll be tallied up at the end of the level. Rescuing Electoons isn't just how you complete stages, it's how you unlock more. And if you manage to go through a level collecting all the \"Lums\" (basically coins) then you'll rescue more Electoons. There are also cages of captured Electoons hidden in every level. If you want to master Rayman Origins and explore everything it has to offer, you'll need to find them all. And this is going to require replaying some levels over and over again. Sometimes with a friend.Perhaps the most rewarding thing about Rayman Origins is by far it's presentation. The game has an incredible sense of humor and some great tunes. The introduction is funny, and so are some of the levels (who would've thought using weenies as platforms wouldn't be such a bad idea?). But perhaps where the presentation shines most is in the graphical and aesthetic capacity. This is where Rayman truly comes alive. The graphics opt for style more so than anything. Certainly Rayman Origins fails to live up to the photorealistic quality of other games such as Uncharted 3 or Gears of War. But what makes this game so important is that it showcases that style is just as important as the actual graphical output. Rayman Origins doesn't have a lot of POWER behind it, but it has a visual flair that you just don't see too much in games these days. The aesthetics are what make Rayman Origins so easy on the eyes. The environments are just amazing looking. And this is because Rayman Origins has character. And art design that helps separate the game from everything else out there. A lot of games look pretty based on the actual power behind them, but it's nice to see a game that treats its visuals as though they were on a canvas for an artist to paint. It goes beyond being something shiny and something that actually exemplifies what gaming can do when developers try a stylistic approach rather than just an all out powerful one. Every frame of Rayman Origins is brimming with visual flair and style. It is easily one of the prettiest games I've ever seen. The fact that it plays well makes it that much more rewarding. At some point when playing through the levels the design just clicks and everything flows well.There are two things that keep the PSV port down.  The most obvious is the price.  Oddly enough the price kept many a gamer away from the console version for a while as well.  And it seems that can still happen here.  This is because the console versions recently dropped in price and the PSV version cost more.  The other thing that's a little strange is that the PSV version of the game doesn't offer multiplayer at all.  The console version allowed up to four players to play, but this has been stripped out of the game entirely.This doesn't make Rayman Origins in and of itself a bad game.  It's still just as remarkable as it ever was.  The lack of multiplayer is, for the most part, the biggest hit against the game, and in the long run it isn't even much to get worked up about (it IS a handheld system... and sometimes games are built with a solitary experience in mind).

I have played all the NES, SNES, N64, Gamecube, and Wii Mario games.  This game utilizes everything from the earlier SMB games and adds some new things.  It has levels that pay tribute to old levels (ie: 8-7 is different but reminiscent of 8-7 in the original SMB).  There is even a level that has floors similar to the original Mario Bros arcade game.  In my opinion, this is the best 2D Mario game out.  The level design and fun factor in this game is off the charts.  In fact, it inspired me to get some old classic handheld mario games...Super Mario Land 1,2, and 3 and the Wario Land games for the GB/GBC.  I've heard great things about those and I'm looking forward to playing them.In case anyone is wondering...this is a different game than New Super Mario Bros. for the Wii...they both contain completely different levels.  The Wii version allows up to 4 players to play on the same Wii at the same time...it's a fun game, but I like this DS game better.There are 3 save slots, so my son has his own save and I have my own.  He loves the game but has trouble after world 3, so I have to help him through some of the more difficult parts.  He loves the minigames and begs me to play them with him.  If you have 2 DS systems and 1 cartridge, then you can play the minigames against each other which is fun.  I can't say I love the minigames as much as he does, but they are fun, quick, and it makes him happy.  I just finished the main game a few minutes ago and it was a blast from beginning to end.Each world is easy enough for casual gamers to get through and there are 3 coins in each level to collect...collecting all these coins gives more challenge for the more advanced gamer.  The game got more difficult around world 6, so I went back through the earlier worlds again to collect those coins and to build up my extra lives.  Then I came back to finish the game.  To complete the game, you only have to go through 6 of the 8 worlds...the other 2 worlds have to be unlocked somehow.Now that I completed the game, I need to go back and collect all those coins and unlock the two worlds I haven't gotten to yet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2010"}

It is my favorite FF game and the best video game I've ever played.  I logged 120 hours and loved it.My favorite Final Fantasy games that I have played are now, in order: XII, X, VI, VII, and X-2.  I plan to play VIII and IX next.What I loved about FF XII:- beautiful graphics- lots of challenging fights- huge world to explore and freedom to travel around- scenes including dark dungeons full of undead, icy mountains, foggy marshes, rolling praries, mystic forests, and more- combat system (with gambits optional) that I grew to love- memorable characters- license system for abilities is flexible and lets you choose who is a fighter, mage, etc.- no random monster encounters - you can see them approaching and use location and range to your advantage- the game stayed challenging pretty much the whole way- the NPC interaction and side quests are interesting and can be helpful, but are mostly optionalWhat I didn't like about FF XII:- if I could redesign it, I would change the end fight - it was good, but could have been better.The best thing about FF XII is that I loved it all the way through the game, all 120 hours I played.  I enjoyed all of the areas, all the boss fights, and monsters, weapons, magic, were all fun.  In previous FF games, I have always liked developing character abilities and powers, and this game seemed to be the best yet that I have played at keeping the balance between toughness of monsters and power of characters good to keep fights challenging.  I got wiped out a few times and had to restart from save points, and there were a bunch of close encounters where I just barely got out, but that to me is challenging and fun.Also, I liked the visuals.  I could tell by looking at the weapons my characters were carrying around exactly which sword, spear, etc., they had because the detail is that precise.  You can tell a Defender sword from a Save The Queen just by looking at them.  Little details make it visually impactful.  Fran and Balthier are great looking characters - the tall elf woman in leather and the swashbuckling leading man, very memorable.  Penelo was the fun, peppy one.  Vaan and Ashe reminded me of Tidus and Yuna from FF X.  Basch was the tough guy.  I thought the voicing was for the most part excellent, especially Balthier and Fran.My favorite locations were the creepier dungeons with the eerie music and undead monsters.  When you are wading through zombies nearly getting your butt kicked, but manage to pull through and reach the goal, that is fun.  There was also a windswept snowy area with swirling magic illusions that I will never forget.The battle system, with no random encounters, enemies you see coming on a corner map, and gambit options, is my favorite of all the FF games.The license system is my second favorite, after the sphere grid in X.  The ending was also my second favorite, after the ending in X.  However, I liked XII better overall because I loved the combat system, the consistent challenges, the phenominal look and graphics, and the puzzles were more intuitive to me.I will definitely play FF XII again some time in the future.  It is my new favorite.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2012"}

It's not what I would call the next gen graphics that you really want to see on your shiny new Xbox One , but they are better than the 360 and ps3 , so at least  we are getting better graphics than what we would have gotten on our last Gen machines :) but all we need is a little patience and time and the next gen graphics we want will be here soon enough.Story : the story is interesting enough that it keeps me in my seat and wanting to play more and more . I literally had to make myself put the controller down and get some much needed stuff done around the house , all the while thinking about my new wolfenstine game and wanting nothing more than to just sit back down and play a bit more , but alas we must be responsible and do what is needed . So my Wolfenstine thirst will not be quenched until later tonight when the wife and kids are tucked in the bed asleep , haha then it's game on baby !!!!game play : its what you would expect from most FPS games , the controls are smooth and precise , the button layout is the same as Call Of Duty except you cannot go prone. The major difference in this game and most of the others is we get to play in an alternate reality ( during WW2 ) where the Nazis have won and we are the repressed that are fighting for our freedom. On top of that we of course get our supernatural and far advanced enemies to deal with but this is par for the course and it wouldn't be Wolfenstine without it. To me this breaks up the monotony of the every day shooter we get time and again. Call Of Duty and battlefield are great and I will play them all but they are still just all about the same. Wolfenstine gives us something fresh and new and in my opinion its something that was sorely needed.if you are thinking of getting this game , just do it if you can , it's fresh , exciting and certainly very entertaining. I don't regret my purchase one bit and I'm certain you will feel the same.. Cheers and happy gaming :)Solid 5 out of 5Edit : the farther I get into the game the better it looks , also I have seen the 360 version on my neighbors console and I have to say there is a noticeable difference in graphics between the 360 and the Xbox One . The X1 version is far more superior to the 360 version. The X1 version is really , really ,really crisp ,clear and detailed. I'm not down playing the 360 version if that is all you can get at the moment because it looks good as well , but the X1 version is the one to have if you can get it..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2014"}

Use your car as a weapon and battle your way to the front of the pack -- by taking down rivals and instigating spectacular crashes.","reviewerName":"Josh Perkins \"antisugarcoated\"","summary":"Blinking need not apply","reviewText":"I'm a huge fan of the Burnout series.  I've been playing since the original a couple years ago and I can't quite get tired of them.  Some people had a problem with the first game's long levels, but I thuroughly enjoyed them, it added that much more time to make others crash.  And now, in the new game, Burnout 3: Takedown, you will find the 40 or so levels to be perfect, along with everything else in the stellar title.For one thing, the graphics, while not super realistic like Gran Turismo games, are still some of the best on the PS2.  Everything is quite colorful and vivid, and you get a wonderful look at everything around you after someone has pushed you into a gaurdrail, causing you to flip around in the air while all the broken glass and flecks of paint and car part flaot around in slow motion along with you.  But what makes crashing really fun, besides the awesome damage animation, is the fact that when somebody makes you wreck or you hit something and crash, you can hold a button to slow everything down, and you can actually move your crashed vehicle around to put it in the path of oncoming racers that may or may not have caused you to wreck, proceeding to cause of festival of twisted metal vengeance.But one thing that was more noticable than anything is the artificial intelligence in the other drivers.  For the first time in any racing game I actually felt bullied around, like I do when I'm playing with real people.  Which is needless to say really freakin' cool.  They ram you into oncoming traffic, tailgate, sideswipe, team up on you to sandwich your car, and coolest of all, they actually make realistic mistakes.  They will literally misjudge a drift around a corner or get faked out by you or another car and crash.  And that just blew me away.Now, onto the thing everybody likes to talk about, the speed.  Even when not using your burnout meter, your screen is still blurred around the edges as you are pushing a minimum top speed of 150-160.  Without your boost.  That's insane!  Then, when you actually get some boost (which you can now use even when your meter isn't full) you hit speeds closer to 200 mph!  And you really take your life in your hands then, because by the time you actually see that car up ahead coming right at you in the oncoming lane, you've already smashed into it with tremdous speed.  Note: this is not a complaint, it's just a really cool idea pulled off superbly.  Sure, you can race the entire level going mach speeds if you like, but you'll probably crash more that anybody else too.  So, unless you have Elven vision, I'd just wait till you find a good clean patch of road with little to no traffic on it to really hit the gas.  Or if you're a second behind somebody, and hitting them at turbo speed would mean a pretty crash for them, then by all means use it.  You don't have to listen to me, just race and win your own way.I'll wrap up by saying that I have not beat this game yet.  I've put about 9 hours into it so far and still haven't unlocked a third of the games unlockables.  And I haven't even touched the multiplayer yet!  So my advice to you is this:  If you want the best arcade racer ever created, buy this game.  If you're not a racing fan, or if you don't have a PS2 or XBOX, then don't bother with this game.  But if you're capable of playing this game, be prepared to let that itch on your face go until the race is over...Graphics-5Sound-5 (except the soundtrack is new wave punk/pop, so I just turned it off.

I own both the Xbox One and PC versions of the game.  While it looks like a next gen game on the Xbox One (it truly does), the console struggles with keeping up.  Since my \"gaming\" PC is really a \"development\" PC with a graphics card that was considered a budget card 2 years ago when I bought it, I assumed it would choke on Titanfall, especially after witnessing the image tearing and frame drops on the Xbox One.But I was wrong.  My budget Radeon 5000-something or other (which cost me $100 two years ago) plays it just fine, and it looks every bit as good as the Xbox One, minus the image tearing and at 1080p instead of 792 (wth?).  Oh, and without the awful black crush.If you only have an Xbox One, buy Titanfall - you'll enjoy the heck out of it.

You'll need all those abilities to get through this unique platformer!","reviewerName":"ps2 gamer \"star wars\"","summary":"Who says the PSP doesn't have good games?","reviewText":"If you've owned a PSP for a long time you've probably kept hearing that it doesn't have any good games. Daxter proves otherwise. If you've been bored with all of the games the PSP has now, be bored no longer! Daxter is quite possibly the best PSP game out there, with awesome graphics, gameplay, story, and many more features.If you're a hardcore fan of the Jak and Daxter series like me, then you won't be disappointed with this game. It does everything great. The story takes place between Jak 1 and Jak 2. If you rememeber, at the beginning of Jak 2 Jak arrives at haven city. He is then immediately captured by the Krimzon Guards, but Daxter escapes. Jak is put in prison, and then the game skips 2 years later and you see how Daxter saves Jak. The game's storyline takes place in those 2 years, and you'll learn how Daxter saves Jak and what he has done in that time. At the beginning of the game, Daxter is offered a job as a bug exterminator. He takes it, because he hopes that while he goes around exterminating bugs he'll also find Jak along the way. By the way, these are metal head bugs, so they'll put up a fight.Now, first of all, let's get the bad stuff out of the way. This game is kind of short, and you'll be able to finish it in 10-13 hours. Also, some people might find it disappointing that haven city is smaller than it was in Jak 2, and there aren't any people walking in the streets, even though they're flying in zoomers. However, these are very minor problems, and they don't affect the game in any very bad way.Now on to the good things. This game's graphics are absolutely phenomenal. They are the best graphics on any PSP game out now, and I daresay that they're even better than the graphics of many PS2 games. I'm not exaggerating. They are absolutely gorgeous. There is an impressive amount of detail in all of the environments you'll visit, and they all look very unique and great. Just take a look at Daxter himself (the character). His fur looks so realistic and cool, and all of the textures in the game are similar. The character designs are also cool and unique.Speaking of characters, here they are. There's Osmo, which is an old man who's also Daxter's boss at the exterminator shop, yet he's very kind. There's his son Ximon, who is a surfer kind of guy. There's Osmo's daughter Taryng, which is a Lara Croft-like gal with a British accent who gives Daxter all of his weapons. There's Kaeden, some kind of creepy guy who really hates Daxter and his friends. And there are a few other characters, some of them from the other Jak games, like Errol and Count Vegar.Another thing that the Jak series are greatly known for is their variety. Daxter delivers that too. There is a big variety of missions and things to do, and you'll do things ranging from simply killing bugs, to chasing a Truck on your scooter while it shoots bombs at you, to shoot down a bug with a turret while you're on a vehicle, and more. Also, there's lots of action and platforming to be done in this game. Like I mentioned earlier, you'll be fighting metal head bugs, and they're all different and unqiue. You'll get several weapons in the game: One being an electric flyswatter, which is basically a melee weapon, a sprayer which lets you stun enemies, a flamethrower(self explanatory), and a sonic blaster, which lets you shoot a bomb that creates a shockwave. You'll also have to pick up floating green orbs to power up tour sprayer weapons. Other than that, you also get an upgrade that lets you temporarily fly in the air with your sprayer, and you'll have to pick up green orbs mid-air in order to feul your sprayer and allow you to stay up a longer time. Jumping and flying around makes up this game's platforming, and its really very fun.Also there's a bunch of other distractions that keep you busy and allow you to do things other than doing the main missions. You can roam around Haven city (by the way, you get a scooter to do it with) searching for secret areas and collectibles, you can go to levels that you've already played in order to pick up secrets you might have missed there, and perhaps most importantly, you can play mini-games called \"dream sequences\". These are very fun, and in them, you make Daxter go to sleep on his bed, and he'll have dreams in which he's the hero, and his dreams take place in movies like lord of the rings, the matrix, braveheart and more. They're basically just minigames in which you have to mash buttons according to what appears on screen, and they're really fun. You can unlock different combos for your flyswatter and other cool secrets if you play them. However, you must first collect enough precursor orbs in order to unlock these dreams.There is also a multiplayer option called bug combat. You can pick up special bugs in your main game and use them in this multiplayer option. Each bug has 3 attacks it can use, and it's sort of a turn based rock-paper-scissors game with RPG elements. Claw attack beats Spit, Spit beats trap, and trap beats claw. You also get all kinds of unlockables for this from the main game, if you find them. You can get power ups that improve your bugs' health, attack, and more. You also get tokens that you can use in the middle of the combat, and they're things like shields that protect you from attacks, things that cancel your opponent's move, things that let you switch your attack after you already picked one, etc.Overall Daxter is the best PSP game that's ever come out. I hope that other companies keep making games like this. If they do, the future looks very bright for the PSP. So if your a Jak and Daxter fan, or if you just own a PSP, you should definitely buy this game.P.S. You can also connect your PSP to your PS2 via USB cable, and if you have Jak X: Combat Racing, you can unlock cool stuff for it from the Daxter game.

I played Final Fantasy VII briefly after it was initially released at a friend's house, then my own copies later in college on both the PC and PlayStation 1. So when I ordered a PlayStation Portable (PSP) recently it seemed like a no-brainer to pick up a copy of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII as one of my first games.Having previously played and enjoyed the Kingdom Hearts games for the PlayStation 2, this game was the perfect choice for my first PSP game, and is the major reason I'm extremely glad I didn't pick up a PSPgo, and will continue to keep my PSP-3000 for as long as it works.Crisis Core tells the events that lead up to Final Fantasy VII (in fact ending with the opening of FF7), and I'll admit the story is pretty moving (Lost Odyssey was the last game to make me tear-up, and I didn't cry during FF7). The gameplay will be quite familar if you've played the PlayStation 2 Kingdom Hearts games, featuring a mix of real-time battles with RPG elements. Depending upon your preference for such things, it offers various simplified elements, such as the shop and leveling, which I think works fairly well.The game plays great on the PSP, offering fairly tight controls (movement via either the d-pad or stick), with great sound and video (as usual with Square (Enix), the CG videos are top-notch and they look great on the PSP).The game is UMD-only, and there seem to be no plans to make it available electronically. Compared to the other UMD game I've thus far played, Star Ocean: First Departure, the UMD seems to be read from fairly frequently, but loading times are fairly quick, and it's something that you can easily ignore.To completion, with a number of optional missions finished, I put in a little over 27 hours into the game, and will definitely be putting more hours in to get near 100% on the optional missions, and perhaps even another playthrough (via new game plus).On the default difficulty I died once or twice (excluding those times a Phoenix Down kept me going), and those were more from stupidity then anything else. Generally, I'd say the game is fairly easy, with some fights a little more difficult than others. Unlike Final Fantasy VII it seems to be a little easier to be a completionist in this game, but since the main area is pretty spread out, those of this type might get a little bored walking back and forth (unless they're following a guide).I give the game 5 stars of 5, as I found the game to be extremely enjoyable, and the amount of time put into it currently, and in the future, is vastly more than the price of entry.Recommended for fans of Final Fantasy VII, as well as those who enjoyed Kingdom Hearts on the PlayStation 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2010"}

I've heard of the games, but the idea of it didn't really fascinate me. when I heard that the new one was going to have pirate theme though..That's when I got interested! I'm a sucker for pirate stories and the whole concept of it.It runs smooth on the wii U. The water is rendered nicely. I've never seen water look so realistic in any video game!  So I'll give a star for that. The world is very colorful and beautiful also.Buuuut Some of the missions (since this is my first assassins creed game) took me a couple of tries to beat.. Wait, more like hundreds.... cause the instructions were slightly ...unclear?.. I don't know, maybe I'm just dumb but it felt too overwhelming  and confusing at times. I found myself saying \"WHAT THE__ AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?\" Waaay too many times in this game. I thought I might just need to get used to it... Wrong. It's just too clunky. And the whole animus thing was so ... Just... What? I thought it was really.. Dumb, and annoying. it felt like an interruption from an already bland experience.The story bored me so much to the point where I just muted the game and played music. It became a chore to play. I didn't care about what was going on.The ONLY FUN I had in this game was taking over forts and picking up the dead bodies and throwing them off the side of the cliff. That's it. It was funny watching them hit things on their way down. But I realized 50.00$ is too much money just to watch something that temporarily entertaining.Overall, boring game with minor gimmicks.

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"A review of the original AND the 2012 HD remake","reviewText":"I picked up RC for the PS2 when it was first released in 2002. At the time, I was wowed by the game. It seemed to take platformers to a whole new level, and it was one of the most enjoyable experiences I ever had with the PS2 console. It combined great humor, storytelling, platforming, combat, weapons, gadgets, and variety. The variety came from a number of tastefully implemented elements that broke up the gameplay, including using your Trespasser gadget to crack hi-tech locks, using Clank to control miniature \"Gadgetbots\" and solve puzzles, piloting starships in intergalactic battles, and even transforming into a gigantic robot to get into some arena-style combat.More than anything else, this game got me HOOKED- I had to play it right to the end, and after that, I wanted to uncover all the hidden bolts, skill points, weapons, and gadgets. Never did I imagine that I would have as much fun when I went back to revisit RC with the RC Collection on PS3. But I'm happy to report that I did!I CANNOT believe this game is TEN years old! It's true that it's been given the \"HD makeover\", but the content and gameplay mechanics are identical to the original. Even though this was the first RC entry, and improvements would slowly occur over time (such as strafing and an enhanced \"quick select\"), this game has aged remarkably well, and it's still as gripping and fun as it was ten years ago. What's just as impressive is how incredibly GOOD this game looks. Nothing was \"rebuilt\"; developer Idol Minds simply enhanced the resolution to HD and fit it to widescreen format. Yet, this game looks better than most PS3 games... and it's only a PS2 game! That speaks volumes about the fantastic, cartoony art direction that this series has always embraced, and the wonderful passion with which developer Insomniac poured into this game.Ratchet and Clank fans, and newcomers alike- rejoice!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2012"}

Like Gears of War 2 and Fable 2, if the original was made this way, it would've made the eventual sequel several times better yet. Is it perfect? Of course not; there's no such thing as a perfect game. But it's really good. Does it fix everything the original game had wrong? Unfortunately no. But did it fix a whole lot of that? Absolutely.One of the biggest problems of the original game was the sheer repetitiveness of its missions, and you can read any number of reviews on this or the original to get all of the details you'll ever need on that. Another one of the biggest problems of the first game was that the collectibles, flags, had no purpose. I am ashamed to admit that I was duped into taking the time and effort to find all of them, only to discover that I opened up some achievements and had a marker in the game that said \"All (territory) flags collected.\" That's it. No bonuses, no new weapons, no new areas to uncover. This game has multiple types of collectibles and tangible, actual rewards for going for them.Its two biggest problems are that 1) Ezio still has the problem Altair had of running up a wall that leads to nowhere instead of through the open doorway, or jumping towards yet utterly missing (or just away from) what anyone can clearly see is what you're obviously trying to get to, and 2) unlike the first game, the primary story cannot be replayed unless you start a brand new game, even though events in the game allow you to go back into the Animus after the story is over. Given Ubisoft's track record with such things, I for one do not expect them to make any effort in correcting either of these problems and I pity any who do. A third, minor problem is that the poison blade is worthless. It's just faster, easier and safer (for you as well as nearby civilians) to kill with the ordinary blade than poison.But the story, the setting, the characters (especially Ezio) the new weapons, the missions, the enemies, the crowds, the evolving villa, everything I just mentioned is a huge step up. I guarantee no one will be able to see the iconic video game character Mario the same way after going to the villa for the first time. Leonardo de Vinci is hilarious. And meeting Bianca is also one of the most hilarious moments in the game. Which brings up another point; the first game was very serious; too serious. This game is still serious, but it sprinkles in a little humor to break up the tension every so often. And watching a group of guards drool and act like idiots for a group of courtesans never gets old. Never. You also get to learn about Ezio, who he is before the story truly begins, the love he holds for his family and thus how tragic his loss is, how he evolves as the story unfolds and why he becomes what he does become. And Desmond is a *tad* bit more dynamic himself. His actions in the game are a little more powerful than just stealing a security pen from the villain and reading e-mails. The missions are much more varied; there's even a coach chase and a mission with Leonardo's flying machine to boot.The graphics are great. You feel like you're in Renaissance Italy, with all of the sights and sounds you'd expect. The music isn't the best soundtrack you'll ever hear, but it's still good. The voice acting is up to par as well. The controls can be a little aggravating sometimes but nothing that will make you throw the controller across the room in frustration.Simply put, this game is amazing, and whether you liked or disliked the first, the second game is great. And if you never played the first game, no problem; the intro gets you up to speed. Definitely two thumbs way up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2010"}

This tremendous list includes standard categories of vehicles, including stock cars, tuned pre tuned vehicles and tunables, but keeping with modern automotive technologyGT5also includes the latest, hybrid and electric car models. Just like any car, these can be raced, but as with their real-life cousins, players can also do things with these cars like monitor battery power as related to speed and other car usage. In addition,GT 5features over 20 courses, more than 60 variations, a new physics engine allowing for realistic damage, a new in-cockpit view, HD support, and much more.","reviewerName":"Caraculiambro","summary":"a mix of good and bad","reviewText":"I am forced to admit that GT5 gives you a lot for your money, but there were so many head-slappingly inane decisions made about the gameplay that I am forced to give this a hostile review:1.  The main thing I hated about this game was that there were no difficulty settings.  Basically you must take everything at full-bore difficulty, and woe to you if this is too hard.  But really, it's not that some of the tracks are hard so much as the WAY they were hard.  You're driving a car worth about 45,000 and they put you in races with supercars worth 20 million?  (Not just that, but there's no way you youself can possibly purchase such cars at this point.)  This is neither fun nor fair, but there's nothing you can do about it.  So you just start calculating to yourself, \"If I were to come in first place in this race 215 times, I would have enough money to buy one of those Ferraris.\"2.  Another gripe I have is that in this game, supercars are not supercars.  Naturally after you've been playing for a little while you will shop around for a Ferrari or a Lamborghini.  Don't spend your money:  instead, go to the Internet, where you'll find discussion forums that will tell you that you can get a much better-performing car for a lot less, say the Nissan GT-R.  But this is a little ridiculous.  The game doesn't seem right when a 2009 fully-decked out Lamborghini is getting comprehensively out-performed by a garden-variety Nissan sedan!  Something seems wrong.3.  There are no Porsches to be had in this game, for licensing reasons, I assume.  This is probably not the programmers' fault, but still.4.  One can maximally have only 20 million in the bank.  This really blows since the cars that cost 20 million will cost you more than that, since it's virutally impossible to ding 20 million precisely:  any money earned over that will simply not be recorded.  But what really blows is that when you finally buy that Lamborghini Miura, you'll have to garage it until you can buy tires for it.  This really seemed wrong.5.  There exists a big gap between the Professional Series and the Extreme series.  Basically, if you'd like to continue into the Extreme Series, you're going to need a car that is worth several million dollars.  The problem is that nothing you can possibly do in the Professional Series is going to net you anywhere near that amount of money.  There is simply no way to transition smoothly from the Profeesional Series to the Extreme Series.  Hence the only solution is you've got to sit there for a couple of weeks running your B-spec drivers robotically around Daytona-style tracks until you have enough money to continue on with the next phase of the game.  So basically the game gets held up for a week or two while you get on to other things, such as your homework.  This was an asinine design decision.6.  The player is not able to control realism settings.  You've got no choice but to put up with weather, tire burn-out, car damage, etc.7.  The cars you win for finishing certain series can only be won once.  This doesn't make sense.  Can you imagine telling contestants in any sort of game that they can't win the prize because they've already won such a prize in the past?8.  The game plays with you by racing cars against you that are not readily available for purchase, such as the Yellowbird or the Chaparral.  I did not find this amusing.9.  There are not enough tracks!  This is because so many of the tracks are wasted on idiotic races (e.g., a tournament for the owners of a VW Lupo!?!?) that when you'd like to take one of your cars out for a race, there are only three or four choices to choose from?  You can only select the track of your choice if you're just practicing or if you're running cars that you don't own (i.e., GT mode).  But as for taking your beloved babies out on tracks you never get to see them on, forget it!  Those tracks are reserved for the pickup truck races!10.  One is not allowed to restart races in tournaments.11.  Having the cost of re-structuring the chassis be half of the car's value was totally unfair, as was the cost of an engine overhaul.  These prices are punitive, not realistic.  And what's the point of this anyways?  Next up:  having us pay for gas and insurance?  (Incidentally, I discovered that one's chassis breaks automatically without your even crashing the car.  Here's how:  1)  buy new car.  2)  enter race  3) immediately exit race before driving an inch.  You'll now have the option of restoring the chassis, implying that the car is damaged, since you're not permitted the option of paying for chassis repairs if the car is not damaged.)12.  Your car has to come in for pitstops for new tires and stuff:  other cars don't.  On the Extreme B-spec races, for example, it is only your car that has problems with tires balding out about lap 9:  the other cars never seem to.  Why is that?13.  The physics of the game don't make sense.  First of all, it's impossible to flip your car, no matter what you do.  There is no animation for it.  Neither do cars crash or show damage (though you have to pay for chassis damage).  But it goes deeper than that.  It seems like the physics of crashing and interacting with walls and other cars don't resemble reality.  For example, if you go off the track and hit a wall at, say, a 20 degree angle, your car will be smashed back to about a 160 degree angle, facing the wrong direction.  NEVER are you simply \"righted\" back to a zero degree angle.  It's almost as if the game is punishing you for crashing into walls, but in a way that doesn't make sense visually.  There's more, too.  There seems to be a sort of magnet effect going on sometimes.  Unlike my first example, this might actually be real physics:  I don't know, but it sure feels wrong.  What I mean is that when you run up on the rear end of the car in front of you, your car seems to \"stick\" and you can't detach yourself unless you completely slam on your brakes.  You can't simply scrape off to one side.  The same goes if your car is running along a wall, scraping along it at high speeds.  It seems like you ought to be able to steer away from it, detaching yourself.  But instead you're magically stuck to the wall somehow, and you can only veer away from it by greatly reducing your speed.14.  Further, the physics of collisions seem unfair.  Every time you collide with another car, yours is the one that is bumped off the road into the sand, never the enemy's.  It seems like this should happen about 50% of the time, but no.  It's virtually impossible to knock an opponent's car off the track:  if you do, it recovers immediately.  It seems like if there is a collision, it negatively affects only your car.  Why do you always get the short end of the stick?15.  The prices in this game are totally messed up!  You can buy a car for 2 million, deck it out with all the trimmings, and then, when you go to sell it, get about 200,000 for it, even though you haven't put a single mile on it!  This is not how reality works.  Realism-based, eh?16.  The game keeps making you go over to Google to find out what kinds of cars you're talking about.  When you're in the used store, for example, how'm I supposed to know that an SLS AMG is a kind of Mercedes? [This was fixed in a patch.]17.  As of the 2.02 update, the game has started to get more mercenary.  There will be cars displayed available for purchase, but you can't buy them unless you pay the company extra money for additional downloadable content through the PlayStation store.  A good example of this is the VW Golf '07.  Before the 2.02 patch, you could simply buy it from the new car dealership.  After December 2011, however, you had to pay more money (literal money, not game credits) to get that car.  Sheesh.  You figure if you lay out forty or fifty bucks for the game, they'd be done hustling you, but no.18.  There's a huge gap with the difficulty at higher levels of the game:  they don't scale well.  After you get the Formula Gran Turismo, for example, it feels like you entered the cheat code and the remainder of the game is uninteresting, if not tedious.19.  The manual sucks!  This game was released more than a year previous to this review, and by now you'd think people'd know how to play the game.  No.  For example, what causes chassis damage?  Is it aggressive driving?  Collisions?  Or simply miles?  Nobody seems to know.  Various websites have various theories, but nobody seems to agree about this basic thing.  But don't look to the manual to clarify that or anything else:  the most the extremely brief manual will tell you is \"if you have an epileptic seizure, you should stop playing.\"20. The tracks are aseptic, almost lifeless.  If I see the Monza circuit one more time, I'm gonna barf!  I can't put my finger on why the Need for Speed tracks seem so various and invigorating while those of GT5 seem so jejune, but it's definitely a problem.21.  There's no way to upgrade your braking and steering.22.  This game features ads up the wazoo:  currently for Motul, Agip, Dunlop, and some others.  These names will change with time because these companies have paid to have their logos plastered all over the racetracks and there's no way you can avoid them.23.  There's no way to prevent the game from auto-saving.  This would have been useful in trying out a car you suspected was a crock. The Ferrari Enzo, for example, wasn't worth half the money you paid for it, but there was no way to test it out and then get your money back.24.  The \"Seasonal Tracks\" require you to race with crummy cars or cars with a strict horsepower limit.25.  Why can't I paint my cars any color I want as many times as I want?  I have like a billion dollars!  Instead I have to \"earn\" paint!?  It's ridiculous!26.  There's some sort of bug (or other fun-ruining mechanism) whereby, in B-spec, your drivers don't get full credit for all the experience they accumulate.  This seems to happen about level 30.  You can put them through a 24-hour endurance race, and they'll only move up one level, not the several levels the raw points they've been given should net them.  Then, those excess points disappear somehow and are never counted.27.  There is (alas!) a rather serious bug that's started to plague the game starting with the patch that came out in December of 2011.  When you are in the camera view that allows you to see the back of your car, the frame will jolt a bit every time you go around a turn to re-center itself.  This only starts happenening after you reach about 10 laps of the same track, but it means that endurance races will give you a headache.28.  Er, howzabout warning me, before I spend more than 10 million on certain cars such as the Ferrari F1s that they cannot be used in normal races?  And that you're not allowed to sell them once you've bought them?  (As you can tell by this review, I played this game day and night for quite a while, but this was the thing that finally soured me on it and inspired me to write this cranky review.  Go, little review! Fly! May you decrease Polyphony's sales and cause them to go under!)In sum, it's a little difficult for me to believe I have so many complaints about this game, but I do.  What's not showing, of course, is that I really got into it and played it for weeks.  Hence despite all these gripes I confess that it is well worth the money.  Here's a couple of things I liked about it:1.  The game really gets you interested in racing history and you start reading a lot more about that subject.  That's gotta be considered a plus for a game.  This kinda starts when you're like, \"Wait.  Why would a '69 Ford be going for 20 million?\"2.  Initially I thought B-spec was the stupidest thing I ever saw.  Why would I want to watch the PlayStation play itself?  That was only until I realized you can set B-spec going while you went off to classes or to sleep and when you came back you'd have a whole bunch of money.  I admit I actually quite got into this:  it was oddly satisfying, heading off to work or wherever, knowing that you were kinda playing even though you weren't there.  It was a great opportunity to get a lot of other, real-life work done during this time.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2011"}

This mysterious power forms the beginning of all life, is the source of all magic and the origin of all thought. For eons the angelic Seraphim watched over the T-Energy and therefore over the fate of the entire world. But eventually tiring of their burden, they passed their knowledge on to the High Elves. T-Energy helped the realm of the High Elves to experience an unimaginable boost of prosperity, making it the reigning culture in Ancaria. But a force as powerful as T-Energy carries great dangers. Not taught how to deal with this, no sooner did the Elves take control, then a heated dispute erupted among them as to how and to what purpose the T-Energy was to be used. Dispute morphed into irresolvable conflict, then rift and eventually to a civil war among the High Elves, where all participants were losers. Their realm collapsed and with it the entire power structure of Anacaria. In the turmoil all the peoples of Anacaria coveted the right, either openly or in secret, to wield the power of T-Energy and in the end, unmanaged, the T-Energy raged out of control warping creature and lands alike. Can anyone regain control over the T-Energy. And if so, will he/she strive to prevent the world from lapsing into final chaos, or deepen it?GameplayGameplay inSacred 2: Fallen Angelin divided into two campaign paths: Light and Dark. As the game begins players choose and customize their character and choose the path they will follow. This choice determines the ultimate goal and intentions of their character, and as the game progresses through literally hundreds of quests and side quests, the paths of different characters intersect at different junctions. Choose one way and you may be tasked to defend a town and its people, while another path could result in you attacking the same town. The choice is yours and the fate of the world and your well-being are at stake.Key Game Features:A massive, seamless and dynamic world delivering hundreds of hours of freeform exploration.Two deep campaigns: play as the 'Light' or 'Shadow' side, complete with distinct skills, rewards and story-elements tailored to the chosen path.Six exceptional, playable characters, each with a distinct look, capabilities and in-game motivation.Modifiable combat arts: change, upgrade and link together your alter ego's combat skills to match your playing style.Fight effectively from the back of a number of mounts under your control; equip and upgrade your character's unlockable special mount.Deities offer unique combat disciplines and unlock additional quests.Seamless transition between single and multiplayer gaming modes via Xbox LIVE.Captivating online modes of play challenge gamers in cooperative, PvP and PvE play.Extraordinary, cutting-edge graphics and Dolby 5.1 channel surround sound utilize the latest technologies for a truly immersive experience.Character ClassesInSacred 2: Fallen Angelplayers assume the role of one of six characters -- five of which are new to the franchise -- and delve into a thrilling story full of side quests and secrets that you will have to unravel. Breathtaking combat arts and sophisticated spells are waiting to be learned. A multitude of weapons and items will be available, and you will choose which of your character's attributes you will enhance with these items in order to create a unique and distinct hero.SeraphimOften referred to as 'Fallen Angels,' these mystical and angelic creatures are the oldest inhabitants of Ancaria. Fast, elegant and acrobatic warriors from a technological future they fight with light to medium weapons and, if required, with massive technological support. Players can assume the role of a Seraphim and protect the world from chaos.Shadow WarriorShadow Warriors were originally humans trained as elite soldiers in service to the High Elves. Upon their death their souls were stolen by an Elven general, bound to lifeless bodies and imbued with T-Energy. Now free, they travel between this world and the next as undead beings with only the desire to return to the peace of the golden halls of Elysium.High ElfThe best student at the ancient academy of magic in Thylysium, the High Elf character lives and breathes magic. Her hunger for adventure and her insatiable desire to increase her personal knowledge and the influence of her once-powerful house are the driving forces as she sets off into an Ancaria boiling over with turmoil.DryadMasters of the hunt and akin to the Elves, The Dryad are in tune with nature and are equipped with the strength of the forests.

They offer all kinds of animals, from the simple nag up to a real war horse. You can equip a war horse with bridle, saddle and even special armor. These special items can be found in the game just like player items, ranging in quality from regular to rare and even unique items. In addition, every character also has a unique mount created specifically for their character class. This mount not only fits the personality of the character, but also complements the various aspects of the character's playing style perfectly. All character classes can fight from a mounted position using a variety of tactics that the player chooses depending on the terrain and battle conditions.","reviewerName":"The Shadow Warrior","summary":"Not what I was expecting at all.","reviewText":"It only took me an hour of playing this game until I lost interest.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

Well I could not have been more wrong. This game is an absolute gem!! So much better then almost everything else in the FPS genre. It is absolutely beautiful and runs silky smooth, and if you want action, look no further. Seriously this game has it all!The only gripe I have is it's alittle vulgar but it actually does a Good job of making it relevant so even that is really not worth mentioning. Personally I loved this game and wish more games were like this. It runs so smooth it really makes me ask why some other big name titles lag and even freeze when this game never slows even a bit. Sometimes there's so much going on my mind skips but the game just pulls right on through. Anybody who has yet to try this MUST!!

COD4 the same thing. Gears 2... a couple months. Why? Multiplayer is just not that good.The single player game is alright. Cinematic, great graphics and sound and a diverse set of levels and challenges. But it's more of the same. Gears 1 had a tighter story where we knew what we were doing and why. In 2, we wonder why we are the only team in the world and why we are making the moves we do. I guess it's par for the course for sequels.Hoard mode is great but I could only play it for so long before the repetition set in. No lag, fun with friends, and lots of bad guys to kill.Standard multiplayer is frankly lame. The ranking system makes no sense (check COD4,5 for a system that works). The learning curve, even for vets of Gears 1, is immense. Lag is ridiculous. The new game modes don't add as much as I hoped either.I had high hopes for this game but the reason I enjoyed Gears 1 (multiplayer) is the reason I'm just not that interested in Gears 2.

The long list encompasses the supposed glitches/problems that were addressed with the latest patch.1. This had/has the potential to be the greatest game I've ever played, even competing against my personal favorite Mass Effect 2.2. As of now, 11/29/11, 2.5 weeks since the games launch on 11/11/11, the game, for me, is utterly unplayable.Patch 1.02 was released yesterday towards the PS3 masses.  It addressed these issues:-Improved occasional performance issues resulting from long term play-Fixed issue where projectiles did not properly fade away-Fixed occasional issue where a guest would arrive to the player's wedding dead-Dragon corpses now clean up properly-Fixed rare issue where dragons would not attack-Fixed rare NPC sleeping animation bug-Fixed rare issue with dead corpses being cleared up prematurely-Skeleton Key will now work properly if player has no lockpicks in their inventory-Fixed rare issue with renaming enchanted weapons and armor-Fixed rare issue with dragons not properly giving souls after deathI have about 95 hours into the game, and my save file is about 7.8 mb (not big, really).  My character is at level 32.  Before the patch, the game could be very laggy, especially if there was a lot going on at one time on the screen.  Well, now, SINCE the patch, the game has become unplayable for me.  Basically, it freezes extremely often--say, once every 20 minutes of playing.Now, I am not even halfway through the game.  So, while I have almost 100 hours of playtime, I still feel very betrayed by the seemingly two-faced nature of the game.  I love the game, when it works, but it works far less than any game I have ever played.It seriously breaks my heart to give this bad review.  But, I feel that only by uniting in our outcry can we hope to force Bethesda's hand into fixing an otherwise extremely superb product.As of now, I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.Keep your eye's peeled, browse the Bethesda forums.  Elder Scrolls > Skyrim > Software/Hardware problems > PS3.  There, you will see when and if the game is fixed so you can purchase.*Update, 12/3/11: I have played the game for about 1 hour and 45 minutes today.  Right now, as I'm writing this, the game is stuck on a loading screen, i.e. it has been \"loading\" for 8 minutes.  After 5 minutes of loading, I was actually watching the clock, I pressed the PS button to try and quit the game, and I am getting that loading icon whilst the PS Menu is trying to open up, this has been going on for over 3 minutes.  Now, I'm screwed, because I'll have to reset the PS3 while my game is loading and possibly corrupt a file.Also, it has frozen twice in the previously mentioned 1 hour 45 minutes of playtime.  Both times I had to reset my PS3.  This is NOT okay. Again, I don't suggest that everyone has these problems, but I know that I am not alone, and my PS3 is only a few months old (for the \"You prob. just need a new PS3\" argument).  I hope this helps.*","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2011"}

Lots of bugs are fixed.","reviewText":"I was originally very hesitant to purchase this game.  I wanted to pre-order it, but with the glitchy Fallouts and previous Elder Scrolls I decided to wait.  After I heard about the terrible lag after 40 hours and nothing changing, I decided to wait.  When Bethesda announced their new patch, I purchased it.  So glad that I did.Remember that when you see 3/5 stars for this game, it is primarily due to glitches (look at the near-perfect reviews for XBox).  There are still glitches, but it has *always* been like this in big Bethesda RPGs.  It's the price you pay for such a huge open-world with near limitless possibilities.  You are just bound to run into some issues.  That is why I'm giving a 4/5.  I do agree that consumers should NOT be beta testers, and that a little more work before being released would have been smart.  However, I am well over 40 hours and do not have an issue with lag.This is basically an RPG lover's dream.  It has a very old-school RPG feel to it, which I love.  You get to travel this gigantic world with so many quests, sidelines, and trophies to achieve that it is overwhelming and addictive.  Once you get into it, there's no turning back!Want to level up a craft?  Make a potion?  Make armor?  Harvest something?  Get married?  Own property?  Choose sides of a war?  Join a bunch of really cool cults, some good and some evil?  You can do all of this here and more.  The quests are really fun, unique, and I never feel bored or like they are repeating themselves.  The main storyline is actually not that long, it's all of the other stuff that can distract you that takes forever.  Oh, and you can keep playing after you beat the main storyline.The major downside is the glitches.  I don't get many freeze-ups, but I have had some VERY obnoxious glitches.  Two in particular took me hours and hours to fix.  One word of advice: don't become a vampire.  What a nightmare!  I was bitten by one, but had no idea what it did.  I went to a store and kept waiting 48 hours so I could keep selling things.  I kept getting more and more vampire spells and some weird side effects.  I tried to cure it, but realized I was too far past to do it the quick way.  So I did the quest for it, and it was insanely stupid.  I had to get something for this guy who could remove the curse, but by the time I got back to him I was the highest level vampire, and everyone attacked me on site, including the quest giver!  When I fixed that, then the NPC wouldn't even get in the circle to perform the ritual.  He stood on the outskirts of it, and I had to spend 10 minutes pushing him slowly toward the ring.The other glitch was even worse.  I had a guy from the Companions constantly following me with his sword out like he was trying to fight me, but instead he kept engaging me in conversation every 2 seconds.  I couldn't fast travel, and had to do an entire quest with him bugging me every two seconds.  I finally was able to fix it, but things like this are just ridiculous!  And not to mention there are several missions I can't even do because they are glitched up for whatever reason.This is a great game and I would say that if you love RPGs there is no way that you can miss out on this, despite the glitches.  Just make sure you save often with new files, so that you don't have to end up loading a much earlier game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002BSA1MQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"An FPS worth it's weight (single player only)....","reviewText":"First-Person shooters are the type of genre that originally got me interested in video games. There've been several good FPS games released this year (2011) but Crysis 2 is the first one that I feel is worth the $60, especially for us single-player only gamers.In Crysis 2 you play Alcatraz, a marine who's sent with a team to assist with a viral outbreak in New York City. After your team is taken out, Alcatraz is saved by a man named 'Prophet' who's being hunted by renegade \"Cell\" soldiers. After being given his super suit, Alcatraz is mistaken for Prophet and you're thrown into a sci-fi plot that involves outbreaks, conspiracies and aliens. I'm not sure how any of this ties into the first Crysis (I never played it) but the story is solid enough with some memorable characters and plot-twists that kept me interested. That's more than I can say for most FPS stories.The controls of Crysis 2 are borrowed heavily from Call of Duty but with some fun customization. Alcatraz's suit which, along with weapons you pick up can be customized to fit your playing style. Along with your suit's tactical visor (which lets you zoom in/out, tag enemies on the field and shows tactical hints) there's your suit's 'stealth mode' which allows you to turn invisible and sneak around and stealth-kill enemies. Also there's a 'power mode' which allows you to take incredible damage. Add to this a chapter-selection which allows you to play through any chapter (on any difficulty) you've completed with all of your purchased upgrades which increases replayabiliy. This is the most fun I've had playing an FPS in recent memory.The game progresses in a linear fashion (going from point A to point B) but allows a lot of freedom as the playground of New York City gives you access to sewers, buildings and streets allowing you to progress through a level however you want. Half the fun of Crysis 2 is finding alternate routes and solutions to firefights and levels. The game really makes you think about using your environment as a tactical advantage.The one thing that is a let down in the gameplay department is the enemy A.I. Most enemies react the way they should, running for cover and trying to outflank you but you'll still see a handful get stuck in the environment or try to run through walls. It's not a gamebreaking flaw but you will notice this.The graphics in Crysis 2 are some of the best I've seen on a console system. Getting into epic firefights, watching your suit turn invisible, seeing roads and building crumble out from underneath you is done very smoothly....for the most part. There's still some slowdown during action-heavy moments of the game as well as slow loading of mission objective updates, objects in the world, and enemies. Again I probably wouldn't notice things like this in other games but when the graphics are so detailed and immersive, the minor flaws stick out more than they should.Even with it's flaws Crysis 2 is an excellent game! With open-ended level designs, player customization, a good story and a lengthy single-player campaign (a little over ten hours on the first play-through!) with high replayability this is an FPS that's more than worth the money you put into it. Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

It is like Silent Hill in the sense that you can carry an unlimited amount of items. It's like both Silent Hill and Resident Evil in that you're in a town overrun by zombies. Unlike Resident Evil, the zombies can run, and sometimes have weapons, or items for you to take from them after you kill them, and their bodies remain after you kill them. It's vintage X Files, set in the 7th season. It has the voices of great X Files characters like Mulder, Scully, Skinner, Kersh, Krycek, Covarrubias, Cancer Man, and the Lone Gunmen. It's set in the fictional town of Red Falls, Colorado, as well as the F.B.I. HQ, F.B.I. Academy, Roush Technologies, Mulder's apartment, and Tunguska. A perfect blend of new and old from the show. The controls are easy, the graphics are flawless, and the story is enthralling. There are also several shameless references to the show, [the streets in Red Falls are named after X Files episodes for one] and to pop culture in general. There's even a lot of swearing. The bonus features make you feel like you're watching a DVD movie. If you're not into The X Files, then it's time for you to get into it, starting with this game.

{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"Shawn Bird","summary":"My Resident Evil 6 Review","reviewText":"I would have never believed in a million years that a numbered sequel in the Resident Evil series would ever be as bad as Resident Evil 6 turned out to be. You would think with so much money and talent thrown at it that it would be in contention for game of the year. With so many things wrong it is hard to pinpoint exactly where to begin, but I'd have to say it starts with the 600 people working on it. On top of that Resident Evil 6 tries to be everything to every gamer out there, almost as if none of the 600 people working on it had any kind of communication. There is some shines of light in the game, but mostly just seeing what Capcom was going for and seeing what the game could have been.The simple act of playing the game is a mess. Not getting that right doesn't make me wonder how everything else in the game was put together so poorly. Going from Resident Evil 4 to 5 it seemed like Capcom was on the right track for making these game better for action shooters, but now in Resident Evil 6 they take a huge step backward from trying to give too much to both the shooter side and the survival horror side. The mixtures of more western style move and shoot with the series more vestigial elements of the original Resident Evil survival horror style. As frustrating as that it, the game play is also is also constantly taken away from the player, be it a cut scene, a loading screen, quick time event or having the game let you control the character but completely take control of the camera view away from you. The latter being the worst as you can still be attacked by an unseen enemy, which can cost player dearly with so many insta-deaths.There is not only so many problems with Resident Evil 6, but also so much is done poorly. It is as close to being broken a game can get without actually being broken. The character movement is completely awkward. Wanting to simply turn around and instead your character take three steps in the wrong direction, aiming and shooting is very stiff most of time and even though you can now walk and shoot the stiffness makes the slowness of moving feel clunky at best. It is not helped by interactions with enemies constantly feel unresponsive, which also causes the player to usually use way more bullets then needed to take any one enemy down, which can be annoying when bullets are seemingly in very limited supply. There is many times that while shooting an enemy it feels as if the bullets are simply passing through the enemy not even harming them. The shooting as a whole is also hindered by the laser site constantly moving around violently into the aiming reticule, making for many wasted shots being fired. Then you have the camera movement, which is also clunky at best, giving the feeling to constantly keep it moving around you so you can always see what is going on in the environment, because otherwise you might end up in a tight location wishing you had moved the camera yourself while getting into that small location. Although, there is times that the camera is moved for you for no reason by the game when you come back from the cut scene. This can get on your last nerve instantly if you were shooting and a big baddie and now are being choked out by him because a moment before there was a cut scene that when you came back you were then facing with your back to him. Resident Evil 6 is constantly taking jabs at your sanity while simultaneously killing any enjoyment that might have been offered.It is amazing that Resident Evil 6 did not get pushed back to work on the games glaring lack of polish, but what is even more amazing is that the game's release date was actually pushed up to an earlier date. It seems like such a ridicules notion with all that is wrong with this game. This game could have used so much more polish that it makes me want to ask Capcom while they pushed up the release date. There is so many times that players can and will be killed by unavoidable scripted events. Making you want to throw your controller across the room and shut the game off (Which I finally did, shut it off). There is so many times were you are in a level and situation comes up were you are running and a dock blows up with you on it causing you to sink into the water and die or a truck comes from off-screen slamming into you and killing you. Sometimes it will happen to your partner, once racing to keep from being were the ground is falling from under me, I get away but my AI co-op partner was so stupid he stood there and died, causing me to play the whole thing again. That gets me onto the horrible teammate AI in this game. Outside of the usually perfect aim and the unlimited ammo they have, the AI is completely useless in almost every other way. There was a time playing Chris Redfield's campaign that my whole team and Ada Wong (6 people) all stood by the wrong door not moving, nor acted like there were creatures in the room. One guy stood in place with his arms crossed. Meanwhile I had to run around and kill everything.The game also never communicates with you while you are playing, unless it is to have a distant icon letting you know where the areas exit is or an item is you will need. This cause more frustration with the multi-level bosses the game is constantly throwing at you. It is not too surprising as like stated before; I don't think the team that made this game communicated with each other, why would they do anything to communicate with the players? The bosses fights suffer from the same situation of bullets seemingly passing right through them making it feel as if you are not hurting them what-so-ever. It is even worse here because with ammo being not only limited, but sometime nonexistent you can find yourself trying to kill a boss with your knife until of course it kills you.Another design choice about Resident Evil 6 that is annoying in many games is the inability to stop time in the game, even if you want to go into the options to mess with the controls or tamper with the audio/video options. Of course this goes for switching from weapons to first aid or grenades as well, which is made even more annoying by the games clumsy menu system and inventory system. If the inventory system isn't annoying enough on its own and being that at anytime you can get caught with your pants down, it has the added annoyance of each campaign has a different inventory system menu to get use to. I get it, some thing that it makes a game scarier to feel panicked while switching between weapons. It doesn't make a game any scarier, just more frustrating. It is a concept that is often used improperly, which Resident Evil 6 does.Another way the game never communicates with the player is it never readily lets you know of a cover system or never tells you about quickly sliding under things (except in short lived loading screens), but it sure wanted you to know about all the quick time events you would suffer through by starting the game out with a horrible tutorial using most of all the different kinds of quick time events you would come across during the game. One could argue it is worthless to tell you there is a cover system; it is after all badly implemented. You have to be standing by something you can duck behind aiming your gun before it gives you the prompt to tap the X button to crutch down and then you have to continue to hold the aim button to stay down, otherwise you just stand back up. Also I am unsure why you have to hold down the aim button, you can not aim from behind cover at all, which really makes hiding behind cover completely useless, after all it is a shooter series now.The story of Resident Evil 6 is thin at best and feels like any imagination was lost. Resident Evil 4 took players out of Raccoon City and instead of zombies it gave you an infection. At the time that was quite a ballsy move for the series, but it paid off. Then Resident Evil 5 kind of went back to the old ways of story with Wesker and Umbrella, but it did a great job of tying up all lose ends with that story line. So you would think that resident Evil 6 would be completely new right? Now there is Neo-Umbrella and Wesker's son. Not much for imagination at all. The idea with Wesker's son is somewhat interesting I will give them that, but still, come on. Also the concept of four main campaigns all intertwining with one another on a global scale seems like something amazing for the Resident evil series. Then there is the addition of having Chris Redfield and Leon Kennedy both in the same game, which should be like sex for Resident Evil fans. It is just too bad Capcom never build onto that with the story. You would think having big time players like Chris and Leon in the same game and having the chance to being each others personal spaces that Capcom would capitalize on it, but instead it is as if Chris and Leon basically never met. I have not played all the campaigns (didn't have that much time to if I wanted to get a review written), but I have heard the game also uses the interaction with other campaigns to repeat boss fights and encounters, to the point that if you play the campaigns in the listed order the first last boss is the same as the last campaigns last boss, which really seems lazy and anti-climactic to me, but again I haven't played through them all as of yet.Resident Evil also has a Mercenaries mode, which I have not played. So I can not say anything at all about it. I am not even sure what it is at all. There is also an Agent Hunt mode wich allows players to enter into another players campaign as a monster and give them some trouble, but really Resident Evil 6 as a whole gives players enough trouble. Outside of that the Agent Hunt idea is brilliant. I have no yet toyed around with Agent Hunt either at this point.Resident Evil 6 is a disaster in almost every way possible. For me it proves the old saying \"too many cooks in the kitchen\". I love the Resident Evil series and I really like where they were going with it, Resident Evil 5 was a lot of fun and I played it repeatedly many times. There is so much wrong with resident Evil 6 it is hard to say where it started. The only really great thing to come from all they money spent on it was the look of it, the game is beautiful. It is unfortunate that everything else went so wrong. I would like to think Capcom will learn from the mistakes made here, but I am sure the game will sell a lot and they will see it as a great success and that would be most unfortunate for not only fans of the series, but fans of shooters and survival horror games in general. It is sad to see one of the major series in video game history be reduced to something less than mediocre, to something really not worth taking time to play. Maybe with the next console cycle we can have a reboot of the series.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00503E9FY","description":"","reviewerName":"DL","summary":"Too big to fail?","reviewText":"Keeping with tradition I made sure to be in line early Tuesday morning to pick up this year's new and shiny edition of COD MW. Terrible weather (power went out for several hours) kept me from getting out to the midnight release. Upon firing up the game we see an offensive content warning and are given the option to proceed with the potentially offensive content turned on or we can be reminded again later just before the event happens. Well, I just paid $60 for this game so I dont want to be cheated out of missing anything even if it could possibly offend me! I mean c'mon, I wasn't offended by the airport massacre in MW2 so how bad could this be? Moving right along to the main menu we get our choice of Spec Ops/Co-op, Campaign, and Multiplayer. After hearing a lot of hype about the revamped Spec Ops mode I decided to give it a try first, but get a pop-up strongly advising me to complete the campaign mode first. I guess MW knows best so sure why not, let's play campaign mode first.Campaign Mode:This is the mode I usually buy the game for. The COD MW series is renowned for their fast paced action, intricate storytelling and jaw dropping moments. MW3 has all three of those and in some ways they seem even better than ever. Sure the campaign is sinfully short, I mean dang I'm maybe an average COD player and I finished it in only 5 hours and 3 minutes! With that being said the campaign mode was far more memorable as a whole than MW2. With Infinity Ward wrapping up the MW series you knew there would be some major story line events in this one, but none of them felt very forced to me. I won't give any of them away...specifically who lives and who dies. For the first time in the series I felt like the story was flowing smoothly and coherently. But wait, how are the graphics you ask? I mean geez they have been using the same engine since 2007. No complaints there, if anything the graphics look as great as MW2 and the shadows and lighting look even better. For the most part Campaign Mode is more of the same old, but overall that's not a bad thing as far as I'm concerned. The only thing I hoped it would have this time is a new cover system. Almost forgot...let's talk about the possibly offensive scene. Really, this is what Infinity Ward was worried about? I just shot 400 people in the face so NO, watching the Davis Family Vacation go South doesn't bother me at all!Spec Ops/Co-op:After that quick 5 hours scamper through Campaign mode it's time to give this mode a whirl. Survival Mode is a blast! You start out with 4 or 5 selectable maps and after reaching a required level it opens open 4 or 5 more and so on. The best part about this mode is that you can play solo or split screen with someone sitting a few feet from you or you can invite/join another player for help from online. I really enjoyed the Delta and Riot Squad Support, but wasn't too impressed that if I make it to wave 25 and die I'm starting back at wave 1 with a pistol. Even with that complaint, this mode has a lot of replay value. I didn't notice too much new content in the Spec Ops Mode. There are plenty of missions and luckily (for me) plenty of good online players to partner up with to increase your chances of earning those gold stars.Multiplayer:Like I said before I usually buy every COD MW game for the campaign. The hype around the MW multiplayer is normally so huge that it ends up sucking me in for a few hours here and there. After several hours spent respawning I'm not seeing anything exceptional new or great. I'm definitely not buying into the \"Elite\" service as I just don't care enough about the Multiplayer Mode to spend the money. From what I've seen the \"Elite\" service keeps an enormous amount of valuable map and statistical information stockpiled so I'm sure it's a great thing for those who love multiplayer. The real diamond in the rough for Multiplayer Mode is the new editions of \"Kill Confirmed\", \"Team Juggernaut\" and \"Infection\".Overall I enjoyed MW3 and I use the past tense of the word enjoy, because Im not sure how much longer I will be playing it. It's by no means just an expansion back of MW2 like some people are claiming. In reality it's the culmination of a four year journey that started in COD 4 MW. If you bought this game expecting to get something completely different than MW2 then you will be disappointed. Infinity Ward isn't going to stray too far from the formula when there's still tons of cash to be made. On one hand I almost hate to see the story end, but on the other it seems long overdue. I'm not sure Infinity Ward has any place left to go with the current build of the MW series. They have accomplished just about everything possible with a FPS so it's hard to imagine what their next project brings or if it will even have the title of COD MW at all. The bottom-line is if you love MW multiplayer then you will want to go spend your $60 right now. If multiplayer doesn't matter to you then I highly suggest sticking to renting this game. You will have the campaign done with plenty of time to experience Spec Ops and still get it back to the video store before its due date. 3.5/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2011"}

Final Fantasy 7 had materia, 8 had junctioning, 9 seemed to be missing a little. You learned the abilities through the weapons and armor you equip and eventually you will master that ability, I believe they could have done more to the battle system to make this one more different than the others. The other problem I had with this one is that at a certain point near the end you can't revisit locations, you are basically forced to go on to the end of the game and I enjoy doing the side quest so I also felt like they could have t=done this differently.However I absolutely loved this version and remains my favorite one, yes I have played  almost all of the Final Fantasy's and I am working on beating the ones I haven't like 5 and 6.

That's not to say that I didn't make attempts to get into the Medal of Honor, Halo, and Half-Life games, but it was never a genre that appealed to me. That is, until the first Modern Warfare game came out. The tight controls, riveting campaign, and intense action sucked me in right away and I couldn't put the game down. Two years later, Modern Warfare 2 has arrived on a cargo ship of hype, anticipation, and lofty expectations. Does it live up to all the pre-release fanfare? For the most part, yes, but I won't hail it as \"Best Game of All Time\" as some already have. It's a great game, but it's hardly revolutionary.The story is seen from the perspective of a couple of soldiers who are all out for the same purpose, and the locales differ greatly from that of the first Modern Warfare game. Afghanistan, South America, Siberia, and even the US are battlegrounds for your soldiers to fight waves of enemies on, and the same \"get from point A to point B\" mission set up of the other Call of Duty games is in effect here as well. This makes the game feel overly linear at times, but the focus is more on battle action than exploration. For those who crave both, exploration does reap certain benefits, such as collecting enemy intel items that are scattered across the map. Collecting quantities of these will unlock Achievements/Trophies. For most, however, this will be the same \"run and gun\" experience as the other Call of Duty games, and that's not a bad thing at all.For me, the two best aspects of the game are the intense, albeit short, single-player campaign and the Special Ops missions that involve completing certain objectives, with stars being awarded for speed and timeliness of completion. The campaign is challenging and immersive, but rather short as others have mentioned. The average gamer should be able to complete the campaign in 5 to 6 hours on the regular difficulty, but more seasoned Call of Duty players can probably breeze through it faster. The difficulty determines the experience you will have. I played it though on regular and found it to be challenging but not overwhelming. The \"hardened\" difficulty will challenge you further, while the \"veteran\" difficulty will find you getting killed off very quickly. But pressing on has it's rewards; the big achievement points/trophies come form finishing levels on the higher difficulty.Gameplay-wise, it's essentially the same mechanic as the first Modern Warfare, which thankfully doesn't try to fix a system that isn't broken. Veteran players of the first game will feel right at home, while newbies will quickly learn the intuitive controls. A host of new missions and weapons also prevents the game from feeling stale; snowmobiles, rafts, and gunships help break up the pace and prevent the game from being the same battlefield scenario over and over again. My personal favorite additions are the stealth missions in snowy Siberia and using the Predator missile (accessible through a laptop) to take out enemies en-masse. Visually, there is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said - the graphics, animation, and cut scenes are all stunning. You can see where the millions of dollars in production costs went.Unfortunately, the one area I cannot comment on is the multiplayer, which I imagine is what most people bought the game for. Most of my friends are not gamers and none own an Xbox 360, so I can't comment on that particular aspect of the game. However, the campaign and the Special Ops missions have kept me interested and the intense action kept me enthralled from beginning to end. Yes, the campaign is short, but I would prefer a game with a short but excellent campaign as opposed to a long and meandering one. If you are a Call of Duty fan, it goes without saying that this is a game you should own.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2009"}

The essence of London is caught as you explore the city, playing the part of Mark Hammond, an ex-con driven into the criminal life by Charlie Jolson, a big mafioso boss, and D.C. Carter, a rogue cop determined to end the Jolsons' reign on London.  The cut-scenes have to be the best that I have seen in quite a while.  The humor in the cut-scenes is a bit dark and wicked.  And, as the package says, there are both sexual (e.g., \"tarts\") and drug references (e.g., \"crank\").  The fact that the game doesn't treat you like a moron is also an asset.  But, here comes the several criticisms of this game...First, the producers of this game should have included a map of London in the package and/or able to be called on-screen at any time.  Many, many, many times the turn indicators on the car have just driven me around in a circle!  It gets frustrating after the twentieth time that you do the same mission, getting lead around in circles. Note: Some of us have never been in London before, and a map would be REALLY nice!  Second, the character animations of Mark Hammond and D.C. Carter could have been greatly improved.  They should move more fluidly and have more movements available to them.  Third, your companion's AI could have been improved, instead of acting like complete idiots.  Fourth, the camera poses a big problem since it is fixed and often lead to many control issues with me.  Lastly, there should be options to save the cinemas as well or have a movie mode where you complete the game, you receive a movie with most or all the cut-scenes included.  Since the producers made such a big deal about the movie theme, it is sincerely a waste to not have an actual movie mode.Overall, this game is pretty good, and one of the better games that I have played (even better than Grand Theft Auto in my opinion).

You cannot shoot weapons out of cars while you drive, yet other gang members can shoot at you from their cars.  In out-of-vehicle gun battles (on foot) auto aim is sluggish and often unreliable.  When you get shot, you have to limp to a wall and lean there for 60 seconds to regain health, which gets annoying when gang members are shooting at you.  controls are HORRIBLE, and the weapons selection is very limited (shotguns, MP-5's and AK-47s are the most powerful weapons.ON THE POSITIVE SIDE:  The Getaway has incredible graphics and takes place in a virtual London (downtown area) that is almost a replica of the British city.  Real brand names exist-- you can see popular fast-food places and clothing stores, which adds a lot of realism.  All the major London landmarks are in the game, Buckingham Palace, Trefalgar Square, Big Ben/Parliament, Tower of London/museum, London Eye, etc.. The traffic AI is very impressive, and there are many more cars on the streets than in the popular GTA3 games.Summary: Graphics and cityscape are very realistic, but the sluggish play control makes the game very annoying.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2003"}

A dramatic tale of revenge sees Nariko, a fiery red-haired heroine, embark on a quest for vengeance against an invading King and his army. The story builds around the ancient Heavenly Sword, which once belonged to a powerful deity. It can never be wielded by a mortal without it slowly but inevitably draining their life-force.When the invading King (played by Andy Serkis) destroys the warrior clan that guards the Heavenly Sword, the clan leader&#x2019;s daughter, Nariko, takes up the sword in a desperate fight for survival.

The music and sound effects are adequate, but unremarkable. The storyline, script, and dialog are some of the worst in modern gaming history, although the voice acting is well done.The gameplay makes impressive use of the SIXAXIS controls. They are tricky to get the hang of, but work much better than most PS3 implementations of the motion controls once you learn it. The system utilizing the motion controls is called \"aftertouch\". Basically after you use a ranged attack, you can control the object as a guided missile.The hack and slash combat system gets repetitive and boring, but at least mixes it up a little bit with 3 different \"stances\", one for breaking through blocks, one for quick attacks, and one for extended range attacks. There is also a counter system that is a little tricky to execute.Some of the cutscenes can be pretty gruesome and disgusting, even though the title is only rated T for teens. The game is set in a primitive medieval world, with some fantasy elements, but also horror and more brutal portrayals of reality than other games in similar settings.I found the script uncompelling, and felt I was being dragged through a torturesome storyline just to get to play the next level. The emphasis in this game was obviously on finding people talented in graphic design and cinematography, not writing talent. It's really a pity, because this game had the potential to be much better. But it does show what the PS3 is capable of, and is a preview of better games to come.This title is a good option as a rental, but probably not a good choice for your PS3 library now that better titles are coming out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2008"}

InDarkCloud, however, the world is destroyed by a malevolent genie in the very beginning, and it's your job to put it back together. This action/RPG will require you to battle your way through dungeons to collect vital artifacts with which you'll rebuild the game's world in real-time 3-D. From there, you can view the world from above, zoom in, revolve 360 degrees around it, and, of course, explore it for more artifacts to build other parts of the world.","reviewerName":"Chris Peters","summary":"Good fun that gets repetative after 10 hours...","reviewText":"Dark Cloud would make a really fun rental - you might be tempted to buy it afterwards.  However, whatever you see in those first few hours is all you're ever gonna get, because this game is very repetative.  It is basically a dungeon crawl - you explore random dungeons and fight monsters in real time, Zelda-style.  Sadly, Dark Cloud can't hold a candle to Zelda - it's missing great puzzles, great story, and any sense of exploration.  Each new dungeon has different &quot;wallpaper&quot;, but you will find that each random level has the same basic layout, which gets old very very quickly.  Getting experience is fun, because you level up your weapons, not your characters, and you can tranform weapons or even imbed their power in other weapons.  The best reward is finding town pieces in the dungeon, which you take to the surface and begin assembling, almost like SimCity.  I actually had lots of fun with this part, but there are only 4 towns total, so not much to it.  The graphics are nice, and at times amazing, especially in the towns, but in the dungeons I felt they were merely &quot;ok&quot;.  The plot is basic and uninteresting.

{"product_name":"B00005V6BB","description":"Medal of Honor: Frontlinemarks the debut of the Medal of Honor franchise on the PlayStation2. InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"JakFrost \"thegreatui\"","summary":"Motion Sickness","reviewText":"This game was awesome; I would have to say that it's a pioneer for World War 2 games.  This game has some of the best game music and by far the best game trailer (To watch it all you have to do it just don't press anything at the title screen).  The game has no auto aim and when an explosion hits your screen shakes.  I found myself moving my guy rather then the cross hairs to try and hit the German soldiers.  What makes this game five star material you ask?  Well it's the fact that the first missions you play you storm a beachhead with a whole lot of Allied forces.  After that you get to play solo missions were you pose as a German officer to sneak in top-secret labs.  A side not a cool point in the game is when your in Paris using the sniper rifle to watch as German officers yelled at the local French populace, just take aim fire and watch as German grunts come to charge your position.

Theisen","summary":"Fantastic solution to a common, nagging problem","reviewText":"I purchased this product as part of my \"upgrade\" to the Move package and accessories. It was an incredible relief to see something like this prevalent with other accessories in searches, as its purpose is to solve one of those pesky, nagging problems that the majority of players face at some point-- you're going to run out of room around your TV and need some organizing help. In my case, I need to have my center channel from my 5.1 speaker arrangement on the the TV stand (just below the screen) in the center, making that Eye location impossible. Setup took literally under 30 seconds to get the Eye aligned in properly, and perhaps one minute to get positioned nice and centered.Though I had a Sony HDTV to clasp on to the top of (so my assumption is that a Sony product is going to surely work with another was correct), the unusual nature of this \"clip\" has let me test it elsewhere and have seen it work on a number of different TVs. Despite the fact that the actual piece holding the Eye steady doesn't have a clasp or set place to lock in to on the back, it's a very firm hold.Even for persons without a TV that will allow a locked connection on the front, the flexibility of the clip with the Eye in it nearly assures a proper angle for use of the Move, even if it takes a little extra working to get the two components lined up the way you're like. Almost a totally foolproof product, fair price, and refreshingly durable plastic make it essentially impossible for me to fault it in any way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2011"}

The straps fit comfortably on your arms/ leg and track all youre movements and your heartrate to make a great fitness program. You can set up a 3, 7 or 9 week training program to fit your needs and while the graphics arent impressive... that isn't why you buy it anyways. There are a great variety of exercises to choose from and it is fun! I enjoyed this a lot more than other fitness games but it also has a lot of problems.Heres why Not to buy it,1. The sensors are an amazing idea but they need a lot of work.  No matter how good your form and positioning is, the game will read you incorrectly and force you to hold a lunge for 10 seconds extra before it makes a correction. It seems to always do this in mid lunge , squat, or some other uncomfortable position.2. Constantly skips counts on fast paced exercises like skipping, foot fires, running causing you to do much more than planned.3. Focuses WAYYYYYY too much on lower body. Even the upper body days will give an advanced user leg/calf cramps from excessive repetition of skips, foot fires,running, biking, boarding. I have been mountain biking for years and considered my legs to be very fit yet I constantly had to skip days due to calf cramps even 2 months into my program. **And yes i did stretch and drink plenty of water**I find myself constantly changing batteries hoping to make up for the sensor/gyro shortcomings and am always cursing and screaming at the damn trainer because it says im not doing something right or giving extremely low heart rate during peak exercises.

{"product_name":"Logitech G700s Rechargeable Gaming Mouse","description":"","reviewerName":"Stacy \"Amazon Junkie\"","summary":"Hunter or Druid profile? Time to smack around some noobs!","reviewText":"I am a girl and I am a gamer. I know, I know, I am like a mythical unicorn; girls playing video games? No way! But, just like guys, I do exist, and I have gaming needs, too. Namely a mouse that is durable, accurate, has a good battery life, and can be programmed to map attacks to different buttons. In short, I needed a gaming mouse, and with the release of the Logitech G700s, my l33t skills in World of Warcraft became even l33ter!ConstructionSince the product description does a fairly good job of explaining the technical details, I won't elaborate on those specs here. However, I can describe that mouse in terms of design, so here goes.&#8226; The mouse is contoured to comfortably allow your hand to rest during gaming sessions. The mouse is big enough for someone with large hands, but still designed so that all shapes can use the G700s without pain/discomfort. In addition the mouse is slightly textured so that your fingers will remain in place so that you're aligned with the buttons and can use them 1) accurately, and 2) easily.&#8226; The mouse can be used wirelessly or while the charging cable is plugged in; the cord plugs into the mouse from the front center. The plug slides in and fits the profile of the mouse so that the cable doesn't stick out or inadvertently pop off while playing.&#8226; The buttons on the side of the mouse do &#34;click&#34; slightly to indicate that they have been pressed. They are also small, but you will quickly adapt to selecting the desired one after a few uses.&#8226; The mouse is relatively lightweight, but still heavy enough to control easily.&#8226; The three lights on the left side of the mouse toward the front indicate the battery charge. Green means that it is fully charged, yellow means it is starting to wear down, and red means plug it in ASAP.Well, Does It Work?The first thing that you will notice when using the Logitech G700s mouse is that the laser sensitivity enables the cursor to fly across the screen. The other thing is that it is faster if the charging cord is plugged in; if you remove the cable there is a bit of lag and then the cursor will move again. However, once the cursor moves you will definitely notice that some of the speed/sensitivity of the mouse has decreased.When it comes to programming the G700s, I want to offer a bit of a warning; if you are already using a Logitech gaming keyboard and have a profile established with the Logitech software, plugging in the mouse may bring up a prompt indicating that the profiles have been found and whether to keep them. If you are not careful, you may accidentally wipe out your saved macros.That being said, the software included with the mouse is intuitive and makes it very easy to map commands to the buttons on the mouse. In addition, you are able to save up to five different character profiles that you can switch easily, enabling you to have greater control of multiple characters and/or games.Final SayIf you are looking for a good gaming mouse that will allow you to program macros and react more smoothly to the action on-screen, then the Logitech G700s laser mouse is the way to go. While it is pricy, the flexibility of using it wireless or corded, the multiple buttons to ensure you will be able to control every last ability of your characters, the ergonomic design, and the great battery life all add up to an awesome gaming experience. If you want to develop an advantage over other players, the extra price of this mouse is justifiable; alternatively, if you are a CAD engineer and want precision movement, the G700s can fit the bill. With all of this being said, I love my G700s, and I am fairly certain that the gamer in your life will love it too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2014"}

Skyrim itself is very fun and have put several hundred hours into the original game.  The legendary adds all the DLC and allows you to continue leveling by reseting your max skills to re-level.  May sound rather odd, but I like it.  You get a few more perk points and can always keep going.  One big reason why I stopped playing after awhile on the original version - once you max out the talent trees that you use most frequently there wasnt much else to do with your character.The DLC is all pretty good, with hearthfire just adding some depth to your character, and being able to travel just north of morrowind is great (who else wanted to swim back there??  would be soo awesome!).  Dawnguard... was pretty dissapointed.  But overall some great new content to trudge around in.As always, the PC version is sooooo much better than the consoles.  Destruction tree too gimpy?  Download a mod to fix it.  Stealth too overpowered?  Then download another one.  Want to get some cool new items or armor?  yup, they have quite a few of those.  The mods add so much to this game that you will never get on PS or Xbox.The down side?  Steam.  Oh my god I hate that system.  Concept wise its cool, but there is one very, very annoying thing about it that drives me nuts.  Steam has to update your data to the steam 'cloud' about every hour or so.  50% of the time this crashes the game and freezes up my comp.  It also sends these very annoying advertisements to my computer that do the same thing.  If there was one program that I would just absolutely LOVE to delete off my hard drive, it would be steam.  I guess if it worked then I really wouldn't care - its an easy system to buy games and download mods, etc.  But after the 50th time rebooting my computer cuz steam is a steaming pile of you know what....

I didn't bother playing as I was too intimidated as a 6 year old at the time. I tried it, but there were no cracks in the walls to let you know where to bomb and finding some of the levels proved too difficult at the time. (I have since beaten it plus the master quest.)Then I bought Zelda 2 as a kid. Some say its the black sheep but its my second favorite Zelda game. I beat that game on my own after getting stuck a few times. Anyone remember finding \"Error\" in the woods for the letter to move on?Which brings me to this game. I borrowed it from a richer friend when it first came out and I was just getting out of elementary school. The music was ground breaking, the graphics were 2d at its best and still holds up pretty well to me. The puzzles were tricky but I eventually did solve most of them. I couldn't put this game down till I was done. The level of difficulty was just right. (Take that Ocarina of Time, a game where i constantly got stuck and thought it was really difficult to get through without help of some sort. People still praise it as the great game ever but i dunno about that one...)Maybe this game brings out my old school 2d love but I prefer this one to any 3d Zelda game and it is a diffinite upgrade to Zelda 1.

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"We gave the Go a Pass - not for us","reviewText":"We currently own 3 PSPs (3 kids) and one of my kids really, really wanted an upgrade to the Go because he thought it would be a cool gadget. Luckily, a classmate of his got one last week and when he came to play the online Uncharted 2 yesterday he brought his new Go along - I asked him to bring 'everything' the Go came with so that we could evaluate it and decide on the upgrade.This is what we found.THE GOODS- Being smaller, it's a lot easier to carry it around.- It's a really good-looking gadget.- The smaller screen looks sharper because it has the same resolution as the larger 3000 screen.- The 14GB of usable internal memory can hold quite a few games, especially if you don't fill it up with movies.- Cell phone tethering is a good download option if you have a good cell phone plan.- Bluetooth allows pairing with any headsets.- Allows to pause a game the come back later and resume play.THE BADS- Proprietary charger.- Proprietary USB cable for data transfer.- Memory Stick M2 is one of the more expensive cards.- Replacing battery will void the warranty.- 802.11b is the slowest Wi-Fi, downloads take a long time.- Analog joystick hard to use by grownups.- Impossible to transfer games/movies already purchased on UMD's- Not all popular PSP games are available as downloads and some downloads cost more than the UMDs.- Higher price does not seem to be justified by features.OUR DECISIONAfter playing with the Go while my son's classmate managed to actually blow up a pair of speakers playing the online Uncharted 2 (true, but it was really my fault for hooking up some old speakers to a new receiver) my son decided that he didn't want one.The deal breaker was the 'downloads only' with no migration path for existing games. We have more than a dozen PSP games already, a pretty serious investment including some new ones (Crisis Core, Dissidia) and he didn't think that the sleek Go was sleek enough to justify his starting with new games. There's nothing to prevent us from downloading minis or full games from the PSP store if we ever wanted to go that way but going the Go way would narrow our options. It would be nice to have Bluetooth and a pause option but it's a lot easier to live without those than without all the games we've bought over the past couple of years and all the flexibility that the PSP-3000 affords us.Besides, our kids do borrow games from friends to play over the weekend and lend their games to their friends. Not to mention that a couple of our games we bought on UMDs as 'used' and they sold a few of the games they got tired off. None of the these would be possible on the Go.In the end, it was an easy decision. We won't be buying a Go at this time and we can't think of circumstances under which we would want a Go.RATINGAmazon's '3 stars' means \"it's Okay\" but the Go is not Okay for us. I understand that those who don't own any PSP games, would never consider trading or selling the games they buy, don't care about proprietary chargers, USB cables, memory cards and batteries and have no problems with slow downloads may actually be happy with a Go but we do not belong to that group so we can only grant '2 stars' - the several improvements (Bluetooth, pause features) saved the Go from a more embarrassing 1-star score.__________________________________NOTE: the Oct 1 date is not when this review was written.

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait. You can't buy a much better game.--John CockingPros:A story to beat all storiesCharacters worth caring aboutHey--it's from SquareSoftStunning animationsCons:Too many random battlesCombat is, as always, turn-based and offers minimal excitementWeak souls might give up after two or three discs of play","reviewerName":"Joy","summary":"So unique and fun!","reviewText":"Once again, I have to completely disagree with the cons of the Amazon review.  The battles are different from other Final Fantasy games but it's certainly far from being boring and the random encounters are certainly not too much.  It's really sickening to read this stuff all the time.  But I won't dwell on this.I really love this game and love how unique it is and how different it is from other Final Fantasy games.  I remember when I first played the game, it was a little intimidating at first because I didn't understand the whole draw system and drawing of magic and how you had to manage your stats with the magic you got from the drawing.  But I became pretty good with it pretty quickly and now I love it.  This game also punishes you for leveling up your characters since the enemies level up with you.  I find this just as awesome as leveling up in other games since it really takes no more time to draw magic than to grind.  A lot of battles I am in for close to an hour since I'm drawing of magic but to me, that's nothing to complain about.  I love it!This is an epic love story and feel Squall and Rinoa belong together.  The music and areas and sidequests are so awesome.  I love the different chocobo forests and riding the chocobos.  I love the whole city of Esthar and there's just so many things in this game.  I love how on the world map itself, you can draw magic from draw points and you can see these cool trains going around and disappearing into a tunnel.  The world map itself is a sight to behold, let alone the rest of the game.  I love the airship you get to control and all the different areas you go to.  Oh and it's so awesome with the summons in this game.  All the summons, each have their own abilities that they can learn which is really an awesome addition to this game.  Oh and Odin is my favorite summon and you can't summon Odin but when you do see Odin come into battle, it's so awesome because you actually hear his horse.  It's so creative.  The sidequests and mini-games are so fun.  An epic storyline and seeing all the characters develop throughout the game.  Of course the music is some of the best in the whole series.  This is what Final Fantasy is all about.  Just so many amazing things.  It's so underrated.  A MUST BUY for Final Fantasy fans and RPG fans!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZE2G","description":"","reviewerName":"Flea Returns: FF13","summary":"Fun and thrilling game but left me wanting more","reviewText":"I enjoyed this game. For someone that prefers RPG's to any other style of game, this game was really fun. Nonetheless, beyond the pretty graphics and the fun gameplay, there wasn't a whole lot to keep you going. As always my reviews are split between story, gameplay, and characters.Story: 6.5/10Yeah the story is basically you and your friends are partying on an island when you are kidnapped by pirates. They kill your brother and you escape and are trying to rescue the rest. But other than that, there just isn't a lot there. Yeah there is some weird voodoo going on on the island but just not much there. Now, I fully understand this is a FPS. FPS games by and large do not have a great story as the focus is on the gameplay. That being said, the story was still pretty shallow. If this had been an RPG i would have given the story a 2 or a 3. Nonetheless the story was there and it was decent enough to carry you through the game. There are two endings and both endings are just kind of...well they end the story.Gameplay: 8.5/10Now the gameplay is the obvious strength of this game. The shooting mechanics are phenomenal. The stealth aspect of this game is probably the best of any game I have played. Simply phenomenal. The whole hunting aspect to improve your gear was simply wonderful. It was awesome. Sniping, flamethrowing, grenades, assault rifles, machetes, rocket launchers, BOW AND FRIGGIN ARROW, just simply awesome. The whole, taking over compounds and winning back parts of the island was simply awesome. 10/10 on all that. I wish you could periodically lose parts of the island, I think that would have been fun but there was enough there that it really didn't detract from it.Unfortunately, there was some annoying things about the gameplay that just detracted from the overall experience. First the whole loot and exploring to find loot was largely pointless. The entire island was riddled with chests to find but every flipping one of them consisted of money ranging from 5-45 bucks and a item that could only be sold for 1-200 bucks..plus some ammo. No awesome armor, or cool weapons, or neat explosive bullets or something. Just money and an item that turns into money. They did have some neat items like finding special letters and artifacts but other than achievements and experience, those were rendered pointless as well.As far as the sidequests and missions and such went it was a mixed bag. All of the missions were awesome. Hunting a pack of rabid wolves with a rocket launcher? AWESOME. Taking out a group of pirates and being forced to kill the leader with a knife and only a knife. also AWESOME. Taking over a compound with the extra challenge of not triggering any alarms and never being seen? FRIGGIN AWESOME. Racing to get medical supplies from point a to point b in a certain amount of time. Fun but not as awesome as the rest. Overall these missions were great. BUT those are the ONLY missions there are. Hunting for an animal, taking out a pack of pirates or baddies with a knife, delivering medical supplies, winning compounds. That's it. Sure there are a few random sidequests that don't exactly match those 4 quests sprinkled throughout the island. But most of them consist of little more than go fetch this, or go talk to this guy and come back.Largely, the game consists of you opening up a sector of the island, winning the compounds, doing the quests associated with the compounds that are either hunting or taking out a pack of bad guys, do the medical supply drop then moving on to the next sector. That all being said, the quests themselves are really fun. But it would have been nice if there was a little more variety.Characters 6/10The characters are completely forgettable and really not even worth mentioning. Ragtag group of rich kids gets captured on an island and the one guy that actually seems like he could survive on the island gets killed in the beginning. You take over as that guy's brother Jason and go on to kill a crap ton of pirates and mercenaries while becoming a member of some weird tribe, while trying to rescue your friends. Jason goes from pansy to rambo over night. Didn't really buy that but it is what it is. The rest of your friends consist of rich boy, little brother, two chicks with little personality, and a pot head. There really isn't anything here. HOWEVER...the reason it didn't get a 1/10 is because of two characters. The first was Vaas. The first villain. This dude is legitimately insane and friggin hilarious. One of the better villains in video games. Very crazy, very intense, very funny. The second was Sam, your undercover assistant on the second island after Vaas. German guy who is just simply hilarious. Hardcore dude. But very entertaining.Overall: 7/10The game is worth playing but I don't think it deserves all the hype that it got when it came out. The strength of this game is easily the gameplay. It is phenomenal as far as game mechanics. However, there are plenty of little things about the gameplay that are just annoying and overall the play through gets repetitive after a while. With the expected shallow story, annoying tidbits of gameplay, and mostly forgettable characters, there is enough negative about the game that blemish it's overall awesomeness. There is an awesome game here that with a little polish and a little more depth could have been an amazing game. Nonetheless, this game is worth playing and is an enjoyable ride.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2013"}

As you beat the levels of the game you get very cool unlockables, including bonus missions and characters too.This game is one of the best Star Wars games ever. I was afraid that after too much hype the game wouldn't deliver, but it's a fairly challenging game, you can play it in easy normal and difficult mode to adjust it to your playing skills. The missions are rather short, but the bosses will take various tries to beat since you have to get a strategy and they have Jedi, or Dark Side powers which makes them more difficult, but it doesn't get to the point of being frustrating.The game is addictive and only getting tired of smashing buttons against a tough boss will make you want to stop.Another cool part is that you develop your characters with experience points. There are four types of kills Fair, Good, Impressive and Masterful, the higher the rank the more experience points you get and the faster you may develop your character. Also there are many hidden secrets through the missions, including boss levels. If you can't get them on the first time around, you can play any of the missions once they have been beaten.If you liked the EA Lord of the Rings games, you would definitely would want to play this one.

The game is as shallow as can be, there's no story, no depth or reason to any of the mini-games.  It's just a menu, and a handful of games, and that's it.  Some games are fun, others feel way too gimmicky and aren't very responsive.  The graphics are beautiful if a bit simple.  Great colors, and the island setting is lovely.  One thing I really hate about this game is the loading.  For games that are so simple, and over so quick you have to sit through way too many loading screens, island panning camera shot intros, warnings about wrist straps, warnings about remote gloves, warnings about seizures... it goes on and on!  You end up sitting through about 3 mins of warnings and loading screens to play a mini game that lasts 2 mins.  It's very tiring.  If you're playing a game as simple as Wii Sports Resort everything should be instant in, instant out.Ultimately, I found this game pretty disappointing, especially at $50.  The price tag wouldn't have been so bad if the Wii Motion Plus was actually being utilized by more Wii games, or if this game had more depth to it, but it's not and it doesn't.  There are only a handful of other games that use the accessory, and most of them are not very good at all.  Nintendo has really been cranking out a lot of under utilized accessories for the Wii, and that's very disappointing.  Note to Nintendo: I don't want or need any more piece of white plastic in my house for your system, I need more first party games!  hat's not to say that there isn't fun to be had with Wii Sports Resort, but don't expect to hold your interest for very long, especially if you don't have a friend or two to play with...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004S5PBM0","description":"","reviewerName":"Q","summary":"Almost playable - almost","reviewText":"I've been looking forward to a product like this for a long time. It lets you hook up a guitar, play along with an actual song, and it kind of, slowly, helps you get better at playing.My problem with this specific product is the unnecessary load times (or re-load times), and the constant tune nagging. The second problem first, the game makes you tune every time before you play. I tune my guitar maybe once a month, and usually it barely needs it. Surely the program could either give you the option of skipping the tuning, give you the option to go out and tune it yourself, or even better, they could detect when you play that your guitar is out of tune, recommend tuning (giving you the immediate option to tune), and/or allow you to tune from a in-game menu. OK, this is annoying, and slows you down a good deal, but it's minor.The major problem with this game is that the time to load between playing a song EVERY TIME is loooooong! There are so many times I've wanted to play this game, usually thinking about it on the way home from work, whilst listening to my car stereo, but then I remember frustration I get just trying to get -into- a song. You can -kind of- get around this by stopping the song, and selecting restart. That works immediately. Which also begs the question, why don't they just allow you to restart at the end without making you load again? Either way, for the small amount of date they have to load, the load times are ridiculous, and the reason for a loss of two stars. TWO STARS!? you say, demanding I reconsider. Yes, I have re-considered, however, because of this problem I have no desire to play this game, so for me, to truly convey the lack of desire to deal with that issue, I have to give less than three stars. Three stars says to me, \"It's not bad, I recommend it\". well I don't recommend it. I recommend the makers hire a developer who can fix the load times, and release a sequel with some new content. I'll Redbox it first, if the load times are fixed, then I'll buy it - which is what I recommend you do with this game.I know this is a pretty long review simply to state \"Potential, however, I don't recommend it because the load time between songs and replaying the same song is too lengthy to make it fun.\"","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2013"}

Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Perfect for me but on the short side all the same","reviewText":"Brutal Legend is a great game. So great in fact it's only down fall is it concludes very fast. The saying goes \"Time flies when you're having fun\" and no quote could be more genuine when summing up Brutal Legend.To be honest I was excited about this game until I found out that in addition to the action oriented hack n slash game play it was also a real time strategy game. RTS has never been a genre that appealed to me. I'm more about being a loner or in a small group as opposed to dictating the actions of up to 50 or so troops  with different strengths and weaknesses. Yet somehow Double Fine had me addicted to the RTS \"battle of the bands\" set up as well as the driving escort missions, gunning death rack tower segments, and even helping my head banger bros score beer and babes. Getting a gamer to be captivated by genres he normally dislikes is no easy feat. As a matter fact to date I'd say Brutal legend is the only title that had me enjoy types of game play I'd normally be insanely frustrated by.While Brutal Legend is influenced by Heavy Metal I don't necessarily think you have to love that genre of music to be enthralled by what is offered. It tells a decent fantasy tale with its' own unique mythology.  Despite the fact Brutal Legend throws Grand theft auto, God of war,  Zelda Ocarina of time, and Over lord into a blender it retains being original and non confusing.Starting off Eddie Riggs is a likable hero. When I saw the first Brutal Legend trailer I thought maybe Eddie would end up being like Kratos aka a dumb enraged testosterone jock covered in leather and spikes. Instead Eddie cares about others, refuses to be a glory hog, and is more akin to that lovable best friend you knew in high school whom despite looking \"scary\" was very charismatic, generous, and optimistic.However Eddie does not start out our tale as a happy camper. Pretty much the game drops us into a scene where Eddie's talents as a roadie are being exploited by a tween pop band trying to pass themselves off as the new equivalent of heavy metal.  Eddie's awesome stage is referred to as \"ironic in a retro sort of way\" and one of the rockers gleefully enjoys breaking  guitars just so Eddie has to fix them. In a humorous kind of way the scene reminded me of Cinderella only Eddie is a guy and instead of having 3 wicked step sisters he has to contend with three jerk wad step brothers. Most of us would understand if Eddie cussed out the manager and quit on the spot but instead he selflessly saves one of the band members from plummeting to his death. Eddie's heroism is ironically rewarded by having a stage prop fall atop his burly frame. Riggs' martyred blood mingles with his magic belt buckle summoning an angry yet noble monster of yore. With a mighty roar Omigodan the fire beast slays the blasphemers stopping their terrible music than it whisks Eddie away to an enchanted dark fantasy world influenced by the awesomeness that is \"True Metal\".Yes, I realize this sounds cheesy. We can draw parallels to it being similar to Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonder Land. However the rock n roll death metal studded presentation of the tired \"Stranger in a strange land\" plot device works perfectly.Upon arriving in an alternative lifestyles version Never Ever Land Eddie slays a bunch of blood thirsty occultists with an axe he finds then meets a sweet yet fierce young woman named Ophelia. She tells Eddie the robed weirdos he decapitated are the servants of the demon emperor Deviculous and that there is a human resistance trying to over throw their evil master. Equipped with his battle axe and electric guitar that can raise relics of ancient power or melt faces Eddie constructs a hot-rod on the spot, riding off into the sun set with the mysterious yet hot Goth girl to save mankind.You will proceed to interact with the lovable yet eccentric guardian of Metal Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy the hellacious biker healer, Lita the spirited Amazon, and Lars the golden haired hero who fast becomes your new best friend.  If these famous real life cameos were just thrown in to sell a bad product I would have felt cheated. As it stands they are woven in seamlessly with the world they are apart of. Every person in the game has good motivations for being the way they are and they seem more concerned with contributing to a good yarn than with out-staging each other.Brutal Legend has a sand box world. In truth you can blow through the story line as fast as a guitarist riding the lightning but if you go that route you are going to miss out on a lot of land marks, extra missions, hidden music tracks to play while driving around in your Druid Plow, world folklore, and secret guitar riffs which grant Eddie arcane war-spell techniques whilst battling making victories come much easier. Unearthing these mementos of the forgotten age likewise increases \"fire tributes\" which you use to upgrade your hot rod and fighting combos within Ozzy's motor lodges.The thing I really hope developers learn from Brutal Legend is its' perfect balance of campy humor and emotionally driven sincerity. While it can be stated Tim Schaefer's newest offering doesn't take itself too seriously it also doesn't undermine itself with an over abundance of bad ham and moldy cheese. Jack Black whom voiced Eddie walks the delicate line between satire and tragedy with perfect harmony. I honestly  have more respect for him now. I'm hoping future movie producers see Jack's true potential and stop giving him roles that undermine his hidden talent.By this point I've explained enough. I cannot say anymore without edging dangerously close to spoiler territory. This game is one that has to be experienced instead of merely read about. Words alone fail to express the creativity, awe, and mirth packed into this sour yet sweet nostalgic road trip through Heavy Metal heaven!Pros+Breath taking twisted yet beautiful world to traverse.+ Good blend of RTS, driving, exploration, fun mini games, and visceral combat.+ Acting and sound track are the best in the business.+ A tale that is not too grim yet not ridiculously silly either.+ Fun multi-player RTS battles over Xbox live+ The enemy types are scary yet outrageously hilarious at the same time. Every creature encountered is some sort of parody or tribute to the various kinds of heavy metal music.Cons-Game is a bit short but to its' credit the ending brought a smile to my face. (Unlike Fable 2. Cough.)-The upcoming down-loadable content is \"meh\" if you are more intrigued by the single player story line than you are the RTS aspects.-Tim Schafer is not renowned for making sequels. For those like myself who want a sequel we may have to bite off  a bit of bad tasting disappointment.-Side missions get repetitive and there are only around 4 types of them. For what its' worth these mini quests extend the game and they're fun for what they are.-Though I took to the mish mash of game styles some may be more puzzled than pleasantly surprised by BL's patchwork Frankenstein of genres.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001ASJISG","reviewerName":"C.T.","summary":"No \"Sands of Time\" but a good, albiet short game.","reviewText":"I really enjoyed PoP, especially the twist at the end.  It definately leaves room for a sequel.  But with a changing market they need to change how they design the game.  I'll explain later.The graphics are very cool, probably the best cell shading I've seen on any video game.  It looks like a highly detailed sketch at certain points, very cool!The controls are pretty good but can get awkward depending on which way the camera is aimed (up may be up or it may be right?)  They shouldn't take you very long to get used too.  Also, I think there's too many buttons that do too many things.  Take the Sands of Time for instance, to run up a wall, grab a ledge, jump off, etc, it pretty much all done with 1 or 2 buttons.  Now you've got one button for a longer jump, one button to grab rings, one button to jump up/off a wall, etc.  Games like this need simple controls to keep the gameplay from getting too confusing.Combat is even worse, you need all 4 main buttons to do different things plus the control stick PLUS a block button...keep it simple.  Thankfully combat is not the focus of this game (nor has it been for any PoP game with the exception of the Warrior Within, which I didn't like very much).  The acrobatics were pretty slick, although they didn't feel as streamlined/quick as they did in the Sands of Time series.  Maybe they made them a little more realistic, I'm not sure, but I like the much faster pace of the other games more.The gameplay itself is pretty good but at times feels a little too restrictive, like I'm on a track and have only one or two options of where to go.  I guess that's typical of PoP games, but after playing Assassins Creed which was mostly open ended, I think PoP could use a small dose of it.  Elika was a neat addition, although I didn't really like the fact that you cannot die.  She fits the story well but doesn't really add a whole lot more to the gameplay itself, you can jump further with her, use her in combat...that's about it.And I know this is petty but why couldn't they have made \"the Prince\" an actual prince instead of a guy who uses that as a nickname?Being an achievement finder they could have made the achievmets for this game SO much better.  I HATED the \"be gentle with her\" achievement.  This is one of the worst ideas ever, because it made people like me quit out of the game every time she saved me.  There's no \"load game\" option while your playing, so I'd quit to the menu and reloaded.  I bet that at the end of the game she only saved me 15 times...but mentally I couldn't keep count so I played it safe.Here is where I think UbiSoft missed their mark...they are not keeping up with what the market wants.  Xbox live is a GREAT service, not just for playing multiplayer games, but for comparing times/stats, etc.  Prince of Persia games have never been about combat, they've always been about navigating obsticles, and with Sands of Time that turned into \"navigating obsticles using acrobatics at very high speeds.\"  My favorite achievements on this game were the \"runner\" achievements, get from point A to point B within this much time, they are a blast.  They need to ditch the light seeds, the combat, most of the pointless (find all areas, find this view, go to a high place, etc) achievements and make 20-30 \"runner\" achievements, as these are easily the most fun to get.  Make some of them extremely difficult, that will make the veterans want to keep playing.  And to top it off do what Devil May Cry 4 and Ninja Gaiden 2 (and other games) did, add \"Time Attack\" leaderboards for these running achievements.  Let players compare their times to other gamer's times, make it somewhat competitive.  As it stands the game was fun but it doesn't really give me a reason to go back and play it again or to \"try to set a new fast time\" or anything.Overall I'd give it a solid 8-8.5, I really liked the game although it has some faults and, as said, it doesn't have great replay value.  There is some DLC coming soon that will add new areas, but I don't know if it'll be worth the purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001AWDFUY","description":"007 Quantum of Solace PS3","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"Second only to Goldeneye!!","reviewText":"\"Take a deep breath, you only need one shot make it count.\" And they didn't miss the opportunity to make a great game. This game is a great addition to the storied franchise. Now I'll answer the question everyone is asking. Is it better than Goldeneye? Well no it's not, but few games even come close to the greatness of Goldeneye, but this game does come closer than any previous game in the series. The graphics are great. I've never seen any video game character so well modeled as Daniel Craig has been in this game. He looks amazing, a spiting image of James Bond. The enemy models are a bit lacking, some variety would have been nice. It is the COD 4 graphics engine so the environments and cut scenes look pretty good.  The game play is very similar to Rainbow Six Vegas, but is much smoother. There is the X when you hit your enemy like in COD 4, which I personally like. The story follows both Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale. It is however more heavily proportioned to Casino Royale, as to not give any of the major plot lines for QOS. This was released before the movie in fact. This game has it all explosions, gun fights, stealth, and great Bond moments, along with an average online experience.Presentation- The music is taken right from both movies, and really adds to the feel of you being James Bond. I would have liked the QOS intro credits sequence, with the theme song. That unfortunately was not included. There are nice cut scenes, along with what look like DVD menus, which was a nice touch. 4.5/5Graphics- This game has an overall great look to it. The environments look great with every level filled with fine detail props, and an amazing model of Daniel Craig. The enemy models are a bit over used, but overall a pleasing game to look at. 4.5/5Story- As stated above it uses both movie's storylines, but centers mostly on Casino Royale. I love the train mission where you find out how Bond got to take Mr. Beach's spot in the poker game. Another awesome moment in the game is where you have to stumble out to your car to shock your heart. Those were nice touches by Activision. Also well done cut scenes add to the movie feel of the campaign. 5/5Game play- The cover system works beautifully. You can easily switch from one cover to another. There is a nice combat system that works great for some of the boss battles and normal takedowns in the game. You basically hit the right button when it pops up on your screen. There are a lot of great trophies to unlock, which have great Bond related names. There are a few drawbacks in the game though. Bond in this game is a blind fire God. He is more accurate blind firing then when you aim. The lock picking section of this game is frustrating. You have to tap the right button on your cross pad when it is shown on the screen. This may sound easy, but in the harder difficulties it becomes a real annoyance. Overall the game plays well with a few minor complaints. 4.5/5Lasting Appeal- This game is a blast. Yes it is rather short. It takes about 5 hours to beat. I've beaten 3 times though. I wish it would have been longer, but when a campaign draws you back 3 times to beat it how can you complain. It is rather easy so I recommend the hardest difficulty for a true challenge. The online is even exciting for a day or two. 5/5The Verdict- This game is the true sequel to Goldeneye. It does almost everything right. It has fun filled game play, great Bond moments, and is based on two of the best movies in the franchise. There is word of a remake of Goldeneye, which is very exciting. I just hope they don't give up on Craig in James Bond video games; his first installment was near perfection.

Berethor is the captain of the Gondor Citadel Guard, and is looking for Boromir. Idrial is an elf woman serving Galadriel. Elegost is one of Aragorn's fellow rangers. And so on for the other three characters; all are made in the shape of other, similar characters. Their activities and encounters all follow the Fellowship, even at one point finding the campsite used by them when in the mountains (in the first film). The objectives are usually tantalizingly close to the fellowship - \"Oh, that's our campsite, yeah, so come find us in the Mines of Moria! Oh, wait, we moved on.\" Gandalf narrates the scenes \"speaking\" to Berethor, usually encouraging him to try and catch up with the group. Many of the game's boss fights are against non-canon enemies, enemies the Fellowship dealt with (supposedly), or enemies that it wouldn't make sense to have killed. As a whole, the story appears more like a fanfiction than a professional work.The gameplay is reminiscent of most RPGs. Characters have HP and MP (or, rather, AP), and various class-specific skills. They can fight, use skills, use magic, or use items. Items tend to be LOTR-specific things like Lembas bread or Kingsfoil. Most of the attacks in the beginning are simply \"hit harder\" or \"hit harder against certain things\", but this later evolves into magical abilities as well. For the most part, the system is uninspired and not particularly exciting. The characters run around on the world map and have old-style random encounters that pop out of nowhere. The majority of the battles are fairly boring and have nothing to set them apart.The graphics are fairly terrible. The textures are blocky, the characters seem mis-proportioned, the animations are odd and unnatural, and everything seems to be blurry for some reason. The voice acting is decent, but not spectacular; the characters seem chosen, again, for their resemblance to established characters.As a whole, this game has nothing going for it. It seems amateur in many ways, and isn't particularly fun, either. Even for fans of LOTR, this isn't that rewarding because of the many inaccuracies and oddities present.4/10.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}

I can barely sit here and write this review, because I want to keep playing!You play as Ratchet, the last known survivor of a catlike race known as the Lombaxes. Clank is your robot buddy, who spends most of his time strapped to your back, offering advice, or using a well-placed propeller to slow your fall. Your nemesis is Tachyon, the last survivor of the Cragmite race, who will accept nothing less than the complete domination of the universe.Most of the time you'll be running around as Ratchet, trying to collect bolt points or Raritanium crystals to power up and purchase new weaponry. Every once in a while you get to play as Clank, and unlike other games where secondary characters may not be very fun to play, Clank has unique abilities like being able to slow time and control other characters. With a seamless menu, you can choose weapons, deploy items, wear costumes, take flight, and more. Your goal is to discover the Lombax secret, and stop Tachyon's tyrannic reign of terror.Pros:(1) The graphics are very crisp and clear, even on a non-HD television. The visuals are similar to the type used in the original Crash Bandicoot game, but with a Blu-Ray redux and a 3-D environment to explore.(2) There is little bit of every kind of gameplay. Want to lay waste to hordes of enemies with a flamethrower? You can do that. Want to collect trinkets to upgrade your weapons? You can do that. Want to dance like a pirate and shake your booty? You can do that. Want to go rail-sliding like a skateboarder? You can do that. Want to avoid surface-to air rockets with the Sixaxis controller while free-falling? You can do that. Want to shoot down enemies in a spaceship? You can do that. Want to make your enemies dance to a disco ball before sending them to meet their maker? Yep, you can do that too!(3) Having infinite lives. This game is designed to keep you entertained and keep you playing until the story ends... with infinite lives, you can keep trying to jump that chasm, fight that boss battle, or duck that laser until success is in your grasp. Kudos to the game designers for including this feature.(4) The humor. From the computer countdown \"Oops...3-2-1!\" to Qwark's pleads of \"I'm too handsome to die!\", Ratchet & Clank had me chuckling all the way from the opening credits to the end titles. Some of the jokes remind me of the game Blasto - and there's more than one character presenting the jokes here.(5) The secret goodies. It's no surprise that video games are less about high scores and more about unlocking secrets these days. There are secret weapons, character skins, hidden areas, and using a style similar toResistance: Fall Of Man, there is a long list of \"skill points\" to unlock, which skyrockets the replay value. The requirements are not always clear, but there are more than enough internet sites to help you out.Cons:(1) The camera angles. Unfortunately, there are a few places where the \"behind the back\" camera angle can get stuck and the shaking becomes nauseating. Thankfully there aren't many of these, so it can be overlooked.(2) The skill points. Yes, this is a positive, but it is also a negative. Most of the skill points are really fun to earn, but a few are next to impossible to achieve without an astronomically high level of patience. Those infinite lives will come in handy for the hardcore gamers.(3) Weak boss fights. Almost every boss in this game can be defeated with little difficulty. While some people may feel games like God of War are too difficult, I think there should be a middle ground - and this game almost feels too easy at times.In closing, if you had fun playing games likeBlastoorCrash Bandicoot, you'll have a great time with Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction.

COD 4 was one that made the genre explode, and for all practical purposes all the games after have been variations of it.It had an intriguing story, good characters, and an excellent multiplayer; with one big flaw: rampant cheating.  Being able to pick your own server was good if you had a clan and liked the team, but it was also bad as you found servers where only the admin and *wink* *wink* his buddies would do well.  Complain and you get kicked.  Few things are more frustrating than being endlessly zinged across a map with headshots or pouring ammo into an enemy and blam blam they get you instantly.Modern Warfare 2 was good and bad.  It had if anything an even better single player campaign with the scary prospect of World War 3 happening on U.S. soil, but it was achingly short, barely five hours.  The multiplayer was....well at first I thought it was a good idea to have servers selected for you.  Just if people who were cheating got on they couldn't be kicked off, and the kill streak system was poorly thought out--whoever got the Harrier would win.  But mostly what turned me off is it was cartoony, with poor sounds and a general feel like an old school arcade game.Black Ops was a near return to form; a good story and a COD 4 style gritty and realistic multiplayer with a better and revised weapon system.  I've played this the most of any in the series, however it not only had legendary problems with hit detection; it was also back to square one with clans and cheating.  I have a hint for you cheaters out there:  don't use the same call sign where ever you go, people will notice your 100+ kills only in a COD game and your ho-hum performance in others.  The killstreak system had the same flaw as Modern Warfare 2; once someone bumped up enough it was endless helicopter spam.  This game also introduced the Special Ops mode and the goofy Zombies mode.Soooooo........here we are with Modern Warfare 3.  The single player was also a short five hours, and confusing.  After a quick pitched battle in New York suddenly the American campaign is over.  The Russian president is going to broker peace and gets kidnapped, and after a brief innuendo the Russians now invade Europe.  This time there's even less motivation or explanation, and the ending is along the lines of, \"Wait, that's IT??\"The multiplayer was straight back to Modern Warfare 2.  They select the server for you.  The sounds and effects are very cartoony again, and the graphics are only marginally better.  I thought they dropped this because people didn't like it--what gives?  If you've played COD 4 or Black Ops and go straight to this it feels like Quake III redone with a modern day look.  But they now want you to start shelling out money for the \"Elite\" multiplayer for more content, tracking scores, etc.After tinkering on drivers/settings I've gotten used to it; kill streaks are thankfully limited so you don't have endless helicopters coming in on you.  But still, until you get up to about level 25-30 you're getting plastered left and right.  Lately the cheaters have subsided, but there is a weapon balance problem with Akimbo FMG9's (subguns) where they can pretty much zap people halfway across the map.  Supposedly this will be fixed in an update but who knows.So I feel neither here nor there at this point.  The single player was very disappointing, the multiplayer is just the same game with different maps and weapons.  The game has to change or fix it's problems, not keep lacquering a new face onto the same thing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

We will take a look at how Square's interpretation of Real-Time combat fares and what contributions it made to the gaming world.STORY: 4/5Unlike the novel-ish FINAL FANTASY 6 and CHRONO TRIGGER, Secret of Mana (SoM) has a rather basic story with only a few exceptional moments. For this game I felt it worked rather well. Since the focus is on Real-Time combat, it only makes sense that the gamer spends most of their time fighting, not reading text.There is only one ending and it's not 30 minutes long, but it does wrap up the story very well and makes the player feel rewarded.MUSIC: 5/5Hiroki Kikuta did the soundtrack for this game, SEIKEN DENSETSU 3 (SoM2) and the much lesser known SOUKAIGI. All are great soundtracks and worth hunting down. The music in this game is a nice change of pace from the epic works of Nobuo Uematsu. In general I found the music to be more playful and optimistic in the villages and \"calm spots\" of the world. Many of the palaces and dungeons feature music that is more mysterious than it is forboding.GAMEPLAY: 3.5/5This is where I really disagree with some of the reviews of this game I've read so far.On the one hand, it is very obvious that the gameplay in this game was the precursor for the combat system in FINAL FANTASY 12, where you have 3 characters fighting simultaneously, two of them automatically. So in that regard the gameplay in SoM was very influential.The actual actions of using magic and swinging your sword/weapon around are not complicated--they're just as intuitive as they were in ZELDA. However, I found a few areas that could have used some attention:1) Tedious magic-leveling system. To go from level 1 to level 2, for example, you might have to cast a spell about 10 times. To gain more levels, you have to cast that spell more often. What I found really annoying were these two side-facts.A) There is no point in leveling most of your magic. Especially the girl's magic, with the exception of Undine. You could leave most of your other magic creatures at Level 0 or Level 1 and still beat the game. Even the boy's magic is not necessary to raise all the way to level 8.B) If you do want to raise the girl's magic, the best way to do it is to cast it on yourself--HUNDREDS of times! Sounds fun, doesn't it? If you want to raise the boy's magic, again, you have to cast it on enemies, HUNDREDS of times.In my opinion, ALLOCATION POINTS would have worked better, where you get to pick which magic you need at \"full strength\" and change your alignment as needed.Finally, many of the spells are just plain worthless--granted, the Final Fantasy series is guilty of this as well, but it is annoying when you're building levels for a magic creature who only has one spell that you may only need for one or two boss fights.2) Pointless \"Weapon Charging\" system.When you build levels with your sword, you can \"charge\" it to do a \"better\" attack. In my experience, it simply multiplies your damage. So if you charge your sword to level 4 and cut loose, you might do 400 damage instead of 100.The problem is this: While \"charging\" your sword, if you get damaged or take any status ailment, you have to start the \"charging process\" all over! At that rate, you'd be better off hitting enemies with several 100% Level 0 attacks.3) Corners and Snags. Your party consists of 3 characters, but you can only play one of them at a time. What results if you want to avoid enemies and just run through the dungeon? You quickly find that your movement is restricted due to the actions of your other characters. They'll constantly get snagged on corners, stuck down/up-stairs, find themselves fighting enemies or getting struck with a status ailment--limiting/stopping your movement until they recover. Instructing your non-playing characters to GUARD and KEEP AWAY has little effect, either. They still sometimes take a swipe as they pass an enemy.Even with all this, the game is still playable, but can be unnecessarily frustrating. Once you get to higher levels you become so powerful that (like in FF12), you pretty much just walk right through enemies and nuke everything in sight.GRAPHICS: 4.5/5Not the best that I've seen on the SNES, but pretty high up there. The villages look very rustic and well-lived-in, featuring nice touches like flower pots outside, vines creeping up the roofs and plants growing between the roof tiles.The bosses look pretty impressive and there is a nice variety that come in different sizes and alignments.I felt this game did an exceptional job with presenting colorful, varied environments. My favorite being the shadowy mushroom forest of King Truffle.The overworld Mode 7 map is very impressive and alot of different effects are used, such as spinning it around when you exit a cannon-ball.On the downside, I found that the magic spells were very basic-looking. I felt that the spells should have looked better graphically with each new level, as this would have given more incentive to improving your magic.CAMEOS: Santa and Rudolph make a brief appearance in this game. Cool points if you get the Kilroy reference when fighting the robot boss.MULTI-PLAYER: This game is known for the fact that if you have an adapter and 3 SNES controllers, each player can control one character. I've never seen anybody play the game this way. I can see how it could be frustrating if one person continually uses magic, meaning the other characters have to wait until the spell has subsided before they can move again.SUGGESTIONS: I think the lesser-known TERRANIGMA is an equally good game with many similarities but fewer annoyances.OVERALL: 4/5I think it's fairly obvious that this was Square's first effort at Real-Time combat in an RPG. The graphics, story and music make up for the moments where the gameplay is a bit lacking or nonsensical.No Rabite's were harmed in the writing of this review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2001"}

Even scared my dog...","reviewText":"As many next-gen console owners have discovered, the market is saturated with high-budget games that look pretty, but lack substance. Dead Space is NOT one of those games.When I bought this, I was eager to play, but ready to be disappointed, since EA is somewhat notorious for the types of games I mentioned. I was pleasantly surprised from the first few minutes of play... no dissapointments at all. Now, 11 hours in, I've been continually impressed and drawn ever deeper into the story and game itself.This game is scary. I mean, it's not going to give you nightmares (well, maybe for some people), but it will keep you feeling tense while you play it, and is even a tense viewing experience for people watching you play. The environments are beautifully rendered, but also claustrophobic, macabre, and full of scares. In contrast to the close-quarters corridors in the ship, there are some gargantuan open spaces -- usually in Zero-G -- that make for epic fight sequences / exploration.Sound here is top notch -- effects and soundtrack both. You're never able to relax when you can hear screams, groaning metal, footsteps, crashes, etc. happening all around you, all the time.The story is solid (if derived from the same sort of alien / zombie thing that's so popular in sci-fi), the controls are creative and good, and the lack of pause menus or a HUD keep you immersed in the gameplay.While this game isn't for everyone -- it's EXTREMELY graphic and gory -- it is a masterpiece for the new console generation and is one of the most fun titles I've played (and that's going all the way back to the Nintendo days)! Hats off to EA by taking some tried-and true formulas (3rd person horror from Resident Evil 4, or being trapped in a spaceship full of aliens / zombies from lots of games and movies) and developing them into something innovative, horrifying, and addictive!If you even remotely like horror / sci-fi / action and can handle gore and some scares, then this game is a definite buy. You won't regret it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2008"}

{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A true \"spiritual successor\" and one of the best RPGs you'll ever play","reviewText":"When I finished playing Demon's Souls back in 2010, I wrote in my review that it was my favorite game of the current console generation, and that still holds true today. The game was a truly unique and innovative RPG in a generation that, despite being full of many great games, isn't going to be remembered so much for its innovations in game design. So obviously, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on Dark Souls, the game the developers have touted as the \"spiritual successor\" to Demon's Souls. After putting nearly 90 hours into the game, I can say that Dark Souls is every bit as good as the masterful Demon's Souls. Dark Souls has made some key changes to the design of the previous game, yet at the same time maintained, and even refined, all the characteristics that not only made Demon's Souls such a great game, but also, a breath of fresh air.The biggest change Dark Souls brings to the fold is the introduction of a singular, interconnected game world. Not so much an \"open world\" like Skyrim or Red Dead Redemption, but more so a series of fully explorable areas that are connected by at least one passage (think Super Metroid). This gives the game world a much greater sense of not only mystery, but dread as well. Where as Demon's Souls gave you much more guidance by providing a peaceful hub world leading to the separate areas of the game, Dark Souls drops you into the middle of its world without any sense of where you are supposed to go. You will receive vague hints from NPCs, but it's up to you to find your way around, and this makes you feel not only more isolated, but also makes achievement even more satisfying. As you learn your way around, you'll slowly begin to see how the world is interconnected, and you'll marvel at the absolute genius behind the design of the world (which manages even to trump its predecessor in level design). The same dark, dreadful and isolating vibe that oozed from Demon's Souls levels remains here, and is amplified by the sense of scale you get from this world. Atmosphere plays such a dominant role in this game; Dark Soul's atmosphere is so thick that it is basically an ever-present character in the world, continuously following you around.A key change also comes in a more forgiving checkpoint system, represented by various bonfires that can be lit and serve as not only as a place to rest and replenish, but to upgrade & repair weapons and armor, manage your inventory, and eventually, warp to different bonfires you've previously visited. I found this to be a much smarter design than the \"start from the beginning\" method employed by its predecessor.Despite these changes, Dark Souls remains one of the purest, most challenging, and most enjoyable games to be released this console generation. The combat remains among the finest of any game ever made, demanding patience, practice and cunning from the player. Your enemies remain fierce, intimidating, and sometimes terrifying. The different types of weapons, armors and items, as well as they ways they can be upgraded, has exponentially increased over what was offered in Demon's Souls. The multiplayer component, where hints from other players can be left in your game world, where partners can be summoned to aid in battle, and where you can invade another's game or be invaded yourself, has been given a new dimension of depth with the ability to join Covenants. And the boss battles are still the most epic and sinister of any other games out there. From Software, the developers, have successfully kept what worked in the first game, made changes where it counts, and still turned everything on its head with the newly structured world. The game feels familiar, yet fresh. Fans of Demon's Souls will be pleased. For first-timers with the right amount of fortitude, Dark Souls will be a revelation.Demon's Souls is still my favorite game of this console generation. I'll never forget the first time I stepped into the imposing world of that game, and how I slowly realized that the developers were quietly revolutionizing the RPG genre. Yet despite this, I can still say that Dark Souls is the better game of the two. It feels less fragmented, more masterfully crafted, and most importantly, more fully realized. This is a game that is retaining the essence of the hardcore RPG experience while setting itself apart from its contemporaries by combining brilliant design with stellar gameplay to create an experience that simply isn't being matched by anyone else. Dark Souls is another masterpiece from From Software, a developer who is daring to be different by reaching further than most others would dare, and is striking gold by doing so. RPG fans would be doing themselves a disservice by missing this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}

For one thing, it plays Blu-ray dvds and streams internet wirelessly.  It also plays awesome games in great quality.  I have mine hooked up to a normal tv, the same one I had my PS2 hooked up to.  I used the basic cables that came with it and I could easily tell a difference in the graphics.  It would look twice as good if I hooked it up to an HD tv with an HDMI cord.  The wireless controller works well.  There is a usb cable that plugs in the front.  When your controller gets low, a message appears and all you do is plug it in and it charges while you play.  But the charging cable isn't very long and if you're camped out farther away from your system, you'll have to set up camp a little closer for the time being while it's charging.I have never owned the older version of PS3, so I can't say the pros and cons of this one vs. that one.  But they say this one is quieter, more energy efficient, and smaller than the original.  I never notice the noise of the fan when I am playing.  Having it use less energy while still putting out the same great graphics is great too.  This one is not PS2 compatible.  Which is something I kind of wanted but considering this is the newest and cheapest model, I still went with this one.  Only the very first model of PS3 is completely PS2 compatible.  So then I was like, well I'll just buy that one, it should be pretty cheap since its an old model.  But I was wrong.  That one sold for more than this one.  Not just a few bucks either.  You'd be lucky to get one for somewhere in the high 300s.  So then I was like no way I'm paying $75-100 more for an older model that can't do as much.One of my favorite things about the slim is Netflix instant streaming.  If you don't have an account with them, your missing out.  The cheapest you can get an account would be around $15 a month maybe.  Now they have this box you can buy for $100 that allows you to instant stream movies for free.  As many as you want, when you want.  But if you get a PS3 Slim, you just go on the Netflix website and they'll send you a free disc.  All you do is put it in your System, and it works the same as the instant box.  The PS3 is like a do it all box.Over all, I'm pleased with the system.  It occasionally freezes, but it can be prevented with a little thing called cleaning your discs and allowing your PS3 breathing time.  The latter is only an issue if you play more than about 6 hours at a time.  Any less and it doesn't matter.  But I've found that after I been kickin' some butt in a game for 6-10 hours, my PS3 freezes more often, which is only about a couple times a day, but it's still annoying.  If you play for a long time, here's what you do.  Play your PS3 till you eat lunch or dinner.  Then when you go to eat (unless you eat while you're playing) turn off your system.  Then when you come back it'll be nice and rested and be ready to accompany you on your next quest.Play on gamers!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2010"}

It really did live up to the hype, unfortunately much like the Dreamcast it was criminally overlooked, although im sure most people who owned a Dreamcast did buy it.The combat itself is nothing special, in fact the turn based battles are pretty slow, not as flowing as the active time battles of most Final Fantasy games.  The beauty of the game doesn't lie in the battles though, the plot is where all good RPG's excel and this is no different.  Exploring the planet is great fun in itself, despite the random battles (which you can later avoid), and the plot moves along superbly right until the end of the game.  Where this game really innovates though is in the ship battles.The ship battles are excellent, rather than fighting as a party, as you do for most of the game, you instead pit your ship against another ship, sometimes even monsters, though usually an enemy pirate or general from the armada.  If you have played the game you will know how good these battles are, and what a joy the game is to play.  If you still have a Dreamcast picking up dust and you don't already own this, you could do no better than to pick it up.  It also came out for the Gamecube, which I believe was basically the same game.A truly classic RPG, which deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as other classics like Final Fantasy 7, superb.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00004SVYE","description":"Sequel to the popular Legend of Zelda game, by Nintendo, for the original NES console.","reviewerName":"JRP","summary":"The Adventure Of Link Zelda II review","reviewText":"Now I am going to review a game that most Zelda fans are divided on some hate some like it & that is The Adventure Of Link Zelda II. I am being honest if I want to play Zelda this wouldn't be the 1st game I'd pop in I would go for the 1st game or my favorite A Link To The Past or Ocarina Of Time, Majora's Mask or Twilight Princess which I finally got around to playing I can say each time I play it I like it more & more. Zelda II was released in January of 1987 in Japan & in December of 1988 in The US. So really it was rushed in Japan & btw The Japanese love hard games The Japanese version of Super Mario Brother 2 is very hard so much so that they took another game & put Mario characters in it. I don't know if it would've worked out if they had done the same thing for Zelda II so it's probably best they didn't. Zelda II is unique cause it's a side scroller & it put in more RPG elements. Both the original Zelda on The NES & A Link To The Past on SNES were both overhead games & were more of an adventure game than an RPG. This game doesn't use rupees you have to to rely on experience points & special skills you get in towns when you talk to the old men or knights or the gear or tool you find in towns. So it does have a novelty of being a full RPG & not just RPG elements. There are your typical easy enemies outside in Hyrule & in the 1st few dungeons & the dungeons aren't too bad. The bosses I think are more unique than the original Zelda. I might as well get into the story Ganon was defeated in The Legend Of Zelda but there are still members of Ganon's clan that still worship him & they have what's left of Ganon & the only attempt to bring Ganon back to his pig like glory is they need to kill Link & use his blood to revive Ganon. Link has came back to Hyrule cause he needs to attain The Triforce Of Courage hidden in The Great Palace so evil couldn't get their hands on it. Impa tells Link a story about when The King Of Hyrule died & left the kingdom to Zelda A Wizard tells The King's Son that his sister knows where the 3rd piece of The Triforce is at The Wizard threatens to put a sleeping spell on her. She won't give the location out so she is put under the spell but The Wizard dies right after. So this Zelda has been asleep for hundreds of years. Impa gives Link these 6 gems to place in 6 dungeons to get to The Great Palace. So the remaining followers of Ganon see this as their time to strike & believe me you they are p  i  s  sed at you. You start off with Moblins & bits & bots going after you but then you have these Tektites that are the hardest they have ever been & you have to have the fire spell that shoots fireballs out of your sword to kill them. Not only that you have to deal with these axe wielding enemies called Daria's annoying enemies like Megmat's & these things called Moa's that fly all over the screen. Bago Bago are very annoying & can get in your way & they can knock you off into a pit or whatever & you lose a lifewhich if you lose all 3 lives then it's game over return of Ganon you lose all your experience points I don't know if you lose all your tools or not. I can forgive the difficulty cause a lot of NES games were hard so no problem with it's difficulty but I can't give the 3 lives & you start over the pass.  Another enemy that is bad news is Iron Knuckles the blue Partetamce, The Wizrobe's & even worse in the 3rd dungeon they look like member of TheK  K  K. You have these things called Ra's that fly across the screen they're in the way. The Bubles steal your magic for no good reason & you need magic & you need as much as possible mainly the shield spell, life spell & later on the thunder spell. The attacks you learn like the down thrust come in real handy especially for The Rebonack boss. I will talk about some fo the magic you get the shield spell lets you take less damage when hit. A jump spell that makes you jump higher. Which that spell is also great in boss battles. The life spell does what it says it regains some of your health again great in boss battles. The fairy spell Link turns into a Fairy no comment here. Reflect Spell it knocks back attacks such as The Wizrobes attacks. The spell spell which turns some enemies into bits & bots. The Thunder spell which makes 1 of the last bosses Thunderbird. This game as I said has better bosses than the 1st game well except for the 1st 2 temple the 1st dungeon's boss is Horse Head & in the 2nd temple you have Helmet Head. The 3rd temple you face Rebonack. The 4th temple you face Carock it's rememberable  cause the way you defeat it is using the reflect spell & it doesn't take much to beat it. Gooma in the 5th dungeon is was sort of difficult but not impossible. Volvagia makes it's 1st appearance as Barba in the 6th dungeon it's not as great as the battle in Ocarina Of Time. In The Great Palace you face Thunderbird which you got to learn the pattern to beat it well. Then when you get The Triforce Of Courage you face Dark Link which is an evil version of Link. He's not much of a problem if you know the special method. I fell The Adventure Of Link Zelda II is worthy of being in the franchise. Shigeru Miyamoto must of enjoyed the mental torture this caused back in the day though. This game is all about preference as I said in my Zelda NES review you'll need some patience but not only patience for Zelda II but a lot of coffee & some kind of tobacco product & I won't fault you if you decide to use a Game Genie for this game. This game also established stuff like The Triforce Of Power, Wisdom & Courage. The towns was used more in future Zelda titles. There isn't much more I can say except I will review my favorite Zelda game The Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past next.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"G. Guberlal","summary":"Evil with a Vengeance","reviewText":"... Now, I will break the game down:Graphics: State-of-the-art. If you're anticipating the same game, think again. The mansion is much bigger and completely redesigned. Lightning bursts through the initial hallway/foyer, the candle effects, curtains, and shadows are breathtaking. Do you remember when FMV/CGI/Cut-Scenes were vivid and real, then you had to go back to down-scaled characters? You wished it were real, didn't you? Well, Capcom has merged the two. The exceptional opening sequence, which explains more than its predecessor, is outstanding. What you see in a cut-scene is what you get in game graphics. Finally, we can play as we see. When the cut-scene is over, you look the same, and for the people who love the female characters, Jill Valentine will leave you drooling, whether in game, or cut-scene. If you thought Claire Redfield looked hot in Code: Veronica X, you've seen nothing. Capcom has trumped, and that's not to say Veronica's graphics were bad because they were visually impressive from the sway of her backside to everything else, but Capcom has outdone itself. You get the point. The level of detail is astounding both character-wise and setting. This is the most realistic game to date.Game: Remember the zombie who looked at you when you entered the hallway off the dining room? The original was great, however, wait until you see this. I'm not going to give away any spoilers, but, there's something different in that area this time around. And also, in the main hall when you search it. I've just finished the original Resident Evil on PS2 (yes, yes, I know it was a PS1 game, but I played it on the PS2) and the mansion has expanded, darkened, and is more terrifying than ever. The basis of the mansion was kept, but vaguely. Remember, you have 2 mini-DVD discs carrying 1.6 GB of data each. The environment has changed and other than the fact that you're in the same place, it leaves its predecessor in the dust.Gameplay: Once you get used to the Cube's controller, you're fine. You have a lot more options and realism in the gameplay. Remember how easy it was to shoot a zombie or pop his head? Not so easy anymore, you'll find this out when you encounter the initial zombie. Be careful, emptying a clip into it will not stop it without strategy. This is a mature game, and as I've preached, real as it gets. You are in this mansion, you must survive, you will feel the adrenaline rush and be scared. The game is hard. This is not Luigi's Mansion or the old Casper games.Music/sound: Can so many things disturb you at once? The lightning, shadows, spinning fan blades playing tricks on you and now the Gothic, haunting score that sound like cries from the undead will rattle you. Sound effects are so realistic and intense, you'll think something's behind you.Repeat Play: High, or ridiculously high. You still have Chris and Jill to play with different stories, but until Eternal Darkness and the next RE, you'll come back...you must come back...because it won't leave your mind.Warning: I will put this on here for a reason. This is not a child's game, it's sick, twisted, disturbing, intense, graphic to the point of reality, and should be played by those its rated for, unless you parents out there act as parents while your child plays it. I'm not into politics, so that's up to you.One last thing, because of the flack from my earlier review I'm gonna say this. Keep your PS2, but go get the GameCube and RE. Soul Reaver 2 and Blood Omen 2 can't hold a candle. RE:CVX for PS2 is a solid buy and not too shabby, but this is the ultimate experience. And, no...I do not work for Sony, Nintendo, or Capcom. I'm a published author/freelance writer and a die-hard gamer for life.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2002"}

It was critically acclaimed and wasn't in sales. This is due to the fact that the main protagonist is a female. NOLF2 was the best FPS of it's time and is even better than some are today. The game has great humor, voice acting, dialog, and game play ideas. The story is about Cate Archer who is trying to stop the evil H.A.R.M organization from finishing Project: Omega. No one knows what it is but it has to be stopped. In the mean time Russia and the US are starting a new war. While the story is great with lot's of humor such as in India you're on the back of a tricycle with your gun while you stop a midget French mime on a unicycle...yeah you heard me!The game is also serious at the same time and Monolith pulled this off perfectly. The stealth in the game is also just right in difficulty and isn't unforgiving like Splinter Cell or Metal Gear Solid. The game is like a 70s James Bond really and it pulls the feel off perfectly. The weapons in the game are pretty cool like a mascara stun gun, keychain flashlight, a mirror decoder, a hairspray welder etc. You also have a crossbow that can have different ammo types and even a utility launcher to disable cameras and short circuit Super Solider Robots.The game never gets repetitive or old since you switch from stealth to fire fights often. While you can pick up intelligence in the game from drawers, letter lying around etc to gain points to upgrade your abilities. The online multiplayer is also fun but nothing too special. You HAVE to play NOLF2 because you're missing out on one of the best FPSs of all time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

The character models and voice acting are fantastic, ESPECIALLY the \"Illusive Man\", voiced by none other than Martin Sheen. The tone of this is much darker than the original. Gone is the \"Star Trek\"-like squeeky-clean atmosphere, replaced instead by morally hazy characters and choices. It's not so much a change in the universe you play in, so much as a change in the crowd you're running with and the locales you visit. If \"Mass Effect\" was inspired by \"Star Trek\", this one is much more \"Blade Runner\". Fans of cyberpunk fiction will be particularly thrilled.The gameplay is a mix of the original Mass Effect and some entirely new elements. The combat is very similar to the original, with a few of main differences: the cover system is better, you can vault over obstacles, you no longer have unlimited ammo, and your character auto-heals faster. There have also been a couple of simplifications/consolidations of functionality, e.g. the medigel system is now combined with the Unity ability. Further, the galaxy map is much more in depth, e.g. you now manually navigate your ship once you've arrived at a mass relay, which means you must burn fuel to travel between local star systems. And, last but certainly not least, most who played the original will be thrilled to know that the ground vehicle stuff has been eliminated. These changes are pretty easy to get used to despite what some say, and if you've never played the original, you don't know what I'm talking about anyway so it won't matter.My one issue so far is that the \"most helpful critical review\" writer was somewhat correct in his assessment of the mission structure: everything does seem to revolve around building your team. But the side quests and atmosphere of the locales you visit are more than enough to add variety to the experience, and the stories and moral ambiguity are riveting.EDIT: I *strongly* recommend downloading the \"Lair of the Shadow Broker\" content, especially to those who played the original Mass Effect. It is more than worth the price and plays out a major event in the overarching Mass Effect universe. I would even consider it mandatory.Pros:-Very good graphics-Great storytelling-Fun combat systemCons:-Slightly less *perceived* sense of freedom vs. the original-Instructions don't do a great job explaining everything-Disk swapping even when installed to the hard disk...uuuugh...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2010"}

Having played the previous Elder Scrolls games and the frustration that comes with them, this game did not appeal to me.Well when Christmas 2011 came along this was given to me as a gift. I put it in my Xbox and began playing it. Not 30 minutes later and I was stunned in amazement. The quality of the graphics, the voice acting, the combat and the DRAGONS had my jaw hitting the floor so many times that it was starting to bruise. I could not quit playing this game. Having taken off work the week for the holidays I had plenty of time to spend in Skyrim. I was so involved in the story line that I lost track of time. I knew I had been playing a while, but did not realize that I had played a full 36 hours straight. That's how amazing this experience was for me. They should have put a warning on the box that reads \"Warning\" Time Loss may Occur\" or something like that LOL.A year later and I'm still playing it, and I still love it. I have put nearly 300 hours into it. The DLC that has came out in the last year is just as amazing as the rest of the game. The open world and endless quests have kept me coming back again and again. It's as about as \"realistic\" that a Fantasy game can get. If you are looking for a game that oozes awesomeness this is the game for you. You'll battle the Undead, Wild Animals, Witches, Demons, and of course DRAGONS. I mean who doesnt like going into battle with a enormous Fire/Ice breathing Dragon?This is now my favorite game of all time.

So update I did.  To be clear, this is technically a wired set that works through the controller.  The adapter conveniently works its magic through the controller itself with a set of chat controls.  Works great.What intrigued me most was its mobile compatibility.  Alas, you will not enjoy any chat functionality there and what it ultimately winds up being is a glorified headphone with a 3.5 mm jack that is connected to the interchangeable cables through a rather clunky adapter interface.  Thankfully, the microphone is fully detachable so at least the headphones can actually WORK like headphones.Sound-wise, this set is better than previous iterations.  Bass packs a lot less oomph still, but it IS improved.Sadly, however, one has to wonder why a wired headset is still $149 when a wireless offering is about the same...one might speculate that lack of a wireless function almost increases the overall profit margin on something that should have been priced in the $90 range.  For that reason, I had to dock it a star.It's a solid set with decent chat functionality, but wow...that price....","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2014"}

It didn't feel like I was just busting up monsters with no objective. I personally didn't feel much of the backtracking some reviewers had commented on, it just felt right, more realistic if you will.After playing through the game on my first play through, (I'm starting on my second round now) I couldn't believe how awesome it is, overall just amazing. And after you beat it once you get to keep any upgrades that where made to weapons, rig and equipment. And that's awesome.I'm almost speechless on the game it self, Dead Space 2 has a lot, and I mean a lot to live up to (can't wait). DS has everything I could want, crazy amazing story, leaving lots to figure out later for sequels, comics, and animated stuff like Downfall, I really hope they make a movie someday of DS. It has a large variety of enemies, that all have there own way of being killed. And the puzzles, it's got some great puzzles. The Graphics are pretty slick too, especially for a 2008 game. The makers did a great job of creating a believable atmosphere and world.If you like the games in series like Quake, Doom, Fear, Bioshock, or anything like that, then this is for you, if you have never played a survival horror game, start with this one.

I actually find myself driving like a maniac when I am done playing because I am all amped up.Power ups, very challenging tasks, vibrant colors, big track selections that look amazing, a huge selection of cars (new and old), very fast paced...what more could you ask for!Not to mention the soundtrack rocks!

There are destruction tracks where you have to destroy other cars and checkpoint tracks where you have to race against the clock.

{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"Brendan Ross","summary":"An entertaining but imperfect ride","reviewText":"BioShock Infinite is the third installment in the series of games which began with 2007's much-acclaimed BioShock.  While the game has some similarities to the earlier games of the series, Infinite is quite different in other areas which are sure to make some fans rankle.  Overall I found it an entertaining, if somewhat flawed game.  To explain why, I will start with the \"cons\", since that seems to be what most people are interested in when reading reviews, and then I will follow with what I think worked rather well in Infinite.SPOILERS!  -- THERE WILL BE SPOILERS HERE -- DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE EXPOSED TO SPOILERS! -- SPOILERS!CONS:1.  Combat System.  The combat system has been substantially simplified in many areas.First, the player is limited to carrying only two weapons.  This appears intended to require more tradeoffs to be made by the player, but can feel like an irritating limitation as compared with the previous games.  It can also discourage upgrading too many weapons, because the player will most likely have one \"keeper\" weapon and one \"off\" weapon using this system, which tends to make the game play very similarly over the course of the game.Second, the setting of the game features mostly wide open areas, unlike the cramped conditions of Rapture from the earlier games.  This makes the gameplay much easier as a practical matter, and much more typical of a generic shooter type game.Third, the game lacks truly challenging enemies like the first two games had.  No enemy here is really like a Big Daddy in difficulty or challenge, and even the tougher enemies (patriots, handymen, firemen, ravens) are really not very tough to beat in terms of requiring significant tactical thought and adjustment.2.  Linear design.  Unlike the earlier games, where the player could move around the entire map freely, exploring or collecting resources and the like, Infinite is a linear experience where the player progresses through areas that are then closed.  These can be reloaded from a chapter menu, but that is simply \"replaying a zone\" -- it isn't exploring a city organically as was the case with the earlier games.  This serves the narrative, but tends to make Infinite feel more \"gamey\" than the earlier titles in a forced way.3.  Story Problems.  SPOIILER!-- SPOILER! -- SPOILER!  Here there will be a lot of disagreement among the playerbase.The storyline essentially revolves around Ken Levine's narrative gloss on the theoretical physics theory of the multiverse.  Some players will find this irritatingly similar to films like Inception, and others will just find it confusing.The issue I have with it is that it kind of plays lip service to some of these theoretical physics ideas (multiverse theory), and makes various hand-waves at quantum physics throughout the game (some of which are bound to go over most players' heads, but that's a separate problem), but then violates these ideas in substantial and problematic ways without explanation.  For example, it is a known time travel paradox that one cannot travel back in time because doing so will compromise one's contemporary existence -- this is even more the case where one is going back in time to kill oneself, or precisely to allow oneself to be killed, by one's offspring --> this is an impossible paradox, because if you kill yourself at an earlier period, you would never exist to come back in time and kill yourself to begin with.  It's a paradoxical loop, which is one reason why physicists have been skeptical of time-travel.  Now, time-travel is fine in a setting where the plot is fantasia and soft and so on, but if you are throwing in references to quantum mechanics and string theory and so on throughout the game, playing fast and loose with some of the ideas feels, well, snarky.A similar issue is raised with respect to the entire treatment of multiple universes in the game.  The multiverse theory, which is more speculation than hard science anyway but is still a theory floated by theoretical physicists, posits that there are infinite universes.  This means that, in theory, there are infinite versions of you, and infinite possibilities for how your life plays out in an infinite number of universes.  The game's name itself is a reference to this theory.  But the multiverse theory also implies that no *one* universe is dispositive of what happens in the others -- there is no \"core reality\" from which the rest of the possibilities emerge.  There is simply an infinite number of parallel realities.  This is problematic for the game, where clearly the suggestion is that the drowning of the player's character in the game dispositively removes all instances of the game's main antagonist in all possible universes -- something which doesn't make sense per the actual theory of the multiverse.  Instead, the \"game's theory\" appears to be that there is a core reality which is determinitive of other possibilities -- which is a nice theory, but it isn't the multiverse, and it isn't explained in the game, either.  Now, I realize that this is a video game and not a physics textbook, and that therefore the narrative should be more important than the science.  That's true.  But, again, if it's just a case of \"making stuff up\" in a nice way to serve a narrative purpose, then the game ought not do so much hand-waving and term dropping from *actual* quantum physics -- this just comes across as intellectually snarky.Clearly the game and its ending were designed to cause controversy, and thereby generate attention.  That has been a success.  Upon further review, however, the ending becomes more problematic, even if taken from a purely narrative point of view.  Paradoxes are fine, but raising *known* paradoxes and not addressing them at all feels ... sloppy.4.  No Manual Saves.  I realize that this is a point of contention in the player community, some of which seems convinced that the ability to save anywhere outside combat is game breaking.  However, the problem with Infinite is that the automatic save points are very spread out.  It's not uncommon for a player who likes to explore to lose 15-30 minutes of game time if they need to quit the game on short notice -- as is not uncommon for people who are fairly busy.  This is a very unfortunate design for a game like this one, and really should be changed in a patch.PROS:1.  Fun game world.  As noted above, this isn't Rapture, it's Columbia.  Rapture probably had more personality, and was certainly creepier, while Columbia is airier and more subservient to the overall narrative.  Columbia here is a backdrop, whereas Rapture was a character.  But ... it's an entertaining backdrop and filled with fun details.2.  Interesting switch-back themes.  While it was thought prior to Infinite's release that the game would mostly be a pointed criticism of right-wing American mytholog(ies), in reality it is more the case that the game whipsaws themes around in an interesting way.  Thus while it's true that the initial portrayal of Columbia as a racist, fundamentalist bubble that worships the founders of the US is an easy and over the top take on something most people already see as false, this theme is not a main one in the game.  In subsequent chapters the game takes the freedom fighters (whom the player probably identifies as \"good guys\" as compared with the racist fundamentalists of the game's early chapters) and turns them into vicious violent killers which it explicitly says are just as bad as the racists.  This challenges assumptions which the player had probably already internalized about them by then, which creates discomfort -- that is well done.  The game also portrays the scientist couple -- which one would \"normally\" see as the foil to the fundamentalist zealots -- and makes them morally ambiguous at best, portraying them as almost amoral and more or less powerless to stop, if not downright helping, the fundamentalists.  And, finally, the game takes the female character, Elizabeth, and kind of toys with whether she will be a love interest for the player character before revealing that she, or a previous version of her, was his daughter (in this or another universe, apparently), which, again, challenges assumptions.  The way that these themes cascade to challenge assumptions is fairly well done in the plotting.3.  Some fun fight sequences, like the rail fights (which are not spectacular by any means, but fun) helped make the combat, which is overall fairly lackluster, a bit more interesting at times.=======Summary (TL;DR):Infinite is a good, but not great, game characterized by a good narrative which nevertheless plays fast and loose with theoretical physics and average shooter style combat which is occasionally livened up in a few sequences.  It's fun to play and I found it enjoyable, but I think that the \"it's the best game ever!\" type of breathless reviews it is is getting miss the mark by overlooking some aspects of the game that are less than stellar or simply problematic.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003C1I06U","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A fine stealth/action game, and a new high for comic book video games","reviewText":"The lack of good video games based on comic books has always been an enigma to me.  Comic books, with their rich variety of characters and imaginative worlds, would on paper seem like fertile ground for video game developers to really create something special within the genre, but this has never really been the case.  With the exception of a few classics like the X-Men Arcade game, Spiderman 2 on the PS2 and a handful of others, a comic book video game usually implies an uninspired, clich&eacute;d exercise that has been done better countless times before by developers working with original IP (intellectual property), especially in recent years with the boom of comic book movies that have been cash cows at movie theaters.  But Batman: Arkham Asylum changes this for the current generation of consoles, delivering an extremely fun and wonderfully presented stealth/action title that puts gameplay first.Batman: Arkham Asylum delivers in making the player really feel like he/she is stepping into the shoes of the Dark Knight.  The fisticuff-centric action gameplay is the finest non-shooting action I've experienced in any action game on this generation of consoles.  Significantly more deep and complex than the button-mashing of so many other games, the combat is combo driven and requires precise timing and analog stick navigation.  Successful combat rewards the player with not only points that can be used to upgrade gadgets/armor/abilities, but with beautiful action sequences that almost seem to be choreographed.  Added to the mix is a fantastic stealth mechanic that lets Batman sneak up on foes, drop in from above, or pop up from below.  Some of the most enjoyable parts of the game for me were when I would stalk my foes and pick them off one by one, watching them panic in despair, until there were none left.  The game mixes stealth and action perfectly, making it an absolute joy to play.  For those of you gamers who are a bit more old-school, Batman: Arkham Asylum feels like the proper follow up to the classic Playstation titleTenchu: Stealth Assassins, a great, innovative stealth game that was followed up by a series of subpar sequels that never captured the magic of the original game.I also cannot neglect to mention the incredible \"nightmare\" sections of the game that were initiated when Batman makes contact with the Scarecrow.  These were tense and terrifying parts of the game that played, looked, and felt completey distinct from all the other parts of the game.  Kudos to the developers on this feat!Batman: Arkham Asylum is a big budget game with high production values.  And sometimes, unfortunately, with this AAA status and the immense popularity of a figure such as Batman, games such as this are at times made to cater to as large of an audience as possible, and in doing this, the game can suffer.  In Batman: Arkham Asylum's case, there is one such weakness to the game, and that is its overall simplicity.  Yes, the game is quite easy (I played it in Normal mode), and none of the bosses were challenging enough where they couldn't be defeated in 2 or 3 attempts.  But the simplicity went a bit beyond just difficulty level.  No matter what part of the game you are on, if you die, the game actually tells you how to progress during the loading screen!  No trial and error, nor any experimentation, is needed....the game just gives you the answer.  Most disappointing was the game's Detective Mode, an alternate view on your surroundings that allows Batman to see through walls and analyze any clues in the vicinity.  This mode was EXTREMELY overpowered.  It not only made the game even easier than it already was, but it took the whole \"detective\" element that Batman is so well known for completely out of the game's story mode.  There was no need to investigate or search for clues to progress the game's story...just go into detective mode, and mystery solved.  The only drawback against playing the entire game in detective mode is that you won't be able to appreciate the game's beautiful graphics.The game does offer an side quest/exploration element that encourages you seek out items and puzzles left by the Riddler, which in turn unlock new segments in the game's Challenge Mode, but this will either be seen as a extra bonus of riches, or as a tedious distraction that is not worth the time, depending on the individual gamer.  Either way, the option is there, and it is a nice touch by the developers to generously add extra content to the main game's 8-10 hour campaign/story mode.Overall, Batman: Arkham Asylum is arguably the finest comic book video game ever made.  Its competition may not be the strongest, but it is a testament to the passion of the developers for the Batman legacy, and a positive sign for the industry overall that excellent video games can still be developed from the deep mines of comic book lore.  Arkham Asylum does have its flaws, but these are flaws that can be very easily addressed and fixed up for the game's next installment.  All the foundations are here to create a brilliant and important series of video games that will bring the Dark Knight to life like no other medium on earth can do.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00002CF9M","description":"InDiablo II, players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"Jon Snow","summary":"Best Game Ever!!!","reviewText":"The Graphics are not the greatest anyone has seen, but no other game provides as many hours of fun as Diablo II does.  One of the real advantages of this game is you can just install it and play.  You don't have to read a book the size of \"War and Peace\" to understand how to play.  You level up at a rate that makes you want to never stop playing.  This game also has the perfect balance of Magic Items and different things to make you want to keep adventuring.  I've played it all the way through with every character class and enjoyed a different experience each time.  I bought the expansion pack and played each character through that.  I'm waiting for another expansion or something.  I just can't get enough of this game!  Every Blizzard game released is a good quality game.  If your sick of getting games that don't work that well or are full of bugs before and after patches are applied(ie Buldar's Gate, the new Pool of Radiance), you can find comfort in the fact that Blizzard doesn't release garbage software in a cool box.  They put excellent software in a cool box.  They also provide great quality FREE on-line play at Battle.net.  Blizzard is a top-notch company devoted to top-notch gaming software.

I also have an older system and it still plays fine and looks good.- Character models and animations.  For the ones I like, very good.- Questing (dynamic events).  Great fun for the first few times.  They can be confusing, but once you get the gist of what to do they can be enjoyable.- Combat.  Its not wow or a wow clone.  I am very glad they did this - you have to move up and swing your weapon at a mob.  You just don't stand there on auto target and hit 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, ....- Customizable color scheme for your toon.Cons:- Character models and animations.  For the ones I don't like (I like the charr cat people, cant stand the other four) the models are all kind of the same.  Picture a GQ model, with the pouty face and model hair.  Then make a thick GQ model (norn), a plant GQ model (sylvari) and a hamster... (well asura don't look like GQ models.  They look like hamsters from fallout 3).  But I think you get my point.  For me at least, I like gritty toons.  I want one with scars all over and half an ear gone.  You can make your GQ model have a bigger nose, or perhaps less pouty lips, but hes still a GQ model.  The run animations are awful as well except for the Charr.  Especially for the norns.- Character sounds.  You also get cut scenes for the dynamic events you go through.  Neat addition, except... your toon always sounds like some Fabio impersonator.  Even my cat guy sounds like a gruff Fabio impersonator.  My plant toon sounds like a plant Fabio impersonator...  Just turn the volume down but why not try to add some flavor?- Questing (dynamic events).  Same reason why I got sick of Rift.  They are fun for a bit, but just like the rifts in the aforementioned game its the same crap over, and over, and over.  And just like those rifts they turn into a zerg zoo to kill 10 of these or gather 10 of that.  They are fun when they are new, but later on its the same ol same ol and (for me at least) got stale pretty fast.- Authentication.  I have had some pretty bad vibes from the developer on this.  Downloaded the game, and logged in.  Then you have to give an email account.  Great, so did that.  Log in and validate using your email.  Woo!  Then try to play the next day on the same computer.  It says I have a different IP address so have to validate again.  Then have to validate four times in a row.  Then it says I have a locked account and have to contact customer support - which is almost non-existent.  Two days later and finally get it worked out and still have to validate with the same email account... I don't get it.  I have played Wow for years, tried KOTOR and Rift, and the only nonsense that I have seen in an MMO that was similar (meaning it was BS crap that got to be a serious pain in my @#$ was FFIX back at launch).  It seems to work OK now, but man what a pain.Overall not too bad but there are some things I don't really care for.  I have not purchased MOP and after playing the beta for a few months I don't know if I will.  I am so sick of that formula and don't care for many of the new tweaks they have added.  Was hoping GW2 would be the new thing... like I hoped KOTOR would be.  Probably will keep playing for a few months and see how it goes.  Hopefully they will refine a few things, but for now its pretty fun at times.  Recommend you give it a shot if you are looking for something a bit different.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2012"}

Where are the rest of the innovative games like this? It ain't easy folks, but it's awesome. Play it now and don't give up after a few hours you lazypants!***Just to give you some background, I have almost every rpg on ps2 and have played video game rpgs since their inception. In regards to taste, I really like: Shadow hearts, Persona/shin megami tensei, Disgaea, Cross edge, Suikoden, Ar Tonelico.This game has absolutly phenominal gameplay structure.  It is fun and diverse.  The many aspects of the battle system play well into deep strategy and grants the player some interesting levels of flexibility. One of the best parts is you can start developing your characters/weapons practically at the beginning of the game. You even get access to side quests right away. The types of weapons are a big part of the strategy and all characters can hold 2. There are too many facets to the battle system to get into too much detail, but one of the more unique things is how position and movement play a big role into how fast you can charge up for your next attack. One of the more fun aspects is going into over the top action sequences where you can mame your enemies by knocking them up in the air and slamming them down on the ground to earn bonus shots.  You can also attack with all 3 characters at once with the \"trinity\" mode.The game does not spoon feed you and the battles can be tough. You should do all the tutorials at least once. Battles might require some serious experimentation.The overworld map is more like a game board on which you can unlock spaces with different aquired \"hex\" items. Some spaces reveal special items, some locations, some battles.  Moving your cursor around the map could cause a random encounter, but many spaces on the board are totally safe so moving from one place to another is easy if you don't want to deal with enemies.I just finished Final Fantasy 13 and this game has everything that I felt was missing from it. In fact, this blows it out of the water in most regards. It does not have the graphics, polish and the intense narritive that FF has. I personally think both games are worth playing for different reasons. If the gameplay in FF dissapointed you, try this for sure.Gameplay A+: Fun, addictive, diverse, deep, totally unique.Style A-: Overall it's a really cool steampunk atmosphere. Some bland spots like dungeons.Sound A- : not everything is fully voiced, but it's not really a big issue. The music is great. Japanese voice track is a nice option.Graphics B: Weakest aspect of the game. The AA is not so great, so you see plenty of jagged edges. Could have had sharper textures and more polish. You will get over it after playing for an hour or two.Story: TBD. I'm still playing, but so far I am not expecting a very intense narative. The story is more subtle. I don't mean this in a bad way.Replayability B: In the NG+ you fight a different final boss. Also you unlock new difficulty settings.If I beat the game and I change my opinion I will update this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2010"}

{"product_name":"Logitech G600 MMO Gaming Mouse, White","description":"","reviewerName":"God is a refuge for us (Psalms 62:8)","summary":"very nice ... comparison to G700","reviewText":"The seller was Amazon. I paid 50 bucks.I'm using the G600 on a PC with Windows XP Home SP3.  The Logitech Gaming Software version is 8.45.88.  The firmware version is 77.02.17.Several years ago, I switched from a regular 3-button mouse to a Logitech G700. It took some time to get used to the G700, but I liked the G700 very much. The same is true for the switch from G700 to G600. It takes a little time to get used to it, but it is worth it.I do like lots of buttons on my mouse for flexibility in Windows applications, browser, and games.  I don't always use every button, but I have the flexibility to do so.WEIGHTThe G700 with battery (can't run it without the battery installed) weights 6 ounces.  The G600 weighs 5 ounces.  I've heard some people complain about how heavy the G600 is, but I don't have any problem with the weight, because my prior mouse was a G700.SIZEI measured both mice across the top over the scroll wheel area. The G700 measures 6 centimeters; and the G600 measures 7 cm.  Not much difference, considering the G600 adds a third button along the right side.SCROLL WHEELBoth mice have a tilt scroll wheel with 3 buttons built in (middle click, left tilt, right tilt). I like the wheel tilt feature very much in mice. The G700 wheel is metallic on its sides and rubber down its middle; you can set it to have smooth rolling or notched. The G600 is all rubber; you can not set it to smooth rolling...its notched and that's it. I like notched, so it is not a problem for me.BUTTON CLICKSWhen clicked/pressed, the tactical feel of the G9-G20 buttons (the 12 buttons on the left side) on the G600 is like the G11 button on the G700.  The G600 G7-G8 buttons sound/feel like the G700 G9 button.  The left, middle, right, scroll tilt buttons on the G600 feel the same as their counterparts on the G700.G-SHIFT BUTTONI like this button a lot. It doubles the function of every mouse button.  So, the mouse has 20 buttons, and with the G-shift, the mouse now has 40 button options.  Lots of flexibility.  Very nice.  For those switching from a G700... You may be used to the 3 buttons (G8-G10) on the top of the left button. No such buttons on the G600, but consider doing this instead with the G600: Use the G-shift plus left button, middle button, right button as replacements for the G700 G8-G10 buttons.GRIPWith my fingers together, my hand measures about 8.25 inches around...just below the knuckles, which makes my glove size a medium. The G600 feels very nice to me.On the thumb side of the mouse...I have to grip a bit differently. I place more pressure at the base of my thumb. Or I can rest my thumb just beyond the G9 button. Either works well for me...depends on what I am using the mouse for.On the ring finger side of the mouse...This took a little getting used to, but it works well. Again, two choices: If I am not using the G-shift button, then I can rest my ring finger along the side of the button. However, I do like the G-shift button, so I rest my ring finger on top of it. My pinky finger grips the mouse on the right side. Since the mouse is lighter (compared to the G700), using my pinky finger to grip and help with movement is not a problem for me. The bottom edge of this side of the mouse is rubber, which helps to grip it.Depends on how you use your mouse...In games, instead of using the traditional W-S-A-D keys for movement, I use mouse buttons. I started doing this with the G700, using the wheel tilt for left/right, G7 forward, G6 back, G7 plus G5 forward sprint/run. This makes movement much more natural in my opinion.  For the G600, it's similar: wheel tilt for left/right, G11 forward, G20 back, G11 plus G10 forward sprint/run. Since I am usually walking or running forward, I am gripping the mouse with my thumb most of the time. When not gripping the mouse in this way, I grip it with the area of my palm below my thumb. This works well for me.TRACKING, POLLING/REPORT RATE, DPIFor the G700, I used 1000 DPI exclusively and 250 for report rate.  For the G600, I am trying 1200 DPI (default) and 250 report rate (500 is default); I may switch back to 1000 DPI...wait and see how it goes. The mouse tracks very well for me; this is probably a combination of mouse quality and PC configuration.LOGITECH GAMING SOFTWARE (LGS)I used this same software for my G700, so it is nothing new to me. Same software, except the screens are different in order to support the additional/different features of the G600. I recommend using \"automatic game detection\", not on-board memory (this setting is on the home page of the LGS; it's a toggle switch). While using the G700, I switched from Setpoint software to LGS, and I noticed that onboard memory did not work well (it was fine with Setpoint, just not LGS). For the G600, I didn't even try on-board memory, since \"automatic game detection\" works so well for me.MODES VS. PROFILESI use automatic game detection for both G700 and G600, which means unlimited profiles and no hassles with profile switching...works well for me.  For the G600, there are also modes.  So, for each profile, you can have up to 3 modes...each mode has its own button configuration. Here is how this is helpful to me... Game #1: The main character has two movement options: human, which is used most of the time; mechanized armor/tank, which is used occasionally. The controls are different for each. So, I have 1 profile for the game with 2 modes (one for the human, one for the armor/tank). Press the mode switch button (G8 or whatever you want to set it to) and I can easily switch between human and armor/tank settings.  Very nice.CORDThe G700 cord is rubber coated. The G600 cord is less thick and braided nylon. Both work fine. The G700 cord showed no signs of wear after 3+ years of use.  Wait and see with the G600 cord.LIGHTSThe G700 has 3 lights on the side to indicate what profile you are using (if you use onboard profiles, which I don't). The G600 is a regular Christmas tree...each of the G9-G20 buttons are backlit, and there are lots of color and lighting options. Very nice, if you're into that sort of thing. I'm not, so I disabled the lighting effect.SOME GOTCHASGOTCHA #1Converting profiles from the G700 to the G600.  These 2 mice have different buttons, so don't expect to plug-and-play. Although you can see the G700 profiles in the LGS when the G600 is plugged in, you cannot use the G700 profile successfully unless you remap all keys to the G600. It's easy to do. All of the commands associated with a profile are listed in the commands menu area in LGS. Drag and drop the commands to the G600 buttons and you're ready to go.  If you are permanently switch from G700 to G600, remapping existing profiles is fine. If you plan to use both mice interchangeably, then rename the G700 profiles to have G700 in the name, and copy/save-as the G700 profiles to G600 profiles and do the remapping; so, you'll have 2 sets of profiles...one for G700 and one for G600.GOTCHA #2Setting or assigning commands to the normal and G-shift buttons. \"Normal\" means the normal use of a button without using the G-shift button. ALWAYS drag and drop commands from the command menu on the left side of the \"customize buttons\" screen to the mouse button on the right side of the screen. NEVER use the little drop down menu for each button to edit/set/assign commands; it's okay to use the drop down menu to unassign, use generic, use default. If you don't follow this advice, then when you attempt to assign/set commands for G-shift buttons, you will overwrite the normal button assignment with the G-shift assignment. It's just a quirky software thing. To create new commands, use the plus sign next to the word \"Commands\".GOTCHA #3By default, the mouse wheel tilt buttons are assigned to back and forward; and this works great when working with Windows applications and browsers.  However, some people like me had the problem of the G600 going back twice or going forward two times when only clicking once. The solution is to go to Control Panel, System, Hardware tab, Device Manager button, expand Mouse, double-click each \"HID-compatible mouse\" device to find the one that says \"on Logitech gaming Virtual Mouse\", and then right click that device and disable it. This solved the problem.keywords: gotchyas, bugs, buggy, problems, answers, fixes, solutionsSUMMARYI am very happy with the G600, but I haven't used it for very long.  I hope to get many years of use out of it.  I plan to update this review as needed, if I experience problems.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2014"}

The Playstation 2 was my favorite console and may very well still be. But the PS3 was doomed by it's own name. When your on top, there are those who say you can only go down from there, and I feel that right now this is what is going on with the ps3. I kept hearing talk of the graphics. People were talking about how amazing they would be. Often people hear this and just have in there heads that the graphics are outstanding. While the graphics do look good, you will not notice much unless you have a high deff tv. I know alot fo people have them but I choose not to spend over 1500 dollars on a tv. So unless your a person with a really great tv the graphics will not be as good as they could be. Sony cut alot of there market by doing this. You must think of every one in order to succeed. Then I hear people talking about the sound. Well once again sony took off alot of fan base with the sound. Unless you have a receiver and surround sound, you will not hear what is ment to be heard. Now to the games. From the reviews I am reading, both fans and media, there are only a few games out that are any good. I know this is how most systems are when they launch but if I am going to pay 599.99, I want gold. Every game I play sound be as amazing as the last. That is another thing. The price. I don't know how many people can just throw out 600 some dollars for a toy. I hear the 20 gig Playstation 3 was discontinued. If Sony is so secure about it's product then why would it do this. I hear that there are game companies with Playstation 3 games finished, but they will not release until the fan base grows. So even after companies spend all the time and money on the ps3 games they still will not let sony sell them. They would rather loose money. That is how low the sales of the ps3 are. The reason the price is so high is because Sony is failing in there $1000 blu-ray dvd players. So they put one in the ps3 to get people to buy dvds to use it with. Then I'm sure they think people will buy a blu-ray player. So what it comes down to is Sony is failing in psp,blu-ray,umd,and ps3 sales. I chose not to take a risk of wasting my money on something that I am not sure will stay in the industry. I'm not saying don't buy a ps3. If you want to, go for it. I will just sit here and be happy with my nes,snes,nintendo 64,game cube,wii,game boy sp, nintendo ds,ps,ps2,xbox,xbox360,plug n plays and my pc.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2006"}

Players are immersed in the role of apprentice at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy where they learn the power - and danger - of the Force. Amidst a multitude of complex and richly detailed Star Wars environments, including twice as many unique locales as those inStar Wars: Jedi Outcast, players face a variety of powerful and insidious enemies.For the first time in a Jedi Knight series game,Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academyallows players to create and customize their own characters by choosing various characteristics including species, gender, clothing, and physical attributes such as hair and facial features. In addition, players can create a custom lightsaber, selecting from hilt design and blade color. As apprentices progress in their training, different lightsabers will become available, such as the double-bladed lightsaber or dual lightsabers.Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academybegins shortly after the conclusion of events inStar Wars: Jedi Outcast. Players create a Jedi apprentice character and join the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 to learn the ways of the Force under the tutelage of Luke Skywalker and Kyle Katarn. While the young apprentice embarks on various missions to hone their skills and abilities, a mysterious group is discovered creating havoc throughout the galaxy. Until order is restored, the fate of the Jedi Academy - and the future of the Star Wars galaxy itself - hangs precariously in the balance.While players are able to accomplish more by using the lightsaber inStar Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, they also will have a variety of weapons - new and old - at their disposal including a blaster, blaster rifle, Wookiee bowcaster, Imperial repeater, and a Destructive Electro-Magnetic Pulse gun. A unique level selection system allows players to choose their own path through the game as well as the missions they undertake to improve their Jedi skills. The game adds new multiplayer modes and bring back the most popular modes fromStar Wars: Jedi Outcast.","reviewerName":"Mark Hills \"Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!\"","summary":"Where Outcast failed, Academy succeeds- in spades.","reviewText":"Wow, where to start? As much as I tried to like Jedi Outcast, the game left a bad taste in my mouth- it looked like Star Wars, sounded like Star Wars, but it didn't play like Star Wars. The game had so many annoying little problems that it all but sucked the life from it. Not to mention a pretty dull story that lacked any sort of dramatics or imagination-grabbing aspects that the first game had in such abundance. Fast forward a little over a year to Jedi Academy- and a surprising treat. I must admit to not being very enthusiastic about it, I quite honestly am used to being disappointed by such things, and was in fact looking to purchase Homeworld 2 and stumbled across Academy and bought it in lieu of Relic's much anticipated sequel- not to mention the fact that I couldn't find it.I knew a little about the game, especially the fact that you were no longer going to be playing as Kyle Katarn- Dark Forces perennial hero, but instead a student of his. You start the game by designing your character- male or female, and a choice of races- human, Kel Dor, Twi'lek, Zabrak (the spikey headed guys like Darth Maul) or Rodian, saber type and color. Cool. I went for a sleek and sexy blue skinned Twi'lek woman to play as Jaden Kor, Kyle's prodigy who stunned the Jedi and Luke Skywalker by making her own lightsaber before even beginning her training. After that's complete, the game begins with your shuttle crashing near the Jedi Academy on Yavin IV and you along with your pal Rosh must make their way to the Massassi temple, avoiding local wildlife and then some stormtroopers. As it turns out, you oversee some bad guys siphoning something out of the temple. (For those who don't know, Luke Skywalker and Co. Defeated the Sith spirit of Ulic Qel-Droma, who had been imprisoned there 4,000 years before, during the golden age of the Sith.)Jaden is an expert pupil and receives training from both Luke and Kyle, guaranteeing she'll be a major bad ass by the time things start to get rolling. Raven really made me proud by taking us to a lot of new places instead of simply carting us off to the same old haunts seen in the movies, with the exception of Hoth, which has never been visited in the JK series. Much of the game involves tracking down a group that has been revealed as the Cult of Ragnos, (again, a major bad guy and one of the first Sith Lords, circa about 5,000 years ago.) And they appear to traveling around the galaxy and using a scepter that appears to have the ability to draw off ans store Dark Side energies. Okay, I knew at that point what their plan was, but players unfamiliar with the Expanded Universe may not click on it right away. There are a lot of missions, close to 25 and they take you on a galaxy wide tour of some very cool places, and there is lots to do.To their credit, Raven seems very adept at ripping every last ounce of life out of the aging Quake III Arena engine, but after this game, it's time to retire the old girl and move on to more versatile technology. It's almost five years old- quite a bit of staying power, but if they want to continue the franchise, they'd better upgrade. While textures were good and well detailed, the repeating patterns on walls and things like magma was very obvious, and it can't seem to push the polys on buildings or characters like many newer engines can. It does it's job, but just barely. Now, what they did improve is every aspect of game play that I hated in Jedi Outcast. Lightsaber moves are better, more effective, easier and more obvious when accomplished. Weapons no longer drill through your personal shields too fast, meaning you can hang in a fight longer than you could in Outcast. Everything is better- level design, story, character movement- they polished and revamped virtually every aspect of the game, making it more fun. Some levels were irritating, such as the never ending villains on swoop bikes, but for the most part I found myself really enjoying what I saw and did.This game improves on every weakness Outcast has- it's 10 fold improvement over the last game. Even the multi-player levels are better, though there aren't that many of them. I did find that dual and double lightsabers are unbalancing against a single blade- I played a few multi-player levels with two sabers and cleaned house a lot easier than I had expected. Plus, they incorporated a Force power system similar to the original Jedi Knight and reincorporated such powers in the single player experience like Protection, Seeing and Healing, all of which were strangely absent from the Outcast single player game. Plus, the game doesn't force you to use Dark Side powers if you don't want to- you have access to them, but you don't have to put points into them. You're a Jedi Knight, not some wormy Sith wannabe. I would have preferred not having them at all, but I guess there are people who think the Dark Side is 'kewl' and have to use the powers. With a new game engine like Unreal II/2K4, Quake IV or possibly even the new Half-Life 2 system, who knows what Raven will have in store for us next. All I do know is that it's time to retire the Arena engine.Additional (10/22/03) After reading the PC Gamer review, I must agree with their comment that this game's villains were very sub-par.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0041OWQUI","reviewerName":"R2the3rd","summary":"Almost good... Slow pacing kills it though.","reviewText":"Borderlands. It has a great sense of humor and the cell shading gives it a style all its own. It really is an old school \"level based\" RPG wrapped up under the guise of a First Person Shooter.The game starts out slow and ends up staying slow for the first 10~15 hours of solo gameplay as you figure out the mission boards/npcs/inventory systems and open up new areas. All the while you are heavily restricted in where you can go as your characters level determines how badly you will get mauled when you enter an area you aren't suppose to be in yet. Have a 300dmg weapon? Too bad. That enemy that is 2 levels above you only takes 1dmg from it. Gun games and level based damage just hit a weird spot in my brain, and watching a \"BadArsed Midget\" take a rocket for 1dmg is not amusing.Eventually you will build up enough cash, weapons and more importantly XP to actually start having fun while you explore and attempt to finish up some of the more annoying \"Collect/Find/Destroy 5x(item)\" quests. But by then you have out leveled all the bad guys (save a boss or two) and are just wrapping up the quest lines or hunting achievements/trophies.Multiplayer is probably one of the few saving graces from all of the monotony. Grab a three(high level) friends and go to town on the areas/bosses that you are still out classed by and reap all the upgraded loot and weapons.Borderlands almost works, but the missions are just too spread out (even more so in the DLC) and the leveling mundane. If you can stick out the first 10 hours there is some fun to be had and jokes to be laughed at, but the time expenditure / reward ratio could be better.Overall:Main Game - 3.0 (Not bad)DLC Zombies - 4.0 (Good!)DLC Mad Moxie - 2.0 (Lame 25 x waves of arena fighting)DLC Secret Armory - 2.0 (WTH is with all the traveling?!?!)DLC Claptrap Revolution - 5.0 (ZOMG AWESOME!!!)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000085AHJ","description":"In the open-ended space action/adventure gameFreelanceryou play a ne'er-do-well with a lucky streak, one of two survivors of a space disaster. Penniless and shipless, you venture around a space dock until you find a ship and a job. You'll encounter a heady mix of canned missions that follow one main quest, and a million opportunities to make money or aggravate the various factions that co-exist in the universe. Like an online role-playing game, or Bethesda'sMorrowind, you determine who your enemies are and who your friends are by your own actions, and, in another nod to role-playing, you can customize your ship with guns, rockets, and equipment just as you would customize a RPG character with swords, bows, and magic items. Best of all, you can play cooperatively with friends or fight it out with enemies online.The backstory posits a future where various countries, divided by both nationality and, seemingly, race, have boarded massive colony ships and ventured into a wormhole that appeared within reach of our crude space technology. They found themselves in a galaxy far, far away and they got stuck there when the wormhole collapsed. They quickly colonized new home worlds and named everything with familiar locales that make navigation a breeze. In the American sectors you'll feel at home entering the New York system and landing at a spaceport called Manhattan, for example. While contrived, this device is used beautifully and it's far better than having to memorize a bunch of sci-fi names and remembering where they are, perfect for a massive universe such as this one.ThoughFreelanceris set in space, it is technically not a space simulation. The game was designed to be accessible to casual gamers. For example,Freelancermakes you use the mouse for ship control. This is quite a shift for a game genre normally known to require joystick control. But even old-schoolWing CommanderorX-Wingfans may find that the sacrifice of verisimilitude is made up for with gains in agility. The mouse controls your guns, while you use the keyboard to maneuver around the rich universe that developer Digital Anvil has constructed. Much like a first-person shooter, you can dodge and weave while precisely blasting your enemies.Despite the game's age, its graphics are spectacular, as is the sound and voice acting, and in that way, fighting and trading with friends or alone,Freelancerproves worth the wait. Just keep in mind that it is explicitly not a hardcore space simulation, and you'll have to leave your joystick on the shelf.--Andrew S. BubPros:A deep and interesting universeGame adjusts to your choices and affiliationsInnovative and addictive co-op multiplayerIt looks like a space sim but plays like a RPGCons:Joystick isn't even an optionIt looks like a space sim but plays like a RPG","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Morrowind in Space","reviewText":"First things first: this is not a sim, and those who play Freelancer expecting it to be like X-Wing are going to have their expectations adjusted. That said, this adjustment needn't be for the worse, and despite the lack of a steep learning curve or some of the more 'realistic' space combat elements, the game delivers a whole galaxy of fun.Freelancer is more an RPG than either an action game or sim, which is why I don't hesitate to liken it to The Elder Scrolls III. It is open-ended, with few obligations on the part of the player unless you so desire them. Focus is largely placed on exploring new areas, encountering exciting new people, and of course killing them. There are a host of factions you can interact with, each with alliances, unique weapons, distinctive ships, and bases.As the name of the game suggests, you are your own boss and can go anywhere and do pretty much anything. If it suits your fancy, you can smuggle drugs and prey on hapless merchants; or you can choose to protect those same merchants and declare yourself the local sheriff. You gain levels as you advance your worth, and this allows you to purchase better weapons and ships. There are a whole ton of each to check out, all with strengths and weaknesses.Freelancer's single play campaign is simply fantastic. It's not particularly hard, but neither is it dull or monotonous. There are non-linear elements that facilitate replay, and the game doesn't end when you finish the main story. Throughout the missions you explore only a fraction of the total worlds out there, which definitely gives you an idea of how big the game universe is. Be advised that wandering around could get you into very big trouble, which is quite realistic in my opinion but might disturb some gamers.The game's controls and mechanics are extremely simplified, also more fitting to a shooter or RPG than a sim. You have energy, shields, and armor. Energy is for firing your guns, afterburning, and recharging shields. The other two can be instantly recharged by batteries or nanobots so long as you have them. Additionally, individual weapons and pieces of your ship can be damaged and even destroyed if you take too much punishment (the latter happens quite rarely and you'll often be dead by that time anyway) and are repairable only in dock. You use the mouse to both aim and guide your ship, and can fire one of four weapons- guns, missiles, torpedoes, and mines. Additionally, you can launch decoys to fool incoming warheads if you're too lazy to pull an S-turn. Enemy craft are listed in your HUD just like in most other space sims, but there is no radar- you just get an arrow pointing to the target you selected. You can see straight ahead in 1st or 3rd person, or straight back in 3rd person, but nowhere else. To reduce the tedium of flying through nothingness, you can activate cruise engines that increase your speed by about 3x but deactivate weapons. This might sound like a good way to escape from a fight, but it takes a while to charge the cruise and there are weapons that can disable it.Graphics are quite impressive, especially for the system requirements on the box. Some of the effects get a bit repetitive, but the combat is well done and the locations all have unique looks. All of the ships also have their own look, and the explosions are nicely done. Capital ships will break into blasted chunks when they die, and fighters will fly to pieces and burn up. If you manage to do enough structural damage to a target, it will show it. Missiles leave incandescent trails and shields flash when struck.The sound is at times both good and bad. The music is well done, with unique tracks for most of the worlds you can land on. Voice acting on the part of the major character cast is also well done, with such notables as Jennifer Hale, George Takei, and John Rhys-Davies taking part. The comm chatter, however, is a bit of a disappointment. Most of the speakers sound like my next door neighbor, and I could swear they were all the same two people (one male, one female) despite the many different nationalities they're supposed to represent. This is somewhat mediated by the dynamic nature of the dialogue, which is quite interesting to listen to sometimes. If you can't get enough of it, you can hail random ships as you go by, and they'll be glad to give you a full ID.All in all, the best thing about Freelancer is that you can do almost anything you want. If you have the firepower to pull it off, you can try to conquer the whole galaxy on your own. It's not a sim, as demonstrated by the fact that freighters seem to perform just as well as light fighters, but it's not supposed to be a sim. This is one heck of a space RPG, and anyone who can appreciate that should check it out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2003"}

{"product_name":"B000056KDW","description":"After making a name for himself with horror classics such asThe  Damnation Gamenovel,The Books of Bloodshort-story collection, and  the feature filmsHellraiserandCandyman, Clive Barker has slowly  moved away from the horror genre toward more fantasy-centric work. Barker hasn't  completely forgotten about his first love, however, andClive Barker's  Undying, a first-person action game from Electronic Arts and DreamWorks  Interactive, beautifully captures the type of horrors that populated Barker's  earliest works. And not only is this game genuinely frightening, it's also a lot  of fun to play.Cast against the backdrop of Ireland in the year 1923,Undyingfollows  Patrick Galloway, an investigator of the paranormal. Galloway has been summoned  to Ireland by his old war buddy Jeremiah Covenant to put an end to the strange  occurrences at the Covenant family estate. What Galloway finds is a house of  horrors that is populated with Jeremiah's dead siblings (and other ghastly  creatures), all of whom want to snuff out Jeremiah so they can complete a spell  cast when they were children.Graphically,Undyingis first rate. TheUnreal Tournamentgraphics  engine has been used to great effect and the result is amazing character models  and environments. The haunted mansion is suitably dark, with wispy draperies and  macabre paintings. The estate's grounds are a mix of lush Irish countryside and  crumbling ruins, all set against vivid skies.Pretty pictures aside, the most impressive thing aboutUndyingis its  atmosphere--this game is flat-out scary. Every element of the game, be it the  gothic architecture, eerie story, great weather effects including rain and  lightning, or amazing sound effects, perfectly complement each other. The result  is a gameplay experience that rivals theResident Evilseries in terms of  generating sheer terror in the player.The great atmosphere isn'tUndying's only innovation--it also features a  very cool two-handed attack system. Most action games saddle the player with an  attack system where one hand controls all the weapons and the other hand does  nothing. InUndying, the left hand (and left mouse button) controls the  standard weapons, such as the pistol and shotgun, while the right hand (and  right mouse button) casts spells. This is a great gameplay device and ensures  the action stays at a frantic pace.Of all the spells in the game, the coolest is the Scrye spell. When cast, it  lets the player see and hear past events--some of which are quite  horrific--and  occasionally it shows you how to progress beyond a certain level. This help can  come in the form of highlighting certain objects or unveiling a portal, but  whatever the method it is a very well-designed gameplay element.The only real complaints withUndyinginvolve the long loading times  between levels and the system requirements, but even those aren't enough to  derail this excellent--and terrifying--action game.--Kilmic RobbinsPros:Very, very creepyAmazing sound effectsExcellent graphicsSlick controlsCons:Long loading timesStory is a little convoluted","reviewerName":"Michael Pappalardo","summary":"Action and Terror from the first person view-point!","reviewText":"I have played many, many FPS games.  Doom.  Doom 2.  Quake. Duke Nukem. Half Life.  Aliens vs. Predator just to name a few.  And none of them, not even Half-Life or AvP could have prepared anyone for this.This game is terrifying beyond all belief.  Not since Silent Hill has there been a game so utterly nerve wracking.  I have played games that were designed to scare you, but this, from the mind of horror master Clive Barker, will have you trembling in your seat.  Unexpected occurences, such as monsters bursting through walls, the ground suddenly falling out from under you, terrible shrieks that sound like they came from right behind you....you walk into a dark room and see nothing.  The door slams shut, you turn around......the beast standing there will take your head off if you aren't fast enough!Crisp, beautiful graphics that look great even on older video cards (such as Voodoo 3), and incredible sound effects make this game what it is.  Very cool weapons, such as the Tibetan War Cannon which shoots a blast of ice at your enemies, and amazing looking spells, such as the ectoplasm, which fires bolts of pure energy at your enemies are just some of the weapons you will use.  There is 'duel-weilding', where you hold your weapon in your right hand, and your left hand is free for spell casting.  Spell power can be upgraded through 'Mana Wells' found throughout the game.  Helpful items such as 'Ether Traps' can keep monsters at bay while you try to find your way out!The story is rather good, but there are many events in the game that will get you sidetracked while you are trying to perform a task asked of you by one of the NPC's, and then all of a sudden you find yourself being led one way by something else when you are trying to go the other way.There are some other annoying aspects, such as being unable to backtrack, so if you miss something, thats it, you've missed it.  Doors will often shut behind you, and will be unable to be opened again.  There are also many doors throughout the game that cannot be accessed  until much later in the game, where you will find yourself scrambling around the many beautifully detailed areas in the game, trying to find them again.  There are quite a few monster types in the game.  However, at some parts, these monsters respawn at an overwhelming rate, and some of these creatures are VERY difficult to kill because of their unique skills.The inventory system and weapon selection systems were rather annoying as well, with the '1' and '2' keys cycling forward and back through weapons respectively, and '3' and '4' to cycle through spells.  There is a button that allows you to access a 'weapon wheel' where all weapon icons are displayed on screen, allowing you to pick which one you want.  However, if you have to quickly switch weapons in a tense situation, both methods are rather difficult to pull off.Despite those gripes, the game itself is very good.  The monsters are scary, the ability to cast a spell that shows you things that are not normally there, such as ghosts and alterations in the scenery, which will help you understand the story, or just plain terrify you, add to the atmosphere and mood of the game.  If you are a fan of horror and FPS games, this one is for you!  Not for the weak of heart!  Difficult controls, but all in all a good game!Single Player First Person Shooter","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2001"}

I like the idea of wandering through a period ship with period weapons trying to stay warm.  As others have indicated, this is a slow thought invoking game.  It is dark and monotone most of the time.  You would think all of that monotone would produce a game that would run properly on even lower end graphics processors.But, even at low settings I found movement choppy on two different computers, both with Windows Vista 64.  The first runs on an i7-920-2.67 chip with 12G of RAM and an ATI Radeon 4850 graphics card.  The second is running an Intel P7450-2.13 chip with 4G of RAM and a Nvidia 9800GS graphics chip.  Both computers can run Crysis and Fallout 3 without any significant choppiness -- and both games are huge graphically rich processor hogs at their highest settings.  Even the cutaways in Cyrostasis do not show any super significant details that would cause these system slowdowns.  For example, see the dogs in the first memory sequence--they have little details with pixellated tails.  Ice crystals on the wall?  Even at low settings I had only minor improvements in performance on both computers.  My only conclusion is it has to be the coding -- optimization is obviously required for Windows running multiple core chips and moderate high end graphics cards that can run lots of other programs properly.It is hard to get play with the continuous choppiness, and like another player I played to the end, and was glad it was over.  Buy it because it is different than just about any other game you have probably played, but expect to have to reduce the game to graphic lows.  2 stars for \"fun\" tied to performance, and 3 stars for concept.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2010"}

Released the same day as LA Noire and all it's fanfare, this title was easy to ignore.  I picked it up at midnight at the same time as Noire and since I have finished La Noire ( another title worth checking out for sure) I am hooked on this game.  A quick rundown on pros cons.Pros:  story is awesome, 100% coop...meaning all chapters you can drop in drop out, rpg customization that actually affects gameplay,  deep 20 chapter level story, lots of bonus objectives on each level, some tomb raider esque puzzle solving, tight controls and fighting mechanics are pretty good.Cons:  graphics are not a plus, I would compare it to say Sacred 2,  coop gameplay only saves progress for host....not cool after you have ridden shotgun and completed 12 levels only to realize when you launch your own game you must start over,  checkpoint system not perfect.You can clearly see pros far outweigh cons.  If you are concerned about not finding people to play with do not worry, there is at least 10 games open to join at any hour of the day....a few overseas, a few in Canada and in the US.

{"product_name":"B00005ME7X","description":"Originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System,Dragon  Warrior IIIis a Game Boy Color port of one of the all-time classic  role-playing games. The game reunites two of Japan's greatest RPG talents in Yuji  Horii (story and game) and Akira Toriyama (character design). Toriyama is also  known as the creator of the immensely popular Dragon Ball cartoons and comics. A  prequel to the first two games in the series,DWIIIcasts you as the  child of a great hero who must defeat an evil demon. New additions to the port  include improved graphics, new minigames, new items, and a better translation of  the original Japanese dialogue.The game starts off with a personality test that loosely determines how other  characters will react to you. Gameplay is standard RPG fare: exploring, building  experience levels, acquiring allies, gaining weapons, and ultimately going after  a large monster. There are some interesting minigames to mix things up. The  Monster Medals feature adds a collectible aspect to the game. Monsters may leave  medals behind after you defeat them. Some monsters only appear during certain  times of the day. Getting all the medals unlocks a secret dungeon. You can trade  medals via link cable to make things easier. Most RPG fans will love this game,  but those raised on modern RPGs might find its combat a bit tedious. This game  is compatible with Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance only.--Raymond M.  PadillaPros:Classic gameplayExcellent monster and character designBetween 40 to 60 hours of playCons:Battles can get repetitiveA few character classes borderline on uselessGraphics appear dark on Game Boy Advance","reviewerName":"Jeff Johnson \"Jeff Johnson\"","summary":"Amazing re-release of Dragon Warrior III tons of new stuff","reviewText":"One of the ultimate RPGs for the NES comes to Gameboy Color. Some things in the game have changed slightly, and things like the graphics and mini games have changed dramatically. It's the same old story though; you are the brave son of Ortega growing up in a small town. You must then create characters to help you on your quest to destroy the evil Demon Lord. There are useful character classes like Warriors, Fighters, Cleric and Wizards. Then there are useless character classes like Jesters, Dealers and Thieves. To top it off, a huge Gameboy improvement is the game is that the characters now have different personalities (such as brave, romantic, honest, jock and selfish), which determine how they gain hit points, magic points, intelligence, agility and so on when they level up. The game is a very nicely diverse RPG, because in some cases you must first go to a town, then go off to a tower and destroy a boss and his minions, but other times you must go to a castle, talk with a king, then go into a cave, find an item in a treasure chest, go to a town, give that item to someone who will give you a different item that the king wanted! There are fun mini games, such as the old \"monster fights\" where you bet on a monster to win in a battle against monsters, but something new from the NES version is that the game lets you bet double or nothing when you win once! The second mini game is a track where you are given dice to roll, which you will move spaces according to the dice to either tricks, traps, treasures or monster battles. There is a new \"field log\" which will allow a player to save anywhere in the game! The graphics are VERY dark for Gameboy Advance and this game seems to disable exterior lights (it shuts the GBA off if you use a light).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2002"}

Driven by pure revenge, nothing can stop Kratos from achieving absolution.","reviewerName":"Robb Boutros","summary":"WOW!!","reviewText":"Every once in a while there are games that make you step back and make you say \"WOW!!\". God Of War IS such a game. Even though it's relatively early, I think we are looking at a serious candidate for game of the year for 2005.In God of War you play as Kratos. A Spartan Warrior who is in service to the Gods of Olympus. He is betrayed by Ares, the god of war who is leading an onslaught against the city of Athens.The first thing that strikes you about God of War is it's visual imagery. This is an absolutley stunning game in every sense. The game makes you feel like you're traversing through these different lands in varrying types of environments. There are deserts, mountains, and underwater environments just to name a few. There are many little details that make that game a feast for the eyes. One of my favorite features are reflections on pollished floors. All of which are redered very well. Even though the PS2 is over five years old, it shows no signs of it's age in God of War. God of War's graphics feature a \"soften\" feature which slightly blurs the picture. If you turn if off you get a crisper picture. The only bad thing about the graphics are that the camera is not free to adjust. And occasionally if you have an older PS2, you'll get a brief pause in the game while it loads the next area. It's a minor nuisance that I think could have been avoided by placing a door or obstacle in the way to impede your progress slightly.But make no mistake, as lavish as the graphics are the real star here is the gameplay. The main character, Kratos, has a ton of moves you can execute. Some are more devastating than others. His main weapons are his chain blades called The Blades of Chaos that extend from his arms. As the game progresses Kratos will earn different abilities from the different gods. Each power is unique and all of Kratos' abilites are upgradable. Making attacks more effective. The moves are easy to execute using the PS2's dual shock controller. The only thing that is a little tricky is the evade move which is enabled by the right analog stick. The game is relatively short, about 20 hours and there's no online play (how would you play a game like this online?) but the extras really enhance the replay value. Be warned:  this game is EXTREMELY violent. The level of gore is rather severe. This game is NOT for young children.One thing that designer David Jaffe included was a ton of extras. There are challenge modes, documenatarys, trailers, deleted levels, a character graveyard where unused character models can be viewed, extra costumes and an ultra challenging God mode. There's no shortage of extras here.There are some that have said this game was \"overhyped\", however I don't understand why. I saw the usual commercials, magazine adds and demos were sent out. There wasn't nearly the hype level as there was for higher profile games. The staff at my local GameStop told me that there wasn't a pre-order blitz until literally days before the game's release.This is quite literally one of the best games on the PS2. If there's any doubt I at the very least recomend you rent it first. But once you start playing you may not stop. God Of War goes in the \"must play\" category. And once you do you'll be glad you did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2005"}

Morales","summary":"A TRUE Action/Adventure Game","reviewText":"God of War is easily one of the greatest games of the year. Acclaimed by both critics and fans, I see countless sequels of this one to come, and  here's why:Eyes and Ears: 4.5/5: God of War has some of the best graphics on the PS2. While other games are muddled with blurry effects and shoddy sounds. GOW's visuals are absolutely crystal clear and razor-sharp. Just bring up our hero Kratos to the screen and take a look at him alone, the detail is astounding. If there was one downfall to the visuals it would have to be when fights get intense and many enemies gather onscreen. Sometimes the camera can pan too far back and actually finding where you're hitting takes second guessing. This usually goes away in a few seconds though. Also, frame rates can get a TAD slow when there is too much on screen at one time... this again is just nitpicking though given the rest of the amazing quality - like huge worlds, beautiful fire and special effects and great distance sight. Keep in mind though that the camera is self working, therefore control it you cannot. No matter though, because the game developers have made sure to give you the best possible angle on every battle and every step along the way. Therefore you won't care that you can't control it, trust me.Sounds are great too, every whap and slice of enemies is gruesomely audible and morbidly self-fulfilling. There is nothing funner than grabbing a bad guy and pushing the O-button to tear him in half and listening to that body tear. Magic spells are nice and loud, and though the music fits the adventure and each situation perfectly, it's not the type of music quality you'd want to go out and buy a soundtrack for (like say, PS1's Castlevania: SOTN).Hands: 5/5: You couldn't DREAM of tighter controls. Kratos's adventure takes lots of fast moves and quick decisions, and thankfully enough the developers have made it that much easier by not screwing us over with so much as a small step below stellar. During this, you'll need EVERY button and almost every powerup if you want to survive, so there's plenty of variety, and more than you know what to do with in one playthough. The combo integration is fantastic also. As you move along your adventure, you'll aquire experience points to bring about newer and more deadlier combos, stronger magical powers, and a stronger Kratos overall. As to which magic powers you'll want to update with your experience is up to you, but by the last hour of the game you'll have aquired just about everything.Brains: 4/5: While Kratos' journey to destroy Ares, the god of war, and avenge his family's isn't the most original idea in the world, the fact that we get to know Kratos better and better with various (beautiful and bloodsplattering) cinematic cut scenes thoughout our adventure gives us a better appreciation for the story and character development overall. You don't learn everything about this one person in the opening sequence as you would most games, we don't really know anything about him at first, but learn as we go along - and all the better. Therefore while the story is typical, the presentation of it makes it a completely non-issue.While puzzles in the game are quite easy to figure out, I became appreciative of it, only because GOW is about EMPOWERMENT, and empowered you'll become without hair-pulling brain teasers to slow you down. A TRUE action/adventure game this surely is. And a beautifully bloody one at that. On top of that, you've gotta love the minigames. When an enemy becomes weak, a button icon will appear above their heads. You can choose to either finish him off with more swipes, or you can play a game of Simon while Kratos takes him out in some uniquely cool way. Again, the variety of methods and choice of moves in this game is astounding. Keep in mind though that the game is pretty linear and there's very little to NO backtracking... like I said, this ain't no RPG or Resident Evil.Hormones: 5/5: Fun, fun, fun. Though during the first stage or two you'll be wondering what everyone is drueling over, don't fret. You don't really KNOW Kratos or what you're realy up to then. But play it further and you'll cheer him on during the following levels. I would say this is easily one of the funnest games I've played in years, and recommend it to ANYONE. Though the game would take the average experienced adventure gamer about 10-11 hrs to beat, it's QUALITY, NOT QUANTITY that matters. I've played games that have been 20 or more hours that are not nearly as fun as this one. And considering all the unlockable \"making-of\" treats you'll get once the game is beaten and MORE after the game is beaten on God level (which im too afraid to try) you'll probably be playing through this more than once.Overall: 5/5: Genious character development, empowering and cheer inducing gameplay, crisp and incredibly clean graphics? how can you go wrong? this is well worth every cent of those $50 you'll toss down for it. Game of the year in my opinion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2005"}

Generally speaking, I'm a sucker for anything that has experience points incorporated into the gameplay, but my enjoyment of this game goes far beyond that.  The plot is a bit predictable at times, and the music/sound effects make me turn the volume off sometimes, but the graphics are lush and the gameplay really WORKS.This is what the junction and GF systems in FFVIII should have been.  A large part of the gameplay hinges on djinns, or elemental spirits which you must collect as you progress through the game.  Once you collect a djinn, you must \"set\" it to a character (think of it as junctioning).  This will affect what sort of special abilities the character has, the character's stats, their class, and, of course, what they get to summon in battle.The most interesting thing about the djinns is the fact that you can combine different elemental djinns on one person to produce some interesting special abilities.  Admittedly, some djinns do not do this when in certain combinations, but the idea is simply fascinating and opens up a very interesting avenue in character development.Anyway, the upshot of this is, if you are an RPG fan with a GBA, you need this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2004"}

While some have called this the ZombiU clone I'd say that's a tad unfair as there are some differences in story and gameplay though obviously the same mass of undead you have to fight to survive is the same.If you've played DayZ then you might feel a little deja vu on the objective of the game and the mechanics somewhat as well of course if you've played ZombiU.The A.I. of the zombies in the game is decent and sometimes great as when you fire a weapon or make too much noise a zombie will come to investigate though other times you can be walking right behind one of the undead and they still won't notice you allowing for an easy quick finish which seems a little redundant.  The graphics and effects are pretty good though obviously not equal to the more elevated games like Halo/Gears of War/Uncharted etc,etc but still decent as is the soundtrack that goes with the game with of course the memorable intro  music from the t.v. series itself.  The game is a good addition for zombie gaming fans or those who like FPS regardless the game is fun and you'll find yourself sweating a little as you try and survive your way through the hordes of undead in the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2014"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar.

{"product_name":"B00009TW6R","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements.

As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions.

Bound to the land, these creatures hold a key to a mystical power of revival--a power you must obtain to waken a loved one.Shadow of the Colossusis a majestic journey through ancient lands to seek out and destroy gigantic mythical beasts. With your trusty horse at your side, explore the spacious lands and unearth each Colossi. Armed with your wits, a sword, and a bow, use cunning and strategy to topple each behemoth.From the original developers of the critically acclaimed ICO, comes a masterpiece of an adventure.","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"An outstanding game.","reviewText":"Shadow of the Colossus has been hailed as a masterpiece by most reveiwers, so I was expecting the very best, especially after enjoying \"Ico\" so much. I was not disappointed. It looks great, plays great and it is totally involving.The gameplay is very economical - your task is to roam across a vast land in search of giant monsters. Each one is different and each one has to be killed. There is usually a different puzzle to work out every time, but the basic requirements are always to climb onto the monster somehow, find it's weakspot and hack away it it with your sword. The first colossus gives you a good introduction to the procedure - the only way up his body starts from one of his ankles - which you can cling on to. From here you must find a way of getting him to crouch down so that you can scale the rest of him, eventually making your way onto the top of his head where his weakspot lies. Kill him and you are one-sixteenth of your way though.The game soon ups the stakes, however. From the second giant beast onwards you find this out straight away - he doesn't have climbable legs! So you are required to use your brain from here on. Sometimes the landscape provides the clues, maybe you can get to higher ground? Sometimes the behaviour of the colossus is the clue - does he ever give you an opportunity to get a hold of him? This is the real fun of the game, and I found it completely addictive. As soon as I met the first colossus that could fly, I was well and truly hooked, determined to work out the way to get myself onto him, when to start with he was perched on a pole in the middle of a lake - completely oblivious to me.  That's the other thing - some of these giant creatures will completely ignore you, only attacking you after you have started inflicting damage on them. Either way, though, their attacks are more of a nuisance than a real threat, because you are more concerned about not falling off as you climb up them. But then you come across the one that can swim, and has an electrified self defence deterrent on it's back - which is the only part that sticks out of the water - and realise that you can start getting seriously hurt! The game actually gets a lot better when the monsters start turning nastier, and soon you'll be meeting up with angry beasts that attack as soon as they see you. And the last 5 or so of the battles are the real showstoppers, especially the gigantic flying sand dragon - it's immense!! - and the sheer spectacle of the final one.The design of all the monsters is wonderful, they appear half organic and half made of stone. Although they all share expressionless faces like robots, each one has a unique character and temperament. And here's a surprising effect: causing the death of each beast may fill you with terrible guilt each time! Each stab of the weakspot in the heat of battle causes a jet of black blood to erupt, along with a monstrous cry of pain from the beast. Then, once you strike the fatal blow, they tumble to the ground in agony and turn black and lifeless.  I felt a huge pang of remorse every time, after all it is not the beasts that seek you out, but the opposite. You are the one who invades their environment with murderous intent. There is, of course, a reason why your character must carry out this slaughter, but it still feels sad all the same to end the lives of these magnificent beings.Apart from the killing, well there isn't much else to do but admire the scenery. The land you are traversing is gigantic in size, and luckily you have a companion in the form of Agro the horse, which you can ride to get you across it. This aspect reminded me a lot of crossing Hyrule Field on horseback in \"Legend of Zelda - The Ocarina of Time\", but times have moved on and Agro is a lot more realistic than Epona, he moves and behaves amazingly realistically, and a lot of time and effort must have been put into creating him. The whole landscape too, seems expertly crafted, and don't be surprised if you feel like doing a bit of sightseeing between each battle, just to look at the world you are inhabiting. There are actually some minor side games on offer in the empty landscape, which players probably won't realise unless they are on a replay of the game (or have looked up walkthrough information), because there is no mention of them in the game manual! I'll leave that up to you as to whether you wish to uncover this yourself or look it up.Actually, that leads me onto one of the few flaws in the game, namely that it is quite short. If you use a walkthrough to find out how to kill each colossus, you'll be shooting yourself in the foot, because this puzzle factor accounts for at least half of each battle. Once you know the tricks, each killing becomes drastically simplified, and the actual length of the game becomes glaringly tiny. So do yourself a favour, and don't cheat - you'll appreciate the game so much more. Subsequent re-plays don't add anything new to the mix, expect that there is one great secret  - a location that can only be reached once you have played many cumulative battles and built up your health and grip-meter (yes - these stats can be enhanced!) high enough to attempt the mammoth task of climbing your way up to it - again, the curious can research this secret if they wish to. But apart from that, then yes, shortness is a criticism that can be fairly levelled at this game.But I'm still surprised to see that a few players have rated this game boring and uninvolving. I guess if you're good at boss battles, you'll lick this much faster than those players for whom the meat of a game is the journey rather than the showdown. It's probably also because those people are used to games with non-stop action, choices, weapons and items to juggle around, and \"Colossus\" has none of these things. It's like taking a sightseeing cruise instead of an extreme sports holiday - they are both fun, but you don't have to wear yourself out in the first type! My only other niggles are that the camera cannot be manually moved to face the direction you want it in - the controls to move it are temporary and it will always swing back to the default position as soon as you let go - not helpful. That and the mechanics of directional jumping while clinging on to a ledge or wall (which made me fall off many times) are the only real areas in need of improvement. The rest of the game is brilliant, and everyone should play it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2006"}

It's a great game but it feels like a dlc add-on... a really, really big dlc add-on.The game's new and only location (Rome) is larger than any city in AC2, but not quite as beautiful or interesting. The cities in AC2 were varied and often romantic, especially when you arrived in Venice. Rome on the other hand is dilapidated and kinda bland.The fighting has improved with new move sets, new weapons (like crossbows and poison darts), and enemies who aren't afraid to attack you while you're engaged with another.Movement and control are less enjoyable for some reason. They're mostly the same as AC2 but a little less accurate, a little less responsive, and a lot more infuriating. This is mostly evident when a situation requires urgency. Ezio bumbles around like a moron, unsure of what you're trying to get him to do, while the enemy attacks him mercilessly.The new feature of recruiting and training assassins is a fun and welcomed addition, as are parachutes, horse ridding while in the city and upgrading shops and buildings for use.The story was relatively interesting, but didn't feel like a significant enough leap in the AC mythos. It feels like AC2 was a little too long and the overlapping segment was cut, stretched out and padded with content to justify a full disc. Regardless, I actually prefer this approach as opposed to repeated dlc releases.I have not yet played Revelations so I cannot say whether Brotherhood is a purchase necessary to understand the overall story. Most of what occurs will undoubtedly be recapped in Revelations but considering the current price ($20>), you may want to pick this up anyway.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2012"}

I had the option to order it online, but I chose to go out to a store instead to be safe (I don't trust online orders if the amount is high). I ended up visiting my local Target. The most they had was the 4 GB console. I was reluctant to purchase it at first, until I learned that I can buy a hard drive to add more space. I ended up purchasing the 4 GB console at Target for $180 (this was the sale price when I went). I also got a $20 gift card on top of that, since it was offered at the time I went, which was a bonus for sure.I then searched for a hard drive. I was going to get a 250 GB hard drive, until I saw a 320 GB one with Lego Star Wars 3. I ended up getting the 320 GB, since it was a good deal (only $100 at Best Buy at the time I went there).Overall, the point I am trying to make here is that it is well worth it to get the 4 GB and then get a hard drive for it (preferably the 320 GB if you ask me, but it is up to you of course). I ended up spending a total of only $280 to turn my XBox 360 into a 320 GB console, whereas the retail price for the original 250 GB console is $300.I would also like to add that this XBox console is NICE! It is very quiet compared to the older models and the games play very smoothly. This console comes with AV cables, but I chose to not use them. I instead use my HDMI cable that I purchased on my own a few years ago. This makes the picture appear more sharp and crisp, similar to a Blu Ray compared to a standard DVD. Also, I love the built in Wi-fi feature.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2013"}

Right now Im going to say Titanfall's less \"next gen\"(bloody stupid buzzword) than say... Mario Kart 8. Which looks like Boxart CGI and runs at a clean clip of 60fps. (Titanfall dips because combat gets absolutely crazy in this game) You got 12 soldiers and 12 titans running amok all over the god damn place after all.If I had to describe Titanfall I'd say its Call of Duty 4 with Mechs. Its really evolves the FPS genre by bringing a package that takes previously touched upon concepts in shooters and ties them all together in a nice well implemented package that is incredibly involving and fun. The game is so satisfying from a basic mechanics point of view. Its designed quite soundly.Graphically I'd say the game has some really impressive texture work, its really pretty makes everything look very distinct. I hope to see some updates later like a DLC single player mode,( Like a challenge fest) or destructible environments ( say on the Xbone, making use of its beefier CPU) to really add to the overall feel of the world and game, although I think that'll hurt the framerate even more. Probably why its sort of light on the graphical effects when it comes to explosions, but the texture work is damn good so you dont even care XD.But Im going to say this, if there is one thing that TitanFall excels at, its speed. This game is really momentum based. You can move incredibly fast in this game, and that ups the ante and dynamic of gunplay a lot in this game. The dynamics of outsmarting your opponent and controlling the field are entirely different.At one point or another I'd love to see an update where they add some destructible environments that you could jump off of and launch yourself into a Titan where you proceed to wreck the field left and right.At the end of the day, if you're a Call of Duty fan, you're going to absolutely adore this game.Which is perfect for the Xbox One. And your PC. And your Xbox 360.If you like a different flavor to your shooters and something on less epic proportion, I recommend Steel Diver,or Deus Ex. Or Spec Ops:The Line :PMoral of the Story: The funnest next gen game on the PSbore/Xbone, is not next gen at all. Be wise with your dollars! Buy good software!! Consoles are for games! Not Warfare. Or graphics. PC's do that much better. Its great building a rig and putting it in a living room. I can play Dota 2 right there! Or Mid-Budget indie games with a controller! But PC's are open platforms! So my games wont always support controllers! Drivers can be annoying but hey, tweaking is the joy of owning a PC. Lol. I think the SteamBox will be interesting because it makes the open source platforms slightly more standardized.When it comes to consoles you gotta do two things well, creating amazing gameplay experiences that are fun to watch and even more fun to play, to explore in, from their mechanics to their world. Games like Bayonetta 2, Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, Xenoblade Chronicles, Shin Megami Tensei. Those games. So focus on that. Leave everything else to the rabble. Because at the end of the day Titanfall is worth a hell of a lot more than Killzone Shadowfall will ever be.I played TitanFall on a PC with Minimum settings(for Kicks) prior to this review. The Xbox One version looks \"slightly better\" than a 360 game I hear.As for the game. Im just going to say that TitanFall is a very strong and solid core foundation for something more. Its the bones with the muscle. But it needs a lot more meat and flesh to truly become something stellar.

I biggest wish with this game is that they'd developed the story and backgrounds of the characters further. For me, the gameplay for the most part just got in the way of the story. The characters they created in Monkey and Trip and really interesting and deep (though Pigsy was a bit too cartoonish), and I really enjoyed their relationship. The developers created something you don't normally see in games with their interactions. So many times in games, the love side-story always feels forced and rushed, but in Enslaved it's the complete opposite. They start out with Monkey having every reason to hate her, as in the beginning of the game she uses a head band to enslave him, so he has to follow Trip's orders and if she dies he would die as well. The climax of their relationship (watch out this is a tiny bit of a spoiler) occurs right before the final battle against the evil slavers Pyramid. Here Trip decides to deactivate the headband, letting him run away if he so chose, instead he vehemently told her to turn it back on. This is just such a deep and interesting reaction, I took it to mean that he wanted to be tied to her so that if she somehow died in the last battle so would he. You could also take it as he didn't want to have the choice of leaving to be available as he didn't trust himself or who he used to be, roving around the blasted countryside only stopping for food and fuel, never having anything to fight for. It was a beautiful scene, but after the end, I just wish that the developers had pushed their relationship further. They didn't need to make it unreal, but I wish it would have at least ended with their first kiss, instead of leaving it all up in the air.To expand on this, the whole story just wasn't developed enough. I wish I'd learned more about all of the characters backgrounds, instead of just a few random comments. I also would have preferred it if I'd learned more about what happened in the world to leave it the way it is at the time the game takes place. They really never say, though I surmised that it had something to do with all the mechs roaming the wasteland (though these may have been Pyramid's). There are hidden memories in the game you can find, but these are all just of common present activities (they explain what they are at the end). I think they missed an opportunity of exploring the decline of human society in fragmented flashbacks similar to Assassin's Creed.  They also really don't explain who Pyramid is, especially during the first 90% of the game, though I suppose this was because none of the characters really knew who or what they were.Now, onto more of the gameplay and presentation. The graphics in this game are beautiful, especially the character models. While Monkey and Pigsy are both a bit on the cartoony side (human traits and body types mutated a bit to better represent their name-sakes) Trip is one of the nicest looking video game characters in recent memory, especially her face. All of the action is very cinematic, though in the end I'd consider almost all of the gameplay a fusion of Prince of Persia and God of War. The platforming and combat are very similar to the Prince of Persia, though in general it wasn't as satisfying. I was a bit annoyed that there was no sprint button, and you could only jump exactly where the game wanted you to. This eliminated some of the tactile feeling you  get when free-running in Assassin's Creed, and it also limits the difficulty. I found that there was nothing in the game truly difficult, but there were annoyances. The developer relied too much on insa-deaths to punish the player for very small mistakes. The only chance for death when platforming comes when the whole building is collapsing, and it usually just entails the player hitting the A button a little faster. The real danger comes from either proximity mines (which explode when barely touching the edge) and a few chases on the very floaty controlled floating \"cloud\" Monkey rides on. When you're just exploring the cloud's limitations aren't too noticeable, but when you're in a high-speed chase to save Trip it's just very annoying (especially when the cloud and the proximity mines are combined).The combat itself is decent, though it gets a bit repetitive; while there isn't much to complain about there also isn't much to appreciate. The staff's plasma and stun shot can be useful at the times, but for the most part it's very flawed. You'd think in an action/adventure game the aiming would be some sort of automatic lock-on, but no. In this game it's all stick aiming, in fact unlike every shooter out there today, I didn't notice any aim-assist. This made it very difficult to use the projectile shot while in combat. Multiple times while attempting this, I actually shot at the center mass of the mech and it missed because the waists are so thin. There are also cinematic events similar to the ones in the God of War games, but instead of timed button presses it's completely cinematic. I kind of welcome this, as the button presses have become cliched and overused in today's games, but at the same time not having any interaction with the events can take you out of the game.Overall, I enjoyed playing the game, it's at a good length not too short but it doesn't drag itself out too far, and despite its flaws it is very fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001NIP3EG","reviewerName":"MurphysLaw","summary":"I choose Rapture...Again","reviewText":"I'm a little late to the Bioshock 2 bandwagon but I wanted to make a few comments for those that are considering purchasing the game.  It is not necessary to play the original Bioshock but you will probably enjoy it more.  Since this is a sequel and the original was extremely popular, it is inevitable that the two are compared.  To be honest, that probably accounts for the majority of the negative comments but here are what I feel are the pros and cons:Pros:~ The atmosphere of the game is every bit as good as the first.  While you are still within the city of Rapture, you explore different sections and I found accessing areas to be more straightforward with far less back tracking. For those that played the first one, it is true that some of the shine has worn off Rapture. The art work and details just aren't as interesting and exciting as the initial playthrough of Bioshock but overall, the game holds true to the atmosphere of the original and it still looks good.  While there was no noticable upgrade to the overall graphics, some of the enemies and moving parts look cleaner and more defined.  The PS3 version looks polished and complete and I saw no issues with clipping, etc.~ The story line, while not nearly as intricate and detailed as the first game, still holds your interest throughout. Don't expect a lot of twists and turns and you won't be disappointed.~ I really enjoyed playing as a Big Daddy. Its just more fun and more original.  Also, I felt that the Little Sisters were more engaging this time around and the developers did a good job of making you want to protect them.  You still have choices that will directly effect which ending you get and there are 4 total.~ The mechanics and movement are essentially the same as the first game but thankfully, the peripheral vision has vastly improved.~ You have both your plasmid and your weapon accessible simultaneously. The first game forced you to choose which was armed at any given time.~ Hacking has changed.  In my opinion, this is the greatest improvement in the game. While some may find it too easy, I detested the pipe reorganization in the first one.  It just felt like it ripped you out of the game and it was tedious and annoying.  Now you just stop a needle in a colored portion of the dial and you are good to go.  You also get bonuses for stopping in the blue sections and its well worth your while to make the effort.  I also didn't have a problem with the remote hacking darts, which apparently caused some players problems.~ The first game had your default melee weapon as a wrench, which I used frequently because there is nothing like getting up front and personal. This time around, you get a drill, which can use fuel to actually drill into things or you can just swing it and beat the crap out of someone. Its quite effective, especially as you progress through the game and get upgrades.  I used it more than any other weapon in the game.  Keep in mind that you can use any weapon as melee but there is just something about that big old drill.  Muhahahaha.~ Controls are fine.  While some players complained that the controls weren't responsive and they couldn't pick up items, I didn't find this to be an issue at all.~There are TONS of pick ups.  First aid kits, money, eve, ammo, etc.  In fact, if you spend a little time looking around, you often find more items than you can carry.  I really don't understand the complaints unless other reviewers are just plowing through the game without even looking.  There are also lots of plasmid upgrades and level up items around. Take a few seconds and search!~ The Power to the People stations are in this game so you can upgrade your weapon of choice but the U-Vent machines are gone.  Personally, I didn't miss them or the requirement to search for 7 different parts to make one weapon or item to continue.  Finding those parts involved even more back tracking which bogged down the original game.~There are plenty of Trophies for those perfectionists out there.~The multiplayer games are surprisingly fun.  There are plenty of on-line players and it adds a different aspect to the game.  There is player customization and a ranking up feature that unlocks trials and weapon/plasmid upgrades.  You can play as part of a team or in a match where it's every man for himself.  One room allows you to play a capture the flag type game where the flag is a Little Sister.  While the gameplay does not change, each match occurs in different areas from the original Bioshock...ah, nostaglia.  You can easily get sucked into the on-line games and end up wasting hours there.  There are Trophies to be earned in the multiplayer games as well.~ Like the original, during load screens you will get hints on gameplay.  They can be helpful for players that have run into problems and you can fast forward or reverse through them as needed.Cons:~ Just like the first one, the initial load is PAINFULLY slow.  I mean, like 20 minutes long.  Come on, seriously.~ The plasmids and weapons (except the drill) are also about the same.  There are a few upgrades here and there but nothing stellar, which is disappointing and really a missed opportunity.~ The over-hyped \"explore outside Rapture\" is a joke.  You move along a very linear path for about 15 total minutes of game play.  There are Adam slugs to look for but no enemies or challenge so it is gimmicky at best.~ While the overall story is fine, there are plot holes.  Dr. Tennebaum makes a reappearance but then suddenly she just disappears, never to be heard from again.  Also, for some reason the Big Sisters feel the need to attack you even if you rescued the Little Sisters.  Another issue is that despite the fact that you are a Big Daddy, the amount of damage you take is the same as if you were a puny human.  A few smacks from your averge Splicer and you're toast. As you level up your max health, the enemies get more difficult obviously so that aspect doesn't really change much.~ The music is not as good or as original as the first.~ Most of the enemies that you encounter are almost exactly like the original game.  They've added a few new ones like the Big Sisters but another missed opportunity.  There is also repetition with the Adam collection process and you'll see the same enemies with the same comments repeatedly.All in all, Bioshock 2 is an exceptional game.  If it wasn't compared to the orignal, it would get rock solid reviews all around but as a sequel there were a few disappointments and missed opportunities.  Still, I found the game to be very engrossing and enjoyed every last minute of it.  It's one of those games that once you finish, you want to start all over.  Definitely fun and definitely worth the purchase!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0044S8DA8","description":"","reviewerName":"Brendan Ross","summary":"Solid Single Player RPG","reviewText":"Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is the first offering from 38 Studios, the game development company founded a few years ago by former Major League pitcher Curt Schilling.  The game's world and lore has had substantial creative input from the best-selling fantasy author R.A. Salvatore, and has also had substantial input from several well-known game designers and developers at Big Huge Games, a company that 38 acquired from THQ a few years ago.  In a nutshell, the game has a good deal of quality development power behind it, and it shows.38 Studios is mostly focused on MMORPG development, and has a project already in the works.  In some ways, this is reflected in this game, because the game often plays like a single player MMORPG.  This has good and bad aspects, and may not appeal to all gamers, for the reasons I describe below.First, graphically the game feels like World of Warcraft.  That is -- the graphics are more of the cartoon/stylized variety than the more realistic kind found in single player games like The Witcher 2 or Skyrim.  The color scheme of the world also tends toward bright, vivid colors in a way that reminds one of WoW's artistic approach.  As a result, less of an emphasis is placed on extremely high-resolution textures, and more on overall feel and style.  It's inevitable that this will turn off some single-player game fans, who prefer games like Skyrim with realistic, high-resolution graphics.Second, the progression in the game is not as linear as something like Mass Effect, but instead features zone progression -- as in, you start in one area/zone, complete the quests in that zone, and then are moved on to the next zone, where there is another pack of quests.  The NPC enemies/monsters in these zones do not scale, unlike a game like Skyrim, so as your character levels, the open-world monsters will become trivial in earlier zones.  In that sense, although it is more of an open world game than something like Mass Effect or Dragon Age: Origins, in that you are actually moving around in the open world rather than porting between snippets of it, it nevertheless plays more like an MMO in this respect than a game like Skyrim.  I do not see this as a drawback, but some players may.Beyond these, the game plays like a good, polished single player RPG.  It does feel like a console game at times, even when playing on the PC, due to the control scheme, the camera angles, and the way the character moves and feels -- this is becoming fairly common in computer RPGs these days, and similar kinds of issues were present in Skyrim's menus system as well.Combat is probably the highlight of the game, and in this aspect it does not play like an MMORPG at all, or like a traditional RPG (as the first Dragon Age did) but like an action RPG.  The combat is fast-paced and fluid, the character is responsive, and the ways and means are quite varied.  The player can choose a melee warrior setup, a rogue/stealth setup or a mage type setup, or any combination of the above, in going about combat.  The game makes it very easy to change one's approach (for a smallish in-game currency fee) to suit a different kind of combat style, and the game offers a substantial variety of weapons and skills that all can be used to alter one's approach to combat and how one essentially plays the game.  One point worthy of mention is that the game's default difficulty setting is probably too easy for advanced gamers, and the hard setting probably feels like a normal mode to hardcore gamers -- at some point perhaps a true nightmare mode will be released for hardcore gamers.The story is well-done, as one would expect with the input of someone like Salvatore, and functions as a good introduction to this new setting and world.  The game accomplishes this credibly and well from the very beginning, with an interesting, fully-blown world and lore revealed gradually to the player.  The larger implications of the story are also fairly interesting, particularly once one advances along the quest lines a bit further.  The voice over dialogue scenes are not going to be confused with a BioWare game, but at the same time the overall game design for Amalur is much more open world than is the case for a BioWare game, and the voice over dialogue is present but much less of a focus.  The use of lorestones and other means to tell the story is an interesting and enjoyable approach, in my opinion.In all, this is a very good effort as the first release from 38 Studios.  It's polished, deep, long and fun to play.  Hopefully we will see more of this interesting world and setting in future games from 38 -- maybe even in the MMORPG they are currently developing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2012"}

This Fills the Bill","reviewText":"Left 4 Dead was a fairly innovative change of pace for the \"zombie game\" genre, and it came at a time when the zombie thing wasn't as popular as it is now.  Left 4 Dead 2 does a nice job of expanding on the original while keeping the core gameplay that made it so much fun.  This game playes like a first-person shooter (FPS) that emphasizes grouping and teamwork.  Even if you're playing the single-player 'campaign', it really has the feel of a multiplayer map with bot allies.  There are character archetypes you choose from to play, and each has slight differences but most of the gameplay is still down to your own level of skill.As a long-timer PC gamer, I love the graphics of Left 4 Dead 2 on the PC:  I've played both it and the XBox 360 version and the visuals are far better.  One of my favorite things about the PC version is that it feels like a classic Valve game:  coming from Half-Life, Counter-Strike, and Team Fortress, I really feel at home in my Left 4 Dead player's shoes.  One thing I like least is that there are times when you will get overwhelmed simply because you weren't aware of what was ahead--and a different decision next time or going a slightly differet way through the map becomes the difference between life and death.  It's hard to complain about this though, because truly that's what the whole \"undead horror\" genre is all about.Left 4 Dead 2 gives you multiple types of undead:  these aren't just your shambling slow-moving horrors but instead we're talking about some zombies rushing at you trying to pin you to the wall, others 'spitting' acid/venom at you, and still other types (\"Boomers\") that run up to you and explode.  The box art should make it clear to you that this game is rated 'M' for a reason:  the gore is vivid and there is more splatter here than a Gallagher concert in fast-forward.  John Carpenter and George Romero would be impressed.  Like all good horror stories, there's humor woven throughout:  characters crack jokes to ease the tension, and there are many objects in the world you can use creatively if you run out of ammo (or just feel like going nuts):  baseball bats, chainsaws (of course!) and even frying pans can be picked up and used on the living dead (called 'the Infected' here).The developers have also come up with what they call 'AI Director 2.0'.  This intelligent subsystem creates 'procedurally generated' (read, 'dynamic') changes to the map as you play.  Pathways are slightly different on one playthrough than they are on another, and the difficulty of the game seems to adjust itself to your level of skill, so you don't get too overwhelmed but neither are you quickly bored.  Instead you're continually kept on your toes, because at times it seems like nothing is permanent.  I'd read an article with the creators about how much easier the new engine made it for them to populate the environment with hundreds of bodies, all without crushing performance, and it shows:  at times you feel like you're charging through masses.If you like survival horror and you also enjoy fast action, Left 4 Dead 2 is an excellent choice.  I find aiming and combat easier having played other Valve  shooters, and I found myself really falling into the storyline, getting immersed in the chaos and at times startled out of my wits.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2011"}

The makers have labeled it as an \"interactive drama\", which is a pretty appropriate term, I think.  It is the definition of a new genre of games, one that I hope other studios will try to make games for in the future.When I played this game, my hands were literally sweating on the controller during some of the more intense scenes.  My girlfriend, who has been known to watch me play video games only if it is Civilization Revolution, was pleading with me to play this game more so she could see what happens.  A decision a character must make near the end of the game had us discussing together the possible results of each choice before I committed to the action.The story is not without its problems.  It has loose ends that I can only describe as 'holes'.  But make no mistake, this is the beginning of a new genre of video games, and I'm sure we'll see improvement in plot writing in future games.If you're sitting on the fence about buying this game, I say go for it!

Fulkerson","summary":"Highly original game with a few flaws","reviewText":"I would give Heavy Rain four and a half stars if I could, but it stops just short of being perfect.  The game has been out for a few months now, and most people have covered what it is great about the game.  I just finished the game this evening, and I am left wanting much more!This game isn't going to appeal to gamers who only want to mash away on their buttons firing at things repeatedly.  As far as gameplay is concerned, there isn't a single game out there that is comparable to Heavy Rain which makes this a must-purchase in my book.  I'm an avid gamer, and I look forward to the times when such an original concept makes itself evident in the gaming world.  Heavy Rain is like controlling characters in a movie, and the twist is that you actually care about the people in the story.  These aren't just random people who never speak and have no personalities, these are people with attitudes and unique motivations.  There were more than a few times while playing this game that I became tense and nervous over my choices.  After these intense scenes ended, I'd find myself smiling at my reactions.  This game completely sucked me into its world, and I couldn't stop playing until the end.The minor annoyances with this game are few, but they distracted me just enough to not give the game a perfect rating.  For one, the voice acting is pretty spotty.  The voice actors for the characters Madison Paige and Scott Shelby are very good, but they are unevenly balanced by the subpar voice acting for the characters Ethan Mars and Norman Jayden.  The latter two characters just don't have the emotion that is needed in the story.  Another minor gripe involves the battle scenes.  When you're fighting someone you have to push certain buttons to carry out the battle, but the button prompts on the screen can get in the way and distract you from the action.  I found myself getting sucked into watching a certain scene, but then I'd be prompted to push some random button.  For a game that plays like a movie there is a lot of time staring at button symbols then actually watching the game unfold.  My last gripe is about the ending.  Maybe my standards are too high, but the ending fell flat.  I find this to be the case in nearly every game I play, so maybe I expect too much.  I feel that developers spend so much time on character development, and do such a great job building a compelling story line, only to have it fizzle out at the end with a lackluster conclusion.  I'm not going to give anything away about the ending here, but there were several things that didn't add up and it was frustrating.All in all, though, this was an extremely fun and intoxicating game.  I found it very stimulating in the way it wove a truly adult story, and I hope this is the start of some genuinely mature oriented titles in the future.  This is one of just a few games that earns its \"mature\" rating, but it doesn't try to shock you by being over the top.Above all, Heavy Rain is an extremely original idea for a game, and it should be highly praised solely for this reason.  With a few control tweaks, better voice acting, and a slightly longer and more involved story line (with a more thoughtful ending), this game would have been an absolutely stunning achievement.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2010"}

(This would, of course, be corrected on Super Mario All-Stars for the Super NES/Wii.)EVERYTHING about this game is completely spectacular -- the graphics, soundtrack, sound effects, background schemes, the new enemies/bosses you encounter (including Bowser and his 7 children -- WHAT?!), and certainly not least -- the new costumes that Mario gets to wear!  My favorite is the Tanooki Suit because you can swing your tail to defeat those nasty Goombas -- PLUS you can turn Mario into a statue to make him invincible (hold down and the B button to take effect).  The Frog suit is extremely helpful for the water levels.

Even if you aren't familiar with Ayn Rand, the story is rich, moving, and deeply satisfying. The voice acting, character development, and cutscenes are all of very high quality.*The underwater setting is unique (finally, a game not set on a distant planet, a tropical island, a military base, or some combination of those) and beautifully realized. The music, environmental sounds and Art Deco graphics are all well done and add a lot to the playing experience.*Each level is designed well and contains a fair amount of territory to explore. You are on rails more or less, as in all FPS games, but there is enough freedom to avoid making the game feel oppressively linear.*Overall, the game is not terribly difficult. Boss battles are only slightly harder than fights with generic enemies, for the most part, and there aren't any ridiculously difficult puzzles to solve. The developers focused more on the story and on making all aspects of the game fit together holistically, rather than on trying to come up with mega-challenges for diehard gamers.*Replayability is high, due to the way weapons and powers are earned as well as to the ability to follow different strategies throughout the game. Having said that, BioShock isn't as chock full of hidden features, secret abilities, and obscure actions as Japanese games (the Metal Gear Solid, Silent Hill, and Resident Evil series all come to mind here. And yes, I know SH and RE are survival horror games, not FPS's).*There is some downloadable content available through the online PlayStation Store, but it isn't free. It would have been nice if there was a free teaser or sample to try before committing to buying the downloads.-----Bottom line: despite being a delayed port to the PS3, BioShock is still one of the best games currently available. Anybody who enjoys FPS and action games will dig BioShock. Judged on gameplay mechanics alone, BioShock is a four star game but the stunning graphics, high production values, and outstanding storyline push it to five stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2009"}

Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"","summary":"Payne, Pleasure, and Playability","reviewText":"Having heard about *Payne* since my early Navy days, I went out to Fred Meyer&#65533;s electronic department last Tuesday and bought it. Over two long nights and part of Thursday afternoon, I beat it. Sucked in from the moment I saw the box art, I refused to escape this game. With few exceptions, four years of development show in *Max Payne*.Produced by 3D Realms, *Max Payne* is a third-person shoot through a noir-choked New York City. Finnish developer Remedy follows the standard set by Valve to immerse the game in an actual plot, bloody and surreal. We begin with our hero at the end of a vengeful rampage, and his reflections are the game. One fine American day, Detective Payne comes home in time to hear drug-crazed loonies shoot his wife and child. He hunts each intruder down, but too late. Payne joins his buddy Alex in the DEA. The killers had flown high on Valkyr, a new designer drug, and after three hard years the pair finally discovers the prime dealers&#65533;a debased and savage crime syndicate. But the break bursts bigger than anyone could imagine: hitmen ambush Max and Alex during a subway meeting. Max survives, but somebody out there is determined, powerful, and sadistic: Max is quickly framed for killing his own friend. As a terrible blizzard sets over New York, cold rage sets on Max. His enemies think he is trapped and helpless&#65533;they only free his trigger finger&#65533;As the player, I turn Payne&#65533;s predicament into an opportunity for revenge. But not all is grit and gloom. *Payne* parodies itself along the way, relieving its own pain through the medicine of laughter. Much of the story unfolds in a wonderfully dark and sour graphic novel. Frozen in pictures made to resemble watercolor panels, actors pose comically, goofy expressions across their faces. Voice acting accompanies the novel scenes with such delicious ham I wanted to eat it. As the voice of pain himself, James McCaffrey deadpans morbid metaphor after sanguine simile after killer comeback. After criticizing the insanity of a mob boss, Payne broods, &#65533;But who was I to talk&#65533;an underdog avenger alone against an empire of evil, out to right a grave injustice?&#65533; In the action itself, the player will stumble across nods to *Pulp Fiction*, *Die Hard*, *Lethal Weapon*, *Batman*, *The Punisher*, and *The Killer*. Foes scream hysterically as they die. And wisely borrowing from *No One Lives Forever*, Remedy peppers the game with the conversations of its guards, like &#65533;Why are vampire movies always set in LA? They can&#65533;t get a suntan!&#65533;All of this humor works against the very un-funny circumstance of Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome. One must actually play through Payne&#65533;s nightmares and hallucinations; the experience is as frightening as any horror movie. But filling the hole of a dead wife and child is a revenge-sodden plot, with the contrast between humor and horror keeping the atmosphere balanced.Play is balanced as much as plot. Every time the game is booted up, the player has the option of customizing performance: textures, decals, sounds and frames. The software is also apparently able to recognize when the player cuts through the opposition like Death&#65533;s scythe, and when the opposition crumples the player-scythe like tinfoil. The stamina and aim of everybody is accordingly adjusted. *Payne* provides no armor, but introduces a Sam Peckinpah-style slow motion to give the player a stunt edge. Named after a special effect in *The Matrix*, this &#65533;bullet time&#65533; allows Max to shoot and dodge in slow motion, but aim in real time. Speaking of bullets, *Payne* bristles with contemporary crime movie weapons, including: Ingram M11s, Beretta 92s, and sawed-off shotguns straight out of *The Untouchables*. No bazookas, BFGs, or similar and unnecessary anti-tank weapons exist. Each level is exotic, moody-- and yet realistic (a multilevel parking garage has fluorescent lights and white-washed walls straight out of Navy boot camp&#65533;ugh). *Payne&#65533;s* puzzles and mazes are simple, subtle, and justified&#65533; with snowstorms and mob wars keeping things in perspective.A proper perspective recognizes quirks as well as qualities. Despite four years to perfect it, a few noticeable flaws prevent *Max Payne* from receiving my five-star approval. Max can crouch, but he cannot creep&#65533;instead he automatically stands up and jogs. This makes things easier on the level designer, but harder on Max when he steps around a doorframe and gets shot in the face. Max also doesn&#65533;t climb anything other than stairs, which again benefits the designer more than Max. While Payne is obviously meant to be a lone-wolf, it would have added to the suspension-of-belief if the levels were populated with friendly New York bums, bartenders, and bus drivers hiding from the snow. Finally, some of the levels felt a lot like those in Raven&#65533;s *Soldier of Fortune*, but given the location, I think the similarities are unavoidable.Strangest of all to me is the content-line Remedy seems to have drawn for itself. No child should play Max Payne as it is, but the game is not nearly as explicit as many classics. The bloody chum found in *Quake*, *Half-Life*, and *Soldier of Fortune* puts Payne to shame. Swearing limits mostly to blasphemies, as *Payne* avoids words even network television slips in. While Max investigates houses, we see just one prostitute, and one gambler. *Duke Nukem 3D* has more pornography, foul language, and gore in the first two levels of the shareware version than all of *Payne*. The only illegal drug mentioned or seen is the fictional Valkyr.But I can easily understand if content is traded for style or performance (or both). Remedy&#65533;s *Max Payne* provides active and balanced story and game-play. Its faithful film-noir atmosphere makes the player imagine more grit than is actually shown. Only it&#65533;s neglect of a few basics prevent a full rating. Now if you&#65533;ll excuse me, I do believe its &#65533;bullet-time!\" (groan).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2001"}

It will save you money over time.  The wireless controller of the XB360 can go through a set (2) of AA batteries in about two week's time, if you play heavily.This is a well-designed and attractive product.  The color of the unit matches the color of the 360 perfectly.  It is an excellent addition to your collection of accessories for your 360.I bought one of these units and tested it.  It worked as advertised.  The performance of the battery pack is better than a set of rechargeable NiMH (1600 mAH) from Rayovac.  However, the battery pack did not perform as well as a set of Energizer Alkalines.  The Alkalines lasted slightly longer than the Microsoft battery pack.I was not surprised that the pack lasted longer than the rechargeable AA.  Microsoft even stated that rechargeable batteries should not be used in the controllers.  I suspect this is due to the fact that typical nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries are 1.2 volts.  Whereas disposable alkaline batteries are 1.5 volts.  Even in my Logitech wireless controller, for my PS2, the rechargeables do not last nearly as long as disposable alkalines.Should you buy this Microsoft Quick Charge kit?  Would you be better off buying a set of regular AA rechargeable batteries and a good charger?I can tell you that a typical Rayovac battery charger will recharge a set of AA batteries faster than this kit can recharge its battery pack.  And if you shop around, it will also become obvious that two rechargeable AAs and a recharger will cost you slightly less than the purchase price of this Quick Charge kit.  And, as C. Johnson stated in his review further down, you can use your rechargeables for other devices, like a digital camera.  So, in terms of versatility and applicability to various applications, you cannot beat a set of rechargeable AAs.  However, a set of NiMH AAs will not give you the same performance as this battery pack.  And, if you are like me, I want to keep all of my video gaming equipment together, in one place.  I prefer not to share my video game console's accessories with other devices.I make part of my living as a computer technician.  Because I own a lot of equipment that require AA batteries, I buy my alkaline batteries in bulk.  And I only own one controller for my 360.  I am also a solitary gamer.  Because of that situation, I gave my Quick Charge kit to my best friend, who is also a technician.  He has three controllers.  He is also a social gamer.  Therefore, he has a greater need for this product.  At this point, I am back to using disposable alkalines for my controller.I consider the Microsoft Quick Charge kit to be a luxury accessory for your XBox 360.  It is not necessary, for most people.  And there are cheaper ways of avoiding the cost of disposable alkalines.  However, this is a very neat and tidy solution.  And, if you are one of those gamers who somehow managed to break your controller's original battery holder, then this is a very, very good option for you.I can also recommend this Quick Charge kit for parents.  This will save you from having to make a trip to the convenience store on a Saturday afternoon.  Picture this scenario.  Your child has company over, and they are playing a game on the XBox.

I've been playing it since the moment it got home, and it is truly a GREAT follow-up to the GTA3 blockbuster.The premise is simple. Think Miami Vice. You're in Vice City, lots of cocaine dealers, the Italians want to get involved. You've just gotten out of prison and are sent down to get the 'family' presence known.Your first job goes wrong and everyone is killed. Now you have to get the cash and drugs back for the family. As your reputation grows, more and more people want you to work for them.The game is just classic. From the low-resolution intro screen to the GREAT music from Judas Priest to Michael Jackson to Bryan Adams, this is a BLAST for anyone over 25 who remembers these years. Younger players will enjoy it too but might miss all the great references!The improvements over GTA3 are numerous. You get motorcycles now, complete with appropriate body leanings. Mopeds too! There are seaplanes, boats and helicopters. Even golf carts! You'll see some of your favorite cars from GTA3 (including the BF Injection) plus many new ones. In addition to a gun shop you also have a tool shop for those who dislike firearms.The dialogue is just *classic*, although they went a BIT heavy with every other swear being a reference to the male sex organ. In the REAL Miami Vice, they had a bit more imagination! Still, that is probably my only complaint in a game that is incredibly rich. The graphics are improved. The radio stations are AMAZING. Yes, this is NOT for kids. But for any adult, this is an amazingly fun way to spend many, many hours!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

The gameplay is what really matters though, and that's where Doom III really shines.What's amazing is how the pacing and immersive environment completely suck you into the game.  I am an adult male and I have played every major FPS released in the last 5 years.  This game is truly a personal cinematic experience.  While graphics alone never make a game great, when combined with great gameplay, both create a trule immersive, and terrifying, game.  I don't really like being scared, nervous, or apprehensive in a game, but Doom III makes me all three and I keep me coming back for more.This is far from a run and gun game.  Unlike other shooters, you don't have relentless numbers of enemies thrown at you to the point of being numbed.  Instead, enemies are used more sparingly - you never know when, or from where, the next enemy will come.  Nothing is more creepy than lighting up a pitch-black room with your flashlight and catching a glimpse of a zombie walking towards you.  True, you cannot equip a weapon and your flashlight at the same time, and while that initially irritated me, I realized what a brilliant game contrivance it was.  You have to choose to see or shoot in darkened areas - its make for great suspense and mood.

{"product_name":"B0050SXGU8","description":"","reviewerName":"Citysmash","summary":"Let's be honest here: It's good, but not great","reviewText":"It seems like that CEO guy from Crytek is always talking up a storm.  First he claims that the PS3 and 360 are not powerful enough, and a next gen console needs to arrive soon (this was 2 years ago).  Then he says that the latest Crysis game engine will be the best FPS engine available for a long time (that was last year).  Okay, all politics aside, the I've played and beaten the single player campaign, gave the multi-player a chance as well and can say without a doubt...that this game as a whole is just average.The graphics of the game have a lot of visual effects in them (lighting & weather comes to mind), but the frame rates are always 30 fps or below.  The story and NPC dialog is abundant in this game...probably too much so, and there are really horrible timing gaps with the way Psycho delivers his lines (I know they were added for dramatic effect, but really fell flat and looked unrealistic to me).  I felt like I was only playing this game half the time, and was forced to watch game play out in cut-scenes and in game dialogue the rest of the time.  Add to the fact that this game only lasted only about 6-7 hours in the single player campaign, there's not really a good reason (for YOU the lucky person who is reading this review) to buy this game.Gameplay wise, I had a blast fighting the aliens, their movements were quick, random and left me sweating bullets every time I had to face them.  The humans on the other hand, are slower than a ton of bricks, but for some reason have such unbelievably magnificent bionic eye sight I felt like I was wearing a bright florescent yellow jumpsuit while walking around in the jungle.Trying out the multi-player section, I see the strong resemblance of this game to COD, but with this game having worse frame rates and larger levels, I forsee all of the cloak campers snipers taking over the servers in a couple of months.  After a few hours of giving this portion of the game a chance, it's clear that this game component won't be really popular with the console players (although the PC's players will probably have a ball with this).My recommendation is to rent it, beat the campaign, and return it the next day.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2013"}

I don't like gyms. I don't like long hikes and bicycle rides in the muggy hot sun during the dog days of summer.So here's the reason I gave Wii Fit four stars.

{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Brendan Ross","summary":"First Impressions: It's the BioWare MMO","reviewText":"My main first impression, a little more than ten hours in and around level 13, is that this is \"the BioWare MMO\".What I mean by that is that if you are used to playing BioWare's games (particularly the more recent titles like Dragon Age or Mass Effect, but even also the older KOTOR series), you'll find that this game plays mostly like a BioWare game with MMO elements -- it's basically a BioWare storyline game stiched together with MMO elements.  Whether you like this or not will depend on the degree to which you like the BioWare approach to game design, with its strong emphasis on storytelling, cinematic cut-scenes with interactive dialogue, choice-driven character development, and the like.I have always liked BioWare's games, and so these elements are welcome in an MMO experience for me.  Gameplay is also what you would expect in a BioWare game (in my opinion):  good, but fairly \"standard\".  In my opinion, BioWare does not design its games around gameplay, but around storyline and setting, and gameplay is intended to be engaging, but essentially to forward the story line in an interactive way.  TOR is no different from this general approach.  The gameplay, in terms of nuts and bolts, is very similar to what you have in other \"theme park\" style MMORPGs -- quest hubs, leveling advancement, training/banking/trading hubs, leveled zones and the like.  It is all done competently in TOR, with remarkably few glitches, but the gameplay isn't revolutionary, new, groundbreaking or anything like that -- it's standard, good, gameplay for the genre which is used to advance you along the storyline with its many interactive cinematic scenes.What does this mean for potential players?  One point is that if you are a veteran MMO fan, looking for something that is new and groundbreaking in terms of the actual gameplay elements, this isn't going to be it.  What is new and groundbreaking about TOR is the interweave of the BioWare elements of storyline and interactive cinematics and dynamic character development, rather than actual gameplay mechanics.  I think that quite a few of the people who are liking the game less fall into this category of people who are MMO vets and \"want something new\" from the perspective of gameplay mechanics, and find that TOR is a competent iteration of familiar gameplay mechanics for a theme park MMO, but with a lot of the elements from BioWare's single player game design ideas woven in.It also means that if you are a big fan of BioWare's single player games, you'll probably like this MMO more than most, due to its emphasis on many of the same elements that BioWare has introduced and emphasized in its single player titles.  Having said that, because it is an MMORPG which has to have a lot of other elements involved, the storyline and cinematics and so on are not at the same level -- in my opinion -- as what we have grown used to in, say, the Mass Effect series.  In other words, it isn't a single player game.  It's an MMORPG \"chassis\" stitched together with BioWare's game design ideas from its single player games, but done in such a way that they \"fit\" in the context of an MMORPG.Where this game goes remains to be seen.  It's solid, not very buggy or glitchy, and has a huge pre-existing fanbase both for the setting/IP and for the developer, and is fairly easy to pick up and play.  That confluence of factors hasn't aligned this way in the MMORPG world since .... WoW.  We've had games made for great IPs that didn't turn out to be great games (STO, AoC, WAR), and we've had games made by respected developers that didn't turn out very well, too, but this kind of confluence hasn't happened in a while.  We will have to see where it goes as the game develops over the course of the next several months.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2011"}

When it was first being developed as True Crime Hong Kong I had ZERO interest in it; it looked like just another GTA clone in an Asian setting but after seeing some reviews of the combat system and how the series played like an homage to classic Hong Kong flicks (in much the same way Red Dead Redemption does with westerns) I was really looking forward to it.And it does not disappointIt as if the designers took the best elements of recent games and infused them with the Hong Kong vibe, where the city itself comes alive and becomes a character unto itself. The mini games, side missions and overall plot might not the most original, but they seemed perfectly balanced and fun,  and I just couldn't wipe the simile off my face while playing karaoke, betting some money on cock fighting, or getting my street creed up in the local fight clubs. Speaking of fights the combat mechanics are just a notch below the Arkham games and it's as fast and fun as those games. The same could be said by the exclent driving, where you really feel the rush of speed in chasing missions, armed escorts or my personal favorite where you get to hijack enemy vehicles by leaping from car to car. It includes a lot of side missions, collectibles and upgrades m and maybe if I were a fan of this style of game this would all be a bit tired and true, but to me it felt fresh and insanely fun.This is a great labor of love for its design team, with great DLC (like the Enter the Dragon based Zodiac Tournament) and constant updates, so if you are a fan of Arkham series, GTA titles or Hong Kong culture you owe it to yourself to buy this, believe me you won't regret it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002BS47TE","reviewerName":"D. K. Malone","summary":"Metal Gear Solid: Weak Sauce","reviewText":"First off I admit that I have issues with handheld games in general. No matter how subjectively good a handheld game is, the fact that it's on a handheld is a handicap in my eyes. And I know I'm not alone. There are tons of gamers like me who are simply far more comfortable playing on a big screen, holding a controller. (Or sitting in front of a PC.) It probably goes back to my childhood, when handheld games were the bottom of the barrel. If you wanted to play a real game you went to an arcade, the next best thing was playing on an Atari or Intellivision console connected to your TV, and if that was out of reach then you played crummy little handheld games with little LED blips that didn't even technically qualify as graphics. Those are the roots of handhelds in my mind. For me there is simply no denying that handheld games are intrinsically gimped. Bringing a console franchise to handheld requires unavoidable sacrifice, and for me personally, the gimping simply isn't worth it. Still, I'm a hopelessly addicted gamer so I keep buying handhelds and games to play on them. Every once in a while I'll find one that overcomes the handicap and makes it all worthwhile.Unfortunately MGS Peace Walker is not one of those games. I was leery from the moment it was announced, because I figured it was going to be Portable Ops 2. Thankfully, it's isn't THAT bad. But it isn't too far from it. I got PW the day it came out and played it for about four hours. For me, that's generally more than enough time to adapt to a new game's controls and start to feel comfortable. But PW just felt annoying to play with its castrated control scheme, some of the characters immediately got on my nerves, the sloppy smeared comic book style cut scenes struck me as eye sores, the game play being broken up into tiny little bite-size chunks was very unsatisfying, the bosses were ponderous chores, and after realizing that using \"auto-assign\" on the Mother Base staff was working against me I soon learned that managing the staff manually was a complete bore... I just wasn't enjoying it, so I dropped it and forgot all about it. A little over a year later it was included in the PS3 HD collection. I still wasn't interested, but after playing through MSG2 and MGS3 I figured \"Why not?\" It was marginally more enjoyable playing it as \"a real game,\" and I did manage to stay with it long enough to see the credits. But I still thought it was close to being the worst game in the MGS series, second only to Portable Ops. After MGSV plot details started coming to light and I learned to my horror that it was basically Peace Walker 2, and after being inspired by Ground Zeroes, I managed to force myself to go back and truly finish Peace Walker, i.e. do all of the post credits stuff in order to see the \"true\" ending.I admit, I like it a little better now than I did before. If I'd bothered to review it back in 2010, I would have given it two stars.The one thing that really chaps my hind about Peace Walker (and MGSV) is that they hired Robin Atkin Downes to play the role of Miller. The guy gives the most generic and banal performances in all of voice acting, he only knows one note and I don't understand why he keeps getting hired.

Bad Fur Day came out towards the end of the N64's life, right about the time Nintendo was starting up the Gamecube hype machine. So it would be understandable if you have never heard of the game. Not learning from their previous mistake, Rare released Live & Reloaded at a similar time in the Xbox's life when everyone's attention was on the Xbox 360. So once again it was overlooked by most, which is unfortunate considering that Conker: Live & Reloaded is not only one of the finest platformers ever created, but it is also quite possibly the funniest game ever made.You play as the entire game as Conker, a small red squirrel with an alcohol addiction. After a night of partying and heavy drinking, he tries to stumble his way home to his girlfriend, but wakes up to find himself lost. He sets off to find his way home, but can't seem to get anywhere without getting in a bunch of trouble. You won't believe what happens to him all in the span of one day.The gameplay is similar to some of the other great platformers like Donkey Kong 64 or Rare's Banjo-Kazooie. As you would expect, you will be jumping, smashing, shooting, and solving puzzles for all of the games 12 or so hours of gameplay. The game also makes good use of context sensitive action, something the original game was one of the first to do. You basically walk over certain pads and press a button to do any number of certain things. A few of the boss battles make good use of that mechanic, requiring you to use them to win. It seems pretty basic now but when the game came out it was pretty new. The third person shooting action controls great and some of the later stages of the game feel as if you are playing a 3rd person shooter.There are a few negative things that you could say about the gameplay though. For a good part of the game, your only weapon that you have is a baseball bat. So combat will basically boil down to running up to an opponent, whacking them, and then jumping out of the way to dodge their counter attack. But then again, the game doesn't focus much on this type of combat. The only people you will be whacking are those that are walking around the environment that are in your way while you are going about your business. The main focus of the game is solving puzzles, jumping around, and boss battles. And when you get to the later portion of the game, you will have weapons and even vehicles which will make this a non-issue. Also, there are one or two sections of the game that are pretty difficult, such as a race over some lava while dodging dinosaurs that will probably take you 5 or so attempts to finish. But overall, these are just minor complaints that should not hinder your enjoyment of the game much.The world of Conker is great. Instead of feeling like a bunch of separate self contained levels, all of the areas of the game are connected and you can usually pick the order in which you want to do things. The massive graphical upgrade the game got really helps make the world feel alive. The environments are very detailed, and the fur on the characters looks awesome. Conker: Live & Reloaded is easily one of the best looking games on the Xbox. The graphical style of the game is similar to that of Kameo for the Xbox 360 with lots of lush settings and cute characters that cover up some pretty brutal and mature gameplay.What sets the game apart from other platformers is its great sense of humor. Some of its humor comes in the form of crude jokes, but most of it comes from parody. For example, there are a few sequences in the game that parody movies like The Matrix or Saving Private Ryan. Surprisingly, these sequences are still pretty funny even though those movies came out quite a while ago. Other parts of the game, like the entire sequence when you battle the Mightypoo, are so outrageous and crude that you can't help but laugh. The dialog in the game is also well written with a lot of humor, but obviously intended for a mature audience.After you finish the game's excellent single player campaign, there is a whole new online component that Rare created. The multiplayer games are large scale class based battles with vehicles. Matches pit the Tediz against the Squirrels in a variety of scenarios. If you can imagine a smaller but more action packed Battlefield 2 then you should have a good idea about how it plays. Some of the matches are set to a World War 2 theme where the Squirrels play as the Allies and the Tediz play as the Nazis, while other matches are set in the future. All of them are a blast to play, making the online extremely addicting.Overall, Conker: Live & Reloaded is an extremely fun game. If you never played the single player game before, Conker will offer some of the best platforming gameplay out there. If you have played the old game before, the updated graphics and the whole new addicting multiplayer component makes the game worth buying over again. Every Xbox (and Xbox 360) owner that enjoys platforming games should check out Conker: Live & Reloaded.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2006"}

McBeth \"PSN/XLive/Steam: DirkPittSpawn\"","summary":"Only thing missing from this game is the funny title that usually goes with the series","reviewText":"Background: I started a long time ago with the Ratchet and Clank series on the PS2, played all of those and made the jump to the \"Future\" series when it came to PS3. I've also played All 4 One and Full Frontal. I've enjoyed the stories of each, but definitely missed the classic feel of R&C; from the \"standard\" titles. When I started playing this one, it really felt like the R&C; experience that I have been accustomed to.Basics: The gameplay feels like it should, and the visuals have definitely been improved since last. The worlds, water, and effects are all there and look spectacular. The effects of the weapons are definitely my favorite. Leveling a weapon definitely changes it a little each time, while the upgrades that you can choose are a nice kicker as you earn raritanitum to spend. While the game isn't as long as Going Commando / Up Yer Arsenal / Future-series, you'll definitely want to play again on Challenge mode to unlock the 2nd tier for the weapons and the difficulty level is much greater on the hardest difficulty (Cadet- Hero-Legend).Faves: The weapons by far are my favorite. There are a couple VERY unique weapons, while most of the weapons are versions of previous R&C; weapons, they're all very fun to use and level/upgrade them up. Mr. Zurkon brings the whole family this time, and the \"morph\" type weapon of this game is the Winterizer - changes enemies into snowmen, and once you've upgraded it, they will explode and turn into holiday packages.Recommendation: Definitely play this one if you've been anxious for a return to the regular R&C; adventure formula that works so well. The story is of the same caliber as the full titles and the lower pricetag reflects this. I would say definitely pick this up and play through a couple of times if you're a R&C; fan and want to continue the story.Update: Definitely play the game on Legend / Challenge Mode. It makes the game that much tougher, and really where the game takes off. Challenge mode also allows for the \"Platinum\" cup in Destructapalooza. I'd recommend playing through once on Hero and get all the weapons to Level 3 (Maxed out) before starting Challenge mode, which allows for all the weapons to their true max of Level 6. I got the RYNO last night, and it is always a treat when you unlock that in a R&C; game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2013"}

In desperation, the Soviets created a time-travel device that they've used to assassinate Albert Einstein before he is able to develop the weapon technology the Allies later use to defeat the Soviets. Upon returning, they notice a new world, and there is a world war taking place between three groups for control of the world.Play As Three Different Factions for Varied game playIn Red Alert 3, you have the choice to play as the Allies, the Soviets, or the Empire of the Rising Sun. Each faction has its own story-line and distinct units with advantages and disadvantages that you have to master in order to win. The new faction to the series is the Empire of the Rising Sun, derived from Imperial Japan, with an all-new cast of units and characters.The three factions have many differences, exemplified by their wildly different types of units. The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas. As they've done with the series, EA injects humor into the game when possible, keeping a smile on your face as you wage war.Fight on Land, in the Air, and on SeaRed Alert 3 has land units, air units, and naval units, all integral parts of the game. Unlike most strategy games that don't bother with naval warfare, Red Alert 3 makes controlling the seas an essential part of the game. Controlling resources in the seas and mounting attacks from all directions are strategies that must be employed to achieve victory.Cooperative Mode Lets You Team Up with Your FriendsRed Alert 3 has a fully co-operative campaign mode where you and a friend can play together to achieve victory. This means that you have to develop a strategy together, as well as execute it in synch in order to win. If your friends aren't online, you can also choose one of several AI commanders as your teammate.Play Against Your Friends in MultiplayerWith the different units and play mechanics of each faction, you and your friends will have a great time playing against each other, perfecting different strategies to best suit the units you have and the maps you play on. And thanks to the balanced game play, no one will have an unfair advantage.For previous fans of Command and Conquer, Red Alert 3 will provide the same light-hearted game play, but with more units, more strategies, and more fun.

So what's an authorization? The first time you actually run the game on a machine, we will authorize that machine. If you reach the authorization limit, the game will not run on a new machine. If you make major changes to the computer (switching out multiple pieces of hardware, install a new OS, etc.) you might need to reauthorize the machine.\"What they don't mention here is that a \"major change\" to your computer can be quite a bit less than changing out multiple pieces of hardware. In fact, changing a keyboard, mouse, or joystick or any number of USB devices could be regarded as a \"major change\". Upgrading drivers for you sound or video card might be a major change. The rules are not defined and you will not know for sure what may or may not use up an authorization.So if you use up all of your Authorizations? Electronic Arts says:\"Just give us a call...If you had a run of bad luck, some hardware failures, a botched OS install, your notebook was stolen, you spilled a coke on your keyboard - you get the idea - and all five of your authorizations have been used up, just give us a call.

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Julian Pope","summary":"A Revolution in Motion Gaming","reviewText":"When the Nintendo Wii first came out, it was so popular that for the first few months you would be hard pressed to find a single one on any store shelf anywhere. As of January 2014 over 100 million units have been sold worldwide. That's almost 1 Wii per every 3 people in the US. Why was the Wii so popular? The answer is simple. The Wii appeals to everyone. Most of all, the Wii appeals to families. Their entire marketing scheme was based around the fact that the Wii is fun for the whole family and easy to use by all. Some of the ads even had grandma's playing the game console!The biggest negative point, and my only con, of this console was that it was being released in the HD era but not in HD, right before the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, both of which ran games in HD while the PS3 even had a Blu-ray drive. Therefore, the consoles resolution and frame rate would not be able to exceed 480p and 60 fps and it plays neither Blu-Rays nor DVDs but does offer video streaming services such as Netflix. Perhaps the Wii's best and most appealing feature is it's motion sensing technology. Being able to use the Wii remote as a baseball bat or tennis racket gives you a feeling that you are actually IN the game, no other console offered anything like this at the time. Nintendo's evolution from the standard candy bar style controller from the NES and SNES days to the Nintendo 64 and Gamecube controllers took a step back to the simpler build and it worked perfectly. This design allows games to be played on the Wii remote by pointing the remote at the screen, or simply turning it sideways. There is also several accessories that can be used in conjunction with the Wii remote such as the nunchuck, which has a separate analog stick and can be held in one hand while the remote is held in the other, and even a Classic Controller, which much resembles that of the Super Nintendo.The console is quite easy to set up, the sound the Wii produces is decent but it is certainly feels like it is held back by it's lack of High-definition support. The user interface is incredibly easy to use, all you do is point and click, similar to using a computer and mouse.The Wii offered lots of Nintendo's great, classic gaming characters in fun games but it felt like something was missing. It wasn't until the Wii U was released that it became apparent that what was missing was the upgrade in resolution. The best thing about the original Wii by far was that it opened the door for family gaming, easily allowing anyone to pick up a remote and join in on a game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2014"}

People just love/hate this game like no other, but I believe it still sells as the #1 sports game doesn't it?  They say sales are down, but it's been 1 or 2 on Amazon's bestsellers list for a while now.I think it's solid.  The graphics have been brightened and they are superb, the cut scenes, and the presentation is the best it's ever been, and honestly I've hated the presentation forever, but this year it's a huge improvement.  The locomotion is a welcome addition and gameflow is a nice addition as well with one caviot...  Quicker, faster, deeper, means you have to make your adjustments on defense much faster.  Ian Cummings, the lead DEV, said they are considering some changes but have to make sure any change balances out.  Honestly the quicker adjusting on defense is the #1 negative for me about the game.  Many times it's hiked and I've done half my adjustments.Offense is much easier, running is easier and much more satisfying, because of these things, defense is at a huge disadvantage.  Online teamplay is a nice change of pace, but to me I prefer single player, because everyone wants the ball, and everytime I passed to them they dropped it.  When I passed to the default guys I dominated, but my teamates are morons usually, so I just dominate on my own and they quit, lol.  I don't want them to take me down.Games are now 7 minutes online.  That's rough IMO, because to me that means the better player will usually win every time.  For Madden lifers they love this, but I'm not one of them, so I'm average and I can't ball control as much as I'd like because the game is 8 minutes longer.  I beat who I'm supposed to beat but it's hard for me to get upsets which is what I live for.Superstar & Online Franchise weren't touched, they'll be dealt with next year they said.If you haven't got Madden in a while I recommend Madden 11.  This Madden is much more of a pick up and play than ever because of the offense is easier and gameflow is your defualt playbook that picks the plays for you, or you can adjust it to your liking , and you finish slightly sooner because of it.  If you got Madden 10 last year, I'd pass.  Many consider Madden 10 the best Madden.  Downside to 10 will be weaker presentation, slightly weaker graphics, and older rosters.Lastly as many have said, you have to buy this NEW unless you want to pay $10 for the online code EA now requires used.  I got lucky, no one used my code I got it used two weeks after the games release.The strategy pad (the bar that allows you to make all the adjustments) is supposed to be patched to give players the option of last years strategy pad.  If so Madden 11 is a 9, if not it's an 8.  Last years game was an 8 as well.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2010"}

{"product_name":"PlayStation 3 40GB System","summary":"Candidate for storage upgrade but better options are available","reviewText":"Necessary disclosure: I do not own this model but do I own the 60GB model, recently upgraded to 320MB. I am also very familiar with the latest 80GB model (which is basically this one with a larger disk) because one of my neighbors has one and I am the neighborhood's unofficial and unpaid 'computer' consultant :). I also did some research in anticipation of us purchasing a second unit because I promised the kids 'their own' if their grades were going to meet a certain standard.As compared to the 60GB model (see this model's pluses and minuses and what all PS3s have in common):______________________________________________+ Less expensive (I paid [....] for my 60GB PS3)+ Amazon Blu-ray movies promotion (buy 4 movies from list and get [...] off through end of 2008)= Wireless Wi-Fi or wired Ethernet network connections= Blue-tooth for controllers, keyboards, earpieces, etc.= Controllers charged via USB wires= Free, unlimited access to the PSN network, including online play= Full PSOne compatibility= Blu-ray/DVD/CD player= HDMI, component video (component wire included)= Surround sound= Internet browser= Allows for installation of third-party operating systems such as Linux= Disk is easily upgradeable without voiding warranty= Quiet operation- 50% less storage- No memory card interfaces- 2 USB ports vs. 4 USB ports on the 60GB- No PS2 compatibility- No chrome trim______________________________________________STORAGE and STORAGE UPGRADE:----------------------------This model comes with an 40GB drive. As crazy as this may sound, this is a pretty good buy IF you are planning to upgrade your storage. On the other hand, DO NOT buy this model if you do not consider upgrading the disk because 40GB won't take you very far. To give you an idea of the amount of storage you may need on your PS3, I recently checked the status of my 320GB disk and I found that I had 198GB free. That means that, less than one year after urchasing my (then) 60GB box I was using 122GB already. The space is taken by family pictures, a little music, lots of demos, many 'disk' games that to dump gigabytes of data to the disk to improve performance, many videos the kids are making with the 'Eye' camera, game saves. I suspect that 'Home', when it becomes available, may require a few more GB's for its own use so 320GB may be what you need if you don't want to constantly worry about managing your disk.An extra [...] would buy you a 320GB drive. I used theWestern Digital WD3200BEVT 320 GB Scorpio Sata 5400 Rpm 8MB 2.5 inchmyself. 1TB drives are available these days for a few $$ more and you should try to get one of those if you are planning to store lots of videos. The nice thing about upgrading your disk is that you are also going to be left with a perfectly good 40GB drive which you can place into a cheap enclosure, and theStarTech AT2510U2 InfoSafe 2.5-Inch USB/SATA Hard Drive Enclosureworked for me. I'd be using the 40GB drive as a backup device for family photos. Digital, of course.Upgrading the disk is (relatively) easy and you can find a lot of advice if you Google for it. Try first Googling \"PlayStation 3 Hard Drive Upgrade (HOWTO)\" for a nice video so you'll decide if you are comfortable. If upgrading is the first thing you do, everything becomes very easy because you need not worry about backups or restores. I upgraded my box in a couple of hours WITH the backup/restore steps.MEMORY CARD INTERFACES:-----------------------The lack of memory card interfaces is annoying but you can get around it. Copy your stuff to a USB drive or flash drive and... problem solved. You can then upload your things through the USB. It's somewhat inconvenient but it's no big deal.USB PORTS:----------My old 60GB model has 4 USB ports and I am using all of them. One for the PS3 Eye (camera), a second has a wireless keyboard dongle, the third is where the racing wheel plugs in and the last one I use to charge controllers. Of course, you can and you WILL be able to live with 2 slots but it is likely that you will be doing some plugging/unplugging if you begin adding peripherals. One way around it is to get a USB port multiplexer. Another solution is seek Blue-tooth peripherals (wireless) if you can find them. Blue-tooth keyboards, for example, are available.PS2 COMPATIBILITY:------------------This model does not support PS2 software. Since the original PS2-compatible PS3's are hard to get, this has to be accepted as reality. I assume that Sony, after polling existing and future PS3 users, found that most users don't need PS2 compatibility. Soon after we upgraded to a PS3 my kids were playing Kingdom Hearts and Destroy All Humans but I haven't seen them doing so in quite a while. It is nice to have PS2 compatibility but its lacking would not stop me from buying a PS3.PSOne GAMES:------------The PS3 has full PSOne compatilibity. Lots of them are available for download at the PSN store. They are quite inexpensive and some of them are still fun to play.SUMMARY:--------- Buy this model if you consider upgrading to larger storage and, for whatever reason, you do not want the 40GB MSG4 bundle that comes with a DualShock controller.- If you feel that you can live with 160GB AND then wait for a few more weeks for the 160GB bundle and you won't have to upgrade your storage.- Get yourself a USB port multiplexer if you need more than 2 ports.- Transfer your photos to flash drives to get around the missing memory card interfaces.- Keep your PS2 if you have one and still wish to play PS2 games in the future.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXVK8","description":"","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"What God of War fans without PSPs have been waiting for","reviewText":"The Gods of Olympus may have abandoned Kratos, but they have smiled upon us PS3 gamers who never found it worthwhile to buy PSPs and, as a result, never got to play God of War: Chains of Olympus or God of War: Ghost of Sparta. This review is dedicated to all non-PSP users who have not yet played these games. We've all been missing out my friends... until now. Not only do we finally get to play two great games we didn't have access to before, but we also find out about several plot points in the God of War story that were briefly touched upon in the console games God of War II and God of War III, but never fully explored. Examples include: when Atlas blamed Kratos for chaining him underneath the Earth and leaving him there to carry it on his shoulders when they last met, when Hades cursed Kratos for murdering his wife Persephone, and when Zeus told Gaia that she should not have chosen Kratos to kill him but should have instead chosen the \"other one\". All these loose threads and other questions are dealt with in both Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta.God of War: Chains of Olympus is a prequel that takes place during the 10 year period before the first game in which Kratos is still in the service of the gods so he could be rid of the memories involving the death of his family. Once again returning as the narrator, Gaia begins the tale of Kratos' latest (or technically earliest) adventure and we see our favorite white skinned warrior in Attica fighting against an invading Persian army, as well as a large Basilisk the Persians set loose on the city, which of course serves as the big opening boss. It is during these first few moments of gameplay where most players will probably notice the rather inferior graphics to this game, with less detailed environments and character models, as well as more faded colors compared to even the ones in the first God of War. There are a couple of other negatives, but we'll get to those later. Kratos fights his way through the city, slaying Persian soldiers and their rotund emperor, and after a couple of run-ins with the Basilisk, Kratos has a one-on-one battle with the large, fire-breathing lizard and puts an end to it, saving the city of Attica. Suddenly, the sun falls out of the sky and crashes into the earth. Even Kratos went WTF? when he saw this happen and is soon told by Athena that the sun god Helios and his chariot have somehow been thrown out of the sky, and without the sun god's light every person and god in the world begins to fall under the dark fog of Morpheus. So begins the adventure where Kratos must save the world from Helios' kidnappers that will test his skills as a warrior, as well as his soul. Chains of Olympus thankfully provides players with what we all would expect from a God of War game originally made for the PSP. Kratos will battle somewhat different versions of his classic mythological enemies such as cyclopses, minotaurs, gorgons, satyrs, and some large saber tooth tiger creatures, although the maximum number of different enemy types falls a bit short compared to the other games.There are five boss battles (with one boss being fought twice) and they're all done rather well; the final boss is appropriately epic and challenging. As you would expect, QTEs are implemented to have Kratos rip his enemies apart, open large gates, push down pillars and statues, and of course make the women cry out his name in satisfaction while between the sheets. Also to be expected are the large number of weapons and abilities Kratos gets his hands on. He still wields the original Blades of Chaos, followed by the ability to summon a fiery demon to incinerate surrounding enemies (Efreet), the ability to shoot scorching blasts of light (Light of Dawn), a shield that lets him reflect enemy attacks and projectiles (Sun Shield), a large and powerful gauntlet that can smash enemies and objects (Gauntlet of Zeus), and a mask that can shoot out continuously burning green fire (Charon's Wrath). Fun and challenging puzzles involving lever pulling and statue pushing also return to make up the rest of the gameplay. One little negative point about the game aside from the toned down graphics are how some button prompts that pop up on the screen when Kratos is killing enemies will appear late or not at all (though thankfully not too often), or when Kratos slightly oversteps a save point or a point of interaction the accompanying button prompt will disappear. The game will also pause at times right before a cutscene starts. These are rather minor annoyances that in the end are all acceptable considering this was first made on the PSP, so taking into account what the developers had to work with, they did an awesome job transferring the great story, gameplay, and controls of this game to the PS3. God of War: Chains of Olympus just doesn't quite make it to the same level of overall greatness achieved by the other games in the series, but it's mostly because of the smaller enemy variety and the fact that it's not until halfway through that the story and the gameplay really get into high gear. Make no mistake, this is still a very good God of War game. If I were to rate this game on its own, I'd give it 4 stars overall and 4 stars for fun.God of War: Ghost of Sparta takes place after the first God of War and before God of War II. This game opens with Kratos sitting on his newly acquired throne of the God of War (with Gaia once again narrating), but Kratos' nightmarish memories still haunt his every waking moment. Amidst these memories Kratos also sees visions which are connected to the memories of his mother Callisto and his brother Deimos. The visions tell Kratos that the answers he seeks regarding the fate of his family can be found in the city of Atlantis, so he sets sail to the fabled city against the wishes of Athena. On the way there, his ship is attacked by the undersea monster and opening boss Scylla (which bears more than a passing resemblance to the Cloverfield monster). Kratos' ship is destroyed and as he lands on the shores of Atlantis, he has to deal with repeated encounters with Scylla as well as the trident wielding fish-soldiers of Poseidon, but this is just the first step in Kratos' latest adventure involving tons of bloodshed and action. Ghost of Sparta basically took everything from Chains of Olympus and greatly improved upon it. The graphics look great, they even surpass those of the first God of War and nearly match those of God of War II. A lot of the same types of enemies from Chains of Olympus like minotaurs, cyclopses, satyrs, and undead soldiers appear, as well as some new ones like big walking, armored automatons (robots) and incredibly annoying female wraiths who slash and shriek at Kratos incessantly.There are six boss battles, most of them very epic encounters against large and deadly monsters. To deal with them all Kratos has his trusty Blades of Athena, followed by an amulet that lets him fire a blast of electricity (Eye of Atlantis), a relic that can create small portal rifts that continually damage enemies (Scourge of Erinys), a Spartan spear and shield that can be used to attack enemies up close and at a distance (Arms of Sparta), and a horn that can create a freezing gust of wind (Horn of Boreas). Kratos also gets the ability to charge his blades with volcanic fire that causes extra fire damage on enemies and can be used to destroy armored enemies and obstacles (Thera's Bane); this ability has its own regenerating meter separate from the magic meter. The combat and quick time events have been given that extra bit of oomph that was somewhat lacking in Chains of Olympus, whether it's during one of Kratos' many past times like slicing up enemies, opening big doors, or making the beast with two backs (or in this case, multiple backs). There are noticeably less puzzles in this game compared to all the other ones. Kratos still pushes around many blocks and pulls many levers, but they're mostly straightforward affairs simply to reach higher ledges or open large gates. The headscratching puzzles that appear here and there in the other games, such as moving specific statues to specific spots to reflect beams of light to a certain point or pushing blocks together into a sort of jigsaw puzzle formation, are all pretty much absent in this game. I'm sure some of you guys will not like the removal of these puzzles and others might even be happy: I personally don't love it or hate it, but it was somewhat refreshing. It makes Ghost of Sparta more of a non-stop thrill ride, since between all the combat and platforming we get certain set-pieces involving Kratos using his blades to slide down steep cliffs and timing a jump to a distant platform or even a boss character. On its own, God of War: Ghost of Sparta would get 5 stars overall and 5 stars for fun; it's definitely a contender with the other console God of War games.Here's what we've got: TWO great God of War games that come with what we all would expect from God of War, as well as some new touches here and there, not to mention answers to all the questions left over from the three main games. Even the extras from the other games like combat arenas and challenges come with this godly package. And we get all of this for just $40.00 right off the bat. If you haven't gotten in on this already, then you are NOT a true God of War fan. Before Kratos lays his vengeance upon you, pick this up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2011"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Terrible, supremely disappointing","reviewText":"In the wake of the revolutionary Grand Theft Auto 3, there were a horde of pretender games released that couldn't come close to GTA's audacity and style.  True Crime: Streets of LA was actually one game that came close in this sense, which is why this sequel, True Crime: New York City, was so looked forward to.  However, not only is this game supremely disappointing, it's almost unplayable.  At first glance the game looks slick enough, but once you engage in the game's storyline and horrible dialogue along with the unbelievably choppy frame rate, you'll wonder how this ever got released.  The story of the game is you play as Marcus; an undercover cop looking to clean up the streets, one way or another.  No matter which route you take: good cop or bad cop, it's going to be hard to get past the fuzzy graphics, the clunky controls, the derivative gameplay, the inane collision detection, and bugs that plague True Crime: New York City throughout the game.  There's hardly anything good worth noting about True Crime, other than a somewhat decent soundtrack (featuring punk favorites the Misfits as well as the godfather of ghoul rock Danzig, and naturally plenty of hip-hop, ugh...) and a surprisingly solid cast of actors supplying their voices (including Christopher Walken, Laurence Fishburne, Mickey Rourke, and Mariska Hargitay among others) who are sadly wasted with the cliche dialogue.  Also, it should be noted that the game will crash randomly, a lot.  It's a wonder how this game ever got past quality control, but then again, I guess everyone's got to make a quick buck these days.  Do yourself a favor; stick with GTA, any GTA for that matter, even the original one for the PS1.  Just whatever you do, leave this game on the shelf.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2005"}

All three races share the same basic gameplay, though there are some differences in units and technologies. The basic gameplay is based on planets and their gravity well; each planet acts as a \"base\" of sorts that can be upgraded on the planet itself with infrastructure improvements or reinforced with structures built in orbit like defense platforms and construction facilities. Each planet has a gravity well where ships can move around and engage in combat; traveling between planets causes ships to automatically enter faster-than-light speed once they're out of the planet's gravity well.There isn't a lot of specific customization you can do on planets (all building construction takes place in orbit), but there are important things you can do on them nonetheless. Improving the infrastructure of the planet increases the amount of taxes that you get from that planet, and also the loyalty of the planet's citizens. It's also possible to explore the planet to look for resources or artifacts hidden on it. The structures that can be built in orbit range from defense platforms to mining outposts to ship construction yards to trade posts to research stations. Defense platforms, like gauss or missile launchers, have a certain radius and are placed around your planet; due to the size of the gravity well around the planet, you have to consider which trade lanes the enemies will come from when placing your platforms. Mining outposts harvest two of the three resources in the game - metal and crystal (the third being credits, gained by taxation) - from asteroids around the planet. Construction yards are your basic unit-building stations, and can build whatever you've researched. Trade posts generate credits depending on how many of your planets are linked up with them. Finally, research stations (either civic or military) affect how much research you can do - the more stations you have, the more advanced your research can get. Research has four types - civilian (affects planets and buildings), military (affects units that can be created and bonuses they receive), fleet (affects experience and maximum amounts of ships), and artifact (grants special bonuses if you receive alien artifacts).Combat in the game is two-dimensional, and doesn't take advantage of the \"space\" concept like Homeworld did, which is a major disappointment. Rather than a strategy game, the combat feels more like an assortment of numbers stacking up against each other. Ships can't maneuver particularly well, so in most cases the battle strategy consists of lines of ships shooting at each other. The only real thing you can try to do is maneuver toward your planetary defenses so that they'll be shooting your enemies as well. The only real thing that makes this acceptable is the intended size of battles and the number of battles that can be going on simultaneously once your empire expands. It's easy to keep track of ships due to the sidebar interface that shows all ships (friendly and enemy) near a given planet, and furthermore if you zoom out enough, all the ships show up as icons that allow for easy real-time management. In short, this is a strategy game, but more on an indirect scale of numbers vs numbers, rather than a direct tactical level. The variety of units in the game - from small corvettes to long-range missile frigates to gargantuan dreadnoughts - keeps things interesting, but in the end it all comes down to numbers.Besides ship-to-ship fighting, the other part of galactic conquest is taking planets. This is done by nuking the planet from orbit with either capital ships or specially-made siege frigates. As missiles fall on the planet, its infrastructure decreases; when it's down fully, it can be captured. Depending on the planet's loyalty to its previous owner, it might be difficult for the new planet to adapt to your empire, and rebellion is entirely possible if the planet's inhabitants are mistreated. The other, more peaceful way of getting new planets is to colonize an uninhabited planet. The colonized planet is generally much more loyal than a conquered planet, though the infrastructure and upgrades start at their base levels.Diplomacy also plays a key factor in the game; when playing against AI opponents, you will often be given missions that can raise your standing with them, making them more likely to agree to a ceasefire or an alliance. It's also possible to put bounties on the heads of players - rewards and incentives for other players to attack them, essentially. Finally, you can hire pirates to raid certain planets and upset your enemy with no cost in terms of your own ships.The graphics are decent, but minimal - the details are good, but due to the scale of the game, it's difficult to focus on one specific ship. Furthermore, the animations and movements of ships are minimal - they're basically sitting completely still while little bursts shoot out of their guns. The camera is hard to manage, and the process of zooming in and out often led to my losing track of my units. There's no real parts where you can sit back and just enjoy the cinematic feel of your units blowing up a fleet of enemy ships, even though there is a \"cinematic\" option that gets rid of a lot of the HUD elements. The sound is not particularly great. The music is decent, but forgettable, and the game's voices are really annoying. Overall, they both kind of detract from the experience in general.As a whole, this game has a lot of good ideas, but the execution isn't that great. It feels like it's trying to do much, and while it's ahead of a lot of other games in its specific field, it doesn't feel properly committed to any of its gameplay elements. It doesn't have the detail to be a proper management game, and it doesn't have the tactics to be a proper fleet battling game. However, it's a decent effort at a spacefaring conquest game.7/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

If you're one of the few who have never played it then here's your chance to experience it too.Remastered in both resolution and texture/polygons you can enjoy the original XBox game in HD 16:9 with remastered sound too. Plus at any point you can literally switch between the new graphics and the old with a click of the back button. It's quite remarkable to see how it looked originally though. For some reason the remastered version is how I remembered H:CE and so when I switched back it genuinely looked like someone was playing a prank on me simply because it just looks so... old!I applaud the designers in their execution of the revamp. It must have been difficult marrying new graphics with old code especially in the cut scenes. Of course the visuals aren't up to today's games and I wouldn't expect them to be. The devs would have been hampered by their inability to insert architecture not originally there. For example, I'm sure they would have loved to populate areas with many more trees than were in the original but of course that would remove the purity of the game play and the ability to play it exactly as it did ten years ago. So expect an upgrade in the graphics but don't expect COD:MW3 levels of visual bliss.If you have a 3D TV then the remastered graphic mode can be switched to true 3D and wow is it good (the original graphic mode is in 2D only). My only caveat is the text messages when in 3D mode are wildly too big for the screen but it doesn't remove from the amazing experience of setting foot on Halo in awesome stereoscopic dimensions. Nice touch.I haven't tried multiplayer, and I didn't play it originally so despite reading that it's basically Halo:Reach with tweaked H:CE maps the game loses no points from me on that front. If you're buying this just for MP then you may or may not be disappointed.The single player game itself is just a joy even though you can see the limitations of the original hardware still showing through in this version due to the repetitive levels and quite sparse landscapes. But nothing takes away from the nostalgia of playing this game again and MS and 343 should be thanked for a great adaptation of a great game.

More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives.

James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit.

There are still gun fights, but there is more variety in what I can do. I can sneak around, do take downs silently, and if I have no choice I can do the gun fighting. It really helps balance the game and didn't make it seem like wave after wave of bad guys were coming after me. I love how the fighting controls are much better and simple (Just push square) instead of the triangle square combo deal in the first game.I love Nate, some of the things he said in the game were things I either said out loud or in my head while playing.Now for the things I didn't like. The girl for the first game was gone for a while and replaced by this Chloe chick who looks and sounds like a man. i thought the game was going to pull the biggest cliche crap but they didn't and I was left happy by the end. (I won't spoil it)Another issue I had is that the game sort of punished me for having common sense. What I mean by this, is that there was a chapter, where I sneaked past guards, took down three silently. Found my way to the next part and always died. No matter what I did to avoid the gun fire on the last part, I would die, and die again. So I looked at a walkthrough and saw that the player was in a long gun fight. So I redid the part...again guns blazing like an idiot, then when the gun battle was over he looks up at the SAME part I made it to with less fuss and go \"Wait, I think I can climb up over there.\" gee ya think?!Overall, the game once again had beautiful locations, lots of action, and it seemed more like a real adventure instead of a third person shooter game. I hope the third is even better than this!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2011"}

It's really fun, like a different version of The Sims 2. You can interact with the animals and make them say stuff that make you laugh. You can also make your own designs (I made a D Generation X and a Rey Mysterio 619 shirt) and display them so the animals can start wearing them. Some of the animals are snotty and mean while others are sweet and cute. My favorite animals are wolves so far, but I'm still playing. The city is very small but fun, you can watch a *horrible* performance at the Marquee, you can buy furniture from Gracie Grace, the most expensive place in Animal Crossing. You can go to Crazy Redd's too, where sometimes he has pretty exclusive stuff but other times he just has rip-offs. You can get your hair done at Shampoodle, or get your fortune told at that fortune place. Overall, the game's fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2009"}

When I read that this was up to Skyrim standards I had to try it though.My playing style is more run and gun tactical with cover as well as REAL open world like GTA. This is not really an open world game it's an open level game with many ways of getting to the same destination via alleys and other passages.Still the world is a different mix of contrasting art styles and technologies. This certainly makes it interesting but a little non-sensical such as the advanced technologies mixed with things like using swords and a musket type handgun. The upgrades to both your supernatural skills and regular weapons seem a bit shallow though.The graphics are pretty variable, sometimes it's really nice looking such as the buildings but at other times the textures seem like copy paste generics off the net. This world is pretty drab and depressing so there's not much of a wonder factor like Bioshock Infinite and others. Very little motivation to explore this world much for me, just go to the indicated points.The story is high drama conspiracy involving royal families etc. The outcome of the game is decided by your actions a lot. You can end the game pretty quickly if you do the right things or extend it based on how much extra work you take and other choices. That's pretty cool kind of like a clue style game with some mystery to it. One thing I'd like is that if you \"win\" the game early you should still be able to go and try other side missions. Instead it just announces the plot is discovered etc and gives you the option of only starting from a previous load or starting all over again.Overall if you have the patience for stealth and non-lethal game play this is a decent game to pick up but I'd recommend the Assassins Creed series over this any day.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2013"}
