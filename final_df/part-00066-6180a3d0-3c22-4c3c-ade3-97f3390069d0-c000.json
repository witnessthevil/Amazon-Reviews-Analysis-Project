I have to say that I thought this game was amazing from the ship battles to the storyline. I like the fact that it didn't take the storyline to seriously like the last assassin creed games where the main focus has always been the apple of eden as well as trying to save the world. The main character Edward is a step up from connor in AC 3 and alot more interesting. Unlike the other assassins he is just a character who's main focus is riches and survival instead of revenge and trying to save the world. This AC was made to just have fun with from the side activities to the sailing and ship battles. All and all I would recommend this game to anyone who likes the AC games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0000A9Y11","description":"Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

There isn't a moment of rest in this game and when it is all said and done you'll be itchin for round 2.**Gameplay: Bayonetta as I previously said, handles like Devil May Cry games.  However it is a tad less forgiving; in fact, play it on Easy and Very Easy the game will basically dodge for you!  Combat is fast and furious throwing punches nonstop. Crazy combos, ridiculous AoE moves.  Torture attacks and some insane finisher moves.  Bayonetta brings tons of style to the table and backs it up with tons of substance.  Ontop of killer moves and attacks, a well timed dodge nets you a few seconds of \"witch time\" aka, slow mo  to pull off long combos.  While the gameplay might seem fast and unforgiving at first ; just like a DMC game the difficulty doesn't really ramp up as the game progresses.  Meaning by the time the curtain falls you are a mean fighting machine.  The gameplay element of Bayonetta is perhaps the best reason you will get crazy high replay value out of this game.**Sound/Story:  The storyline is not bad; while it isn't a masterpiece there is a nice storyline here with some twists and surprise moments. Cut-scenes done via movie reel strips tell the story half the time and the real time cut scenes end up having quite a bit of funny moments in them.  The sound effects are very crisp and voice acting is rather good.  You can actually tell what enemies are going to do based on their sound cues (they speak in 'angelic' dialect) so you know what to expect just by listening to the game.**Graphics/Presentation: Presentation is very nice.  There is just the right amount of downtime between epic fights.  Enough time for you to absorb the combat, move memorization and just go \"wow that was sick!\"  Graphically however this game has some problems.  It is pretty obvious by now that Sega did a horrible job porting the game to the PS3 (If you can't even port the game right, why not just rebuild it for the PS3 and delay it 2-3 months)  The latest patch fixes much of the load problems and frame issues  but you end up with some fairly dull coloring in cut scenes and some bad frame rates here and there.  it is nowhere near as bad as it was at launch.  (I laughed during the credits though when they went \"Converted by SEGA\" sorta the first time I ever saw a company pat their own back about doing a port)**Length/Replay:  I beat the game on Normal in about 7hrs (not including deaths or visits to the item shop or cutscenes) so 7hrs gameplay  is about.. 10-11hrs total time .  Replay value is through the roof though. Not only does the game keep track of your stats for the difficulty, but then \"taunts\" you at all the empty slots for Easy, Very Easy  then goes \"Oh we unlocked  HARD\" so you got lots of work cut out for you.  Plus there are at least 6 unlockable weapons, tons of costumes.  Not to mention that \"stone\" award you got on a few levels that just taunts you.  You can easily get 3-4 plays out of this game - consider it like DMC replay-ability  you either can't put it down until you unlock everything  or you throw the controller through the wall after the boss owns you for the 10th time in a row.  ^_^~~ Overall:  I give bayonetta a 91%.  I'm being rather generous here since the 360 version is clearly superior (graphics and framerates, load times etc)  so if you have a 360 get it on that but I won't give this game less of a score simply because it had a bad port.  The gameplay itself works just fine... and that's what counts. Not how pretty the cut scenes are.  Bayonetta will give you hours of enjoyment, tons of replay value and brings a new style to the table ; giving Dante a run for his money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2010"}

The dungeons are great, the controls are great, the additions of the 3-dimensional boss keys are actually very very cool, the relationship between Link and Zelda is good, and the newly implemented run option is great. BUT, there is some weaknesses as well. The graphics are really blurry and messy and look on par or even below the graphics of the previous Zelda games. It definitely makes me look forward to an HD Zelda on the Wii U. However, the biggest weakness of the game is the inconsistent game design and the padding. The developers added a lot of collectathons  and fetch quests to prolong the length of the game just for the sake of prolonging the game, which makes  it frustrating and tedious at times. Despite some of the lows of the game it does have some incredible highs which make up for the tedious parts. Overall, this game is quite excellent and another great addition to the Zelda franchise but it definitely could have been better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0042WXQ62","description":"","reviewerName":"Moviedude","summary":"Outstanding game, but OKAY DLC at best","reviewText":"Borderlands is Diablo as a science fiction first-person shooter. You mercilessly annihilate hordes of bandits, creatures and lunatic robots, and as you do so you are rewarded with special abilities and randomly generated guns. Some guns are just guns, others set people on fire or shoot rockets instead of bullets. These are the FUN guns. The art is appealing and uniquely styled (actually it looks a lot like the cult Marathon stepchild ZPC, but you haven't played that so it will be new to you). All the voice actors do a good job, which helps bring the dusty, outback world of Pandora (no relation to James Cameron's planet) to life. The fun only increases with 4 players as you can duck and cover and shoot as a team- or start a PVP brawl, in which case the enemies will gather around in a ring and wait their turn.There are issues. The blasted deserts of Pandora begin to look a little Samey after a while. The end boss is painfully easy (in fact most of the bosses have some weakness, mostly getting stuck on the environment that you can exploit). There are no 4-seater vehicles so if you're a fully loaded team it's easy to get separated on big maps. And while good aim is rewarded, level is far more important than skill- higher level enemies will chew you up until you get better guns and more HP, no matter how good of a shot you are.This is the GOTY package, which comes with all the DLC. Frankly that's a mixed bag. Each DLC area has only 1 warp point, meaning that if you don't finish in 1 sitting, there's a LOT of backtracking. I wasn't too impressed with the length or original content in any of the DLC, except for Secret Armory of General Knoxx- it's much longer than the other DLC packs and feels genuinely like a whole new level.PROS-Good looking, stylized art means it holds up well over time-Inoffensive, unobtrusive sound-Quirky offbeat humor-Synergizes shooting and RPG stat-mongering really wellCONS-Aside from covering your teammates, there isn't a lot of cooperation in coop mode-Some areas, especially DLC, feel grindy-Impressively huge tough bosses still die stupidly stuck on rocks-Surprisingly large install footprint","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2012"}

Graphics are awesome, the campaign is to me better than Modern Warfare 2 campaign, but about the same length which is my only gripe. The sounds are pretty good, almost as good as Bad Company. The multiplayer falls right in 20% call of duty modern warfare (faster moving - controller layout the same) and 80% Battlefield Bad Company 2. When I first started playing the multiplayer, there was a second delay from when you got shot, till the camera showed you died. A firmware addressed this issue so I have not experienced that delay, which is a good thing. The sniper class overpowered any other class too, but it seems to have been addressed with an update if I'm not mistaking. Also, matchmaking is wayyyyyy faster than call of duty and battlefield bad company 2 are which is a plus.

You must escape the doomed city or become part of a ghastly new food chain: one with you at the bottom.You play as either Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop who's having areallybad first day on the job, or Claire Redfield, sister of one of the stars of the originalResident Evil. Leon and Claire's meeting is depicted in a visually stunning, B-movie cutscene. They're quickly separated, but occasionally meet up throughout the game.Right after the gruesome intro, you're dumped into the thick of things and have to dash through the devastated city streets, fleeing from one horde of zombies after another. As you make your way to a supposed refuge--the city police station--you find evidence that the citizenry fought bravely against the undead menace--and lost. Smashed barricades, abandoned police cars, boarded-up stores, dismembered bodies, and hundreds of expended bullet shell casings are all-too-common sights. Once you reach the station, you discover the remains of a siege. The defenders' desperate final hours are recorded in a fragmented journal. Its pages detail a possible escape route through an underground passage. Did the cops make it out? The alarming number of zombies wearing tattered police uniforms may be a clue.Resident Evil 2keeps the terrific puzzles and action of the original while vastly improving cinematic qualities such as dialogue, camera angles, cutscenes, atmosphere, and location design.

E Jackson","summary":"Want to see blood and zombie guts?","reviewText":"Now THIS is how you're supposed to enjoy blowing through a bloody, violent game!  Blood squirting from moaning zombie bodies.  It's so strange and relaxing to experience this.  I know you will laugh at what I am about to tell you, but I never bothered with this game when it first came out.  Yeah, I know, I lost many friends because of this.  I ignored this game in 1998, and my level of coolness went right down the tubes.  I had to fail math and pretend to smoke cigars to fit back in with my classmates again.Children shouldn't play this game.  If you think it's ok for children to see the two main characters in this game shoot and fry their way through the police station then you might not be a reasonable person.  Yes that's right: you can walk through a police station in this game.  If in real life you have a problem with the way cops sit in a field and watch over you to make sure you have your seat belt on (and not one of those cases where you pretend to put the seat belt on until the cop is out of view and then take it off again) you now have a place to take out your frustrations- Resident Evil 2.The weapons in this game are realistically cool.  I like pulling out the magnum and shooting zombies in the head and watching their heads blow to pieces.  Don't try this at home, but do try this on your Playstation.  The magnum doesn't make much noise so you wouldn't think it'd be such a bad-ass weapon, but you can shoot at the head of a zombie and watch his head quietly blow to smithereens.  You know you shouldn't do that in real life though, right?  You'd go to jail for a very long time.  And if you tried to explain to the police that you were shooting at zombies, you'd only get laughed at by the entire court room.  Use your head.If this game doesn't satisfy your sick animal-like needs, then try looking for the fire blaster thing.  You can cook zombies with this.  It's near the end of the game hidden in a locker.  Go near the locker and press the X button, and it will open and you will say \"sweet\".In this game you have two CD's.  One CD is for the Leon adventure, and the other CD is for the Claire adventure.  You can choose to start the game with either Leon or Claire.  To do the game completely you have to beat the game twice with Leon and twice with Claire.  I've only ever played this game on easy and I had a blast.  I'm sure on normal it's quite harder, maybe so hard you can't think straight and become dumb.  Of course you aren't dumb, it's just that video games can confuse you sometimes.Man I'm tired.  But I'm never too tired to take a couple hours from my easy-going day and blasting my way through this super cool game.  The only downside is that you can't skip the cutscenes.  That's fine at first, when you want to listen closely to the story (even though I didn't) but after a while you really wish Capcom would have put a skip button on this thing.Still, great game.  It's old, but please don't be one of those people who thinks that just because something is old it's not good.  I've been around people who think like that and they just ain't cool.  Sure, these people get all the girls and all the friends, but what else?  What's \"in\" sucks, and what's old is cool.  You think I'm wrong?  Good for you.

Covino","summary":"Now we?re talkin?","reviewText":"Just when you thought Rock Star couldn't surpass Grand Theft Auto, they slap everyone in the face with this beautiful masterpiece which they call, `Manhunt.' FULL of the blood and violence that I've come to love in video games today. They really decided to stretch the limits with this one. It's about time somebody grew some balls big enough to stand up to those censorships, and to the threat that some of the public holds against games of this genre.You play as a convict who was sentenced to death for crimes unknown, but the only place you die is in the mind of the public. Your death was staged, so you could be used as a pawn in a corrupt, underground snuff organization, which is governed by a guy called Starkweathers. Despite his sick passion for filming the deaths of people, Stark is actually secretly contracted by the Police? FBI? to stage the deaths of criminals (like you) so they can be forced to engage in a ring of survival and mayhem. You are placed in deserted sections of Carcer City, weaponless, to kill gangs hired to kill you. This is some morbidly creative way Carcer City wants to dispose of it's criminals. The theory is that you will take out an X number of wanted criminals for as long as you can, before you yourself actually gets hacked. You are being filmed the entire time, as Starkweathers is monitoring you through cameras set-up everywhere and talks to you through a little ear-piece. Meanwhile, people are paying money to see these videos Starkweather is directing at your expense, which will not go to chairty.Are you loving it yet? No? Okay...it may sound too frustratingly hard to take out so many bad guys like yourself without all the automatics and revolvers that most games will supply you with offhand, but it's not. You run through this game pretty smoothly, in fact. Thankfully, the 20 missions this game has are very long. None fail to entertain. All environments are large, heavily shadowed, and full of things to hide behind. Once hidden, you make noise to attract your prey. Once they walk by you, you walk after them, with whatever weapon you found in hand (a bat, an axe, a machete, a crowbar, a glass shard) and kill them unsuspectingly. Each weapon has 3 unique executions that you can perform on `the unsuspecting'. We're talking gutting, decapitating, castrating, stabbing, neck-breaking executions that just never get boring (Starkweather always appraising you through your little ear-piece as the bodies continue to mount). And if you're a lover of some nice shoot-out action, then this game has a little something for you too. About half way through, you go from Medieval sword fighting to your typical kill them all and let no one live shoot'em up game. Revolvers. Shotguns. Sniper Rifles. Uzis. Assault Rifles. This game's got all the goods. You can huddle behind anything during a shoot-out (garbage dumpsters, turned over cars in the middle of the street, mail-boxes). This system is set-up to where all you have to do is press the target button, and your character will pop his head out, gun pointing at someone's head, shoot, release, and back down he goes. This process is repeated until everyone's dead. Very intense when you have four or five guys hiding behind stuff and shooting back. It's all about timing and good judgment. If you shoot someone close enough, their head comes right off and pieces of brain splat on the wall behind them, stick there for a while, then slide down. It just don't get better than this people.This game is not for everyone. It's plot is utterly pointless, it totally involves no thinking, and it's story is hardly worth following. For gore hounds only. This game here probably raised even the eyebrows of a few of those crazy Japanese people that are literally the KINGS of Snuff videos and violent entertainment. If only our culture would just loosen up a bit, we'd see a whole lot of what Rockstar is only showing us glimpses of.

{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"Michael Pappalardo","summary":"Fun but difficult action game","reviewText":"I remember playing the very first shinobi in arcades way back in the 80's.  Seeing Shinobi return with modern-day gaming technology was a big surprise.This game is your typical run of the mill action hack 'n slash game.  Its not really boring...its alot of fun actually.  Most hack 'n slash games get boring rather quickly but Shinobi manages to maintain exciting gameplay throughout most of the game.  The soundtrack is sort of Japanese-techno with a quick beat.  It sounds somewhat inspired by Japanese Animation.  The graphics are pretty decent (though noticeably full of PS2 'Jaggies') and the flowing sash that trails behind your character is very, very cool.Unfortunately I have noticed that many people complain about the difficulty.  Frankly I must agree.  The game can be extremely frustrating at times.  I found myself spending more time turning it off and walking away from it than sitting through and playing it.  When you die in the game you must restart from the beginning of the level, no matter how much progress you made, which is, needless to say, very frustrating.  The game is a good challenge but it definitely would've benefit from mid-level save checkpoints.'Tate' kills are a nice little reward for quick multi-kills.  They occur when you killed a group of 4 or more enemies in quick succession.  When you kill all of them, you are treated to a brief in-game cutscene with Shinobi striking a pose, sometimes uttering a line, and then watching your enemies fall to bloody pieces around you (again, looking as if inspired by Japanese Animation.)  These kills help to fuel your power and will increase the power of your weapon.  However, in later levels Tate kills will become very necessary for you to survive, since your sword begins to consume your life.  If you go more than 1 minute without killing an enemy, you will die.  this becomes very frustrating, since it leaves no time for you to look for secrets.  Tate kills also become nearly impossible in later levels since the enemies become stronger.  Some cannot even be killed...many enemies requires lots of dashing and jumping to even do damage to their invincible blocking.  These incredibly annoying enemies often take so long to beat that the other enemies die before the Tate can be completed.Fighting enemies can sometimes become frustrating.  The targeting system is pretty strange...instead of targeting the nearest enemy, it will target the enemy that is often farthest from you or is most directly in your line of view, often resulting in the closer enemies around you getting in some cheap hits.  Sometimes in the middle of a combo, Shinobi will freeze in a pose, allowing other enemies to get a good 2 or 3 hits on you.  Otherwise, the fighting just takes a little bit of skill and some getting used to, but you will enjoy it.The commercial was right: Shinobi's back.  And in a big way.  This is definitely a good game but you must have a high threshold of patience.  This game can become very frustrating, resulting in cheap deaths(especially in levels that are just packed with pitfalls) and unbeleivably difficult boss fights lead to many fights being done and over and over.  Alot of the levels are very bland and very repetetive as well.  But the game has a good story, told through some pretty good cinematics.  The American voices aren't that bad either.  Usually translated voices are pretty awful, but Shinobi has some decent talent (although the rogue ninja woman has an irritating 'school-girl' type of voice).If you were a fan of Shinobi in the past, or are looking for a fast-paced action game with a decent story, pick it up.  However if you are a casual gamer that isn't looking for much of a challenge, stay away.  The difficulty of the game will probably get to you rather quickly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2003"}

There is a bit more of a challenge here, because there isn't as much hand holding as you play towards an objective. Also, it seemed like once the action starts in a COD game, it's pretty relentless. With Battlefield BC 2 there is more of an ebb and flow in the fights.Other pros:- Decent graphics and weapons sound authentic, grenades are very effective- Varied environments (like COD)- During a battle, structures can undergo a lot of damage over time - you have to stay on your toes- Some imaginative situations (in one spot, you are following flares, trying to reach your objective before you freeze in the elements all while fighting off the enemy)- Multiple ways to reach an objective (seems less \"scripted\" than the COD MW games)- The characters have some very funny lines & occasionally do some amusing thingsSome negatives:- Occasional graphic \"glitches\" - chunks of scenery stick on the end of your weapon, or the front of your vehicle (didn't happen a lot)- Too many vehicle activities for my taste (the few vehicle sequences in COD MW were done better)Anyway, this is quite an entertaining action/adventure game for the money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2013"}

Huzzah!","reviewText":"&quot;Maximo&quot; is similar in style to the popular Crash Bandicoot and MediEvil games, in their style of platform action. As an older gamer, I found this to be a lot like the older games, such as Ghouls 'n' ghosts and Castlevania in it's overall feel. Obviously, the graphics and music have evolved since then. Here is the breakdown:The Pros:1. Classic gameplay. This game is a lot like MediEvil, in that it feels like a halloween adventure. There are graveyards, crypts, and there are plenty of monters and undead creatures to fight. What I loved was the overall feel of the game. The story is not very deep, but the emphasis is on the action. The control is like second nature, and very easy to grasp on the first attempt (I had to, the copy I bought didn't have a manual).2. Graphics and Sound. The graphics in Maximo are remarkably fluid, with realistic shadowing, character movement, and world designs. The worlds are huge, and the detailing is nice. The music is where Maximo really shines. Unlike most video game music, the tunes in Maximo will stick in your head. The sound effects are really nice also, especially the sound your sword makes when it strikes rock.3. Challenge. Many people think that Maximo is an easy game, but I think that it gave me a good challenge. The levels are huge, so unless you are super careful, you are bound to get killed a few times. Though the boss fights are easy, the levels themselves can be quite challenging. This is just what I was looking for.4. Replay value. I have played through the whole game twice since I got it. Since the storyline is not very deep, the tedious cinematics are not a problem. You will want to play through again just for the action.The Cons:1. Saving is difficult. Everyone I know who has played Maximo has complained that saving is not easy. Finding a save point it tough enough, but having to pay for it is another problem altogether. What I wish it had were a more accessable save feature.2. Monotony. After a period of extended play, the battles become tedious. I sometimes found myself getting quitre bored when I tried to get through an entire level in one sitting, and often I would have to repeat since I got killed off. People who have played MediEvil know what I am talking about.Maximo is one of the PS2's most underrated titles. Fans of old school platform games will love the look and feel, while younger gamers will enjoy the great graphics and music. In short, everybody wins.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2002"}

Over 120 plus hours of total combined gameplay, numerous additions and enhancements, and critically-acclaimed game and art design.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Great story and characters, but hard, hard, hard","reviewText":"The Good: Great story, interesting battle system, decent voice acting, beautiful anime cut scenesThe Bad: Generally the same, woeful graphics, loading......I heard all the hoopla about Persona 3, but the next gen craze side tracked me from it. I finally rented the game and I have to say I am very impressed. I'm tired of the same old random battle JRPG with clich&eacute; stories, characters and battle systems. P3 tries to do something different with practically every element. When you start the game out you'll notice the game has beautifully drawn anime cut scenes. The story doesn't become very clear until after you start playing, but this is OK.The first thing I have to say is that the game takes FOREVER to get going. Maybe 5-6 hours into the game you'll really start getting interesting and most of the play mechanics and taught. When you're not fighting you'll be living your regular school life by studying hard and preparing for exams. The game has a calendar event setup and you go to school, talk to some people, you can choose to stay awake in class and listen to the lecture to increase your academic skills. Sometimes you'll have to answer questions (it's mostly guessing) and maybe your charm will increase. After school you can meet up your friends to strengthen your Social Link (more on that later). Depending on the responses you choose will affect your relationships. You can also go around shopping at the mall for items, weapons, armor etc. Another thing I have to mention is there isn't enough to buy before the next moon phase (more on that later). So you there is one new thing for each member and that's it. This can make traveling the upper levels of Tarturus even harder (more on that later).The game's story is about Shadows that try to wreak havoc during the Dark Hour which is midnight. During this hour the Dorm you stay at turns into a mysterious tower known as Tarturus and you must climb the tower fighting stronger and stronger enemies. Every 30 days you fight a boss and some event happens that evolves the story. During those 30 days you have to increase your Social Links, level up, and acquire all that you can before the big boss. When you fight in battle you use your Personas which are like Aeons (think Final Fantasy) and they are your strongest attacks. You'll rarely attack yourself so you always concentrate on your Personas. Some Personas have different magic abilities etc. The battles are won by determining the enemy's weakness and exploiting this. When you hit their weakness you get one more turn and that enemies falls down. If you get all the enemies to fall down you can do an all out attack where all the players will maul the enemies for extra damage. This is key to mastering because you can die very easy early in the game because leveling up takes longer that it should. Luckily you can switch Personas in mid battle so you can exploit accordingly.One irritating thing about this game is they changed the elements' names. Instead of Fire, Ice, Wind, Fire it's Zio, Bufu, Garu (light) and it's really stupid. Why did they do this? Probably just to be cute, but it confuses you and you have know idea what these names mean. Once you win a battle you may get a Shuffle Time which lets you see faces of a card and it shuffles them around. Some may give you bonus experience, some may be new Persona, some may be weapons. While you run around through Tarturus you can see the Shadows so this game isn't random. If you hit them first you get an advantage, but let them hit you and it's not so good.The game mainly evolves around Persona so, of course, you can make your own. Take your cards to the Velvet Room and you can combine them to make better Personas. Now there are attributes and rules, but these are confusing and pointless so you just add a few up and see what it makes. It's really simple and easy to use, but you can't do this for a while because you can only create Persona that are at your level. Also in the VR you can take requests from Elizabeth by bringing her certain items at certain dates for rewards. I found this very hard because you never really know what she's talking about half the time. I think it's mainly there for completionists.Social Links effect your Persona because if you have a friend that is a Magician SL all your Magician Persona will level up faster. Of course there are events every day that always change. Sometimes you can't go to Tarturus at night because your members are too tired, some may get sick, some may be busy studying for exams etc. This changes things up all the time so not one day is the same. When it all boils down is that the game is generally always the same. Go to school, go to Tarturus over and over. There are no worlds or levels to actually explore so this may disappoint some people. When in doubt pick up Persona 3 because you are going to have a blast and there are dozens of hours of RPG goodness here. With decent voice acting, memorable characters, great battle system you will truly love this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Burns \"Slackjaw\"","summary":"A Gamer's review of Lord of the Rings 10 hours in....","reviewText":"Hello and thanks for checking out my review of this game by Snowblind Studios.. This game has people split down the middle.  Is it worth a play through if you are on the fence about this game?  Maybe this will help a bit. Think Baldurs gate (with bigger enemies of course) mixed with some dynasty warriors, then throw in a little horde mode (ala GOW) for the challenge missions (which you try to last through multiple waves of enemies including boss characters.The Lord of the Rings : War in the North is set as a companion piece beside the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It overlaps the plot of the movies at many points and allows you to mingle with most of the main characters from the movies and books.  This is an UNTOLD story within the LOTR universe and as such should have a special attraction to those who are big fans of the original story.  You will choose between 3 playable characters, a dwarf, a magician elf, or a Ranger (archer).  Each character has their own skill tree associated with building up special skills and or improving base ones.  All three of your characters are participating in the loot gathering and leveling process.  You can ONLY play with one of them at any given time and are NOT allowed to switch between them throughout the levels.  Therefore you will have to wait until the end of each level to assign points and to decide which character to use.  This can be a bad mix as you will have to take EACH CHARACTER INDIVIDUALLY to the shops to sell, and buy new items.  The same poor design applys to the skill tree.  You would have thought the developers would have allowed for an easier way to manage the party.  It is important that you continue to develop these secondary characters even if you focus on one (as I did with the Ranger).  The reason is that you will need the powers of the other characters beefed up for specific boss fights.  So this is A MAJOR deduction for me.  You will be wizzing along with the story and then realize that it's time to take care of the party which slows the pacing down.  But I did like the skill trees as well as the loot options found throughout the towns you visit.I thought the character development was important as this may be a game saver to those who care (like i do) but for those who don't care about the story.. and are looking for the next technological marvel... Pass on this game like the black plague.  It is buggy and you will likely get ticked off at your party members as they are not the best teammates in terms of strategy or efficiency  you will scream for them to get out of your way at least 10 times).  But the game is not apologetic about what it is or what it attempts to do. If it was released 5 years ago it would be considered a top tier title but is shadowed by some pretty impressive competition this holiday. And despite its rather poor technology it is a fun and satisfying dungeon crawler. But it is far from perfect.  I liked the damage system which allows you to see the combos you are pulling off and rewards you for stringing more of them together.  I also felt that the combat was simple AND YET SATISFYING. I disagree with the reviews on acuracy of hits. It is accurate enough for this type of game.Graphics in the game are good.. NOt great.  But you will enjoy the larger Boss battles as well as some of the extremely satisfying environments.  There will be some points you will be impressed and others you will feel like a different development team was subbing in at some point. But the title is one of VERY FEW LICENSED LOTR GAMES THAT SUCCEEDS IN MAKING THE GAME FUN AND WORTHWHILE.  I am 10 hours in already and have opened up several towns as well as some challenges that change up the flavor.  I found myself playing these \"challenges\" several times and was having fun.  It reminded me of some of the Borderlands DLC  maxies*****It is a violent game and the action can offer decapitations as well as arms and legs being serated.. I would not allow a child to play the game if you want to avoid this.. BUT IF YOU CHANGE OPTIONS SETTINGS YOU CAN TURN OFF THE GORE and there are little other concerns from a language/conceptual angle *****So to summarize...  I am not verified because I rented it..  And am keeping it out for an exptended time.  I feel it is worthy of a purchase but not at it's current price.  Maybe on the first couple of price drops snag it or do as I have and try it out first.  I think it's dated feel hurts it as a top tier title worthy of release date spending.  The game is worth a playthrough for ANYONE looking for a good CO OP  dungeon crawler.  It does the license justice and stays true to the LOTR mythos.  It is a blast to combo up 5 or 6 enemies (think batman arkham) and then use a quick finishing move to finish off an orc.  AS A CO OP GAME THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS!!!!!  That should be enough for some to try it out as the co op is done very well indeed.  I would bump up the fun factor a ton when playing with buddies.best LOTR property I can remember on a CONSOLE..  Enjoy!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2011"}

The first player will always be Kirby and the second will be the blue newcomer, Prince Fluff.In this game, I'm sorry to say that you don't suck enemies up to get their abilities. Since Kirby is now made up entirely of yarn because of a new nemesis, Yin-Yarn, the enemies would go right through him. Instead, he grabs them with a starred rope and turns them into yarn balls.

The build quality - from the leather wrapped rim to serious-looking shifter to the three metalic pedals - is top-notch. From the looks alone, the G27 seems to be worth every penny.Play-wise, I find it very easy to control and the feedback is smooth and precise. Admittedly I don't have much experience with racing wheels, but when I play GT 5 Prologue I feel so much more in control than with the DualShock 3, and my racing results are way better than with the DualShock. Like many other reviewers, I don't use the shifter but instead opt for the paddles (my own Mitsubishi car has these paddle shifters). Another benefit of using a high-quality racing wheel instead of a regular controller is it's more ergonomic and easier on your wrists.In the end, if you play a lot of racing games - I just joined a game rental service and plan to play more PS3 racing games - I think the G27 is totally worth it. The only big downside is, it's not easy to set up securely, and the cables can get really messy, unless you somehow can have a dedicated setup you don't need to take apart every time after you play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}

Covino","summary":"Great game with some flaws","reviewText":"Jade Empire is an adventure Role Playing game in a complete fantasy world of magic, weaponry, and martial arts. You begin your journey as a young student of the martial arts after your village came under siege and your master was kidnapped by an unknown enemy. In your travels to locate your master, you discover that your homeland, The Jade Empire, has fallen into complete darkness and despair, incomparable to the idyllic environment of your village nestled away on the boarder. As you come to discover the mysteries of your heritage, and shed light on your darkened past, you find that you are destined for great things and that the very salvation of mankind depends upon you as the last Spirit Monk.The best thing about this game is its story, and I tried not to give too much of it away, but the story is far from being the only great thing about this game. In addition to fighting and leveling up numerous martial and magic styles, there are about a hundred side quests you can undertake which will determine the characteristics of the protagonist. In short, you can pursue one of two philosophical ways of life: the way of the Open Palm or the Closed Fist. The way of the Open Palm is a belief system of harmony, and protecting the weak; while the Way of the Closed Fist is the worship of strength. A follower of the Way of The Open Palm will go out of his or her way to help people who are in difficult situations and don't know how to help themselves. This can range from helping an old lady see through the forgery of an Imperial Writ threatening to claim ownership of her teahouse, to saving someone being stormed by thugs. The Closed Fist follower will do just the opposite. Instead of bringing peace to peoples lives, a follower of the Closed Fist will bring chaos, but he or she will do so to see if this person is strong enough to not fall into complete ruin. If the person dies in the process, then that is good, for that person is weak and only the strong should survive and be worthy of anything. It is because of this that the Closed Fist scheme is often interpreted as evil, and is a far more dangerous path, for you will make twice the amount of enemies. Side quests all deal with people and their individual problems. You can either solve these problems for them or worsen them. To deal with them all is really the girth of the game, and most of them are in plain view and not easy to miss. So, it is not like you will need to search for them.Another great thing is the game's numerous locales. There is the village where you begin. Tien's Landing, a town suffering from the opening of their Water Dam and a swarm of troublesome pirates. A pirate's camp on a deserted island. A haunted Forest. The Imperial City. The Lotus Assassin fortress beneath a huge Necropolis. You venture into the spirit world among other strange places. All superbly displayed on your TV screen in excellent Xbox graphics. Side objectives in addition to your main quest can be found in each location, which makes this game very engrossing, and very long. Only game that may be longer than this would be something like Final Fantasy.Now that I am done praising this game, it is now time to mention its quirks. This game is obviously inspired by Chinese myth (inspired, not taken directly) and it is made to look like China, with upturned eaves on houses and pagodas in the mountains. HOWEVER, they all speak in English and have American accents. This annoyed me to no end. They couldn't at least find some Asian voice actor with an accent? I would have preferred reading subtitles and listening to real Chinese than what I got.The people you meet throughout the empire are the same characters again and again, just with different voices and wearing different clothes. This was so cheap.When people speak in Tho Fan, a fictional language of the prosperous East in the game, they use the same words (or sounds) perpetually, when they are supposedly using different words which you see in the subtitles below.Among these nagging problems this game has, are the huge historical and religious inaccuracies. Although there is a wheel of Life belief in China, it is not governed by a Water Dragon. The Chinese Dragon is simply an elemental creature, often residing in the sea. They are not even considered Gods. Another huge blunder was the game's depiction of the Imperial City, which I am left with no choice but to assume that this is supposed to be the Forbidden City of China, which, during an emperor's reign, they would never allow common folk to tread its stone roads (that is, if they wanted to keep their heads). But in the game the city has a poor quarter, a common folk district, and a rich district, which borrows from the social strata of medieval monarchy of the west.But what dose it matter? The gaming experience is great and I enjoyed it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Why are people so disappointed?","reviewText":"I did not buy this game on the day of its release, as so many people were complaining Bioshock series lost its magic in Bioshock 2. The Rapture city doesn't feel as novel anymore. But now that I have played through with it TWICE, I have to say these folks were dead wrong. Yes, the city, some of the villians and gameplay are similar, but that is why this game is labeled Bioshock 2 and not a new IP. Either way below are the pros and cons for the Bioshock2PROS:-CHOICES, CHOICES, CHOICES: One of the aspects, gamers loved about the original is how you have to make choices in terms of litter sister throughout the game and how it affects the ending. In this one, they have taken a step further and improved this choice system. Not only for little sisters, but also for some other things you will have to make choices. This choices will affect the story (dialogues, cut scenes and ending) to a great degree and add decent replayability to the single player mode.-MYSTERIOUS STORY: The story is suspenseful. It is not as good as the first one, but is still pretty good and will really drive you forward in the game. If you played Bioshock 1, it is certainly a plus; however, certainly not a requirement. Even if you did not play the original, you will be able to understand most of it.-AMAZING UNDERWATER VISUAL ANG GRAPHICS: The city looks as stunning if not better as Bioshock 1. Better yet in this one you get to play UNDERWATER. While it may not sound as thrilling it truly adds great deal of feeling to the gameplay experience.-PLAYING AS BIG DADDY: Initially you will be somewhat confused, but this gets to be real fun. You can still use plasmids as in the original, but you get access to heavy duty weapons as you are playing as big daddy. I won't spoil much for you but YOU WILL LOVE THE SPEAR GUN :)-NEW WEAPONS, PLASMIDS and TONICS: In this game, you get access to all the cool plasmids from the original, but you also get to use some new mysterious plasmids and tonics. Expecially, if you decide to go for good ending, you will get some really cool plasmids. As for weapons, you will just love the big guns. Trust me on it.-NEW ENEMIES and BOSSES: I don't want to spoil it so I will just say big sisters will make you wet your pants.-FOUR ALTERNATE ENDINGS: Again refer to choices section-EPIC MULTIPLAYER: This game offers a very unique multiplayer. It was a wonderful break from games like Modern Warfare 2. The modes such as capture the little sisters can be fun. Just wait till you play as a Big Daddy. The power you get will truly be intoxicating. Oh did I mention you can use very different plasmids than single player in multiplayer mode.My only complain for this one was instead of focusing on multiplayer, they should have just focused on single player and made it longer. Don't get me wrong , it will still take you a while to go through it (8-12hrs depending on how much you decide to collect).In summary, to me, Bioshock 2 lived up to the standards. It was enjoyable and has great replay value.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Who is Your Daddy and What Does He Do?","reviewText":"You return to the fallen utopia of Rapture, but this time you're a Big Daddy!You get an arsenal of weapons, Plasmids, a cool diving helmet, and an industrial strength drill for an arm.Story 8/10The original Bioshock's story was revolutionary and set the standard for immersive storytelling.  Bioshock 2 tells the story in the same format.  A crazed ruler bombards you with idealistic rhetoric over intercoms and you find cassette players that add more detail to the back story.  The narrative is still very good, but it lacks the creepiness of the first game.Hey, Bioshock 1 is a tough act to follow, it won Game of the Year.Graphics 9/10The City of Rapture looks a bit more colorful this time around.  The environments are very impressive and really set the stage for the game.  The character designs are well done and the enemies are just as creepy.  The visual effects are also very good.Gameplay 9/10The gameplay of Bioshock 2 is a bit tighter than the first one.  The weapons are more accurate and reliable.  You also get multiple damage types for each weapon.  Plasmids are also back and work well in combination with the weaponry...  Launch your foes into the air, cause them to burst into flames, freeze and shatter them...There are two basic types of gameplay:1)  Level Exploration:  Explore and battle your way through levels to complete your objectives, fighting crazed lunatics along the way.  You get a rivet gun, a spear gun, a shotgun, a machine gun, a rocket launcher, a hacker tool, and Plasmids.2)  Defend an Area:  You can defend a Little Sister as she extracts ADAM from an \"angel.\"  This triggers a mad zombie rush and you have to defend her as she drains the corpse of its fluids.  You have plenty of defensive weapons like auto turrets, proximity mines, auto fire rivets, electric tripwires, and cyclone mines to ward off the assault.Hacking is also easier in Bioshock 2.  A grid appears with white, red, blue, and green areas.  A pointer moves rapidly back and forth over the area and you just press the A button to stop the pointer.  If it lands on red, you get attacked by security drones.  A white area shocks you.  Blue gives you a bonus.  And green is a successful hack.  There may be 1-5 stages of this and it's very simple.Levels 9/10The Levels are very imaginative and look great.  You also get a map and a directional arrow that always points you in the right direction, so you can't get lost.  The levels of Bioshock 2 aren't as creepy as the first game, but the spaces work well for the combat.  My personal favorite was the Amusement Park.  Imagine a crazy person educating you on their beliefs through animatronic mannequins.  It's good stuff!Sound 9/10The voice acting is great.The music features happy music from the 1950's, which is a bit unsettling because you're trapped in an underwater city full of psychopaths.The sound effects are great and add impact to the action.Multiplayer  6/10There is a multiplayer mode that offers Capture the Little Sister, Team Battle, Deathmatch...  It would have been cool if there were battles with underwater Big Daddies, but the setting for Deathmatch is a bunch of citizens trying out the \"Home Defense\" Weapons of Rapture.  As you play, you earn points that allow you to unlock new weapons, costumes, and Plasmids.  It's pretty fun, but it's no Call of Duty or Halo.Replay Value  6/10Bioshock 2 is about 12-14 hours long and features a multiplayer mode.  There are multiple endings and different difficulty modes, so you can play through more than once.Overall  9/10Bioshock 2 offers better gameplay and better level design than Bioshock 1, but the story is just good (not a masterpiece.)Buy this game if you liked Bioshock 1.Buy this game if you like a little more thought with your First Person Shooters.Buy this game if you like good psychological horror stories.Rent it if you have 12-15 hours to get through the Single Player Mode and don't care about Multiplayer.Avoid this game if you didn't like Bioshock.Avoid this game if you don't like first person shooters.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2010"}

Bakehorn","summary":"Rawk.","reviewText":"Guitar Hero was something of a sleeper hit last year. Developer RedOctane delivered an excellent rhythm game that played quite unlike any other console game with its guitar controller and deep list of playable songs. Despite its pricey package, Guitar Hero sold and became a quick hit, garnering almost as much gaming media attention as 2005 classics like God Of War and Resident Evil 4. RedOctane's readied up Guitar Hero 2, and does the series continue to deliver a deep experience or is it a one-hit wonder?Without a question, Guitar Hero 2 is better than its predecessor in most ways, though the gameplay mechanics haven't changed much at all. The guitar controller, bundled with either Guitar Hero or Guitar Hero 2, works as well as always. The notes in each song are played by holding one of five colored frets on the guitar while strumming the controller's strum bar. There's even a whammy bar for those distorted, drawn-out notes. If you've played Guitar Hero, you'll feel right at home with the controller. It's no surprise, this guitar wasn't broken and RedOctane didn't need to fix a darn thing.There are a few new things added to the mix. Three-string notes will pop up on the Hard and Extreme difficulties and can really throw you off. Also, hammer-ons, which weren't very effective in Guitar Hero, are done much better here. The result is a perfectly improved experience, with little to no frustrations coming from the controller itself. Guitar Hero's a lot like golf; the only person you can blame for not doing well is yourself. Also like golf, the only way to get better at the game is to practice. Fortunately, Guitar Hero 2 has an extensive practice mode that actually lets you pinpoint individual sections in songs, slow them down, and practice them until you can't miss a beat. I'll quote my roommate Alan, \"Practice mode actually makes you better.\"The track list is something most Guitar Hero fans have become familiar with, even weeks before the game's release, but those of you in the dark will be happy to know that top rock artists like Foo Fighters (\"Monkey Wrench\"), Nirvana (\"Heart-Shaped Box\"), and Black Sabbath (\"War Pigs\")  make an appearance. Some older groups are also there, including Lynyrd Skynyrd, with the 9+ minutes of guitar solo pain in \"Free Bird.\" I was very happy to see some metal bands thrown into the mix, like Avenged Sevenfold, Shadows Fall, and Lamb Of God, but RedOctane earned the most bonus points in my book by including All That Remains' \"Six\" as an unlockable song. It's a current favorite of mine, after all, and it almost made my hands bleed when I kicked up the difficulty to Hard and tried to play it. The different levels of songs are unlocked in the familiar career mode, and it's as fun as always to earn money, unlock secret songs, outfits, and characters, and go for those difficult five-star reviews.I have to admit that Guitar Hero 2 is noticeably harder than the original. The reason for this isn't because of the notes themselves, in fact, some of the songs are incredibly easy. Most of the difficulty comes from brutally long songs that require a lot of stamina. As I said, \"Free Bird\" is over 9 minutes long-that's asking a lot of your left hand for the frets and right hand for the strumming. While I'll admit I play the game on the Normal difficulty setting, I've tried a large amount of the songs on Hard and I've only beaten a few. \"Free Bird\" on a higher difficulty setting is just obscenely difficult.Guitar Hero didn't really wow anyone with an explosive visual performance but it did have a wild art style and decently interesting environments to play in. This time around the background camera angles get a little closer to your player, allowing you to see him strum on his virtual guitar while you shred away on your controller. Some of the visual effects light up the screen and add a nice touch, like the fire effects that come from your player's hands as he strums on-screen. The environments deform and change in appearance during Encores, and the final shape-shifting venue was particularly interesting. The re-recordings are hit (\"War Pigs\", \"Free Bird\") and miss (\"Beast And The Harlot\"); but this isn't surprising to me. The same thing happened last year, and I'd be happy to see the actual recordings make it around for Guitar Hero 3. I'm very happy to report that RedOctane input an option that allows you to turn off that annoying scratching noise that occurs whenever you screw up a note-this sound effect was extremely distracting in Guitar Hero and it can be silenced once and for all in the sequel. I usually know when I screwed up a note, I don't need an annoying sound to rub it inGuitar Hero 2 does nothing to change its predecessor's direction. It's essentially a fine-tuned update to last year's hit, and that's just fine with me. If you as much as watched someone else play the original, you simply can't miss out on the sequel. If last year's \"Bark At The Moon\" and \"Cowboys From Hell\" weren't enough for you, \"Free Bird\" will be. I referenced \"Free Bird\" five times throughout this review; if nothing else, play this game just for a hands-on experience with this classic. The only improvements I could suggest would be to include the real song recordings. Guitar Hero is one of those games that doesn't ever really need to be reinvented. That's not to say that something couldn't be done to make it even more fun, but even after all of the hand cramps, there's nothing I could think of.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2006"}

Others are mature because they are really scary and nasty. Condemned - Criminal Origins falls clearly into the latter category.Condemned - Criminal Origins has you in the part of FBI Agent Ethan Thomas, tracking down a serial murder. Don't think that this is like Law & Order or Criminal Intent. This is about the nastiest, grittiest, scariest areas of a city that you can imagine.Somehow it's as if a maximum security prison was turned into an area of town. You go walking through buildings that are covered with gang signs, crawling with addicts who kill police offers on sight. Most of these insane bad guys lurk in the dark and call out profanities before bashing you with 2x4s or other weapons of convenience.Of course a wise police officer might call for backup. But in the first \"situation\", you're told backup will take 10 minutes to show up. Instead of hanging tight for 10 minutes, you go trekking through the building on your own with only a gun and a flashlight to keep you safe. It's not long before the gun is in the hands of the bad guy and it's you and your flashlight against numerous enemies. This is wise?? Where's your radio?You have a helpful friend - Lt. Rosa - who helps to talk you through using your forensic equipment. However, she waits until a madman almost kills you before chiming in with some information about how all the madmen on the streets are insane and worthy of slaying. Thanks for the help, Rosa.The game is definitely very scary. The screens are quite dark, the flashlight only lights up small areas, and there are a ton of corners for the madmen to hide out in. You see them run across the screen, take cover, lurk in the corners. You never know when they'll launch an assault. Again, it really makes me ask why a lone FBI guy is roaming around in here without any real weapons. I realize it's for plot reasons, but I want a better plot :) Surely if I was really tracking down a serial murderer, I'd have more backup and more weapons than this.That being said, if you're looking for a scary game that isn't all-and-all out combat a la Quake 4, this might fit the bill exactly. It's you against the enemy - and the enemy is truly insane. It's not about tons of ammo here - you're lucky if you even have a gun sometimes. You have to find crowbars, planks of wood and whatever you can to stay alive. If you play this at night, with the house quiet around you, the HD TV showing you the full detail and the 5.1 surround sound tuning you in to the slightest noise, it really can get to you.Well recommended for the mature set that enjoys being scared!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2005"}

When the President's daughter is kidnapped, Leon tracks her to a remote, hidden fortress in Europe - where he'll relive the horror he faced six years before.   Players will face never-before-seen enemies that make Nemesis seem like a kitten. You'll be wishing for the usual Resident Evil zombies!","reviewerName":"S. Morales","summary":"Survival-Horror Revolutionized","reviewText":"THE GOOD: Fantastic presentation; revolutionary action gameplay; unforgettable enemies; top notch audio and visual; lengthy adventure and unlockables make for high replay valueTHE BAD: Not as scary this time around; some questionable and scripted hit detectionDIFFICULTY: Medium-to-HardWell, it's obvious the folks at Capcom were just about as tired as the rest of us when it was clear where the RE frachise was going with mediocre spin-offs that basically offered the same clunky gameplay over and over. They heard your complaints and suggestions, and basically outdid themselves this time.Resident Evil 4 was origionally released for the Gamecube a year before the PS2 version, and its absolutely revolutionary gameplay, incredible graphics, memorable enemies, and constant on-your-toes challenge made this in most publications the 2005 game of the year.The PS2 is a very near identical port of the GC version, and with the new extras thrown in, may make this the better of the two games... in some aspects.The storyline is pretty straightforward, you are Leon Kennedy of RE2 and on a government mission to save the president's daughter in the outskirts of Europe (most likely Spain, since everyone speaks spanish). It stands on its own for the most part, so newcomers who've been living under a rock and never played any of the first 3 RE games will be pretty safe here.Now, the first thing people will love about this one is the new over-the-shoulder camera perspective which gets rid of that annoying static camera and clunky \"tank\" player control of the original titles. You always have a fresh look on everything and with the new laser sight enemy hit detection system, it makes pulverizing your grunting, dirty, virus-infected human monstrosities all the more fun... so fun in fact that the unlockable \"Mercanaries\" mode which offers ONLY the pure, balls-out head exploding action that will have you replaying this time and time again (this isn't even mentioning the other 2 Ada missions, one of which is a PS2 exclusive and offers a new 6-7 hour adventure). Besides the action, the puzzle aspect of the game still lies within, though not anywhere near as thorough as the original RE games had it. This is a good thing, no more collection annoying crests to open doors and whatnot. The game controls very much realistic as well, Leon isn't able to strafe or do all out Devil May Cry style death-defying jumps to avoid enemy hits, it's all very accessible and though isn't as tank-like as the early games, it still feels a bit limited which better balances the horror on-your-toes action. The game will also keep you on your toes mainly through the cut-scenes, which don't offer a break like other games, no. In most instances you'll have to quickly hit a series of 2 different button combinations to avoid attack in split-second timing, if you don't, you either get hurt pretty bad, or die. Some are so intense you'll find yourself staring at the tv eyes wide, sweat beading down your forehead, holding your breath, fingers tense and ready - it's VERY exciting.Now, though most aspect of the Gamecube version are great, the aiming system feels a bit touchy mainly because the PS2 controller isn't very good for first-person shooters which require fairly precise aiming. Also, the hit detection, though a great addition - which makes enemies react appropriately to which area of the body they are hit - can sometimes be off and feel scripted rather than real. About a quarter length into the game, you'll find that blasting an enemy's head off will result in his inner \"monster\" to start waving a very dangerous whip blade at you, which makes the combat even tougher. So generally you'll try and start shooting them elsewhere. Still, the game sometimes forces you to fight these annoying monsters, so even though you'll hit an enemy square in the stomach, his head will magically blow off. This becomes annoying especially when trying to control a huge crowd of foes. One final minor complaint is with the atmosphere in the game. Though the battles and fear of getting killed are scary, the atmosphere that made the first RE games so scary just aren't here anymore. This is partially because the game is very action-oriented, and though the environments look beautiful, they aren't very scary.That's about enough with the negatives.One great positive is how the game forces you to fight. In older games, if you didn't have enough ammo you could simply run past enemies. In this game, the vast majority of enemies will leave behind money, weapons, and health power ups which are necessary for later in the game. The money aspect is a very welcome addition. Generally, in many parts of the game you'll come across a mysterious guy who you can buy and sell from. New and upgradeable weapons, along with the more realistic and strategic inventory system, bring a great RPG element to this game which can also greatly enhance the replay value (should I trade in this shotgun for this other one? Are buying these treasure maps really worth it?) It's enough to warrent another playthrough just to see what other weapons and power-ups you can upgrade and how it'll alter the challenge.Graphics and sound are a grand showcase of their own. Every shot, every kill, every explosion, every scream and moan just oozes inspiration and hard development work. And the graphics, oh man the graphics, are SO gorgeous at times that I found myself simply stopping just to LOOK at it. It's amazing the PS2 was even able to pull this off.There are simply too many positives which make the PS2 version of RE4 worth an instant purchase - fast enemies (no more zombies in this one), split second reactions, incredibly fun hit detection, lengthy adventure, strategic inventory, gorgous graphics, GOOD voice acting, and involved story make this easily the BEST Resident Evil and easily the greatest game of 2005.BOTTOM LINE: If you own a PS2, and don't own this game, you don't deserve your PS2.

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"DL","summary":"Review from someone that actually bought & played the game","reviewText":"Let me start by stressing some relevant points...1. I played Uncharted 2 extensively and believed it easily earned a 9/10 or even a 10/10 rating2. Refer to the title of this review3. I own a PS3 and a XBOX 3604. I wish this title was not PS3 exclusive so everyone could enjoy it!Ok, so now that I got that out of my system on to the review. In the case of this game, which plays out much like a Hollywood summer blockbuster movie (just like Uncharted 2), it's better that I don't give away too many details of the plot. I think its better that I address some of the broader things I believe the game does very well and some of the things that it misses. First off, let's hear what things the game does right.Graphics: Holy Cow! Just like Uncharted 2 the graphics are tremendous. It meets and in many cases exceeds the very high bar set by part 2. There are many times in the game when you want to stop and just take in all the scenery...the levels look that GREAT! The lighting effects are nothing short of genius in almost every level. This could not be more evident than in the cave level where you find yourself pushing the graphics engine to its limit when Drake is waving around a torch. Watching Drakes and Sully's shadows react to the light sources is as realistic as you could hope for.Story: This was one of the areas I had doubts about before playing the game. I didn't think it would be possible for Naughty Dog to come up with a more breathtaking and mesmerizing story than they had previously. Thankfully they were able to come up with an original story that had me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end. The pace that's set from the very beginning to the end is a perfect and almost seamless blend of deep character development, retrospective moments and jaw dropping action.Acting/Dialogue: I don't know how many other games out there get as harshly graded when it comes to the characters interactions and body language as Uncharted. It's probably not one of the first things you think of when you start wondering if you're going to like a certain game. As usual, the Uncharted franchise has set the bar so high with its voice acting that it's become expected. Once again that gold standard has been reached and many times throughout the game even surpassed. The bottom-line is it is such good acting that it will make you actually care what the characters are going through.Multiplayer: This is a game that I never bought for the multiplayer experience although I have spent several hours playing it for both Uncharted 2 and Uncharted 3. Let's be honest with ourselves...right about the time most of us bought this game or are considering whether or not to buy it we already have a couple other new games sitting around that are built for multiplayer. If you spent $60 truly believing that Uncharted 3 was going to fill the gap in your multiplayer social life over Battlefield 3 or Modern Warfare 3 then you're crazy. But hey, I guess all the fanboys out there rating this game 1 star, yeah you heard right 1 STAR had to have something to try and justify their 3-5 sentence reviews with.Now lets get to those things I thought came up a little short...Okay I really don't have much of anything to say in the negative about Uncharted 3. From top to bottom, beginning to end it displays everything in a video game that you could ever want. I couldn't give any stronger recommendation to a more deserving game, it's just that good! 9.5/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2011"}

For me, the wii gave kinect a bad name and I was not impressed to say the least.  But my wife thought it would give our 5 year old daughter something else to do and my daughter really liked the disney adventure and dance central 2 commercials on xbox live.So instead of paying two hundred on a birthday party at jump zone (what a waste of money) we decieded to buy the kinect. at least we'd have something to show for the money after her party and if it didnt work out we could re sell it.  We bought our kinect used off craigslist about a month before my daughters birthday.  This gave us time to get it set up and work out all the bugs, learn how to use and play and we'd have a kinect birthday party instead.Within the first week I was intrigued to say the least and well into 3 weeks after the purchase we had 4 kinect games and I was hooked line and sinker'ed.  Now i still throw down on gears of war three but when my daughter is home, we throw down on river rafting, wing suit flying, skiing, dancing and golf with my wife.  i personally like tennis on kinect sports season two the best.  We love playing it and its fun to play with my daughter.I understand these are first generation games, they need improvment but still a blast to play.  My wife and I started working out again, not so much to lose weight or because of the new year but more so that we can keep up with our daughter and be more competative in the kinect games.our living floor is now lined with taped boxes and lines so we know where to stand and what range not to cross to keep within limits of kinect sensor (we've gone hardcore)We love our kinect!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001NX4DUQ","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"God of War-lite","reviewText":"Saying that Dante's Inferno is a blast from the minute you pop it in is kind of misleading. Indeed the game is tons of fun when you first fire it up: offering up some great action and creepy environments, but sadly, the fun doesn't last all that long. Back from the Crusades, Dante descends into the Nine Circles of Hell to rescue the soul of his love Beatrice, and standing between them are hordes of demonic enemies. Gameplay wise, Dante's Inferno plays a lot like the God of War games, and while the combat offers up some bloody good fun, it sure isn't nearly as satisfying as the God of War games that it imitates. Most of the environments are well designed, as are the enemies you encounter, but the puzzle elements you encounter are another story all together, and are just more tedious than anything else, not to mention the fact that the game itself is pretty short to boot. Still, despite its shortcomings, the technical aspects of Dante's Inferno are worth noting: the game looks good, there's terrific voice acting and music, and an engaging story as well. All in all, you'll certainly play worse games than Dante's Inferno, but you'll certainly play better ones as well.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2010"}

I love the times when there are enemies coming from every direction and your just shooting everywhere and it is total chaos!! The gameplay is very smooth and the levels are nicely designed. And of course there are plenty of funny lines throughout the game.There are about 10 levels, not much for a Ratchet and Clank game, but each level lasts longer so the amount of time to beat the game is about the same as other R&C; games.Also when you play as Clank you have to do these Time based levels. They are interesting and a change of pace... but sometimes I found myself having fun shooting away and then suddenly I was doing some pointless time minigame.So why did I give this game a 4 out of 5? Because of the poor quality and lack of weapons. There were a few useful weapons like a rocket launcher, spinning disk blades, the Ryno V, and a disco ball that makes all the enemies dance. But there are only 17 weapons which are either useless or weak. I found myself fighting bosses with two or three weapons and struggling when my ammo ran out.

Like many other classic NES RPGs I now enjoy playing them on my cell phone using my emulator.  This game is the perfect classic RPG in many ways:Turn based system, though outdated, still has lots of room for strategy and increases the difficulty level greatly.  There is some level grinding required, but it's fun and rarely monotonous.  I also love the ability to choose your character classes.  Sometimes I like going with 2 fighters and the obligatory white and black mage, other times I use red mages, thieves, or other fun groupings.  It makes the game unique and interesting.  Try beating the game with two thieves and two red mages!  Gold is somewhat hard to come by early on, so it makes budgeting important.Some points of interest: each class levels up at exactly the same experience points.  If a character dies, then they gain no experience and can fall behind the others in levels.  There are a few points in the game where you are pretty much forced to level grind for a bit, but other parts where you can go through a few areas without having to level up.The graphics are pretty solid for the NES hardware and the music is catchy, even though it is rather computerized sounding.

It gave me some insight into their personalities and I was hoping to uncover more about each character as the game progressed.I like the open world feel, The island is beautiful, the zombies are...well zombies.What I didn't like.Sure you get a small bio on each character but it really makes no difference as you don't seem to find out more about them and the story isn't tailored to each character. I would have liked to have some form of a story here. The missions are repetitive and dull and it doesn't seem to lead to much of anything. Whats the point in leveling? Seriously, I don't get it. You level up but the zombies level up with you? Why not level up and reach the point of easily dispatching the lower level zombies while giving us higher level zombies to deal with? But that would require the creators to come up with other zombie types so I guess they won't do that.Now onto my biggest pet peeve about this game and why I will be trading this game in the very near future. Each character has something they specialize in. One is a thrower, one with blunt objects, another with sharp objects, and the last one with guns. I picked the woman with the guns. But after several hours of game play I have NO guns!!! I can't buy guns, can't find a gun, no one will give me a gun. I just have no freaking guns at all. Mind you, I don't think she should be well stocked but at least give this character a 9mm that can be customized or something. why is this character specializing in something and not given the thing she specializes in to get started. I got a hold of knives I could customize and blunt objects I could repair and use but nothing for these particular character. I might as well had chosen the sharp object character because at least I get cleavers et al early on.Update: Played a little more and found out that I had to unlock the Fury skill to use a gun, but you only use it when she's mad or something and it's temporary. A gun as an unlockable emotional skill in a zombie game?? What idiots.Speaking of customizing and repairing. Why do I have to spend money just to create something out of materials I gathered myself? Why do I have to spend money to repair items myself? The creators are just looking for ways to make you spend your money with no real thought behind it.Overall I wanted to like this game, but I'm not playing the character I picked to play and the missions are so boring its more like a chore just to do it then anything fun.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Brilliant sequel with only a few flaws","reviewText":"I just finished the full walkthrough for Halo 2, as well as played a number of multiplayer games. I'm finally ready with the review of this awesome game!First off, this is obviously the sequel to the hugely popular initial Halo game. You are Master Chief, a space marine who is sent out to battle the enemies. You are fighting the Covenant, who are your main foes, but you also run into the Flood, who are a space parasite that wants to eat all life. In addition, there are mechanical creatures on Halo who want to kill pretty much anything including the Flood. So each location and creature type has its own look, feel, attitudes and reactions.The graphics are simply gorgeous, from the rippling water to the clouds in the sky and reflections off of surfaces. I love taking screenshots of this game. The music is also extremely well done, in that the quality is always very high. But it's a little bizarre to be going from new age lilting softness in one heated battle to high intensity rock music in another and so on. It doesn't necessary track to the location you're in, either. It's just whatever the designers felt like putting in.The gameplay and plot is where this game really shines. Your characters that interact with you are simply BRILLIANT in how they each do what a real live creature would do. Grunts are my favorite - these little Covenant front-liners are brave and talkative when they're in groups, but when you whittle them down they suddenly turn and flee, shrieking at the top of their lungs. Your teammates leap into vehicles with you, either driving or shooting depending on your preference. They'll come alongside you to give you support, and duck for cover when appropriate.The quips the characters come out with mid-battle still make me laugh out loud. In one sequence you are the covenant Arbitor and are working your way through a room. You come across a pair of grunts and a jackal under attack, and take out the enemies. The grunt comes running to you in glee, shouting, \"Arbitor! My savior!\" Then he pauses and adds, \"Jackal, say thank you to the Arbitor!\" :)The cut scenes are equally as brilliant and are truly movie quality in the interactions. The timing, dialogue, everything is great. The little touches are everywhere. In one sequence, the Sergeant is preparing his troops to get ejected in pods down to the surface of Halo. He walks past the Master Chief's pod and thumps twice on it, as if to say \"All OK in there, ready to go?\" Right on beat, you see Master Chief inside his pod, thumping once back in response. You really forget that these are just computer generated characters.Multiplayer is the stellar addition to this release and there are reasons to be thrilled. You can play on a large variety of maps, in a number of styles, and there is even going to be downloadable content in the future.That all being said, there are of course a few non-stellar aspects to this release. First, the ending SUCKS. The first one was bad enough with its \"Oh I bet there is another Halo out there\" so you don't even feel like you really saved the world. In this one, not only is it not a \"you're done but it's not over\" ending - it's pretty much cut off mid-battle! That is INCREDIBLY frustrating for a gameplayer. Obviously they want you to buy Halo 3, but that's going to be a year or two away. Can't we have some satisfaction in the meantime?Next, the game is really short, even on normal mode. We had a friend start the game up Sunday morning at about 12:30 and he was done with the entire game by around 8. You can have fun replaying it on the harder levels, but that's a rather quick game.Finally, the multiplayer, while brilliant in concept, is lacking in implementation right now. There are two general ways to play - either you set up a game yourself for friends ONLY, or you launch into the ether to play a quick match. If you get up your own game you can control all the settings, but you can only invites people on your friends list. That limits the chances of having a full game unless you are VERY proactive in seeking friends. The quick match game only lets you make a few choices, and then in essence you are auto-connected with other people who are also actively seeking those game types. You can't browse or look. You just say \"I want to play X type of game\" and then you wait - literally for 5 minutes or more sometimes - as the servers gather together other people who are also actively seeking that game type. Then the game auto launches without you even knowing who is on your team or if you want to play with them. It's very frustrating to people who are used to the more customizeable lobby situations.Still, the online experience can always be tweaked going forward, and the base gameplay is amazingly good. I highly recommend the game to anyone who enjoys shooting / strategy games - but you might want to rent it for a week first, to see if what it offers to you after that point is going to keep you playing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2004"}

While you might not be able to customize your character in this game like in Saints Row the main quests and mini quest as well as the explosion and mayhem more then make up for that.  The vast free raoming quality is also nice as while you do have the main quest you are required to build up your reputation and like with GTA or SR you do that by getting in good with the various bosses around the small island until you can proceed further along in the main quest.  The graphics and effect are amazing but since this is from Square Enix thta shouldn't come to much as a surprise.  Also your character does come with a bonus action figure attachment which is a short/long range grappling hook accessory that allows him to scale walls and other near impossible surfaces by foot or to grapple an opponent and pull them too you or make them fall,especially useful when you have a shooter across from you and you're out of ammo.

{"product_name":"B0002CHJ3M","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"Despite this sequel's darker tone, this is still Prince of Persia","reviewText":"As you can see from my Fun Factor rating, I find Prince of Persia: Warrior Within to be the most entertaining game of the series gameplaywise. Basically, while the first game had a great story with pretty good gameplay, this game kind of did the opposite and had great gameplay with a pretty good story. As far as the story goes, it's been about seven years since the Prince's adventure in The Sands of Time, and apparently since then the Prince has been on the run from an enemy unlike any other he's ever faced before: the Dahaka. This creature is a large and practically invincible juggernaut of darkness whose sole duty is to correct any anomalies in the timeline. The Prince, due to his manipulations of the Sands of Time in the previous game, has become such an anomaly since he was supposed to have died. Since he isn't dead and doesn't belong in the timeline, the Dahaka is attempting to kill the Prince and effectively remove him from the timeline. So while doing all he can to remain a few steps ahead of his would be executioner, the Prince has gone through extensive training and become a much more proficient master of the blade, believing that unleashing the \"warrior within\" is the only way he'll be able to save himself (some of this background info was revealed in the game manual, but would have been better if it were revealed in-game). After receiving counsel from a mysterious old sage, the Prince travels to the Island of Time, the birthplace of the Sands of Time, in an attempt to convince the powerful Empress of Time to not create the Sands in the hopes that such a thing will save the Prince from his fated death at the hands of the Dahaka. No longer is the Prince out to save his loved ones or the world from a horrible supernatural plague; he is now a desperate man doing all he can to save himself from certain doom.As interesting as this new premise sounds, it makes for a somewhat less epic and grand adventure, which was kind of the point. This game was made to show us a darker side to the normally charming and wise-cracking Prince from the first game, and while many loyal fans of The Sands of Time didn't like this drastically different direction Ubisoft took with the Prince, it was actually pulled off pretty well. The Prince is far more grim and quiet than he was before, and he no longer makes corny jokes in order to cope with his stress; now he just beheads the sources of his stress (his enemies). That's not to say that the Prince has become a Persian counterpart of the Spartan Kratos; no, despite his great difficulties, the Prince still has a heart and shows concern for those whom he considers to be his allies or friends. He's just not as vocal as before and smiles a lot less, which makes sense considering the guy has been running from an otherworldly demon for the past seven years of his life... that's bound to stress anyone out. Changing the voice actor was something the game should not have done, despite the fact this new voice actor sounded tougher and more dramatic.Now for the gameplay. The Prince has greatly improved his skill with weapons, so as a result the game's combat has been reworked from the ground up, for the better. Using a \"free-form fighting system\", the Prince can perform additional moves alongside his regular swordplay like flip enemies into other enemies or off cliffs, use the weapons of fallen enemies, attack while wall-running, and instantly kill weakened enemies with their own weapons while grappling them. There are so many combos and moves to perform that players now basically have the option of choosing their favorite style of combat. If you prefer to grab certain enemies, steal their weapons and throw them at other enemies, then go for it. If you prefer to dual wield the Prince's main sword along with an enemy's sword, axe, dagger, or mace, then have at it. If you want to do it all (like me), then what's stopping you? Coming up with fun and creative ways to do away with the Prince's many enemies is a blast. As for the enemies themselves, they're much more challenging this time around. The sand monsters that serve the Empress come in all shapes and sizes: red-clad sand warriors, big and bulky sand executioners, annoying sand hounds that explode upon death, and even 20 foot tall sand brutes whom the Prince must first weaken and then climb on and hack away at their heads. Unlike the enemies in the first game that could only be killed by being absorbed into the Dagger of Time, these enemies die more traditionally. There are also many more boss fights this time, some of which can be quite frustrating, but can be conquered with enough perseverence and strategic thinking. Using the Medallion which belonged to Farah from the first game, the Prince is able to further utilize the time warping abilities of the Sands of Time to reverse and slow down time, or speed himself up and blow enemies back with sand explosions. Yes, the time warping abilities are better suited for combat situations this time around, but they also still serve their original purpose: saving the Prince from falling to his death or being killed by the many (and familiar) bladed traps and pits that litter the Island of Time. While the game does indeed have a heavier focus on combat, the classic parkour and free-running aspects of the previous game are still a big part of this one; you'll be leaping and bounding from wall to ledge like any Prince of Persia fan would expect to.An interesting addition to the game is traveling back and forth between periods of time, the past and the present. In the present, the palace and gardens of the Island of Time appear ruined and dilapidated, and at times the Prince is unable to advance due to there being abysses where there used to be bridges or floors. In such situations, the Prince must then go through a sand portal which takes him to the past, so he could bypass the now (or then) nonexistent obstacle and then go back to the present and continue his journey. While standing in these portals, a rather short and cool CGI scene plays showing the Prince's surroundings appearing to repair themselves and coming to life with lit torches and red banners covering the walls as he goes back to when the Island of Time was still fully built and somewhat prettier to look at. Going to the past also gives the Prince more switch pulling and box pushing puzzles to perform, not to mention more fully functioning traps to run through. Going back to the present shows the Prince's surroundings falling apart around him, like if the Island had experienced an earthquake. The game's graphics and music are also quite different in this outing for the Prince. The characters still look good and the environments are once again large and boast impressive architectural designs, but the game looks less cartoony and colorful and more realistic and gritty, even in the portions of the game where you're in the past and everything is still new looking and vibrant. The music is of a rock and metal variety when you battle enemies, with hints of the classic Middle Eastern themes from the first game during quiet moments. As a fan of rock and metal, I enjoyed the music in this game, although I agree with others that it feels somewhat out of place in a game with a Persian setting. The addition of a couple of Godsmack themes (without vocals) was a cool addition, especially during the \"Dahaka Chases\" where the Prince runs through obstacles to get away from his advancing predator with \"I Stand Alone\" playing in the background: that spells AWESOME in my book. Many Prince of Persia \"purists\" dislike the direction this game went in, but I for one think it kept the series from having too much of the same thing and gave it some variety in style. Plus, it works really well in the grand scheme of things in the Prince of Persia series and gives it an overall sense of completion once you get into the third game. While the game is still quite linear, it's actually possible (and at times required) to revisit certain areas, but since the palace is so large, it's also possible to lose one's direction; don't bother utilizing the in-game \"map\", it's just a useless picture of the entire island. In the end, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is lots of fun, as well as much more challenging and much longer than The Sands of Time, about nine to ten hours. This game is great, so if you don't buy it, at least give it a try, maybe borrow it from someone... not doing so would be a sin.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2011"}

It looked and played just like the original PS1 versions of Grand Theft Auto, only in portable form. So, when i heard they were coming out with Liberty City Stories for the PSP, I'll admit..I was a bit skeptical that they'd do a game like GTA3 justice on the handheld(especially after Midnight Club 3 Dub Edition). Yet, after getting Liberty City Stories, I must say I'm simply amazed at what Rockstar did with the game. Load times, which were my biggest concern, were minimal. The game looks and plays like GTA3(and future iterations of it) and, in some ways, one ups it. While it takes place in Liberty City(a town we all are intimately familiar with), the missions and storyline are all new.Multiplayer modes are new and fresh for the series. After three games like this, for the PS2, I thought I'd be burned out playing yet another game but, after playing the handheld version, I became more immersed into the GTA mythos. It being a handheld version added a whole new dimension to things. Sure, controls were a bit odd since there is only one analog stick among a few other lil nitpickey things about the game. Make no mistake, though, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is the Definitive PSP game that everyone should add to their PSP game collection.In my opinion, games on the PSP have been no more than PS1 games with a PS2 graphical shine(not that it's a bad thing)...that is til this game came out. Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is a game that proves just what the Playstation Portable is truly capable of and is a game that all other PSP games should strive to match. If developers strived to match what Liberty City Stories accomplishes, just think of what type of games we could see on the system. Portable versions of Tony Hawks' American Wasteland, True Crime, Gun, or Call of Duty, perhaps? How about Champions of Norrath, or Final Fantasy?

So as far as eye-candy goes, True Crimes does a brilliant job here.Now the sound.  Again, no mistakes here!  Good sound overall, and you can't go wrong here.  Sound effects are great as well as the music.  Again, you're not going wrong.  The only thing I can say is that if you don't like Rap, you may not like the soundtrack as much. In this case it's good that you can take advantage of the custom soundtrack that the XBOX allows you to give the game.Gameplay is probably where te game begins to faulter.  The game has a \"Good Cop/Bad Cop\" system which isn't a bad idea.  Should you do things the way a cop in real life would (i.e. you don't kill those you capture, you only injure, you fire warning shots and only shoot people in the leg and such) then you'll be considered a \"Good Cop\".  Do the complete opposite and you're a \"Bad Cop.\"  There is a meter that tells you on which side of the bar you fall on.Good Cop/Bad Cop isn't too badly done, but it really brings down the difficulty level of this game.  It's fun to drive around but the game is so simple to keep to one side.  If you see someone rob a bank you can easily just hit them with your car and not kill them, which results in you being a \"Good Cop\".  If you hit him and kill him, you're a \"Bad Cop\".  This becomes simple gameplay should you approach it that way.What also makes gameplay simple is that you can choose to redo any failed missions.  Clearly you could try them over and over again until the game is done with.  BUT you could continue and leave mission failed. If you do this it effects future missions. Missions are very realistic.  You can go undercover and hope you don't blow it even.  You can do various things that a cop would do. You can search them and see if you find drugs, weapons, etc. or you could flash your badge, which will result in a suspect running or something else.What's not to like about the gameplay? Well, it's too simple for one thing.  I already talked about how you could hit a suspect with a car and not kill them, and this finishes missions easily.  The other part is that you could easily complete missions without shooting (just knock them out).  The auto-aim is very nice however.The other bad thing about the gamplay are those camera angles.  You'll find yourself constantly repositioning the camera just to see some of the action.  Because of the camera you could be \"jumped\" and never know who did it, or get shot from behind.The game presents a branching story.  The outcome depends on the missions you succeed in and whether or not you're a \"Good Cop\" or a \"Bad Cop\".  There are tons of ways to go through the story but the final confrontation is the same.  You \"could\" become a bad guy but it makes no difference.The story is actually more like something you'd see in an action movie.  You've got your average jerky character (Nick Kang) who doesn't want a partner and constantly refuses to work with his and goes at it alone.  His father used to be a part of the LAPD but died working a case. Sound familiar? It should, and it's full of chase scenes, one liners, and everything else you could want in an action movie.So while larger than Vice City by A LOT the game is actually fairly linear.  The storyline is decent (although the main character takes a bit of time to like), the gameplay is nice and overall the game is pretty good.The Good:+Great graphics and sound!+Though quite linear, TONS of missions+Lots of weapons to choose from+Branching story+Multiple endings+HUGE City to exploreThe Bad-Main character is unlikeable at first-Annoying Camera Angles-Missions are too simpleThe game overall is pretty decent. You've got a lot of freedom to enjoy and a huge map to explore.  A great experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2003"}

Fraley","summary":"Great game","reviewText":"Well my wife loves this game.  She was a huge sims 2 fan and had all kinds of expansions.  She likes the way the interface is and thinks it is an improvement.As for me.  I can say i have enjoyed playing this game more than the Sims 2.  Everything is easy to find and understand. Here is what i enjoyed about this game:Taking my sim to the park, gardening, and fishing.  My sim was easy to manage and fun to play around with. And there are plenty of other actions like when i went wondering around town and found seeds, talked to other sims and found a flower that was called \"Death Flower\".The create-a-sim was great.  There was plenty of options to make the sim i wanted.  This to me is definitely an improvement from the sims 2 in my opinion.The game pace is great.  When i want to rush through something i just click the fast button and it will speed right through it.  And it returns to normal when that task is done.  And when my sim goes to sleep the game switches to fast mode and within about a minute my sim is fully rested and ready to go.I love the easy to use interface.  Everything is easy to find and not hard to understand at all.  There are taps for career, daily needs, skills, etc. that make it easy to keep up with everything about your sim.  I will admit i have not played as much sims 2 as my wife and others(did play it quite a bit when we bought the open for business expansion) but i like this game a lot more and will definitely play it more, if i can get my wife to stop playing.The moodlets are a great addition.  And it gives you things to choose that go along with your sim.  For example, I game my sim the traits Angler, Computer Whiz, Handy, Loves the outdoors traits.  My sims life wish i chose was Perfect Aquarium were he wanted to show off a perfect fish of each kind in Aquariums.  My sim received moodlets that were along the lines of what he licked.  This game me a lot of the Lifetime Happiness points.  These pointscan be spent on Lifetime Rewards that directly effect your sim.  I bought iron bladder and my sim never needed to use the bathroom again.  There are other good Lifetime Rewards also.That is my basic feelings on the game.

{"product_name":"B00009WAUD","reviewerName":"Scottypiper \"Scottypiper\"","summary":"Another Great Mario Kart Game","reviewText":"So Nintendo follows suit again and releases a new Mario Kart game for every system. I have played every Mario Kart on all the consoles, including the Wii Mario Kart.Gameplay: Racing. While some things are different from the N64 version such as power-sliding, this game adds new features, new tracks, new battle levels, new characters, new weapons, and the ability for 2 riders per cart. Let's start with the characters. There are now 20 playable characters including 11 new ones and each player chooses 2 characters. New weapons are included for some characters such as the fireball for Mario and Luigi, the giant banana for the Kongs, and Bob-ombs for Waluigi and Wario. There are 3 difficulty classes again; 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. After completing the available three cup tours with Golden trophies, you get a 4th cup tour called the all-cup tour. This has every race track in the game. If you complete the cup with a Golden Trophy, you open up the final option in the game; mirror mode. Mirror mode is only on 150cc but each track is played in mirror mode (everything is mirrored so turns that were right are now left and vice-versa). Battle mode has the traditional balloon battles and includes two new modes. One is capturing and maintaining a Shine Sprite for as long as possible. The other is Bob-omb battle which players throw Bob-ombs at each other.Multiplayer: Mario Kart-Double Dash can have up to four players. You have the option as riding with two players per cart, or each having their own cart. With two players in one cart, new abilities are added such as the double-dash quick start acceleration and stronger power slides. One player drives while the other player handles the weapons and helps with steering. You can play versus mode and battle mode with up to four players, while only two players can compete in Grand Prix.Conclusion: Graphics are good but not a huge improvement from the N64. Controls are easy. A lot of the new tracks are great and multiplayer is still as fun as ever. Worth getting even years after the GameCube era has ended. Will play on the Wii using the GameCube controllers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2011"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"The best Spider-Man game of all time","reviewText":"Not all movie based and licensed games have to be completely average or just plain bad.  Spider-Man 2 isn't just the best Spider-Man game of all time, it's possibly the best super hero game of all time as well.  Stepping above and beyond the first game, Spider-Man 2 allows you to take on the role of the web-slinger as you swing and fight your way through a completely free roaming New York City.  And when I say free roaming, I mean free roaming.  For the first time ever in a Spider-Man game, you can touch down on the ground and interact with pedestrians and accomplish missions to earn points to build up your stats and abilities.  Along the way, you'll take on villains such as the Rhino and Mysterio, and of course Doctor Octopus, and film stars Tobey Maguire, Kirstin Dunst, and Alfred Molina reprise their roles from the film (and the great Bruce Campbell is back as well as your helpful guide throughout the game).  The voice acting is great, the graphics are pretty good while your swinging (once you hit the ground running some of the other character models become a bit blocky), but the biggest downside of Spider-Man 2 is that the missions get repetitive after a while.  Mostly it's rescue him/her, beat up group of people that's jumping you, stop robbery, help out cops, etc, etc., but you can't argue with the overall package.  Between the Spidey games and the X-Men Legends games (don't get me started on the X-Men 3 game though), Activision knows how to do licensed super hero games, and Spider-Man 2 remains the best Spidey game of all time.  All in all, if you've never taken the game for a spin, what are you waiting for?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2006"}
{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"Holy Divorce Court!","reviewText":"Since I'm a little late to the party with this review I'll try to keep it simple, and simply put, this game is well worth the release date price. Back in 2009 whenBatman Arkham Asylumcame out I thought that it would be like every other below average movie spinoff game out there, but I quickly learned that Batman AA was right up there in my book with the best single player games that I've played. Batman Arkham City is no different and perhaps even an improvement over Arkham Asylum if you can fathom that.There is a lot to this game and it is very well developed. I played on Normal difficulty and I'm glad that I did, because Arkham City's Normal difficulty is no walk in the park. I died during a few battles and even when I got used to some of the battle patterns (especially when facing goons with guns) I sometimes was down to almost no health by the end of my retry. So if you can beat Arkham City on Hard in your first playthrough you're a pro. I might give Hard a try after I beat it on Normal in order to unlock New Game+ that gives you the ability to start a new playthrough with all of the earned abilities from your first playthrough. But be advised that New Game+ won't unlock unless you do indeed beat the game on Normal or Hard first.You play as The Dark Knight and there are DLC missions where you play as Catwomen; you get the code for the Catwoman DLC free with a new game purchase. And again, just like AA, AC is indeed the \"dark\"Alan MooreBatman, not the bright and happy TV Batman. The game is super fun, sometimes dark, sometimes even creepy & scary but always exciting to play. If I had to name the most important piece of advice to playing Batman AC, especially when you're facing armed enemies, I'd say remember that it's an action/stealth game, and for the parts that require stealth...you'd better be stealthy!Just like Arkham Asylum there's a lot of hand to hand combat where you start out with basic moves, and as you progress through the game you earn points towards upgrades that allow more advanced takeout moves, or you can apply the upgrades to increased armor or gadget upgrades. There are hours of side missions and plenty of Riddler Trophies to find in Arkham City; I love games where you are rewarded for searching for hidden stuff but not required to find the hidden stuff in order to progress through the game. Rest assured though, the more you search the more upgrade points you'll acquire making your life as Batman a lot easier. But the challenges and Riddler Trophies are much more difficult to attain in AC versus AA...it's like the game developers said, \"Hey, everyone's played AA, so let's up the difficulty.\"There are plenty of  \"restrain from throwing controller moments\" in Arkham City...especially getting some of those dang Riddler Trophies to unlock. Similar to AA, some of the Riddler Trophies are in out of reach areas that you won't be able to get to unless you have the right equipment upgraded. I don't have a problem with that, but other Riddler Trophies are locked in puzzles that need to be solved...those are the ones that can give you fits. But don't worry, there are plenty that are just there for the taking if you simply look in the right place.I promised to keep this simple, and I'm feeling like I could go on all day about how impressive Batman AC is for a sequel. So let me just wrap up by saying that there aren't many games that I'd put ahead of this that I'd recommend. There are hours and hours of gaming that you'll get addicted to in your first AC playthrough, and then you get to do it all again with a New Game+. Good luck explaining to your wife why you've disappeared. Warning: \"C'mon, it's Batman!\" is not a well received excuse for not wanting to go out to dinner on a Friday night. This game could seriously end all communication with the outside world for weeks.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2011"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City.

{"product_name":"B004EW7LSY","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Fig.","summary":"A Great Game Flying Under The Radar.","reviewText":"I'll be honest, when I first heard about this game, I didn't expect much from it, but boy, was I wrong. Binary Domain puts you in the boots of a soldier named Dan, the main character. He's part of what they call the Rust Crew in a mission to Japan to capture the head of an organization who is violation of the Geneva Convention for creating advanced robots, also known as Hollow Childs, I won't go into much more detail, because I don't want to spoil the experience for you. The game uses voice commands, but not with Kinect; it requires a headset to do so. For example, you can give your team mates orders to charge, regroup, etc. All by pressing LB and sayin the command shown on the screen. A very neat feature that keeps you more involved. This feature however, can be turned off and you can simply chose your commands by pressing LB, followed by either X, Y, A or B.The game has a fluid play, the camera and aiming mechanics are well done and there's little to complaint about. You have the option to upgrade your main weapon with currency given to you as you kill enemies, once you have some cash, you get to spend it at \"stores\" that look like ATM machines, there you can buy upgrades for both your gun and the character. You also can do this for your team mates. You are given three weapon slots, selected with the D-Pad. Left is for the main weapon, top is for you hand gun (infinite ammo) and right is for a secondary weapon which can be a sniper rifle, light machine gun or submachine gun. It is important not to only upgrade your weapon, but to also do it for your mates, to increase their range, power, clip size, accuracy, etc. You are given first aid kits which you can use on yourself if you go down, you must use it before time runs out and die. You can also use your kit to heal fallen mates and they can do the same for you if you request it. Know this though, each member, including yourself, are given only 3 kits. If they ran out, they can't heal themselves or you, so take cover to avoid too much damage.Multiplayer is fun as with many others, you rank up, etc. So I won't much into detail.The story is surprisingly good. It's a rare ocation when a game keeps me from skipping the in game cinematics; normally I skip it and get on with the action, but this game had me interested throughout; and the end, is actually pretty good. Again, no spoilers.Graphics are on par with such games as COD BO and MOH, environment/backgrounds are well designed and I didn't notice much recycling or washed out colours.The music, although not that important to me, does not really add to the game. It's standard at best.Some have compared this game to Gears, I can see why; you take cover the same way you would in Gears, this includes going over obstacles and such. But to be honest and fair, comparing this game to Gears really does not make much sense; Gears was/is a big budget game, so don't expect this game to have the same quality, don't get me wrong though, this game's quality is not questionable. Some others have compared it to Mass Effect, and that I simply do not understand. Mass Effect is a total different beast all together.The game has some flaws, and mostly due to friendly AI. Throught the game, you are required to interact with your team mates constantly, which gets old and down right irritating. Having to say \"Okay\", \"Damn It\" and so on, to answer/react to your team mates meaningless conversation is just plain stupid and gets old very quick. You have a partner named \"Bo\", whom I wanted to shoot after 10 minutes into the game, he wouldn't shut up. Luckily though, not so late into the game, you are given the option to chose different mates, so I got rid of BO and his dumb !#@.One of the biggest complaints I had about this game is how useless your mates are. In times of heavy weapon fire, they constantly get on your way and you can't avoid shooting them, which results in them saying stupid crap like \" are you trying to kill me?\", which had me cursing at my TV. At times, specially for boss fights, it seems you are the only one shooting and doing actual damage.All in all, this game is fun and will keep you glued to your controller to the end. It is fluid, easy to control and there's no camera issues. This is one of those games that didn't get enough media coverage/marketing, so it flew right under the radar and I'm afraid many gamers will not know about it until it probably hits the bargain bin. It is worth the full price IMO, but if you still have doubts, like I did, rent it first, you'll see then how good it is. And do yourself a favor, ignore reviews that try to compare it to Gears or Mass Effect. All shooters are the same, follow a story, aim, shoot, kill the main bad guy, the end, so why compare?Anyway, as a third person shooter, it delivers and the story won't disappoint you. 4 stars due to the AI, but 5 stars for fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2012"}

I do want to preface the review a little by stating that GOW 1 & 2 are the reasons I have a PS3 today and therefore are real good games.So on with the review:To me, this game was just okay.  It was a prettier version of been there, done that in games one and two.  The controls are exactly the same which was disappointing because I was really looking forward to being able to view 360 degrees of the game rather than the game leading me to look in one particular direction.  I think if there was a 360 degree view, I would have rated this game the best I ever played.This game is not for nor should be played/watched by children.  And it is not just because of the violence.  Though I am not complaining from a personal standpoint, there were scenes of nudity and lesbian acts that I do not feel children should be subjected to.  That may seem obvious from the rating but if parents feel that it is only violent and therefore it is fine, then think again.Overall, I think the makers of the game should really have taken better advantage of the PS3's capabilities.  As it is, I am not sure I would play another GOW game.  I like the idea and the story but do not like the unilateral game play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKDOV2","reviewerName":"Q","summary":"Buggy yet ultimately fun tween 1 and 3.","reviewText":"Having played three before this one (not having been too impressed by the first Saints Row), this game felt unpolished and rushed. The first five minutes or so of this game are horrible, down to the graphics chugging at about 10 fps during a water/boat sequence. Once I got to the main land, I ejected the disc, and put it aside, mostly abandoned. I then went back and beat the first one, which I hadn't done, however enjoying the third in the series, I decided to give it another go. I guess it prepared me more for this sequel. Once out of the first five minutes, the graphics performance improves, there are more \"distractions\" in this edition than the first, and many of the power-ups you'd earn in the third one are here (available after completing those distractions). The story is OK, the graphics OK, the map is bigger than the first, however, similar enough to bring back that nostalgia - a sort of, see what they have done with the place since you've been gone.This title ultimately paves the way for the very polished third in this series, and I recommend it if you need a time filler, or a fairly well achievement chore.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZBP6","description":"","reviewerName":"From Detroit","summary":"Better than Cataclysm","reviewText":"Over all, I would say that World of Warcraft remains to be the best MMO that I have played.  There as a three month tryst with Final Fantasy XI before WoW, and another few month fling with Guild Wars 2 during my 2 year hiatus from WoW.  But I inevitably came back to this game.  I played until the launch of Cataclysm, which in my opinion, was dismal.  They ruined my favorite class (ret paladin) and seemed to try to recycle a lot of old content. So I quit.  Anyway, after chatting with some friends about our old days, I decided to give Mists of Pandaria a try.  They insisted it was better.  Well, they were right.  It is an improvement upon Cataclysm.I started playing about 3 weeks ago, and since then, I've managed to level 2 of my higher levels to 90, and see the first 2 sets of raids.  I have returned to many changes. Many were for the better.  Some, well... not so much.  Here is what I've noticed.  (Please note that I have been away for a couple years, and I might not know when such changes were implemented.)The good:1.  On an asthetic level, WoW has seen some substantial improvements.  You don't need the best hardware to crank everything up, which seems to be Blizzards MO.  The world is still a bit cartoon like, but that is part of its charm (and always has been!)2.  The Raid and Dungeon finder has made things much nicer for casuals.  You do run the risk of running with inappropriately skilled/geared players, but over all, it is a nice feature.  It seems to have been improved since I quit (and Raid Finder is completely new.)  Some folks complain about LFR for a number of reasons - lower gear quality and reduced fight mechanics.  I am personally fine with this.  I mainly play to see content.  Not have the best purples.  It would, however, be nice to see a buff given to tanks who meet the minimum gear requirement.  Speaking as someone who started tanking heroics with an item level of 440 last week, it can be hard to maintain threat when 2 or 3 of your DPS are pulling 100k plus.3.  Guild Perks!  Experience and rep boosts, mass resurrection, faster flying...  The list goes on.  Very nice for leveling an alt!  (Though it could be bad if you're a sucker for the story...  you tend to outgrow quest zones and dungeons pretty fast.)4.  Traveling is considerably more convenient.  Most classes have at least an optional bonus to movement speed perk to choose from, and they seem to have allowed mounts in more areas.5.  I leveled a Death Knight from 55 as a blacksmith/miner.  They rearranged the zones, so gathering had a few hang-ups.  But once I got going, things were a lot easier (mainly because I could fly from level 60 on.)The Bad:1.  The change I like the least is probably the Cross Realm business.  Zones are flat out crowded now.  I've had to wait in line to kill a unique mob, and folks seem to be fighting over items to be gathered.  Depending on the time of day, questing can be nearly as bad as it is during launch week.  I get that Cross Realm dungeon finder was necessary.  I can even see why they'd want it for regular zones, as well.  But they should tone it down a bit.  (I was in Loch Modan last night, and the place was CRAWLING with panda.)2.  Scenarios!  These are flat out boring.  There is one that gives you a 450 weapon of choice.  That is worth doing once you hit level 90, and if you didn't get lucky in any of the higher level dungeons on normal mode.3.  The Isle of Thunder.  It's a crazy rep grind.  I suppose it would be worth it if you're in a hard-core raiding guild.  I took my Death Knight there as soon as he hit 90 (in quest greens and blues.)  It seems to me that the place was tuned for people who were at least raid-ready.  The non-elite mobs have about 500k health, and the elites have way more.4.  The music in this expansion is flat out annoying.  This is sad, because music has been one of Blizzard's strongest suits in ALL of their games.5.  I didn't spend much time in Cataclysm dungeons, and I didn't step foot in a single raid from that content.  The dungeons in this expansion are pretty lame.  I don't care much for the story line in many of them (Stormstout Brewery, for example.)  The boss fights and mobs seem pretty annoying.  I appreciate that they are trying to add new mechanics into the dungeons.  Some things worked.  Some didn't.  It would be nice if they allowed us to skip some of the NPC dialog once we've seen it once.6.  While the story line here seems a bit more original than what they did with Cataclysm, I still don't care for it as much.  The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King both had outstanding stories.The Nit-Picks:1.  Pandas!  This was just like all the other expansions where they introduced new classes/races.  Everyone needs to be the new thing.  I rolled a dwarf shaman, and I was the only non-panda in a Shadowfang Keep run!2.  My Death Knight is a blacksmith. I've leveled up through WotLK in the passed.  Cataclysm's gear seemed like it was pretty logical.  I am not happy with some of the changes they made.  All the ghost-forged armor pieces have \"random enchants.\"  This would be more annoying if we weren't tripping over ghost iron nodes, but is still slightly annoying none the less.  There is no control over what stats you get on a piece of armor, and sometimes you have to make several in order to get the desired result.  It is nice that they gave you about a 10% chance to make a level 415 blue, however.  I also don't like how they made Living Steel a main component in all epic gear (in relatively large quantities, no less.)  Lightning Steel is pretty much useless.  The only purpose it serves is to \"learn\" new plans on a once-daily cool down.3.  A huge focus on daily questing for rep.  I liked the dungeon grinds better.  Wrath of the Lich King seemed to have the best flexibility with rep grinds!  Choice daily quests and tabbards for the desired faction!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2013"}

What's even better, it's a portable game that you can carry around with you.Fire Emblem is a game that falls under a category of games called \"strategy Role-playing-games\" or \"strategy RPG\". This genre has lots of great games, which includes Final Fantasy Tactics, but Fire Emblem blows all other games in the category out of the water. In a strategy RPG, you move around your characters on a battlefield that has a grid, and you fight your opponents accordingly. Whenever you attack, the game looks like a little cut-scene where the two units do battle. Most of the time you try and wipe out the opposing force or blast your way through them to the target space.As good as all of this sounds, it's gets even better. Lots of little twists in the battles make you rethink your strategies, if a character dies, they're gone forever, so you try to avoid having one of your own units killed, and certain specifications and requirements force you to change your plot of action.If that's not a good enough game for ya, there's an INCREDIBLE storyline to the game that is very engaging and keeps you playing until the end, which is epic.There's a host of characters, topping out at more than thirty, and this game will definitely eat up your free-time.

{"product_name":"B004FYJFNA","description":"","reviewerName":"Chance Briggs","summary":"The Return of the Jedi of the Mass Effect Trilogy","reviewText":"I felt that Mass Effect 3 was good, but not great. I was a big fan of ME2, but found ME3 to be a diminished experience. For one, I enjoyed the characters assembled for your team in ME2 more. While EDI is cool and James is okay, neither of them quite match up to Samara, Thane or even Jack. Also, the loyalty missions in ME2 were a great gameplay-driven way to get to know your characters, while party interaction was limited in ME3. Furthermore, in ME1 and ME2, I felt there was an emphasis placed on maxing the speech skills. For example, talking your way out of the Wrex situation on Virmire or mediating an argument between Jack and Miranda were highlights of the Mass Effect experience, but I felt they were slightly cheapened in ME3.  My Shepard that I had taken through the entire trilogy was completely Paragon, had almost no points in Renegade, yet there wasn't a single red conversation option grayed out. I expected at least one speech-heavy challenge (like the Samara/Morinth conflict), but the best I got was talking the Illusive Man down at the end...which was basically a rehash of the finale of ME1. Finally, in terms of the final mission, I thought that ME2 had one of the most enjoyable ending sequences for this genre of game, mostly because there was an emphasis on making the \"correct decision\" knowing that your crew's life was on the line. In ME3, without going into spoilers, with the exception of the final decision, is largely a linear ending sequence without a lot of variation. Overall, I can't say that I'm disappointed in ME3, but I don't feel it matched the overall experience of ME2.Overall, I think this was a fun series with ME1 as a Space Opera, a clean Sci-Fi RPG that sometimes tricked you into thinking it was a shooter. ME2 was more of a  Sci-Fi shooter with a good story. ME3 was more of a streamlined version of ME2 with better graphics.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2013"}

Former fans and new fans can rejoice at the sheer brilliance of Dragon Quest VIII!An evil wizard named Dhoulmagus has gotten hold of a legendary scepter and has placed a curse on the castle which he got it from.  He has turned the King into a frog, and the Princess into a horse.  You, a lonely knight, are one of few to survive the attack.  Now you and a set of friends, King Trote and Yagnus, will set off on a quest to find this evil wizard and break the spell.In addition, you'll meet up with two other characters named Jessica and Angelo, who will join you in your quest.  There aren't a whole lot of characters in Dragon Quest VIII, but at least each one is unique.  Each character also has their own strengths in battle that'll prove useful to you either way.Battling is a simple turn-based battle system.  You select commands and then watch your characters tear the enemy to shreds.  The battles occur at random, but they don't pop up too often, and they're often fun.  Battles are also quick.  You can select attacks and use magic spells.  Some spells attack the enemy, some raise stats.  No different than your usual turn based RPG.In addition to the battle system, you've also got skill points.  You gain skill points by gaining levels.  Each character has four weapon skills you can spend skill points on.  Weapons like your swords, axes... so on and so forth.  Each character also has something unique for them that you can spend ability points on.  The more you spend, the better the skill.Battling is now always easy, though.  Most Dragon Quest veterans know this.  When you could be thrust into a battle with eight enemies (and there are only four of you) things can get hectic with enemies constantly healing each other, calling for back up, and even reviving dead allies!  This seems annoying, but it makes for a much more unique RPG.  One where you don't have to hold down the attack button.  You can't just go into a battle thinking that attacking is all you'll do.  Battling in Dragon Quest VIII actually calls for strategy.If you lose a battle, though, have no fear.  Unlike most RPGs, Dragon Quest doesn't have the dreaded \"Game Over\" screen.  You simply are reverted back to the church where you last saved.  You lose half your money, a small price to pay in the long run (or a hefty price, depending on how you look at it).If you do find yourself getting into lots of trouble, you'll more than likely be well prepared for the worst.  You learn a spell that helps you escape from dungeons fairly early in the game, and most of your healing assets don't cost too much money.  The game is a challenge, but not impossible.The graphics of this game are absolutely spectacular!  Fans of Dragon Ball Z or Chrono Trigger will be happy to know Akira Toriyama was brought on board to shape the world in which you're playing.  The character movements are smooth, the frame rate is consistent.  And if you're an old school gamer, the enemy designs haven't changed much.  I think some will appreciate that.  If you're not an old school gamer, fear not; the monsters aren't the same old cardboard cutouts they used to be, either.  I can't express enough how gorgeous these in-battle graphics are!  They're fast, and you'll be instantly stunned by it's beauty.The music is just as stunning as the visuals!  From the music made in dungeons and the overworld map to the voice acting.  It all shines with nothing but sheer brilliance.The game is long, and full of side quests as well.  You'll easily be playing for more than fifty hours.  The only downside to how long it'll take you is the same one that plagues most Dragon Quest games.  You'll probably spend a lot of that time leveling up.Overall, Dragon Quest VIII is worth your hard-earned cash.  Fixing the problems that once plagued the series, it deserves your gratitude.  An engaging tale, gorgeous graphics and sound, great characters--what's not to like?  Grab it, you won't be sorry.The Good+An Engaging Storyline+GORGEOUS GRAPHICS+Excellent Voice Acting+Excellent Sound+Battling is fun, fast, and simple+Wonderful character development+It includes a demo of Final Fantasy XII!The Bad-Random Battles Are Tough-Some may feel there are not enough characters-The game is long, but most of it you'll no doubt spend leveling up.I assure you those small qualms won't turn you away from this instant classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2005"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

Massive environments, challenging missions and strategic team formations highlight this latest evolution in the Sonic universe!","reviewerName":"WhitWire Reviews \"Ryan\"","summary":"Sonic's First Gamecube/Playstation 2/Xbox Game","reviewText":"When I first heard of Sonic Heroes in 2004, I was almost immediately impressed by the flashy graphics, speedy gameplay, and level designs. But does the game live up to its full potential? This review has the answser.In terms of the gameplay, Sonic Heroes separates its characters into four teams. Each team has a speed person, a strength person, and a flight person. The teams are Team Sonic--consisting of Sonic the Hedgehog, Knuckles the Echidna, and Miles \"Tails\" Prower--Team Dark--consisting of Shadow the Hedgehog, Omega, and Rouge the Bat--Team Rose--consisting of Amy Rose, Big the Cat, and Cream the Rabbit(and Cheese)--and finally Team Chaotix--consisting of Espio the Chameleon, Vector the Crocodile, and Charmy Bee. The speed characters are Sonic, Shadow, Amy, and Espio; the strength characters are Knuckles, Omega, Big, and Vector; and the flight characters are Tails, Rouge, Cream (and Cheese), and Charmy.You play and make your way through the game by switching between your speed, strength, and flight person in each team. Speed characters can do the light-speed dash, the homing attack, and the spin dash. Strength characters can use the other two characters in your group to throw/punch enemies and obstacles. Flight characters can be used to fly over long distances and stun enemies by throwing their teammates at them.In terms of the storyline, Sonic Heroes gives us a pretty simple story. For Team Sonic, Dr. Eggman is--once again--trying to take over the world, and it's up to you to stop him. Team Dark wants revenge on Dr. Eggman--as well as answers. Team Rose just wants to find out what Sonic and his team are up to. Team Chaotix wants to make some money off of doing some \"treasure hunting\".With four teams, you'd probably think there are multiple places to go. If you think this, you're wrong. All the teams go through the exact same levels. Occasionally you may run into another team and be forced into a fight with them, however.Finally for the visuals. Sonic Heroes definitely uses shinier graphics than what the Sonic Adventure series had used. At the same time, the graphics are very bright and vibrant; every Sonic game should look this way.To finish off this review, Sonic Heroes should belong in any Sonic fan's collection. Although it may become repetitive, it is still a fun and addictive game to have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001FPBZBC","reviewerName":"Vocaloid \"Digi\"","summary":"The X's Y's and B's: An unbaised review of the 360","reviewText":"The X's Y's and B's: An unbiased review of the 360Here's my review of the XBOX360:What version:After having received my XBOX360, I immediately turned it over and checked for one thing. The AC unit. This is of importance, as it has been known of XBOX's RRing on consumers and other problems because of hardware issues. It was a Jasper Unit. Jasper, being the most \"recent\" XBOX 360 system update meant that the likely chance of a RROD was slimmer compared to other products such as the falcon and even older versions of the mother-board.The box cover:Turned the box over carefully, noting a slight dent on \"Mumbo's Nuts\" screenshot on the bottom half of the box. Thumb's length. Though the crack didn't tear the box itself it, that small area was \"pushed\" into the box, causing a white line . Also noted some very slight wrinkles located near the round corners of the box, particularly on the upper-left side of the front cover.Opening the box:First, the sticker was old because it torn the surface of the box paint upon removal. A new sticker would be slightly harder to come off, and if done carefully would not damage the surface but leave a sticky residue.Now comes the tricky part. The box itself took a little longer than expected, having to grab the side of the box and then wiggle the slippery-tight cardboard flap out of it's hiding place. Possibly annoying for folks with smooth hands who want to get to the console straight-away.Inside the box:The unit was covered in it's original packaging. Turned the system over to examine it until I heard a loose, squeaking noise. Turned the unit over again, hearing that sound once more. More than likely it could have been the DVD drive, as I have read articles of people's XBOX's having to be replaced because the spindles on the drive wore out.That's like buying a brand-new DVD player with a wobbly/loose dvd drive. Seriously Microsoft, this shouldn't even be on ANY of your units! That's why the label says \"Do not move console with disc inside\". Could moving the unit potentially knock the axles out and scratch the disc? Probably.The items:After having to pull out some useless cardboard materials I finally got to the meat of the console's accessories on the bottom of box. The control, the AC, the output cables, batteries, the game (which was hidden within one of those cardboard sleeves), 6 manuals and a plug.As for the plug there has been 2 small minor dents from the tie that was used to keep the wires together. Nothing major, as the tie didn't \"bite\" into the wire itself but left a barely noticeable mark upon examination.*The physical 256 MB unit is nowhere to be found which was noted to be in the box*The AC outlet is HUGE. It literally looks like a plastic wired brick.  Microsoft, why the brontosaurus size AC? Does it REALLY take that much power to run this console? No wonder why i've heard of consoles overheating! This thing is like a giant eyesore!Controller:The controller itself is funny. It had the surface design of a game cube (concerning the placement of the joysticks and D-Pad) and the buttons of a PS2 system. The shape of the controller itself is like a shorter, rounder version of a N64 controller (without the \"third\" man in the middle). Holding the controller felt awkward and unnatural to the curves of the hands at first try. Pushing down on the joysticks made the small click-noises that a PlayStation controller does.  Unfortunately there is no recharge cable available with the wireless controller. There is a Power button in the middle of the controller.Setting Up:I would recommend having enough space before starting this. Thanks to the mini-surge like ac adapter, one would have to make adjustments on an a smaller surface. The box came with a quick-instruction sheet (one of the manuals). Simply by following the instructions the entire process took no more than 3 or 4 minutes. The AC adaptor is \"orange\" when it's plugged into the wall. The controller had a small piece of paper in one of the batteries sockets. This was taken out, the batteries were pushed inside, and the controller was closed.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Playing XBOX360:The first thing to notice about the machine is how loud it is. Immediately after turning it on, the AC's Orange light it turns Green. Followed by an annoying, vacuum sound of a fan that would suit a Windows 98 system, not a 2009 console. Compared to the PS2's silent almost non-existent noise, this is a draw-back. I expected, for the prices going for this console that it would have little to no noise.As a first-time user you'll have to go through a configuration set-up. Very easy. After finishing everything insert the arcade disc that came with the console. You'll be greeted by a cheesy-yet funny tutorial video that'll explain the rest of the features.The Good and the Bad:Pro's:-Wireless Controller with Power On/Off feature-Large Library of Games for the system-Ability to playback dvd video's-Live-Support/Internet ability for multiplayer games-Download games-Extra games/demos included not on arcade disc were on system.*Note* Had the Xbox360 running for two hours straight and experienced no over-heating problems. The unit is fairly cool to the touch except for the vents over the fan. The air was slightly warm.Con's:-Physical Memory unit is not in package(Can save games in internal memory)-Console turned ON sounds like a room filled with old computers-Mysterious \"squeaking\" noise can indicate a \"loose\" part inside the console or possible wearing down.-No re-charger for your controller.-Games on the XBox360 have a tendency to be worth $50+-That AC adapter is annoying and takes up WAY too much space.-Accessories can be expensive.-Must pay to use online featuresOverall Score:Graphics: A+Accessories: C+Noise: C-Fun: B+Price: BMicrosoft should have ironed out the noise,  downsize the ac outlet, and fix anything that could go wrong with the system to make it a quality console that would last its years and beyond.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2009"}

Rhodes","summary":"Pleasantly Surprised","reviewText":"As far as video games go, Metal Gear Solid has been a franchise that has had a special place in the hearts of many a gamer.  It has, over time, grown to really change the face of gaming.  But every franchise has to go in a new direction at some point, or risk becoming rather stale.  Metal Gear has usually been pretty good with keeping up with the times while maintaining the heart and soul of what the original Metal Gear started in the 1980's.  But sometimes there's an experimental moment as well.  Metal Gear Rising is that experiment.There is a lot of risk going along with Metal Gear Rising.  The first is that there isn't a lot of actual sneaking done in this one.  A lot of it is intense fast paced action.  The second is that while there is definitely a story, it's not really the focus.  Certainly there are a few cutscenes thrown into the mix, but for the most part Metal Gear Rising makes sure to let you know right off hand that this is a very different beast of a game.  It's not Metal Gear Solid.  It's Metal Gear Rising.  And it does quite a bit to separate itself.The most obvious knack at this is the gameplay.  Players used to Snake's antics of sneaking around, going without being detected and putting guards to sleep will have this replaced by Raiden, a cyborg ninja, jumping into combat and taking down the bad guys in graphic and gory fashion.  There are lots of combos and light and heavy strikes to chain together as you take down your enemies.  And some moments look incredibly absurd as you go about it.  You'd think, watching gameplay segments, that pulling off many of the stunts would be tough.  It's really not.  A lot of the combat is fast pace and flows rather well.  It can be difficult to really learn and grasp at first, but there is little wrong in the way of how the combat flows.Raiden can also enter a blade mode where his concentration becomes heightened and time slows down so that you can slice your enemies into hundreds of pieces.  Raiden can also pull out certain enemies spines, which serves as a repair unit that can restore his health.  You can also parry blows and parry counter blows.  A tactic you'll have to master if you wish to play through Metal Gear Rising on its higher difficulty settings.  You'll also need to master dodging.  The gameplay isn't quite as complex as it looks.  It's a rather simple to learn.  It can be difficult to master, but at least it's accessible.The other big thing is the actual story itself.  It's not a bad story by any means, but it is most certainly a forgettable one.  You won't be playing Metal Gear Rising and remembering it for any type of story or even really the characters within it.  You'll mostly play through the story and pay attention because it's there, but it's not the element that sticks out.  There are plot twists, sure, but nothing you won't see coming.  And this means that from time to time you'll feel as though the cutscenes are slowing down what is otherwise a fast paced game.  As I said before, Metal Gear Rising is doing what it can to separate itself from the Solid portion of the series.The campaign itself is pretty short.  Maybe four or five hours at best. There are a few VR missions to play and the game does come complete with some replay value.  It's also not too terribly challenging.  Unless you ramp up the difficulty, and it's not so bad to do so after a first play through.There are things which keep Rising from being all around awesome.  As mentioned, the plot is pretty forgettable.  It's not a focus here and for a Metal Gear game there is a bit of a letdown there.  The combat may be frantic and fast paced but from time to time I ran into issues with the camera.Graphically, Metal Gear Rising looks good.  And with all the intense action going on it's surprising that the game doesn't slow down much at all.  It's a very detailed game.  Likewise, the music is also good.  The voice acting is also delightful in many respects.  From a production standpoint there's not much of anything I can really complain about with Metal Gear Rising.In the end it's a good game.  It's going to take a bit for some players to get used to the shift.  This is a Metal Gear game.  It's just not that much based in stealth like the Solid series before it (and the original series before that).  This may be because Raiden has been billed, beyond Metal Gear Solid 4, as primarily being a non-stealth character.  As such, Metal Gear Rising strives (and succeeds) at taking on a different tone than Metal Gear Solid in almost every way.  For Metal Gear fans it's worth a peak.  If you are a fan of hack and slash games then it's also worth a look.  I wasn't expecting to care much for Metal Gear Rising, but in the end I grew to like it immensely.  It is, overall, a really good game that is worth giving a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2013"}

I finally broke down, grabbed the credit card and bought an Xbox 360 Elite.With a heavy heart I say:  I love it.I now have nearly three times that of my Playstation 3 collection just a few months later.  I have just as many Xbox peripherals as I do the Playstation, and the recent blockbuster, best-selling titles I have purchased for the Xbox instead of the Playstation.  This is because of the enchantment of the Xbox \"Achievement\" scoring system, rewarding the player with (unfortunately useless) global points for making various accomplishments in every Xbox 360 title.I have begun researching the PS3's \"barely used\" resale value.Besides playing games - and there are tons to choose from - the Xbox is well-built to use the internet.  Though I myself am not a big online-gaming enthusiast, I can still use it to upgrade games, download visual content for background themes and the like.  I have even begun downloading TV shows.  The system allows you to establish 1-on-1 chat rooms, which I use often to talk to my brother who lives cross-country.  We can catch up on current events while playing two different games.  The PS3 allows you to chat, but you can't do anything else while chatting.Unfortunately, the Elite has one major limitation.  In fact, the feature that makes this system \"Elite\" is it's biggest drawback - the 120 gb harddrive.  My PS3 only has 40 gb's, and I've already packed it with MP3's and movies (honestly - what else is it good for??)  What drew me to purchase the Elite Xbox (besides it's black color which blends much better into home-entertainment setups) was it's large storage capability.  However, Microsoft has made it impossible to download or copy any music content onto the Harddrive.  The only way to import music is to \"burn\" it from a CD.  Obviously the intent here is to discourage piracy, but it has also alienated any iTunes subscribers or the like.  I probably would have been just as happy with a standard Xbox 360.  I still have over 100 gigs available!Thus the benefit of the Elite is to be able to download lots of game content, pictures, videos, etc.  This comes at a cost, as very few of these downloads are free.  Take that into consideration before you buy.System malfunctions seem to be rare - a few game crashes here and there.  I am sympathetic to earlier owners of malfunctioning systems.  As of this writing, May 2008, I'd say you'd be \"good to go\" buying one of these systems.Microsoft I apologize.  I've complained about a fair amount of money I've given you over the years, but I have to confess - you did this one right.  I look forward to many, many more hours of hardcore, balls-to-the-wall gaming.Look for me online - my gamertag is \"Vipera Raddei!\"","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2008"}

Heavy Rain is a great experience. It has great graphics, voice-acting and Story-telling but controls so uneven (and awkward) I had a hard time calling it a video-GAME. Deadly Premonition has PS2 level graphics, believable voice-acting, a great odd-ball story and so much variety in gameplay I have no problem calling it a video game. In fact in-spite it's many short comings (which I'll mention later) it has more the feel of the old point-and-click adventure games than Heavy Rain.The story of Deadly Premonition takes place in a small american town where a local girl has been murdered brutally and you're an FBI agent called in to catch the killer. The characters of this game all have oddball quirks which will remind most people of Twin Peaks (with a little SUDA 51 thrown in). You're main character talks to an imaginary friend named 'Zach' and sees messages in his coffee. The oddball charm of this game in my opinion is what keeps alot of the more unpleasant aspects of the gameplay tolerable.The game splits between sand-box style exploring (more Yakuza than GTA), driving, shooting (ALA Resident Evil 4), and adventure game style. Throw in side quests for cash (though everything you do seems to give you $$$), clothes customization, eating, sleeping, shaving, and card collecting and you have the most dynamic game released for a  console. Unfortunately the controls of this game are mediocre at best though were never frustrating enough to make me stop playing.Also this game is long. I think my first play-through took me about thirty hours and I didn't do alot of the side quest missions.The sound and graphics of this game will be deal-breakers for alot of people:-The background sounds (office noise, woodland creatures, footsteps etc) and voice-acting are actually very well done. The more direct sounds are okay until you realize that every door opens with the same noise (no difference between metal and wood) and the music keeps looping the same four songs. Also the sound keeps changing volume for some reason.-The Graphic animation in the game (especially with shadows) is very well done but the textures look very much like PS2 graphics (and even worse the outdoors almost look PSONE).What's sad is just with a bit more polish this game would've been an all and out winner: smooth out the controls (especially driving and combat), re-edit the sound and music, hell take an extra year and buff-up the graphics. I'd actually pay $60 for a game like this.Even with my list of complaints I really enjoyed my play through Deadly Premonition (and am still going back to it). It's not perfect (far from it) but it's dynamic gameplay and oddball charm will keep the right person entertained almost more so than the latest gameplay releases. The $20 price tag doesn't hurt either.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2010"}

I love Final Fantasy, and I love FF9, however for me it is the weakest of all the recent FF's (7,8,9 and 10, not including X-2 which isn't really in the series as such).My main gripe with the game is that it was far too easy, on my first time completing it, I only died once, and that was because I ran into the secret boss Hades by mistake.  I also did not have to go out of the way to build the character levels up like in previous games.  I know some find this annoying, but for me, it is an important part of the challenge of a good RPG, and by not having to build the characters up, it is only catering to the casual gamer.Despite this it is still a great game, i've never played a bad FF game, the locations are great, the plot is good, though the characters aren't especially engaging.  As usual there is plenty to do outside of the regular game, though again not as much as previous FF's and the card game is c**p compared to Triple Triad on FF8.  I would honestly recommend this game to anyone, despite what i've said it is a great game, it just felt like a disappointment on the back of FF7 & 8 (I honestly don't know why people rate this higher than 8, I cant see it myself at all).Please note as well, avoid the official strategy guide for this game, it is awful, see my review for more info.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2005"}

But this is a suitable replacement. It has an improved battle system, special paper moves, and you get to play as Bowser at some points. However, I thought it was a little too similar to its predecesor. There is a forest, a creepy old town, an ice world... just like in the last game. Many of the characters are similar, too. There also seems to be a lot of talking in this game which you are unable to skip. If you keep dying at a boss, you have to view the scene before it over and over. Perhaps it isn't as bad as I think and its just going through it twice. Either way, I was half tired of this game before I got very far. If you never played Paper Mario, you will like this just fine and you don't need to play both.

I attempted to Download and install the enhanced version, but it was a no go. It is apparant that I'm not alone in this either as a lot of others have been unsucessful in downloading it. Initially, I was more than a little ticked off as after I had installed it, it kept crashing and was an exercise in frustration. I had pretty much written the game off, as I had just installed a new Nvidia 8400 GS Video card. After looking at the specs on the card, I realized that I had made a bad choice. I then purchased am Nvidia 8600GT card and problem solved and I was hooked. The decisions you make during the game will determine the direction of the game. You will ultimately reach the same end, but as the saying goes, getting there is half the fun, and this is certainly no exception. The enhanced version supposedly adds two new adventures as well as all the other aforementioned goodies. My advice would be to skip the frustration and agravation of the download and just buy it as I intend to do. I don't know why it was censored, as all indications were that what was censored in The Witcher (Nudity), was present in God Of War and other games. So much for consistancy. This game has a strong storyline and a lot of interactivity. plus the graphics are great. You do need to pay attention to your computer specs. You should be able to run it with a 1.5 Ghz processor,Preferably 2.0 Ghz. also, if you are running Vista, you should have at least 2 gb of ram and preferably 3 or 4. As far as graphics go, do not even consider running it with an onboard graphics chipset, it isn't going to work. You need a good PCIe graphics card with a bit transfer rate 128. Also, with a PCIe card, be sure you have, at least, a 450w and preferably 500w PSU. Although it does't require something along the lines of a DELL XPS 721 H2C to play it, it does take more than an \"entry level\" computer. I played it on an eMachines T5212 that I had made a few changes to. It had a Pentium D 925 ( 3.0 Ghz) processor ( I have since changed it to a PD 945 (3.4 Ghz) ), 2 Gb ram, Nvidia 8600GT PCIe graphics card, and a 500w PSU to power the thing. Most systems \"out of the box\" can be upgraded to some extent and it is always worth it to max it out over time or as the budget will allow. This will take some research to determine the biggest processor and max memory that can be run on the motherboard, but is worth it in the end. In my opinion, this is ultimate RPG and new standards have been set with this game. Charlie S.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2008"}

Just know that the game isn't perfect.First, I'll admit that I am both a big fan of the 24 series and also of Keifer Sutherland. We were too busy to watch the first seasons live, but instead we waited for each one to end and then rented the DVDs for a full-out marathon of watching them. It really helped not to have to wait through commercials or for the next week to come to see what happened. So I'm probably the ideal target audience for a game like this.I also love shooting games and Bond-style games, so I really was looking forward to playing this. It has the real voices of Keifer and other cast members, and unfolds based on the time between Season 2 and Season 3. It uses the time music style and intro 24 addicts know and love. Your game is broken into \"hour long segments\" which in reality probably take you 15 minutes or so to play through, depending on your gaming skill.Unfortunately, gameplay just did not live up to the expectations. The camera was *awful* - there were numerous problems that made the game very frustrating, very quickly. At times you're running along in various terrorist areas, crouching behind cover, jumping over boxes, peering around doors. You might have a few fellow CTU units with you who do basic operations like blowing open doors, but they're rarely any help in a firefight.The enemies don't show great AI either. It also gets frustrating that an enemy might suddenly decide to surrender while you're in the middle of shooting him - and by the time you've pulled your finger from the trigger, he's already killed by the bullets that were in the air when he surrendered. So you get penalized for his death.There are also little decoding style puzzles, car driving missions and so on tossed in to keep variety interesting. It figures that none of them are either challenging or fun to play. With all of the thousands of games on the market that nail each of these areas, I wasn't asking for spectacular here - just reasonable. It just wasn't.It almost seems that they raced this game out quickly in order to get sales and nothing got quite done properly. Which is a real shame, because the series is well loved by millions of people who buy the DVD sets, watch the shows repeatedly and who would LOVE to get this game and replay it to immerse themselves in the world. There is certainly great potential for replayability here, to keep going through a mission over and over to nail the top rating. If the missions were fun, I know I would gladly do that to hear Jack's voice and to be in that world. But with the way things were designed, I'm going to have to wait for a sequel to come out that hopefully spends more time in development.As a side note, this game does play fine on the PS3.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2007"}

I'm definitely not the kind of player that picks \"Hard\" out of the box, but I can keep up reasonably well. And I can't really say that I prefer one franchise (or even instrument) over another. So, I'm fairly agnostic.The turntable controller is heavier than I had expected it to be. The turntable itself is actually a really decent reproduction of the feel of a real turntable (smaller, of course). I'm almost inclined to say that it's built better than some turntables I've owned. The crossover and mixer, on the other hand, feel extremely cheap by comparison. Being left-handed, the option to move the mixer panel was very nice. Overall though, the controller is kind of difficult to manage. To get a \"proper\" feel, you need to have a table or something. At minimum, it needs to be on a flat surface.As for the game, it's exactly what you'd expect from any Hero game. Activision knows their formula works, and they're not tinkering with it. The tutorial was useful and short enough to not be annoying. Once you get to the game, on Easy mode, you're pretty much hitting the buttons on the turntable, almost exactly like Guitar Hero. There's a little scratching, but nothing that really approaches difficult. Moving to Medium, though... huge jump. Not only does the crossfader come in to play, but there's multiple-button scratching, crossfading, and longer improvision spaces. Moving to Hard is as near-impossible as you'd expect.All things considered, the turntable controller is much more challenging than other instruments I've played with on this type of game. This is the sort of game you can throw at the kid who's playing Dragonforce on the hardest setting with his eyes closed.What I really liked, though, is DJ + Guitar mode. If you've got a Rock Band or Guitar Hero guitar, you can do two-player with the turntable and guitar, or one-player with either instrument (and the system playing as the other player).The price is a bit steep for what you get, but the controller is made well enough to soften the blow. If you're a fan of the rhythm game genree and enjoy some decent mashups, this is a must-have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Jub Jub","summary":"L.A. Noire game review","reviewText":"I'd like to take a look at the game LA Noire which came out all the way back in the spring of 2011 released by Rockstar Games and developed by Team Bondi. Now I didn't get to play it till earlier this year in 2012 and I found myself regretting not playing this game when it came out because it totally deserved a place on my top 5 games of 2011. At first glance, this game looks like another GTA clone but it is far from it. It is a deep and immersive game that truly makes you feel like a detective in a film-noire crime movie. It received high scores in reviews and rightfully so but I still know lots of people who have never played this, myself almost being one of them. This is one of those games that anyone who considers themselves a gamer needs to experience.STORY: Set in Los Angeles in 1946, you play mostly as Cole Phelps, a Battle of Okinawa veteran and new beat cop with the LAPD.  Phelps' keen problem solving skills get him noticed by the police chief and heads of the detective desks in the police department and after while (four missions that act as the game's tutorial) he is promoted to detective. Throughout the game, you work multiple cases from the traffic desk, homicide desk, vice desk, and arson desk. Not to go into any spoilers but you will deal with murders, insurance frauds, serial killers, the mafia, drug rings, and scandals including Phelps' hurtles as he rises to become one of the most well known and feared detectives in LA. One of the things that makes this game work is how painstakingly detailed Los Angeles is. Team Bondi put in a lot of hard work to recreate 1946 Los Angeles, not just in physical appearance (you can go anywhere in the city as it was during that time) but also in the social issues that were going on at the time. Racism, sexism, and veterans adjusting to peace time create some of the strongest images I've ever seen of post-WWII America and it all just sucks you deeper and deeper into this game. Be warned: the murder scenes in this game are brutally realistic but once again it just adds to the feeling of being a detective. The gameplay, acting, and sound also greatly play into making this game an unforgettable experience.GAMEPLAY: Like I said before, it looks and generally plays like a GTA game however the best aspects of the gameplay does not focus on running and gunning like most similar games before it. Let me make this clear, if you pick up this game expecting an action game you will be very disappointed. This is a thinker's game and that's what makes it so great. You will be rattling your brain trying to put together the clues you've gather and trying to figure out who is lying and telling the truth. This is the core of the gameplay and it gets really tricky as the game progresses. Each time you visit a crime scene you will need to make sure to explore every inch of the area and examine everything. You have a notepad in which notes are made through your investigations and you'll want to use them during questionings and interrogations. The more clues you've gathered, the more you'll have to work with. Interrogations are the other big part of the game and you will be racking your brain with some of these. As you ask your questions, you must determine whether or not they are telling the truth, lying, or give doubt to what they are saying. You'll probably notice how realistic everyone's facial animations look in this game. That's not just to make to game look good, it's a gameplay mechanic. Part of what you will be using to judge if someone is telling the truth or not is by watching their facial expressions. This gets really tricky but is so satisfying when you're able to catch someone in their own lie.Now like I said, getting interrogations to come out the way you want them can be really hard but there is help. You gain intuition points throughout the game by successfully questioning someone and/or getting a good cop grade when completing a case. You can use these during interrogations to take away some of the options to help you deduce if someone is telling the truth or not. I found myself trying to use these as sparingly as possible mainly because, while this gameplay mechanic is challenging, it is very rewarding and fun to try and figure out which, once again, plays into the immersive feel of this game and making you really feel like a detective. Help also comes to you during your investigations in the form of the partners that you get throughout the game. While some are more helpful than others, you can always go talk to them about what you should do next. The game missions are actually very linear however you don't really notice it since the entire city is there to explore but you will feel driven to go to your next objective and what not which makes the missions feel more open than they really are. There is a lot of replay value to each case as they can have multiple outcomes based on how well you do with your investigation. However, the outcome, no matter how bad, doesn't really affect the overall story at all which is a shame because this was a game that could have used more than one ending.Driving is another big part of the game. There are nearly 100 actual car models that would have been on the road in 1946 that you can find and drive. Like in similar games, you'll want to go as fast as you can all the time and end up crashing into everything because no one else is driving like that. In this game, that's not the best idea as it can hurt your case performance points though there is a free drive mode where driving like a mad man won't count against you and it is fun for mindless road rage. Of course, you do find yourself in car chases throughout the game and they can be frustrating at times. Not knowing your way around in a case can lead you into a dead end or getting caught on the corner of a wall or something as your target speeds away that can lead to a failure of the mission and restart at the last check point. However, this is something that is common in open sandbox type games so it's nothing unique to LA Noire. There are also foot chases where you have to chase down a suspect. This tends to happen a lot and it gets kind of annoying each time it happens. Much like with the car chases, if you get lost and lose your target, its game over. The action segments in general in LA Noire are not handled too well and hard kind of rare for what you'd expect from a game like this. They are there but they are much more spread out throughout the game. The shooting mechanic is pretty bare bones and while it is simple enough, it doesn't happen so much so I was usually taken back when I had to try and remember how the shooting worked because you just don't use it that often. There are even some platform action segments which can be pretty difficult as well. This game does let you skip past these action parts if you die too many times but I personally find that kind of cheap though I did find myself using it once. Like I said, action is not what this game excels at, this is thinker's game and that is what sets LA Noire apart from other similar games and what it does so well and makes this game so memorable.GRAPHICS: What you will notice that stands out the most is the facial animations for all the characters in this game. MotionScan technology was developed for completely capturing the faces of the game actors, capturing every single movement of someone's face. What we get is true acting in a video game, not just voice acting over the animation of a game character. Something like this has never really been done before. The sites of Los Angeles such as landmarks and other locations were recreated for this game and look amazing. The crime scenes, apartments and houses are very well furnished and look like someplace someone would actually live instead of just decoration for the game. Like I said the facial animations will steal the show but there is a lot to look at when you're not too busy with investigations.SOUND: The music in this game is just great. The jazz and big band type music from the time period makes for a beautiful and fitting soundtrack and is the icing on the cake. The sound effects all sound great and work into the gameplay as well. When doing investigations of crime scenes, as you walk past a clue, a piano chime will play by the object letting you know to check that object out. It helps you inspect things that do not appear as obvious some other things at the crime scene. The voice acting, my god, this is flat out some of the best voice work for a video game I've ever heard and works so well with the facial acting. It really feels like you are part of a movie.Overall, this is a game I feel has sadly become rather underrated since its release.  It truly makes you feel like a detective and really makes you exercise your mind trying to solve these cases, especially if you want to go through and try to get a perfect score on all of these. If you're only into action with games like this, then I'd recommend Sleeping Dogs or a GTA title then. But if you're like me, something like this is a great change of pace from just running around and shooting bad guys. The game has dropped in price a lot so it shouldn't be too hard to find this game for $20 or less if you look hard enough. I highly recommend this game.OVERALL: 9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2012"}

It's exciting and interesting from the very first second and barely lets up. There are surprises and action around every turn. They introduce and pace new game elements properly so it doesn't get repetitive and keeps you on your toes. Take the premise of the TV show Lost (without the lack of focus and direction the show plot had) and combine it with the excitement of the Uncharted series and you have the new Tomb Raider. Not to knock the previous Tomb Raider games, but the technology finally caught up with the concept. Sure the developers borrowed from other games, but they did it a way that gives the game it's own life and feeling.I'd recommend this over almost everything that came out in this genre during the last 2 or 3 years. Top notch, and hopefully more to come in the future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2013"}

The movement you get used to, and the upgrades to the weapons really added some new levels as you went.  I also liked that you couldn't upgrade straight through them, but could only upgrade each &#34;version&#34; of a weapon to a certain point, then couldn't do any more until you found new parts to add to it to expand the options.Graphics were very nicely done, and I never had any stutter, blurring, pixelation, or any other issues common to some of the more graphically intensive video games.It's lengthy, with lots of things to collect and a lot of places to go.  But once you've worked through an area, I wish some &#34;bad guys&#34; would return again to fill spaces.  I had that happen only in one or two places, so once an area is cleared, it's cleared, and returning to it leaves nothing to do if you've found everything.But since there's so many areas to work through, it's not enough to take a star off.I got this on a gold box deal a while after it was released so I got it for cheap, and it was definitely worth every penny.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2013"}

It isn't as bad as what most have been saying, I do like it, I dont love it, and Amazon even claims that it is a best seller..If you are a fan of the series, and you are not upgrading this season to the next gen, then I would pick this up!  You better believe there will be some sale for Black Friday or Christmas.I loved playing Battlefield and BLOPS, and I feel that the maps in Ghosts has a good mixture of the two.  Of course they would sit nicely with 18 players, but something had to sacrifice to maintain the high level of FPS and the smooth gameplay that COD offers.  Don't blame the game, blame your 5 year old console...I didnt care too much for MW3 maps, I felt that there was so much !@#$ on the floor that you couldnt even run anywhere without getting jammed up on some rubble, etc.  The maps in Ghosts are a lot more clean, even the war torn maps are easier to run in.My only real gripe is the amount of time it takes to level up.  You don't like the first character class or gun assigned?  Too bad, play for 3 hours until you get enough in game currency to purchase something else.  So go ahead and grab this game on a sale or buy a used cop.

{"product_name":"B002I098JE","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Scott","summary":"2nd Best in the Series","reviewText":"Ghosts is the second best Call of Duty game in the series, and it just barely beats out the original Black Ops. It still falls short of the lofty heights set by Modern Warfare 2 though.Spoilers aside, my only real gripes with the single player mode are that:1. It was heavily advertised as a &#34;Post-apocalyptic&#34; setting. The truth is, only 2-3 out of 18 levels take place in this setting and the rest is your standard Call of Duty snow, urban, industrial areas. I was bummed out cause the idea of rogue agents fighting in the wild with limited resources sounded really cool.2. It ends on a cliff hanger. I'm not sure if you can see a &#34;secret&#34; ending somehow, but I beat the game 3 times. Once on the hardest difficulty, and I collected all of the collectables and the ending did not change. I don't know if they're going to release an expansion to show what happens but it was bizarre to see the game, espcially a blockbuster like Call of Duty, end this way.The multiplayer is more refined than the last 2 games and nearly reaches the same level of fun as MW2, but not quite. Grenades are still nerfed to kingdom come, and there are far fewer weapons total. Also, there is a ludicrous amount of perks, and attachments. Far more than nessisary. CoD has always been a gun/bullet game for me. I dont need all this extra stuff.There are several other modes included, the most notable being Extinction which is basically Call of Duty + aliens. It's, in my opinion, far superior to the Zombies mode in the previous games. Here's hoping they expand on it and add more maps.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level.

Unlike the rest of the RE series this one has NO ZOMBIES...YES!!! Finally, Capcom is starting to think. Capcom did an amazing job with this masterpiece. The game has no slow downs, no messy framerate, just raw flawless fun. Resident Evil 4 shines on one of the most succesful parts of the game and that is the gameplay. I won't go into detailed except that the controlls in this are just plain good. The new \"No camera angles\" is great and now we just see from our hero's back as he tries to save the Presidents daughter from these \"things\".The games Visuals are just simply amazing. Everything from Leon to Ashley all the way to the boss battles. It's just incredible. The games visuals unlike most games never get messy or glitched up or nothing like that...In other words...Capcom did an excellent job bringing the breathtaking visuals to the Nintendo Gamecube. The new ability to buy Weapons and upgrades from merchants is a big help and is not a hard task to do in the game. Scattered through out the game is Pestas(money)and you need em' to get those weapons, you can also find valuables that can be sold to the Merchant for some good price. Besides the breathtaking visuals, level desighn and Weapons system, did I mention that these have some of the most incredible boss battles in a game? Some of the most memerable bosses are in this game and are just as good if not better then MGS3's bosses. From fighting the giant Sea monster all the way to El Giante. Some boss battles will have your mouth drop in awe...In other words...Capcom knew what they were doing..Does the game live up to the hype?...YES. Unlike overrated halo 2 and GTA this game acctually lived up to it's hype(will for the RE gamers like me atleast)and is my pick of 05' game of the year!

Resident Evil4 was at one point a tiring but Capcom told us in the beginning of the time REZero came out that RE4 would be a totally new RE game and they were right, new weapons, new story, flawless amazing gameplay and visuals, jaw dropping Boss battles, and the return of an old character.

When abducted by Aliens you escape near death only to be thrown into a world of madness and sick revolting creatures to save your girls life, in space.

This makes the game very unique in itself though the game does remind you a lot of Dooom 3 and also Quake. Your interactiveness with the game is also cool because you actually see your hand turning things on and off, even flushing toilets, and using hand dryers! Much like Bioshock, (but remember this game came first). This game however does have its own identity especially when it comes to being vile, the creatures are very liquidy and gross looking if that make sense, in other words the outer parts of there bodies are meat if that tells you anything. Reminds you a lot of something Clive Barker would come out with even sicker! There are large spores that give you energy, and also ones that spit out body parts all over the place, so yes this game is definitely for adults only, and there is a lot of fowl language as well, but a lot of it is very humorous. The weapons and shooting are spot on, and also the ability to walk on the ceiling and walls using gravity rails can make you wanna throw up yet makes it a lot of fun especially when killing enemies and watching them fall UP, or fly down.

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive.

GameCube also has far more games that I'm looking forward to than the other two consoles. The only real problem that Nintendo has is its lack of advertising, and its reputation for kiddy oriented games... like Mario Sunshine.The storyline of Mario Sunshine (and title) seem as though it was intended for a four year old, but then you get into the game play which is definitely too challenging for a younger player. Mario Sunshine is the most difficult Mario game to come out in a very long time, and that makes it great! Sadly this challenging little masterpiece has a couple of problems with it. Fist of all, all of the levels are tropical themed, we don't have the multi-world set up past Marios have had, no hot lava levels, no ice worlds, etc. I also miss the Mario Karate of Mario 64, and I miss it badly. The game is a blast, and no GameCube owner should be without it, whether a kid or an adult, because both younger players and adults will appreciate it, perhaps for different reasons. Little kids may actually enjoy the story elements, while adults will appreciate this masterpiece of a challenging platformer. I still like Mario 64 better though.

Its more of a cartoon feel rather than that of a real gory game. Besides the graphics, the controls are unsteardy and somewhat irritating. It takes you ages to move the charachter  providing your enimies ample time to harm you as much as possible. The player gets a really weird feeling after the charachter whom you play, penetrates his sword into the enemies body, gives it a 90 Degree rotation and then pulls it out. Eeire! I mean you may not feel it at the time, however you do later on. Trust me on that one!On the other hand, the sound is really good. If you love gore, a lot and a lot of gore, this game is for you. If your'e squeamish you might end up in a pretty bad situation!Overall, a good, worth for the money game. And yeah, the extra gore is included!!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2002"}

This is my recommendation:PrefaceUpon hearing about the PSP Go, I was thrilled. I truly believe that out of all possible avenues through which console makers can pursue the digital-download path, the portable market is an obvious first choice. However, as the release date drew near and I learned more details, my excitement wavered, ebbed, and extinguished completely before being reborn as a fiery phoenix of righteous indignation toward the system. Now, possessing all the facts, I can't imagine why any well-informed person would want to purchase the PSP Go, excluding those who simply must have the latest-greatest stuff, in spite of logic or rational thought. What follows is a colourful literary account of a would-be PSP Go purchaser- You. As you read you may become nervous or frightened. Take solace, though, no consumers were harmed in the making of this story!---So there you are, skipping gleefully out of your favourite video game and/or electronics boutique, shiny new PSP Go in-hand. You briefly wonder to yourself, \"Was it worth it to cough up the extra cash for the PSP Go or should I have settled for the budget-buy PSP 3000?\" The price difference, after all, was fairly steep. With the money you would've saved on a PSP 3000 you could have started off your game collection with two new releases.But the doubt is fleeting, for you love how much smaller and more portable the PSP Go is compared to the PSP 3000, not to mention the futuristic gadget coolness of the sliding (albeit smaller) screen! And with digital content installed to the colossal 16 GB of built-in storage, you'll never have to carry around (or lose/have stolen) a case full of UMDs ever again. The PSP Go even grants you &uuml;ber-trendy Bluetooth support so that you won't have to fuss with tangled headset cables either... except on planes, that is.No, you care not for the few extra dollars you spent on the system because you'll make it up and then some via the savings you'll accrue from discounted digital purchases. Since digital content doesn't require packaging & distribution, those savings get passed on to the consum... wait, what's that? You didn't get your discount on that first game purchase? \"Well, that's just rude,\" you say as you turn on your heel and march back into your favourite video game and/or electronics boutique! And as the sales clerk informs you that digital games cost exactly the same as retail boxed UMDs, the fantasy world in which you are satisfied with your PSP Go purchase begins to crumble and burn.Your brain tries to rationalise and come to terms with the explanation given to you for why prices are the same: because Sony can't risk the ire of its retail partners by enticing consumers to abandon retail products en masse. You console yourself with the idea that if Sony undercuts the middle man so dramatically while he is still necessary in other areas, they risk severe financial consequences.This thought assuages you until further consideration of the \"digital only\" concept culminates in the ideological connection that the bonus of not needing to carry UMDs also brings with it a consequence: the inability to bring certain games with you at all. You unwillingly embrace the simple truth that some games that have already been released on UMD won't ever be available digitally, due to other behind-the-scenes complexities of the business side of gaming, like licensing for example.Now you can really feel your energy being drained. And, upon thinking of energy, your mind alights on the design decision to remove the user-replaceable battery from the PSP Go. You begin to imagine yourself on an airplane with your PSP Go (unable to use a Bluetooth headset for fear of catastrophically disrupting sensitive equipment) and you're running low on power. Alas, with a PSP 3000 you could have simply saved your progress and swapped to your spare battery. Or, better yet, you could have started the trip with an extended-life battery. Unfortunately, your imagined-self is going to have to finish out the flight by watching Big Momma's House instead of playing Gran Turismo. Oh, the horror!What else, pray tell, must you endure? What shocking new revelation will be next in line to bludgeon your soul? What other changes has Sony made in order to humiliate you, the unsuspecting consumer?Your body falls limp and you collapse into a sobbing heap right in the middle of your favourite video game and/or electronics boutique as you come to grips with the fact that the final insult involves no change whatsoever: You never needed a PSP Go to get on the digital distribution train in the first place. What remains of your consciousness, in defiance of Sony's best marketing efforts, has just come to the realization that all of the digital content intended for the PSP Go, full games and minis alike, can be loaded onto an old fashioned, PSP 3000-compatible, Pro Duo memory stick, which sell for much, much less than the comparable PSP Go-compatible M2 micro memory cards.But as you lie there, gasping for breath, the shop employee ready to dial 9-1-1, your mental cogs complete one last revolution- you have not yet opened the package and still have your receipt!Quick as a fox, you leap up from the floor. With renewed vigor you set your recent purchase on the counter and request a refund in a tone so confident that Napoleon Bonaparte would have felt obliged to obey you. Fervently you scurry back to the shelf to retrieve a PSP 3000. As you make your way back toward the register your eyes meet a newly released game you wanted badly, but could not afford along with your PSP Go purchase. Cheerfully you pick up a copy, knowing that even after purchasing the PSP 3000 and a respectably sized memory stick, you will have enough credit left for the game as well.With purchases in hand, you exit the store. The sun feels warm against your face and the air smells crisp and clean. Birds sing, flowers bloom, and the whole world seems to be in harmony as you make your way home to break open your new toy, the PSP 3000.If God were the sort of deity to concern Himself with such worldly matters, He would have looked down upon this outcome and declared, as eye-witnesses say He did during the creation, \"It is good.\" And after that, He likely would have smote Sony for fleecing His children. Well, and because every story needs a good smiting.---Tall tales (and smiting) aside, the PSP Go just isn't a good value. It isn't any kind of value at all, actually. Considering that the reduction in size and addition of Bluetooth support are the only rabbits that the PSP 3000 can't pull out of its hat too, it hardly seems worth it to sacrifice the experience of playing those games that will inevitably be unavailable to the PSP Go, let alone spend an extra $80 for the privilege of that sacrifice.Take my advice: Whether you own a PSP now or not, until Sony comes up with a UMD conversion solution and makes every UMD game available for digital download (which will never happen), pass on the PSP Go.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2009"}

It had a much faster pace than Tekken and a more dynamic fighting than Virtua Fighter.  More importantly, it offered a deeper experience than either of the two above fighting games.And of course while everyone might have heard, few have probably played the origonal Soul Caliber(which should be played by all with the perfect Dreamcast controller).  Now you have a chance to try the game out.Lot's of people have written already about how good this game is and why.  I want to throw out something a little different.  The major differences between Soul Caliber 2 Gamecube and Soul Caliber Dreamcast.First and foremost players will notice the difference in character size.  Things have been panned out a little and that is both good and bad.  Graphics have been smoothed but with the wider angle, it is a little more difficult to follow the close in battles.  That means slight advantage to long distance players like Ivy and Kilik.  MOst damaging is the advantage to the Big Axe guys like Asteroth and Rock AKA Berserker.There has also been a big balancing since the DC version.  Key persona's like Sophitia and Cervantes have been weakend a bit while Ivy and Kilik have been enhanced.  While most will see this as a good thing, as a devoted Sophitia player, I was a little saddened.  Expect to re-tooth a little from game to game on some characters.Also impotrant is the true incompatibility of the Gamecube controller with Soul Caliber.  It has been said before but I felt a little explination was needed.  The button combo's required for playing are all easy to press on the Gamecube...too easy.  Often players will finds themselves accidently soul charging rather than attacking because they hit all three buttons rather than two.  Also while the controller is more than adequate in the control department, the smaller D pad is a little annoying.Of course the biggest difference is disk size.  Be a little more careful with that itty bitty Gamecube disc because its a lot easier to misplace than the beefy DC disk. :)Oh yah, theres also a small thing about the new ability to use different weapons with different abilities...big change.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2003"}

I play a large variety of games and usually have fairly lenient standards when it comes to having fun.  Homefront is a largely mixed bag that is ultimately a letdown.  The story is ridiculous but it's easily overlooked and doesn't detract from the overall product.  The controls are mostly fluid and responsive, and I did enjoy some of the firefights.  That being said, the game just lost my interest and \"fizzled\" roughly halfway through the campaign.  I haven't felt any desire to go back to it.  I decided to try out the MP for a couple of nights and had the same problem.  The game isn't horrible, it just doesn't have anything resembling a \"wow\" factor.

{"product_name":"B00DC7G2W8","reviewerName":"Daniel Roskeland","summary":"The best racer to date on an amazing platform! Beautifully done, Nintendo!:)","reviewText":"Like most people, I bought a Wii U for the New Smash Bros, Zelda, Animal Crossing and so on. And I've been anxiously awaiting this games arrival for a long time, as I pre-ordered is the second it was available on amazon. The last game I can say I truly enjoyed on the Wii U, was Super Mario 3D World, and boy am I glad the wait for a new great game is over.This game is AMAZING! I've played every entry since double dash and have loved each one equally since, as they all brought new ideas to the table. Mario Kart 8 takes the reigns as my favorite title in the series though, no question! This has got to be THE best racing game Nintendo has ever created. It's so much more tasty and rich than the ones before it.I'm gonna keep this review short and sweet though since I haven't played the game to its entirety just yet (I got it couple of hours ago) I've just been seeing troll reviews here on amazon, and i feel like someone's gotta save the day! HahaSo first off, the gamepad controls for this game feel very nice. Being used to the wii remote, I was surprised at how natural the conversion felt. I prefer using the analog sticks opposed to the gamepad's gyroscope though. The gamepad is just a little too big to be leaning back and forth!:/ I also like how they incorporated the gamepads screen into the game. If you're playing on the T.V. you can easily switch to gamepad-only mode with the touch of a button, there's also another little button you can press to see where everyone is on the track! Very convenient! Some people may complain that the gamepad screen isn't being used enough, but come on, lets be honest... There's not much you can do with the gamepad in this game. You're racing! You want to keep your eye's on ONE screen!Next, the graphics. Sweet baby Jesus this game is beautiful. I can't describe the feeling of seeing an HD Mario Kart game, it's completely different from seeing the videos of it in reviews on YouTube. Once you own this game and you play it on your TV... Then and only then you can truly see how nice this game looks. My favorite track has got to be Twisted mansion (i'm a sucker for anything spooky!). Nintendo, like always, does a great job in course variety and it's no different in this game either as each one is COMPLETELY different from the one before it. They stuck to the traditional 16 re-made old tracks, and 16 brand spankin new ones. I love this tradition as it eases us into new territory in the series. There's tons of throwbacks in here though!Also, I don't know if anyone else likes to do this too, but to really appreciate the game more.. i go on time trials and just explore the tracks to their entirety. I know I'm gonna have fun doing that on this game considering all the detail they put into it, and how nice it looks!!Next, the ANTI-GRAVITY! Wow, You ever play a mario kart game and just be like \"man, I wish I could just drive on the walls.. And then onto the ceiling! Well, now you can. The first course showcases this and man it feeds some sort of hunger I had. I love this feature along with the gliding they incorporated (which was first used in Mario Kart 7) So happy these have been added to the main series. Oh, and you can drive UNDERWATER NOW TOO.And finally, the MUSIC! The music Is amazing. If here's one company you can count on for making great music along with their games, it's nintendo, I mean come on. Pokemon, LOZ, Smash Bros, Super Mario. Big band music with sweet guitar solos and jazzy songs? Yes please! Loving the music so far, 10/10 !:)Last, THE BAD. Honestly, it's pretty tough to find anything bad about this game.. I haven't had any real issues with it. I wish next time instead of 32 tracks, they would add some more more cause I managed to race and beat every single one in about 2-3 hours. Then again, I'm not sure if I really do want more tracks. Maybe 32 is perfect! Nintendo knows balance. Another thing.. WHERE IS THE TRACK CREATOR? I would absolutely love to make my own track. Nintendo understood that people like to be creative in games back in 2008 with smash bros brawl with the stage creator.. We haven't changed, nintendo! We like to make our own stuff! Hopefully the next entry will allow this. No biggie though. I'm really happy with this game!!That's all I really want to say for now though, I'll add more to this review once I play it more. It's a great game though, if you own a Wii U, you have to get this game. It's a no-brainer, I don't even know why I'm telling you this. If you have a wii U, stop reading reviews.. You know this game is great, buy it NOW!:)Thank you for taking the time to read this!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2014"}

The game itself has plenty of bad flaws.I used to love Warcraft. But I hate Warcraft since they made it \"Blizzard presents: Magic: The Gathering\".My favorite thing about Warcraft was exactly what they took out in III and World of: a sense of grittiness and uniqueness in a world of fantasy. There were no \"Thyalawynd\" or \"Darkheart\"s or \"Ebonheart\"s or \"Gyilwind\"s magic fantasy crap with gravity-defying robes and swords made of silver and no shields or any semblence of tactics or strategy or even blood.There was no \"We ah the Knoights of Lothar the Guilywind, son of Gunther the Loinhearted, son of Baxter the Baxton, son of Aragorn of Aragorn, and we foight fo peeeeeace\" versus \"Graarrgh we are demon spawns from hell who want to crush the world and kill everything that moves\".Warcraft wasn't like that at all---Warcraft had the Orcs coming into Azeroth because their own world was destroyed by civil war, and rather than accomodate, the Humans responded with war. And it blew up in their faces as the Orcs destroyed Stormwind Keep and forced the humans into Lothleroin, with the Orcs following. I don't remember what happened after that, but I think eventually the Orcs were beaten back by the Alliance of Humans and Elves.Then I completely do not remember a single thing about Warcraft III other than Taurens supporting the Orcs for absolutely no reason, and the Undead randomly appearing out of nowhere for no reason, and Night Elves appearing out of nowhere for no reason, and lots of pixie dust sprinkle winds magic and demons and wizards and keys and powerups and upgrades and magical fire pansy moves of doom for make benefit glorious magician of kingdom of Godwynn EverNeverwind P. Dark-Ebonheart.Warcraft and Warcraft II were to me, the modern Medieval-fantasy equivalent of Conan the Barbarian, in that yes, magic was there, and magic was used, but only the magicians practiced magic, and the magicians could not stand up to an army of a billion Orc Grunts and Troll Axethrowers.  Sure, then there came Ogre-Mages, Death Knights, Paladins, and the like, but even those were but a small asset in an army made to fight with steel and wood and flesh, not just magic.Instead in Warcraft III, and extending into World of Warcraft, magic becomes the centerpoint of virtually any army.  You can still use the backbone of infantry and cavalry and the like, but their effectiveness against magical heroes and magical elves and pixies is reduced by the sudden jump in population everything costs and the stupid upkeep.But while magic would become the more central point beyond Warcraft III, War3's focus instead came upon HEROES!The entire RTS aspect of this game is not fully broken, but rather fractured by not just the inclusion, but the heavy reliance upon individual heroes, who have dozens of hero-only chests to pick up for upgrades and equipment that can make them MORE powerful, and they have the ability to LEVEL UP and research MORE abilities and powers.At least half the missions in the campaign I was apart of either involved playing ONLY as heroes, or playing in such a mission that only heroes could determine the outcome of battles.Then, UPKEEP.The idea of upkeep in this game is in no way relevant to how upkeep really works in games like Total War or in real life.  Upkeep is the cost of maintaining an army.  Upkeep does not exist in traditional RTS games.In this game, upkeep means \"you no longer mine as many resources\" when you have too many units.  And \"too many\" ranges from 50-75 population points taken up.And then comes the fact that full-army battles are rendered impossible when the average Orc Grunt starts costing THREE population points, and the maximum population is no longer the Blizzard standard of 200, but somewhere near 125-175 or so.Controlling the first level of upkeep means your peasants now gather 7 of a resource rather than ten.  Medium upkeep reduces it to 5.  High upkeep reduces it to 3.  And an army under high upkeep can consist of a handful of heavy units not fit to take out a militia force twice their size.This is only balanced by the fact that it affects all player on a map.  But another problem involving this is that because the basic units take up so much population and are so ineffective, the player is basically forced into an arm's race with their opponents, to build up their base technologies, upgrade all they can, then build the most powerful units available while ignoring the 90% of other units available to train, just to meet an evenly matched opponent who has done the same thing.And then again, the RTS idea is fractured and shattered by the powerful emphasis on building superunits and superweapons as quickly as possible, and to hell with all other available units.This is not how a good RTS works.  Starcraft comes to mind: an army of 30 basic Terran Marines can slaughter an enemy army of Hydralisks or Ultralisks.  An army of 30 Battlecruisers seems unstoppable, and yet can easily be torn asunder by a few Corsairs or Valkyries, or a flood of Scourges.  Or they can be broken up from all-out attack from an Arbiter's stasis, or a Ghost's lockdown.  They can suffer huge splash damage from Psionic Storms from High Templar or Infested Kerrigan.In short, in Starcraft, every unit is effective if utilized properly.  You can win one game by playing a megalomaniac and massing dozens of super units, and win another game in the same amount of time with a ragtag militia and some special tricks of infiltration and the like.Warcraft III has none of it.  Every unit that is not a superunit or a hero is simply cannon fodder and/or base defense until that superunit or hero is available for building.And so what was once \"WARcraft\" and I so deridingly called \"Magecraft\" could more accurately be called \"Herocraft\", because heroes are so ridiculously overpowered that they become the center point of every game, EVEN the skirmishes, as you cannot start unless you pick a hero for your side.  AND you can get MORE THAN ONE hero on a map, one for heavy combat, one for support, and one for magic.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2009"}

Anyway its crazy theirs blowguns that you can shoot from haystacks, climbable trees, new area (Lousiana, bayou), yet still all the collectibles and great storyline of the console releases. I just barely beat the first sequence and the game is massive for a handheld. Also all the same gameplay is there the fighting system, counters, collectibles, and vita specific functions like near. This is amazing and is why i am buying huge console games like this and need for speed on vita, because their just like the console releases but with extra functionalities and 20 dollars cheaper. What i always find funny is that a game like paper mario 3ds can get a much better score on ign than this, which has better graphics, gameplay, trophies, near, and plays like the consoles. I do kind of expect it as the first creed got bad reviews but was also revolutionary for the time.

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"An Entire Game Series Ruined by the Ending","reviewText":"For those that haven't finished Mass Effect 3, the first part of my review will be spoiler free, but the second part must be rife with spoilers because the story and ending is the biggest problem of the game. I'll also preface this review by saying that the ME series had been probably my favorite gaming series of all times, and I beat the campaign of ME1 three times while I finished the campaign of ME2 four times. I had been incredibly excited about the game, and had been able to avoid practically every spoiler except for two smaller ones about EDI and the Prothean character. Even though the game is flawed, I loved pretty much 99% of the game, but the ending was so bad that it has ruined my entire Mass Effect experience. I was going to play the game again with my female character as I loved the voice over work of Jennifer Hale, but now I don't really want to. I was even going to start a new character in ME1 and play all three games in succession, but now it just isn't worth it.So, let's start with the gameplay, which in the Mass Effect series is split between the RPG aspects, and the third person cover shooting battle system. ME3 definitely has the best action gameplay of the entire series, and while it can still be clunky there are constantly amazing moments with dozens of different but equally awesome strategies you could employ. I just wish there were almost more buttons on the controller for this game. It's one of the most effective uses of a controller in any shooter, where you really have so many different attacks you could use at every moment. Most of the clunkiness once again resolves around the action button being the same as the sprint and cover button. I'm not sure if it would work, but it could be interesting if the action button was instead mapped to the select button, the only one that isn't used in the game.Now on to the RPG systems of the game, which is much improved from basic systems in ME2, for Mass Effect 3 they basically took most of what was in ME1 and stripped out the hassle of the massive inventory screen and the repetitive/annoying/time-consuming aspect of destroying/selling the multitude of useless items you received. This interesting new inventory management system works by all of the weapons having a weight, and if you go over a certain weight limit (which is dependent on your character class and certain upgrades you can choose) you can face severe power regeneration penalties. I love this idea, but it can become annoying when all of the good weapons have really high weight. It also ends up limiting the weapons you can bring along, even though I was a Vanguard that selected the increase weight capacity upgrade. There's a possible related result, where you can no longer carry any heavy weapons like in previous games, something that I always loved. Instead there are only four heavy weapons found at few certain points lying on the ground (flamethrower, rocket launcher, some Geth laser gun, and the mini-nuke) with very limited ammo. Back to the main weapons that are in this game, I loved that Bioware brought back the Role Playing elements present in ME1 guns, almost keeping the same names and level presentation. The concept is really smart, where you can purchase an upgrade up to level 5 for each weapon and each weapon add-on (that you can have two equipped on each gun). The only problems here is that I had enough money so that each time I got a new gun I promptly maxed out the upgrades, so the system wasn't as rewarding as it could have been. Also, with the level of each add-on upgrading when you find or buy a new one, while I love this, it was a little uneven where multiple times I upgraded ones I didn't use while I couldn't find the upgrades for the ones I did regularly use. This whole system could be improved with a few adjustments, which is possibly a higher level cut-off limit like in Multiplayer (could make it so that weapons that you like don't become useless because of their stats later in the game) and something that I liked in the first game but disappeared in the sequels. That is a weapon efficiency upgrade system where you could get experience points for every enemy you kill with each weapon type, I think this could really increase the RPG feel while keeping all of the action. One more thing with the weapons, there's an interesting section of the Spectre offices where you have a fire range to test your weapon load-out. I love this idea, especially with all of the different weapons, but it makes no sense to have it on the Citadel, instead it should be in the Normandy Cargo Bay. Too many times I would upgrade a new weapon only to find I didn't like the way it fired. Then there are weapons that I never tried out as their weight was really high and the stats weren't the best. So while I may have possibly liked the way they fired, now I'll never know as I didn't have an opportunity to test them out.I was pretty disappointed that no real changes (non-cosmetic) were made to the armor system. It's much too basic, almost exactly the same as ME2, and I wish there were more options to alter and upgrade your armor. I really kept the same armor for most of the game, even later I just made a few adjustments and all I cared about was getting the bonus percentages I wanted. The armor also looked all pretty similar, except for the helmets, which were mostly pretty goofy looking. Finally, for the different character classes, in this iteration they seem about the same, but some new abilities have been added. One of them that I really loved was the new Nova attack which was really useful when combined with the Biotic Charge, also I like that it's not perfect as it uses up your shields, creating an interesting cost versus benefit play choice.The next aspect of the game is one that has really defined to series up to this point, and that is the conversation system of ME3. I was very disappointed that the conversation options were much more limited in this iteration, where you basically only had the paragon or renegade choice. There was never a paragade response or something else like the sarcastic comments I loved making in Dragon Age 2, at this point in the series it felt like a step back. There was also an annoying amount of conversations that resembled your talks with the DLC characters Massani and Goto. I didn't mind this too much, but it was frustrating when multiple times I would accidently hit the A button one too many times and I would skip the conversation. I also had a few graphics glitches during the normal conversations with choices, where the character's framework was broken or glitched, and they'd be looking all over the place or the eyes would be tracking wrong, it was just really weird. Even stranger, this tended to happen earlier in the game (they either occurred with Liara or Ravik), I didn't really experience it too much later, I'm not sure why. Possibly relating to this, I didn't have any problems importing my character's face as some have, but I think that's because I played around with it in ME2 because I didn't love my Shepard's face.There were multiple times in conversations where there were great little inside joke comments that were only for my Shepard, but I was a little disappointed that there weren't more new in depth conversations with your crew. Even with the new character Vega, while I love the sparring match/conversation you had with him (One of my favorite crew member interactions in the whole series) you don't get to know him as much as you did the previous game's characters. I understand that with the possibility of almost every old character not being present in ME3, the developer didn't want to spend too much time and money on them, but conversely they didn't add many new characters. In total, not counting the DLC character, there are only four new crew members on the Normandy (all of whom are humans): the new playable jock character, a gay male pilot, a gay female communications officer, and a female reporter. I liked all of these new characters (though the reporter is a little generic and annoying) but consider something for a minute. If Garrus and Tali had died in your playthrough of ME2, for most of the game you would only have two playable characters, Vega and Liara. Later of course, you get Kaidan/Ashley and EDI, but it's amazing they didn't add new characters or make more of the characters from ME2 crew members. Even with all of the crew members possible, you don't get a representative from the Krogans and the Salarians, or any of the other non-council races. I expected to see all of the different species send someone onto the Normandy, but for some reason no one did. All we got was a Krogan leader (Wrex!), a Turian leader, and a Quarian leader in the War Room for a few missions. You'd think that if Bioware didn't want to waste time and money on possibly unpopular characters, they would have created more characters that every player would get to know. The only possible explanation for why they didn't do this is that they didn't think they had the time to establish multiple new interesting characters.Another annoying change to something I loved before, was how when you're in the hub-world listening to people's interesting conversations you have to leave the area and come back to hear the next part of the story. In ME2, you could just keep hitting the A button to listen to the rest of the conversation, which to me worked really well. This time, even though the stories are cool, I would lose interest in them as so much time could pass between each part of the telling, also at one point they glitched out and all of the conversations reset. I also had a problem that I figure has to be a glitch where at the last conversation with the Illusive Man, the Paragon and Renegade options were greyed out. With this Shepard I have always selected the blue conversation options in each Mass Effect game every time they appeared, and I also always explore every possible conversation option. I had off the charts amounts of Reputation and Paragon points and still I had a conversation option blocked, the first time this has ever happened to me (in the Mass Effect series and every other video game with a similar conversation system). I felt extremely confused and annoyed that somehow the best possible resolution to the Illusive Man conflict wasn't available to me for no apparent reason.Onto the locations and exploration of the different worlds, something that was one of my favorite parts of the previous games, but is almost non-existent in ME3. Here is where ME3 strikingly reminds me of the failure of Dragon Age 2. Similarly to Kirkwall, the Citadel acts as the only hub-world in the entire Mass Effect 3 game, while in ME2 there were four completely different hub-worlds. This would be okay, as most worlds are under attack from the Reapers, except for the fact that this version of the Citadel is the smallest and most basic of the entire Mass Effect trilogy. Then the Citadel only goes through a very minor cosmetic change halfway through the game, and they expect us, a society full of ADHD people, not to grow bored of the surroundings. We get to go to worlds we've always wanted to explore, like the Turian, Salarian, Quarian, Asari and Human home-worlds, but all of them are filled with waist high walls and they're all being blown up by Reapers and/or attacked by Cerberus. The missions are also relatively short, and we fail to really see anything unique about the planets. Further, ME3 has essentially eliminated the mini missions on random worlds, and the probe mechanic found in ME2. Instead, now you have to fly around each system evading the Reapers while you randomly scan for 2 or 3 of the interesting things, which are either small amounts of fuel or some random unexplained war asset on a planet. Then you get to play a few basic solo N7 missions on the limited number of Multiplayer maps. I understand that exploring Alien worlds isn't a priority in the middle of a war with a group of ancient synthetic/organic hybrid monster spaceships, but I missed this aspect that was hugely present in the previous games.Related to the locations and explorations, I'm going to talk a little bit about the further development of the alien species you encounter. Sadly, we see very little new aspects of the previously introduced alien species, and no new aliens. One thing we do see is our first Krogan female, who is a very cool character, though the time spent with her is short. Also, you don't see too much of the Krogan woman, but this kind of makes sense when you consider the Krogan society. Once again, every other species' females are non-existent, I guess Bioware believes the Asari provide enough females for everyone. Also, I can explain away why we don't see many of the other races' females (though we probably should see them as refugees or scientists), but I find it weird that we don't see any Turian females. From Garrus' previous stories, it has been established that females can serve in their military and can compete with the best of the males (also they're apparently very flexible but don't have much reach). The one new design that Bioware were extremely successful in creating was that of the Prothean. They succeeded in looking like the Collectors and were just extremely cool. I loved even more the reality of what their culture was in comparison to what everyone had believed. The only problem is that for some reason Bioware decided to make this important and awesome character first-day DLC.  Finally, the worst aspects of the new alien design in ME3 are the Quarians.I either wanted Bioware to keep the Quarians faces secret, or I wanted a beautiful scene to show off Tali's true face, they even had the perfect situation when they are on her home planet of Rannoch. Instead Bioware was lazy, and they just had Tali give a picture to Shepard that he could keep in his cabin. This picture showed a poorly photo-shopped stock photo of a cute human woman that probably took an hour or two to make. Every single piece of Tali fan art I've seen is a hundred times better than what Bioware chose. Since Turians and Quarians are so closely related (same amino acid structure) then they would probably look more similar to each other instead of being human (except for some tattoos and different hands). Of course, they would be also be different in many ways (the Turian world experienced a lot of radiation which caused them to develop the armor plates) and there was something about the Quarians where they have a symbiosis with the plant life on their world, and because of this their immune systems weren't fully developed (this was then made worse by years and years spent on sterile space ships). Even if Bioware wanted a mostly human design to appease Tali fans (which there is some precedent for as the eyes and nose appear human behind the mask) I've seen much better humanoid designs for Tali. I mean it's a little strange where fans are more talented and spend more time creating images of a very important design than the official developer.Here's where I'm going to stick a bunch of the random features in the game. I was a bit surprised by the complete elimination of mini-games in ME3, while they were all a little annoying before, instead of fixing them now they just removed them, and the doors/safes take a little longer to open, implying that you're automatically performing some type of hack or bypass. The reputation system is a much appreciated addition/adaptation, where you get standard reputation points for performing moral neutral actions, and every Paragon or Renegade point adds to your total. Because of this, players are no longer punished from not being an absolute character, and no matter you preference if you have enough reputation points both of the Paragon and Renegade conversation choices are unlocked. However, it is pretty goofy how the bar is filled up very early into the game, I was still getting lots of points, but there was no visual interpretation of the increase. I almost wish there was a bigger bar, or even a numerical presentation of all of your reputation points. Another new addition to this game is the War Assets and Effective Military Strength (EMS). I really liked this feature, as everything you've done in the Mass Effect series is represented here. However, once again the bar fills up incredibly early in the game. There's also some really disturbing about the EMS, and that's the aspect of Galactic Readiness, which can only be increased by playing multiplayer. So if you hate Co-op Multiplayer, or if you don't have enough money or the ability to have an Xbox Live Gold Membership, your Galactic Readiness is locked at 50%. This means that all of your War Assets will be halved for the EMF. So let's look at my level, I had 7245 points with a Galactic Readiness hovering around 100%. If I wouldn't have played Multiplayer, then I would have only had 3622 EMF points, which is enough to get the endings but is not enough to get the \"best\" ending. To put this in perspective, I played every mission available except for a few that glitched out on me. The only things that might have lowered my war assets, were that in ME1 I saved the Council, in ME2 I destroyed the Collector Base (even though for the story Cerberus still found most of it intact), and in ME3 I cured the Krogan Genophage which annoyed the Salarians. One other random thing, in ME3 you don't have someone like Kelly that will take care of your fish. The only option is to buy a crazy expensive Aquarium VI, and if you don't your fish will die, even if you feed them every chance you get. You'd think EDI would be able to monitor your fish tank for free, but I guess it'd be a little degrading considering her new role as a crew member on herself.Now onto the last aspect of the game that isn't the story, and that is the newly added Co-op Multiplayer. I was initially concerned about this aspect of the game, but I've had a lot of fun playing with it. I did have a lot of problems with the EA servers the first couple of days though, and this was exasperated by the fact that you only get experience and credits by either successfully completing the mission, or by dying. I wish that the game would save your experience after each wave, especially when any expendable items you use before you disconnect are lost forever. After this I also glitched out a couple times, once I got stuck in a wall, but I was actually still able to kill a bunch of the enemies while some of them were unable to get me. Another time I glitched out during multiplayer, it was much worse and much weirder, where the whole stage was shaking like I was in the middle of an earthquake. Then while I was running, I ended up floating in the air for a few feet before falling through the floor (I actually have a video of it but it's kind of crappy since I couldn't find my camera and used my iPod). Sadly or thankfully, my team members were a capable bunch (even though it was a silver Reaper mission) and were able to beat the 10 waves, though it took like 20 minutes where I just had to float there in nothingness and wait. The even weirder thing was that I could damage some of the enemies with biotic powers, and the enemies were able to kill me. However, once I died I would immediately come back to life. Looking past the glitches, I love leveling up the different characters, and with a group of capable players the missions can be very fun. However, after a while I grew a little bored playing the missions, they're all just too similar. Then I worked really hard on maxing out the Vanguard branch, but when I hit level 20, to get the achievement I promoted the soldiers. This is a cool idea, but I wish there was more of a reward for this, or possibly the ability to still use the high level characters when attempting a Gold level mission, or at the very least a new character plus where they get an extra bonus so you're not starting from the very beginning of the character. The biggest problem I have with the multiplayer though is that EA decided to for the first time in a AAA console game to include a freemium pricing structure for the locked characters, weapons and items. I actually find this kind of offensive, as I could play the multiplayer for hours and get a random pack someone else could get immediately by shilling out two dollars. I especially have a problem with this pricing as you could spend two dollars on a pack, and get nothing you could use. If you're going to charge for items others could get by just playing the game, I think you should be able to pick items, although of course it would make it even more unfair for people that don't want to be tricked into paying for items that are already in the game. I think that the Multiplayer could be saved with a patch, and possibly more game modes than the 10 waves that always feature the play modes capture the flag, secure the base, head-hunt certain enemies, and kill everything moving. As it currently stands, I can't see this multiplayer establishing a consistent faithful base for anything nearing long term.Now, I can finally get to the aspect of the game that had me the most upset/frustrated, and that is the story. From here on in, warning, there be major spoilers ahead. Right from the start of the game the story is goofy. A minute after our first look at the ME universe's Earth, the Reapers attack, not giving the player any time to acclimate to the game. Then a little later (after a goofy child's death that will haunt Shepard for the rest of the game) you are introduced to the game's one and only plot device, blueprints for an all-powerful weapon designed but not completed by the Protheans, called the Crucible. This is just so generic and out of the blue, it doesn't make any sense, but I was ok with playing along. You then have a mission involving each of the previous ME game's characters, some small and some large. The developers then proceed to kill off two of my favorite characters in these missions, Mordin and Thane. However, I can accept their deaths, especially since it was established previously that both of them were near death (old age and lung disease respectively) and both of them were done very well, they had good deaths. I admit that I felt serious emotion with both of them, and I may or may not have cried through the whole hospital scene.I have a lot of problems with the development of Cerberus as the main antagonist in a game about the Reapers. I understand that Bioware wanted to provide different enemies to face, and I admit that their AI and designs are excellent. However, I don't understand how Cerberus became so powerful. Every time you see them they're a step ahead of you, even when you kill hundreds or thousands of their heavily armed and trained troops. Later they kind of explain this by establishing that they created a refugee Sanctuary that was actually a Human harvesting and indoctrination factory, but it still doesn't quite add up. I didn't love Cerberus in ME2, and things they've done had always been on the border of indecency and terrorism, but it usually seemed to be in Humanity's best interest. However, in ME3 they're all crazy and doing absolutely horrible incomprehensible things, Bioware tries to say it's all because TIM has been slowly indoctrinated and he's now under control of the Reapers, but I never really thought they successfully established this. Probably the goofiest Cerberus plot line is the coup of the Citadel, which made absolutely zero sense. They somehow gained control of Udina (who while being a douche bag didn't have any connections to Cerberus and had no reason to betray the rest of the Council) and managed to infiltrate the Citadel which is supposed to be the safest and most guarded place in the Galaxy (they even again said they upgraded the security). Then they for some reason wanted to assassinate the entire council, for reasons that are never explained.Up until around halfway through the game, I didn't love the story, but I was in love with the game and having a lot of fun playing it. I mean the actual story for ME2 was pretty basic and goofy, but I still absolutely loved the game. Then, after the previously mentioned Cerberus coup of the Citadel, I received the first realization that Bioware might not care about their fans, or that they might possibly even hate us. Previously in the Citadel, you met up and talked to Kelly Chambers in the refugee camp. There was a great little scene where after asking if she wants to rejoin the Normandy, she describes the horror she experienced on the Collector ship, and that she can't be on the Normandy as it reminds her of what she faced. Instead, she's helping the refugees coming into the Citadel. I loved this little interaction, and I thought it was great fan service for people that liked Kelly. Then after the coup, when walking around the refugee camp you hear two people talking and they basically say \"Have you seen that red headed woman who was helping out so much?\" \"You didn't hear? A Cerberus soldier came up asking if she was Kelly Chambers, and after she said yes he just shot her in the head.\" \"Huh, I guess if Cerberus asks you if you're someone, you should just say no.\" \"Hah hah hah.\"  This was a character I spent the whole of ME2 talking to and growing to care about, and Bioware decided to kill her off so disrespectfully and unnecessarily, I was just absolutely horrified. I wished I could have never heard that conversation, but no, it will now always be in my brain.After this point, everything was ok, not perfect but I pretty much enjoyed all of the events and there were some truly awesome kickass scenes (I loved the fight where you called on the mother of all Thresher Maws and the brokering of peace between the Quarians and Geth), until the final battle to retake Earth. The whole strategy for retaking Earth was a little goofy, but I didn't mind it too much. There was also a great area where before the final battle you walk around the camp and talk to all of your party members, and you can even call and talk to the previous game's characters that aren't playable in ME3. The conversations are a little short, but I enjoyed all of them. Then after fighting for a while, you get to the beam to take you to the Citadel (Which was overtaken by the Reapers without any explanation of how & you can assume billions of people were killed) and everything breaks apart in a million pieces. You know the developer did something wrong when fan created explanations/interpretations make more sense than what we were actually given (The most logical being that the whole Citadel sequence was an indoctrinated dream). Other people have more succinctly examined and explained all of the different problems and plot holes, so I won't go too in depth here. Nevertheless, you are apparently hit by the Reaper's laser beam that destroys everything it touches, but here you only get some melted armor and a beat up face. You also receive a very powerful heavy pistol with unlimited ammo that you use to kill the Reaper creations between you and the teleportation beam. When you get to the beam and are transported to the Citadel, somehow both the Illusive Man and Anderson beat you to the main room. There's this whole thing where somehow TIM is able to control your body and make you shoot Anderson, but you are able to break control and kill TIM.After ascending the elevator to the merged Crucible and Citadel console, a God-like AI in the form of the dead child from Earth appears. Here, Bioware for some reason decides to give you more questions instead of providing the player with any answers. The God-child says that the Reapers are his answer to the problem that Synthetic life (pure order) will eventually completely wipe out all Organic life (pure chaos). Basically, the Reapers were created to save Organic life from Synthetics by murdering and harvesting every developed race each 50,000 years (A synthetic being created hybrids to kill organics to save them from being killed by synthetics). Through this whole interaction, Shepard acts completely subjugated and accepts everything the child says as absolute truth. You are finally given three options, you can control the Reapers (presented as the blue or Paragon choice even though it was represented by TIM, who was at least a Renegade character), you could destroy the Reapers along with all synthetic life (presented as the red or Renegade choice even though it was represented by Anderson, who was absolutely a Paragon character), or you could take the third option which would merge all organic and synthetic life (presented by no one, but this is obviously the choice that the God-child AI wants). Then, no matter what choice you make, as long as your war assets are beyond a very small level, Shepard dies, the Reapers leave Earth or are destroyed, every Mass Relay is destroyed (hopefully in a way different than what was seen in the Arrival DLC or entire systems might have been wiped out of existence), and the Normandy (After Joker apparently flees the battle on Earth) just barely escapes the blast and crash lands on an Eden-like planet, with characters that were just with you rushing the beam somehow being magically transported to the Normandy.Then that's it, the game is over except for a ridiculous conversation featuring a star-child and an old man taking place in a forest that resembles the one in Shepard's dream (and a flash of Shepard taking a breath if you had enough EMS and chose to destroy the Reapers). Oh, also there's an insulting message telling you to buy the future DLC Bioware releases, and you're set up back on the Normandy before the raid on the Cerberus base. I literally walked all around the Normandy trying to talk to everyone, and it felt like I was in a different dimension, it was just so weird and awkward. The only real difference between the three endings is the color of the beam the Crucible emits and the explosion that follows. When faced with the choice, I watched each ending on Youtube, and decided on the Green/Synthesis ending. Partly because it was the weirdest, but mostly because Edi and Joker embrace in that end, and if I had to die & the universe had to be irreversibly changed (most likely leading to many of the stranded races on Earth dying of starvation and never seeing their homes or loved ones) at least someone could find some happiness in this ending.So why am I and almost every Mass Effect fan outraged at the ending\"s\" Bioware gave us? (In one poll found on the official Mass Effect forums 91% of around 60,000 fans hated the ending and wants Bioware to change it completely, and 6% still wanted the ending slightly adjusted). First and foremost, the ending is so bleak and depressing, that there is no opportunity for happiness or even a sense of accomplishment that should come with beating a video game. I've never before played a game that punished me for beating it. Then there are so many plot holes with weird and abrupt revelations that make no sense. However, the biggest problem with the ending is that no choice that you made in all three games has any bearing on the outcome. As long as your Shepard didn't die in ME2 and you have the minimum amount of war assets or EMS in ME3 you get the same ending as someone that worked hard in each Mass Effect game and created their perfect Shepard story, maxing out all of the meters, doing all of the missions. I wouldn't have liked any ending where Shepard dies, but I could have accepted it if it was well done and provided closure, instead of just appearing to be the crumpled pieces of paper that a writer with any talent would have thrown into the trash.The prevailing sense of hopelessness despair and depression was never before found in the Mass Effect games. Even though you faced suicide missions, if you did everything right only one of your team members died in the games, and the overall mission was always essentially a complete success (There were always a large amount of casualties, but they were all blank faces). I really can't see how anyone at Bioware would have liked this ending. I've come to the conclusion that either Bioware doesn't care about their long term fans, hates their long term fans, or are so stupid that they thought the fans would actually like the ending they provided (or possibly a fourth option where they're just being trolls and the whole ending was a dream sequence and the true ending is being released as DLC, although I would probably associate this option as aligning closely to \"they don't care about","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"A Dramatic Ending to the Series","reviewText":"Mass Effect 3 relies on drama, nostalgia, and improved gameplay to end the epic trilogy.  It deserves to go down as one of the best Sci-Fi trilogies of our generation, but it's got a few issues.Story:  8/10Throughout the story, there is a dark sense of drama, and an overt feeling of impending doom!  Reapers have invaded the galaxy and they are intent on wiping out all non-synthetic organisms, so all of the races you have encountered in ME1 and ME2 face genocide.  The Reapers begin their attack on Earth and as the humans quickly realize, they're outmatched.  Lucky for us, there's a Halo Device called the Crucible that will destroy the Reapers!  Commander Shepard must assemble his crew and search the galaxy for allies for the war and engineers who can activate the Crucible.  Cerberus is also after the Crucible and they're battling Shepard's crew along the way.  On the quest, Shepard will make many difficult choices regarding who lives or who dies, and some of these are painful.Graphics: 9/10The characters and cutscenes are great!  The environments are on par with ME2 (great), but some are lacking a bit.  The enemy designs and visual FX really bring the battles to life.Gameplay: 8.5/10The basic game flow goes like this - Start on Ship, Search Galaxy Map for Quests, Fly there, Play a Mission (A battle in the Unreal Engine), Return to Ship, Talk to Characters about it, Repeat!The Main Quests are marked on the Galaxy Map.  In order to begin one, you just fly to the planet and land on it.  From there, you pick your squad.  In a few story related missions, one squad member is automatically chosen for you.  You want to pick a squad that best combats the enemies you'll be fighting or pick a character with biotic powers and another with mechanical powers to balance your squad.  You can upgrade Shepard's armor to give him boosts to offense or defense, and you can choose the guns for your squad members.  Shepard can carry up to 5 different gun types:  Pistol, SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun, or Sniper Rifle.  But the heavier the combined weight of the guns, the longer it takes for his powers to recharge.  So, do you want more firepower or more special powers?Everyone levels up when Shepard levels up, and you assign points to all of the character's skill trees to unlock or boost their powers.The quests are usually battles similar to Gears of War encounters.  Enemies charge you and you can use your weapons and powers to stop them.  You can take cover behind objects and roll.  At first, the cover mechanic feels really strange.  I found myself rolling by accident, then pressing A to take cover, then have it not work, so I double tap A, then Shepard takes cover, and jumps out of cover to get shot in the face and die.  After a few battles, I did get the hang of it.The guns do damage, and the powers either debuff enemies, attack them with a damage type, summon a drone, or get enemies to fight on your side.  Success in battle is largely determined by your aim and using the right powers against enemies.  The game is pretty easy on normal mode, and on the harder difficulties, you'll really need to strategically use the damage types.Powers and Weapons: 7/10Upgrading the Powers is very simple.  There are 6 levels of each power and 1 or 2 choices on each path.  So you may unlock a biotic attack, and for an upgrade, you can choose to do concentrated damage to 1 enemy or have a wider area of effect.The guns are pretty bad.  There are many weapons in the game, and each can be upgraded 4 times.  But it is really hard to tell which guns will best suit you.  One frustrating thing is that you cannot see how one type of shotgun compares to the other shotguns while you are upgrading it.  So you may have a cool shotgun that you like, and then you'll spend money to upgrade your new shotgun 5 times and realize it's not as good as the one you are using.  And there's no way to get your credits back.  Also, some assault rifles are full auto, while others are burst fire.  It doesn't tell you this on the equip screen.  There are just bar graphs on Damage, Capacity, Fire Rate, etc...  It would have been great to show the Player the max attributes of a weapon in a different color on the bar graph.Each gun can carry 2 modifiers, that improve accuracy, clip size, weapon capacity, etc...This helps you balance out the gun's deficiencies.One really nice feature is that Shepard can earn Reputation Points by acting favorably with a crew member.  Once Shepard does this, he can add their powers to his own and upgrade them.  So, if Tali likes Shepard, he can use her Summon Combat Drone ability.  If Liara likes him, he can use Singularity. Etc.The Endings: 6/10I don't want to spoil the ending, so I won't talk about what actually happens.  Instead, I'll just point out the mistakes on a conceptual level.Note:  My expectations were so low for the ending, I thought Commander Shepard was going to slip on a banana peel, fall out of an airlock, then get probed by space monkeys.  As he pounds on the glass, space monkey giggles and Uranus jokes are overheard while circus music plays in the background.The War Asset Meter:Every Quest that you do, fills this meter.  There is a minimum line on it and that's pretty much it.  You can also fill this meter by playing lots of multiplayer.  It doesn't make sense, but it sorta gives players a reason to try it.  If you fill it all the way, you get a very minor tweak to the ending, but the game doesn't tell you that.  Most people just partially fill the bar by doing the main quests and that's it.The Choice!In the end, you are presented with 3 choices.  There is a blue switch, a column of light, and a red switch.  But there is no confirmation on what switch does what, or what happens when you jump into the light.  The game really needed confirmation text, \"Pressing this will destroy the Reapers.\", Option 2, Option 3...The way the ending was originally edited, it was choppy and confusing.  Parts of it also made no sense and there was almost no mention of Shepard, a character that you've been playing for 6 years!  In the Extended Versions, they added some more scenes and some voice overs.  They're better, but not great.Basically, if you want to make an artsy ending or a cerebral ending that makes people think, do it in an epilogue.  Make the regular ending a payoff.  Remember when Luke Skywalker blew up the Death Star?  That was gratifying!  That makes the audience feel good!  Mass Effect 3's ending is confusing about how you get each one and when you see it, it raises more questions.Sound: 10/10+The sound effects, music, and voice acting are awesome!Maturity: MThis is rated M for sexual situations, violence, and language.  It's a lot like an Rated R action film.Replay Value / Multiplayer: 8/10You can play the game over and get different endings, different romances, and choose to ally yourself with different races.  You can also play on the harder difficulties and try battling through the levels with different squad members.  Each pass through takes about 20-30 hours, depending on the difficulty level and the number of side quests that you do.Fails:(Side Quest Logs - There aren't any.  If you meet someone at the citadel and they say, \"I can help you if you find the lost artifact of Gormic for me.\"  You can search the galaxy and scan planets to get it.  But when you find it, you aren't sure who needs it.  You just find an artifact and you know someone that you met in the past wanted it.  This game would have been better you could look up - \"Artifact G - for Fred, Citadel Hospital,\" so you didn't have to wander around as much.Other fails, I already noted:  Cover, Gun Upgrades, and triggering the Ending.Overall:  8/10Flaws aside, this is a really good game that is part of an amazing trilogy.  The world that Bioware created is incredible.  All of the different alien races, their cultures, their religions, and how they interact is mind-blowing.  It also makes you think about the human race in relation to the vast and infinite universe.  The combat is fun and tactical, the characters are memorable, the story is dramatic / universal in scope, and you'll feel emotional about parts of it.

I had given that set to the grandson to check out and held back a little before giving him this video game to play.  I knew well enough that he'd enjoy both items, but also suspected that once he started playing this video game he was going to be lost in that game throughout the weekend.  I wasn't wrong at all.  If I had given him this video game before he started playing with the wild walls set, he never would have gotten to that set (or at least not until he'd gone home for the weekend, leaving the video game back at our home).It was heartwarming watching him sit and play and enjoy this game as much as he did.  It was obviously immersive for him and seemed to catch him at a perfect age for everything that goes on in the game.I would note that this grandson has played with Legos for years now, and has played through several of the earlier Lego superhero video games (the Batman series as an example), so the learning curve for him playing this game wasn't steep at all.  It was just the latest game in the series as far as he was concerned, and yet, well, it offered him a ton of fun.  He went about collecting the in-game Lego currency so he could cash it all in (multiple times) to unlock some of his favorite characters, and by the end of the weekend, sure enough he'd unlocked several of those characters.Within the game, he was also enjoying the challenge of figuring out the various puzzles as well as determining how he was going to accomplish whatever the next task was that he was supposed to be doing in the game.Realistically, this game is, in many ways,Grand Theft Auto Vfor younger gamers.  It offered up the ability to drive around, fly around, use special abilities to get around, swim around, etc., to go off and do whatever the next task was, or alternatively, just wander around the world collecting the Lego currency to save up so you can unlock your favorites.  The cartoon violence that takes place is relatively tame, though you do see the Lego characters get beaten up, run over, torn apart, etc., as you play.  Persons that are sensitive to the thought of letting their children play in such fashion might want to avoid the game, but really there's little to even think of objecting to here.I would note that the game did freeze a couple of times in a very repeatable fashion.  By the end of the weekend the grandson had learned how to reset the Xbox 360 multiple times because of that issue, but also seemed to have learned which part of the game led to the freezing issue.  Hopefully that issue will be resolved soon with a patch.Easily worth the purchase price.  Available for most major video game platforms.  I'm personally going to be looking forward to the PS4 version when it gets released later.  Until then, I'm enjoying watching my wife's grandson get so much enjoyment out of a video game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2013"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Xbox gamers = REAL GAMERS unlike the sonymite...","summary":"The slowing down time is the only good thing about this game","reviewText":"The mulitplayer sucks.Noone is online,then the maps sucks,then if you find someone online the controls is very floaty.The single player is the same old same old, with the exception of the awesome slow down & popping people which is very fun no matter how many times you do it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2012"}

Turtle Beach and Sony just signed an exclusive agreement where TB will be releasing the offical Bluetooth headsets for the PS4 system.While some TB (and other) headsets will work if you plug them into the controller, this is the first \"official\" PS4 headset as it were.It's easy as pie to use (simply plug it into your PS4 controller!), however, you will need to fiddle with the settings on your PS4 (especially if you want the sound to pipe into your headset, more on this in a second).The chat quality is fine enough.  The people I talked to playing NFS: Rivals had no problem understanding me.  The problem lies in the sound coming in.  Even with everything turned up to the max, you're going to struggle to hear what's going on.  It is as it on a volume scale of 1-10 it's a 3.  With NFS: Rivals, not a huge deal-breaker.  On a game like Battlefield 4 or COD:  Ghosts, yeah you're dead.Also, not the most comfortable headset in the world either.  Whereas the PS3 Wireless headset you can wear for hours on end, this one is going to get uncomfortable in about 30 minutes to an hour.  So no long gaming sessions, unless you find a way to pad it more.Overall, it is what it is: A VERY basic chat headset for the PS4.  Is it better then what it comes with?

Johnson","summary":"Very fun game; but controls can get finicky -- Update about achievements","reviewText":"I picked up this game because it seemed to be a nice break from my normal games that I like to play.  I really enjoyed Little Big planet on the the Playstation and this game seemed to be similar in some regards to LBP so I thought I would give it a shot.This is my first time playing any game in the Rayman series so I know nothing of the storyline or any of the characters, but I quickly found out the game is easy to pick up and start playing without having to know anything.  The basic premise is to finish a obstacle course like level without dying as well as saving \"teensies\". The more teensies you accumulate during your game play the more levels you can unlock and continue.  There are also challenge levels, and levels that allow you to \"rescue\" more playable characters that you can subsequently use.  The rescued characters have different moves, but so far I haven't seen any advantage of using one over the other.The graphics I would describe as \"fun\".  In context of this game I would say that they are really good.  I really like the 3D feel of the game on many levels you can see animations occurring in the background and in some cases you can actually go into the background to continue your adventure.  Frame rates are silky smooth, I experienced no choppiness or slowdowns during game play.Sound is pretty good, but for some reason I can't get the game to play in full surround sound as I can with my other games so as a result the game only plays sound through my front speakers.  I verified that my sound settings on my XBOX were correct and also tested out some older games to verify that my rear speakers were in fact working.  Perhaps there is a sound setting I need to set in the game itself, but I haven't found anything yet.As I stated in my title, the game is very fun to play.  However the controls are inconsistent at times resulting in frustrating deaths.  First of all you are able to hold down the \"A\" button to glide, but this doesn't always work.  This makes timed courses more difficult than they should be.  If the next platform is just out of reach with a normal jump, you need to glide there instead by holding down the \"A\" button after you jump, but for some inexplicable reason it simply does not work sometimes and you fall to your death.  Second your character automatically grabs rings and ropes, but sometimes this doesn't always work and you fall to your death again.  Additionally the jump button itself is inconsistent at times especially when running, a running jump usually does a long jump, but sometimes it only results in your character doing a bunny hop.  Finally instead of pressing a button to drop down from a rope or a ring, you only have to press down on the analogue stick; however the analogue stick is VERY sensitive so even if you think you are pressing right on the analogue stick, if it is not pressed preciously to the right, then your character will drop down instead.  All of these issues with controls are compounded on timed levels where you have to move fast to avoid being burned by fire or drowned in quicksand.  On these levels that require speed, you don't have time to be precise for every little jump or when gliding and this causes you to die a lot.  One thing I also forgot to mention is that the game is very floaty like LBP.  Your character seems to be sliding on ice whenever he/she lands on a narrow platform and you constantly have to correct him/her to avoid sliding off.In summary I think the game is fun to play, but probably not as detailed as LBP.  One thing LBP has is that Sack Boy can move in and out of the screen by pressing up or down on the D-pad, but Rayman Legends is truly linear side scroller except for the few times the levels forces you to go into the background.  I didn't pay for this game, but I think the price point ($20 less than the usual price of video games) is decent. However, if I were buying this in the store for myself I would wait for about a $10 price drop before purchasing it.UPDATE=========Normally I don't pay much attention to the achievements on XBOX 360 games and couldn't care less when I beat the main story; but this game is the only game I have that I came so close to getting all the achievements (except the pacman games from XBL).When I completed this game; got all teensies and all cups on every level in the game including the invasion levels.  I had all 700 teensies and was sitting at 650,000 Lums.  One achievement requires you to get 1,000,000 Lums to unlock the final hero; this one while time consuming is definitely doable by replaying levels and just focus on getting Lums. However the \"Final Level of Awesomeness\" achievement is ridiculous.  It requires you to get 6000 points to unlock Level 11, and the only way you can get points is from cups from each level.  When you complete the game maxing out on all cups, you should have a little over 4000 points, meaning you need 2000 more to get to level 11.  The only way to get more points is to complete daily challenges.  While this is ok in theory, it will take an unreasonable amount of time to accomplish this.  The main reason is because there are only TWO challenges you can compete in per day and the maximum points you can earn in each challenge is 50 (and that is if you get Diamond, which is virtually impossible unless you have nothing but time to play levels over and over and over and over again and then hope no one else knocks you out of the diamond ranking.  Most people will be lucky with a Gold or Silver trophy in the daily challenges. Diamond awards 50 points, Gold, 10 points, Silver; 5 points, and Bronze 1 point.  There are also weekly challenges (still only two) but for sake of simplicity I'll just do the math on how long it will actually take to get this final achievement based on daily challenges only.Best case scenario, you are a Rayman Legends GOD, don't have to go to school, don't have to work, don't have to eat, and can spend every waking hour playing this game and you are able to get Diamond trophies for both daily challenges.  (100 points earned per day - 20 days to get the final 2000 points for the final achievement.Second best case scenario you are a very good player, but can only get gold on both daily challenges, (20 points per day - 100 days to get the final 2000 points)Third best case scenario, you are ok, but can only get silver on both daily challenges (10 points per day - 200 days to get the final 2000 points).Fourth best (bronze) -- don't even bother, it will take you 1,000 days to get the final 2000 points).For me I was able to get gold on all challenges and even five or six diamond cups and it still took me nearly three months of playing this game every single day with the same frustrating levels to finally get to 6000 points. It was quite demoralizing after getting a gold cup only to be awarded 10 points.  The diamond cups award 50 points but like I stated earlier, unless you have nothing but time on your hand to play this game every waking moment of the day diamonds will be few and far between especially given the fact that you are competing with others around the world who do nothing but play this game all day.  For myself, after getting past 6000 points, I haven't played this game since.  It was a fun game but the mindless grinding required to complete the final achievement eventually made me hate this game.I have to say with 100% certainty I am done with this game, and will not play any Rayman game in the future.  Its the kind of game that is fun, but the frustration factor in many levels and the fact that it forces you to grind on other levels make me not to want to go through it again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2013"}

Even those who don't know the difference betweenCrazy Taxiand the long-running  TV seriesTaxiwill immediately recognize the appeal of this game. In fact, this game is so  impressive and addictive that it should easily convince a whole new wave of buyers to purchase a Sega  Dreamcast.What's so hot aboutCrazy Taxi? For starters, the graphics sport the most impressive re-creation of  a living city ever seen in a video game. The level of detail is astounding and never ceases to surprise the  player as block after unique block speeds by. The city is a distilled version of San Francisco with some  landmarks and neighborhoods left intact. Making it seem all the more real are apparent product placements  of real-world retail locations such as KFC, Tower Records, and Pizza Hut. And just about everything you  see on the screen is interactive: boxes, phone booths, and mailboxes topple when bumped or smashed,  pedestrians leap and tumble out of your path, and the myriad of traffic attempts to avoid your erratic  high-speed antics. While some driving games brag about a lack of boundaries, this one delivers--players  drive on the ocean floor, off the second floor of a parking garage, through parks, and down stairs. A helpful  hovering arrow points drivers in the correct direction, but you can truly drive wherever you want at any  time, making for tons of replay value.While the game is a direct port from the arcade game of the same name, there's plenty more depth in the  home version. In addition to the city that appears in the coin-op version, the Dreamcast version also  includes an entirely new city.Crazy Taxiincludes a trunk-load of mini-games that help to teach  drivers how to perform the special speed boosts and maneuvers in the game.Though this game would be plenty exciting without any sounds at all, it has an adrenaline-pumping  soundtrack supplied by punk crossover bands the Offspring and Bad Religion, as well as some good, if  sometimes monotonous, dialogue between the driver and the passengers.--Jeff YoungPros:Wonderful, realistic graphicsEasy to get into, and full of many long hours of addictive playEven more to offer than the fantastic arcade game upon which this is basedCons:On very few occasions players will encounter some graphic slowdown","reviewerName":"John Hoffman","summary":"VERY addicting for a early Dreamcast release","reviewText":"back in 1999-2000, I was a N64 Kid who didt really care about sega games & consoles, this game made me wish I was.Its a reasonable priced game, with some pretty good graphics, and very good controls, and It makes me want to keep playing it.Music & graphics 9/10. smooth 60 FPS, awesome licensed soundtrack, smooth character design, with their talk that is still cool & comically charming.Controls 9/10 the turning is always in your favor, but the hit detection & collision impact can get laughable & awkward sometimes, like I hit a bus & bounce 20 ft away, THATS nice.Im not a die hard dreamcast fan (the saturn takes that place) but this is a addicting arcade game that you'll get hours of fun of. one of the Several AAA titles the Dreamcast has to offer","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2014"}

The last one I owned for my 360 was a $300 Turtle Beach. In all but one or two areas, this model beats it for half the price.Overall construction is SUPERB compared to all older models. The cords are not nearly as fragile and thin. They are thick, braided and solid. It was quick and easy to assemble, with just a quick update required by hooking it to your controller and then to your Xbox. A number of reviewers have complained about a \"popping\" sound, but I never heard the slightest hint of it.No batteries, which is a nice feature, but this means that you are tethered to the controller if you want to use it. My old model allowed me to use it to listen to music or the tv without the controller at all. I only needed that if I wanted to chat.The other nice feature is you don't have to hook up that stupid little box to your TV or your Xbox--there isn't one. VERY NICE! The earcups are comfortable for extended playing sessions. And what do I mean by extended sessions? 8 hours or more. Volume controls are all MUCH more accessible than past models. Everything is right at your finger tips instead of having to fumble around on the headset trying to find the game volume. There are also independent volume controls for chat and game volume, but they can take some getting used to.The one significant complaint that I have is about a feature that older models have, but this one doesn't. The earcups fit so securely over your ears, that you can barely hear yourself talk--and I mean BARELY. Older models would play your voice over the headset so you could hear yourself, which was a very nice feature and I didn't realize how much I would miss it. Honestly, I just assumed it would be included. Other than that it is a very nice headset.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}

P. Stathoulopoulos \"nick9155\"","summary":"High hopes but way too easy","reviewText":"This game was highly anticipated, but sadly it falls short of what it could have been.First off, format wise, they throw in a Multiplayer mode, sadly missing from the PS2 version of Frontline.  They also support online play.  These features are great--the bots in Multiplayer can be tough.  So what happened to the AI in the regular mode?Overall, the first player mode falls short.  These EA shooters are all starting to look the same.  I loved the Bond games, they were fun and captured the spirit of the movies.  MoH Frontline was fantastic as well.  Rising Sun has a lot going for it, but sometimes feels like they just got lazy.For one, the game is very easy.  I finished this game in about two days, effectively.  There is very little strategy involved, and the computer AI is plain bad.  The Japanese soldiers are, of course, lousy shots, and at times will just charge right into the barrell of your gun.  The game gives you computer controlled teammates so you can fight side by side, but as can be expected, that AI is pretty awful, making the feature useless.  Your partners are bumbling buffoons.  I also found myself running around certain boards trying to figure out where to go and what action to perform, something that rarely happened in the first one or in the Bond games.The graphics are very good, the sound is awesome, but there are some things missing.  There is hardly any interaction with the surroundings aside from what you must do to finish a board.  It may seem like a small thing, but it's just lazy.  You can't open any doors except for ones that are essential to you finishing a board.  You can't break random things and shoot up rooms, something that both the Bond games and Frontline had.  There are some new features, such as the opening bit of manning a carrier gun during the Pearl Harbor attack and shooting down 0 fighters, or riding an elephant.  But again, it's all way too easy.  Matter of fact, I actually couldn't believe I finished the game when I did, the last mission hardly offers a challenge for a first person shooter.  And the Pearl Harbor opening is nowhere near as tough or as new as the D-Day landing of the original.I dropped fifty bucks on this game when it came out, and the only reason I'm not selling it back used is the multiplayer option, which still doesn't make it a great value.  I think MoH fans will find a lot to like, but the game could have been much better.You have more weapons, and some great looking boards, including very realistic jungles.  I did find myself getting lost on boards and getting frustrated because of the layout, but in the end, like the original and like Bond, the game just guides you through the missions on autopilot.  Even timid first person shooter fans will finish this game in no time.Of course, the game is bloodless and carries a teen rating, which is a shame.  I don't understand why they try to sanitize a WWII game, but it's EA, and I guess they want a bigger market.I'm hoping the 3rd person Bond game next year will be a lot better.  I was looking forward to this, now I need to go out and buy something with a little more replay value.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2003"}
{"product_name":"B008AU4YEA","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"Another whimsical, hilarious Rayman masterpiece that celebrates the joyous spirit of gaming","reviewText":"I must admit, I almost didn't buy this game new. I remember trying to buy this as soon as my local *cough cough* opened on its original release date in February only to be turned away. The story is well known by now: rather than release the COMPLETE Wii-U version first and then port it to the other systems later, Ubisoft decided to make us Wii-U owners wait so they could port (again, I emphasize) a COMPLETE Wii-U game to the other consoles, which I (and apparently the vast majority of people on the internet) thought was poor form on Ubisoft's part. However, Michel Ancel, the genius behind masterpieces likeBeyond Good & Eviland the creator ofRayman, and the rest of the development team who worked on this have been a real class act in this situation, and they do deserve support, so I broke down and bought this game right away. After all, I lovedRayman Originsso much, surely this game must at least be as good, right? Was it worth the extra 8 months of sitting on my hands to play this game (and nearly 12 months of delays overall)? You better believe it, and to be honest, I'd say an 8-month wait while being beaten with sticks would have been justified by just how incredible this game is.Rayman Origin's story was minimal at best, but it set up the action well enough, a flimsy but hilarious premise though it was. Rayman Legends isn't much deeper, but I actually find its plot set-up even more zany and even strangely epic. You see, Rayman and his buddies have been in a deep sleep for well over a CENTURY, and during that time, the great creator of Rayman's Universe and close chum to Rayman and co., the Bubble Dreamer, has had terrible nightmares that have sprung to life and kidnapped most Teensies and terrorized the world in a genrally terrorizing fashion. Rayman, Globox, Murphey, the remaining Teensies, and now a new viking character named Barbara, take it upon themselves to travel to the different worlds via magical paintings (alaSuper Mario 64) and put an end to the havoc the Buddle Dreamer's nightmares are causing. It's bizarre, it's epic, and it works at giving context to the gameplay, which is delicious beyond wordsAs far as the art design and visuals goes, Legends continues in the same vein as Rayman Origins, that is to say, indescribably imagination fueled/fueling and absolutely gorgeous. The settings you visit in this game range across the thematic spectrum of fiction and time periods, from an epic fantasy setting (complete with dungeons, castles, magical forests, etc) all the way to a bizarre combo of a chef land of gourmet delicacies and fancy deserts meets a \"Dia de los Muertos\" aesthetic. Talk about a joy to take in. Character art and animation for all characters is once again top-notch with tons of hilarity and charm, channeling the classic animation styles of yore where the drawings were joyous, funny, and zany. The sound design is just as charming, with tons of fantastic music from the same composer as Origins.  For example, the fantasy levels feature plenty of Celtic infused music, complete with bagpipes, and it is just awesome to listen to. Plenty of humor injected there as well. This should not come as a surprise to anybody who played Origins. That trademarked Rayman pig-latin gibberish returns as well. Everything in the presentation of this game is guaranteed to slap a big doofy grin on almost anybody's face.Much like Origins, the platforming in Legends is once again top-notch. Level designs are innovative and challenging. Existing gameplay ideas are brought to new heights and are as fun as ever, while new gameplay concepts are interspersed evenly throughout the game, making the whole experience feel fresh and helps to keep any sense of staleness at bay (and this is a big game, so that's even more impressive). The control mechanics are so tight you could bounce a quarter off the game and make change. This is about as good as it gets when it comes to traditional \"flatforming,\" although the game does feature some new 2.5-D moments that have you rocketing to the foreground or toward the screen, which are visually dazzling and fun to play through as well. The balance of challenge vs. accessibility is perfect in this game. Make no mistake, this is a very difficult game at times, full of challenge, but lives are unlimited and respawn locales are very frequent, making this a VERY rewarding game to play overall, with minimal frustration. Bravo developers! Boss fights are also incredibly challenging and super fun to play through (most of which also implement 2.5-D really well), not to mention super epic. Fighting a dragon while an entire kingdom burns around you is pretty sweet.The new \"music\" levels are downright amazing and deserve special mention by themselves. In these sections of the game, delightful and exciting music plays out and the game takes on a rhythmic quality in which the music perfectly syncs up with your tight speed-run platforming through the levels. In fact, you contribute to the music. In one rock-n-roll stage, Rayman punches a obstructing barrier or an enemy who is in the way, prompting a loud drum flourish, or he'll slide down a long chain, unleashing an epic guitar solo. These levels are simply amazing, and if your heart is not running overtime during these sections, you may want to check if your heart is working at all. Talk about goose-bump inducingly awesome.One feature that helps make the Wii-U the definitive version of the game to get is its use of the gamepad. The touch screen is used to control Murphey exclusively, and in many ways. You can attack enemies (or if they're bigger, tickle them until another player takes them out), move platforms around to help the other players, get rid of obstacles, you name it. Some sections require the player to tilt the gamepad, using the gyroscopic feature to tilt or move sections or platforms to help the other players get through puzzle-like sections. Even when not in levels, the gamepad is utilized excellently as a sort of central hub, always showing you new things you have unlocked. To be honest, I have not seen many games to date that utilize the gamepad this well. It really helps show off the potential of the Wii-U's most distinguishing feature and is a better game because of it rather than in spite of it. Legends acts as an excellent showcase for the system. Bravo development team!I know this is a long review already, but to be honest with you, I have barely brushed the surface of this amazing game. I haven't even mentioned how awesome co-op in this game is (and any game that I can have so much fun playing with my wife always gets bonus points from me), how long the game lasts (120 stages with 40 bonus remixed stages fromRayman Origins!) plus its amazing replayability and what a good value it is, the online features and challenge modes that adds even more replayability to the game, or the sweet Mario and Luigi costumes that are exclusive to the Wii-U version of the game. I mean, seriously, Legends has everything you could ever want from a 2-D platformer, and I can only think of one or two platformers in the last decade that comes close to the quality of Origins and now Legends. Amazing.In short, Rayman delivers yet another masterpiece. Much like Origins did, Legends just embodies the very essence of what has always made video gaming such a joyous, imaginative, FUN entertainment medium that people of all ages and backgrounds can enjoy. It's so full of charm, innovation, and brilliant execution, I cannot think of a better game to buy for the Wii-U at the moment. It is easily the #1 or #2 game for the system as of this review and, in my opinion anyway, it is easily a game-of-the-year contender across all platforms (of course it won't get the recognition, and Ubisoft's foolishly releasing it within a week or two of what willprobably be awarded game of the yearvirtually guarantees it won't get the success it deserves). Under no circumstances should it be missed by anyone with a Wii-U. What's even better, is that the definitive version of the game with the most unique and innovative features, is without a doubt the Wii-U version. So disillusioned Wii-U owners out there, take heart, this game will rock your socks off. So buy it, wake up to a dream world that needs saving, and get lost in indescribably amazing video gaming perfection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2013"}

Deans \"Shadow\"","summary":"Believe!","reviewText":"Well if your looking for rpg shooter sci fi, then look no further.  Mass effect is truly a movie.  From the very beginning you are thrown into a deep and emersive story line.  A very linear path to choose where you hunt down 1 single person.  But as you progress in the story it opens up with rich mystery, suspense, and puzzles.  You are given bits of information and from there you have to peice together a story from countless enemy encounters and legendary artifacts.  This game plays heavily into the good or bad cop and politics.  Throughout the entire game you get to choose what your main character says and how he enteracts with people.  Weither it be a good response a bad response a mixed response or no response at all.  There are chances where you get to intimidate people to do what you want rather than shoot them dead.  Or you can charm the person into doing the right thing rather than turn them into the cops.  There are also chances you can take to eliminate people if you want to be a hard liner.  Along with the story is the playback value of the game.  I myself am on my forth playthrough.  After you finish the game they allow you to continue with your same character and start again.  This allows you to build more levels and get some really unique gear.  The quests also follow a not so linear path where you can do side quests and missions to uncover more secrets and add many more hours of gameplay.My only complaint with the game is the texture mapping sometimes delays and visual details sometimes dont hit till mid conversation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Camila \"Lally\"","summary":"The most epic RPG","reviewText":"I reviewed this product at the beginning of the year and since then my thoughts about ME have drastically changed. This game is not only an RPG, but a shooter as well albeit not your typical one. At first, all of the game's element felt intimidating and confusing as I barely play RPGs so managing all my skills and powers didn't come naturally to me. Also the shooting in ME is not like most other games (i.e. Halo, Gears of War, Call of Duty) in which you can just more or less go all out and shoot like a maniac. It's a little bit more tactical as it is more fun when you mix and match you powers in combat. Once you get used to the controls, the flow of the game becomes much smoother.That's where the story of the ME takes center stage. It's written in such a way that it immerses you into what's happening with you and the other characters. Although you can make choices in the game, it never really drastically changes the course of the main story although it does impact the game in some ways. It's not like this bother me much at all as the story is incredibly great. Which brings me to my next point, although ME is set up to be a trilogy, this game ends without leaving you hanging. When I finished I understood what had happened and wasn't left wondering much. It hints at future games, but not in the way other games like Halo 2 blatantly do.Aside from the main story there numerous side quests that can be done. I'm not going to go into detail about them as they were not very interesting. The way they play out becomes tiring after the fifth missions you do, but if it's a nice option for those who want to add more gameplay hours or just want to maximize their skills. However, don't be expecting to be gathering any significant loot from these missions.For those looking for a rich  and complex narrative, characters, and gameplay Mass Effect is definitely a game you should add to your catalog.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001D7T2VM","reviewerName":"JSiph","summary":"If Legend of Zelda and God of War series had a child, this would be it.","reviewText":"This game is a third-person adventure hack-n-slash sort of game. It's very Zelda-like dungeon gameplay. Go to a new dungeon, get new item, kill miniboss, kill big boss. The main weapons have a leveling system like God of War (You earn souls for killing things, pretty similar). The story is rather original for it being based on the Apocalypse and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. All in all this is the closest game I've ever played to a Zelda game (one of my favorite franchises) and it's very fun.The Story:- You are War, the first of the Four Horsemen, arriving to Earth (present day) as Angels and Demons are fighting it out. You are neutral and with the humans you are supposed to decide the fate of the middle kingdom (mankind). As you fight your way through a city, you come across Abbadon, the leader of the Hellguard (Angel army). He says that the seventh seal was not broken, meaning the Horsemen were never called, as he gets killed by Straga (one of the Chosen of the Demon army). You are then called to the council (leaving Earth). War is sentenced to death and loses all his powers as he was not called, however if you can end the Apocalypse, the Council might reconsider and send you back to Earth (still without your former powers) with one of the Council's lackey's attached to you, in order to assure you do what you're supposed to. The five minutes with the Council equates to about 100 years on Earth, only Angels and Demons are left as all humans have been killed.Pros:- Zelda fans will love this game because of how it plays.- It's very God of War fighting and macho, but there aren't anywhere near as many Quick Time Events. If there are Quick Time Events, it's just tap the &#34;B&#34; button once.- The weapons are unique, but pretty much follow the same idea of usefulness as most Zelda weapons. The Crossblade equals the boomerang, abyssal chain equals the hookshot, etc.- The graphics are pretty good and fits the setting.- I live how a lot of the surrounding environment can be used as weapons, (Cars, light poles, parking meters.)- Quite a handful of unique characters.Cons:- The Boss fights are way too easy, the hardest one for me was the first one. The first one is the only one that you actually need to use the item obtained in that dungeon to beat it. Also, each boss takes only 3 hack-n-slash combos after you stun it to kill it. (I played on the hardest difficulty).- Everyone acts super macho, it's rather annoying (the characters look straight from Gears of War)- While I like the Zelda dungeon formula (if you want to call it that) it's sort of a rip off, that said they do it pretty well.Other:- I got all 1000G on a single playthrough on Apocalyptic difficulty (the hardest). Yes, the difficulty achievements stack.- There are a couple missable achievements (helicopter smashing, riding the angelic beast, beating Ulthane's killcount)- It took me 22 hours total including all collectibles (the last one took me 4 hours to find because while there is a weapon enhancement that reveals all hidden treasures on the local map, you have to travel to each spot for the local map to appear, you cannot zoom in from the world map). The local maps are also very spread out and three dimensional, as most dungeons have 5-7 floors.- Plus, one of the achievements require you to ride your horse 100 miles, that is extremely hard as you are limited where you can ride it. I used a rubberband around my joystick and something heavy to ride my horse around the Stygian's lair, in a circle. It still took 2 hours.You should buy this game if:- It's under $20 (it's been out for quite some time, whether it's new or used it shouldn't be hard to find around or under this price).- You like God of War and/or the Zelda series (you even have a horse, granted you are a &#34;horsemen&#34;)- While the gameplay isn't so original the story is very epic, well written, and most importantly, well done.You shouldn't buy this game if:- You don't like hack-n-slash games- Want to collect everything as soon as you see it, most things you find early on cannot be obtained until you get a weapon or learn skill later on, meaning you have to travel back.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2014"}

C. Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"I came I saw I conquered.... Well sort of...","reviewText":"This is the type of game I have been waiting to hit the consoles for years.  A good strategy game that is not bogged down with too much.  Sid Meier has created a game that can get just about any gamer into strategy gaming.Getting into Civilization Revolution is simple.  When you are at the starting menu you can go to the play now option and get into a game quickly.  There are five difficulty levels available which make this game available to any type of gamer.  I found it best to start on the simplest level to get the gameplay down first.  Now more experienced players will probably start at a more difficult level.  In the single player setting you can also play the game of the week which is something new to the Civilization series.  This setting allows you to play the same Civilization and map as everyone else.  It's a good chance to hone your skills and compare yourself to other players.  This game also has online play which allows you to take on others in building your civilization to the top.  There are four different ways to win a game and most games will take you at least three hours no matter what difficulty level.  The four ways to win are financial, cultural, domination, or technology(alpha centurai).I have found that no matter how good I think I am at this game the style can change drastically from match to match.  Just have many different maps and varied civilizations can change the difficulty drastically.  Playing on the same difficulty level can have you dominating one time and then getting beat up another time.  I have found that no matter what type of way you try to win the game it's always best to have your cities well fortified.  When your civilization has become established I have found probably the only real negative.  The game has a tendency to get a little bogged down when there is a lot going on.  This is unfortunate but is nothing that ruins the game.Civilization Revolution is a positive step forward on the consoles.  Not only do the controls work great but this game feels like it belongs on the PS3.  It is easily one of the most addictive games I have played on the PS3.  Sid Meier did a excellent job on this game and everyone who enjoys strategy and even those who don't think they are should give this game a try.  Although I will say this game is not for everyone and you should try the demo first before making a purchase decision.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2008"}

This is truly an Action gamer's Rpg. You can actually Level yourself up to God-like status! God of war, and Zelda, mixed with Morrowind Quests, and you have this game.Graphics: Polished, and cartoony, but like a serious cartoon/Comic book. it does have some glitches, but they are typical of many open-world games.Sound: Definitely epic enough! Orchestra music playing during fights is very climactic, and magic and swords sound like you would expect.Gameplay:  Though a lot of the game is run by a numbers system (weapon strength, character strength etc...) it does a phenomenal job in its fighting system., keeping the quests fun.Fun Factor: Definitely fun. once you create your character (you cant make an ugly bastard, but you can look good) the game throws you into some awesome stuff. you will already feel capable, and there are no cheap deaths.Story: Its good, but nothing you havent heard before. at least my character isnt a teen who is japanese who turns out to be some super god with funny friends who save the world from a super dragon. Sure, this one is no better, but it feels like it was written well.Overall: Buy it, if you are looking for that Sunday game away from multiplayer, which will tell you a solid story and deliver awesome combat.CONS: 1. EA has a stupid online pass to play a cool guild. Though I have the pass and it works, I really hate that they did this to the game, especially since BHG went out of business. 2.

Why? The challenges were extremely frustrating and some parts of the map had such bad graphics that it actually lead me to turn it off due to eye strain. Not kidding. It was a great game with fun elements that fell short and unpolished. Now with Prototype 2... wow... let's just say it's nothing short of amazing. The graphics were vastly improved giving it a more realistic but comic-booky feel. Gameplay, controls and sounds are completely upgraded to make it seem like you're playing a movie blockbuster. James Heller is also one of the funniest, badass \"heroes\" I have ever played. This guy had me rolling so many times that I was replaying the campaign just to hear his one liners again. Seriously. There's an enemy called \"The Juggernaut\" that's a huge, fat, ugly looking mutant/thing and after the initial shock of Heller, you begin beating him to death until, just before the last blow, he says \"HUH, NOT DOING SO GOOD...ARE YA' FATTY!!\"... I literally had to pause the game and just lmao. I know it's kinda random but it's little things like that that make an action game like this (over the top) an enjoyable experience.On a side note, I almost quit playing the game because of a glitch that prevents you from unlocking missions. It breaks the game. Completely. 81% completion it suddenly stopped and there was nothing I could do but just run around killing the infected. BUT... as I said initially, the game is SO FUN that it didn't hurt going back and doing it all over again. *Note: Don't look for collectibles during the campaign. Wait 'til you finish it.

I think we have it here.  This game has it all and is way better then vice city.  To be honest gta3 was my favorite then when vice city came out I was dissapointed.  The sun glare effect was bad and when it rained it was stupid with it's horible color system.  This game however has really realistic and good looking rain with nice sunsets.  This game has the best graphics in the sereies and the most to offer.  You can work out to get buffed or chow down to get fat but this game has something for everyone.  There's a lot of hidden stuff in the game you can do.  For instance you can play a game of basketball or play a mini video game in cj's home.  You can also shoot pool and gamble in the later stages of the game.  The radio stations are the best so far with commentating by andy dick and music by rage against the machine, ice t, snoop doggy dog, NWA, guns and roses, and a nice selection of reggae so there's music for the average rock fan or your average rap fan.  There's a variety of new missions and some that copy the older gta's.  Overall though it's going to take you at least 10-15 hours to do the missions then you also have to spray paint your logo all over the place so this game is definitly worth the money.  If you liked the previous gta games definitly get this one, even if you didn't like vice city like me you'll probably have more fun with this title.

When a power-hungry tyrant messes with Venezuela's oil supply he sparks an invasion that turns the country into a war zone. But for you, international crisis is all upside: You are a mercenary, and you profit from chaos. You are not a soldier. You don't have to play by anyone's rules. You have your own code: you will fulfill the terms of the contract, no matter what. If you see it, you can buy it, steal it, or blow the living crap out of it. Play your own way, or play with the help of a friend in the new co-op multiplayer mode.  And remember rule #1 for mercenaries: EVERYBODY PAYS.Left ColumnLogo Image (Assumes a logo of 200ppx)Center ColumnKey FeaturesMassively Open World- Play throughout the varied terrains of Venezuela that is larger than all theMercenariesmaps combined.Work for the Highest Bidder- You decide which factions to work for and when.

The explosions and vehicles in this game rival any so far. The missions are all pretty fun and vary between a variety of different activities for a variety of different factions. The weapons are all fun to shoot and the vehicles are all fun to drive. Luckily, all the things I just mentioned are done in such an awesome manner that it is fairly easy to ignore the bad points in this game.Bad Points: The ending is crap. You would think there would be something a little more thought out after the Americans and Chinese fight for oil in Venezuela. I won't tell you the ending that I saw, but I'll tell you this. It lasts all of less than half a minute and is a non-event. Another bad point is the voice acting which is just EXTREMELY annoying. It makes you want to kill all of the NPCs. On an island that headquarters the Jamaican faction all of the npc's say \"hey mon\" as you pass by. Sometimes they add a couple of words like \"mercenary\" before the phrase, but come on. What a cliche. The Australian girl at PMC headquarters has a very annoying voice also. It's like an Aussie Fran Dreshcer (not sure about spelling) that nags you whenever you mess up a mission.Anyhow, for all my complaints (and I do have a few more) this game is A LOT of fun. Just wait until you get into a Hind gunship and start blasting a village with rockets and throwing troops thirty feet in the air with the nose cannon. Imagine GTA4, but you can blow EVERYTHING up. (including skyscrapers) It's so much fun destroying the gas tanks and vehicles while hovering around dodging AA guns and surface to air missles. I'm not sure yet about replay value as I normally never play a single player game after I beat it. (Unless for nostalgia sake) There is just too many good games out there anymore. Give this a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0065NP05G","description":"","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"Five Stars For The Game; A 'Generous' Four For The Product","reviewText":"Let's be clear about this right now:\"Fallout: New Vegas\" is a video game that does not work properly on a consistent basis.  Both the original 2010 PS3 disc and this Ultimate Edition have problems that are unacceptable in most people's minds.  The game freezes occasionally.  The framerate chugs once in a while.  Characters will sometimes get stuck on a hill or a table, or some other piece of environment.  In terms of product testing and quality assurance, \"Fallout: New Vegas\" (and other Bethesda releases) should be ashamed that some of these issues aren't fixed.If that's a deal-breaker for you, consider this a 2-star review.  However, it's because of consumers like me that Bethesda is allowed to get away this lack of fine-tuning.  I am personally willing to deal with these technical hiccups because in my opinion, \"Fallout: New Vegas\" is the best open-world RPG of this console generation.  I don't really care for the sword-and-sorcery \"Elder Scrolls\" experience, and I think \"Fallout 3\" was a very good game with some baffling world design (subway system, anybody?).  I invested 60 hours in the original \"New Vegas\" when it first came out in 2010, and this Ultimate Edition has already brought another 40 hours thanks to some solid bonus content and a well-crafted design that indeed lets you, the player, choose what happens.I won't go into too much detail about what \"New Vegas\" is, because there are much better written reviews and video reviews that'll explain what you're in for.  Aside from my aforementioned opinion that \"New Vegas\" is superior to the more critically-acclaimed and commercially-successful \"Fallout 3\", I would like to emphasize that the ending is the most personalized I can recall.  Every faction you encounter, every live-or-die choice you made, every siginifcant story decision, and even the smallest rumor you stumbled across...most of these details will be reflected in a slideshow epilogue which tells you what happened to all of these people.  If you don't believe how complex your tale will end, just go to the official \"Fallout: New Vegas\" wiki and sample the possible ending branches.  Whatever you do in \"New Vegas\" will be your adventure.As you're probably aware, this Ultimate Edition includes:*  all of the post-released patches to fix many of the technical errors when this game first came out.*  all the 4 DLC quests released in 2011*  the Gun-Runners Arsenal, which essentially means more weapons available to buy, and some bonus challenges to help you level up quicker*  all the pre-order bonus packs that were available depending on where you bought \"New Vegas\" in 2010.So, what do I think about all of this stuff?Personally, I think the patches being on-disc are the biggest deal.  I think people forget that one day, the ways our games are being fixed through online downloads might not be available one day.  This game used to have issues where quests couldn't be completed depending on who you talked to, and companions wouldn't appear on your map so you might lose them.  And while \"Fallout: New Vegas\" isn't perfect by any stretch, it's nice to have a lot of these glitches sorted out permanently on this Ultimate Edition disc.The pre-order packs are neat.  My only gripe is that as far as I know, there's no way to turn them off before your game starts.  As a result, you'll always have a canteen to keep your character from thirsting, and a few extra guns and outfits to get your started.  It's not a huge deal because you can always just drop the items or sell them; then again, perhaps players will appreciate having these perks to get started on the long adventure.The Gun-Runners Arsenal doesn't really mean much for me.  The new weapons are incredibly expensive, so you won't get to enjoy them until you've played the game for a while.  Plus, I never really dealt with weapon-modding, so the scopes and damage-modifiers I found usually ended up just getting sold.  Also, the new challenges are pretty ridiculous, so I wouldn't count on them to get more XP too much.  Besides, there are enough challenges available for players to level up without the GRA content.The big deal for most buyers will be the 4 DLC quests.I really hated \"Dead Money\" for reasons that would take way too long to get into.  But in short, the toxic environment is annoying and bland, the enemies and weapons create a survival-horror experience that I hate, the companions are weird, and the story is just dumb thanks to a sinister villain's oddball intentions.\"Honest Hearts\" and \"Old World Blues\" are easily my favorites.  \"Hearts\" deals with tribalism in Utah, where two leaders ask you to sympathize with their opposite approaches to religion, violence, and survival.  The pressure on you to handle the exodus from the dangerous Zion Valley is well-realized.  \"Old World Blues\" is widely-considered to be the best of the DLC content, and it's hard to argue with that.  This mad sci-fi tale is one that you have to see to believe, with robots that'll make you laugh hard while trying to reclaim your organic limbs because you're essentially a robot now.\"Lonesome Road\" is an interesting but inconsistent story that sheds some light on events leading up to The Courier ('You') getting involved with the Platinum Chip, and how the NCR/Legion conflict plays into it.  I found that the story was intriguing on paper, but the characters you encounter don't really mesh with it.  It's almost like two separate stories are trying blend together with an important purpose, but to me, it just doesn't gel.Even though I only really liked 2 of these main quests (\"Honest Hearts\" and \"Old World Blues\"), the cost to buy a 2010 \"New Vegas\" disc and purchase these 2 DLC quests is the same as picking up the Ultimate Edition release, so you're better off just buying the whole package.OVERALLI don't blame people for being harsh on \"Fallout: New Vegas\".  For some people, even one technical error is enough to write off the whole game.  If you're hoping that this Ultimate Edition rights all wrongs...I'm sorry, but it doesn't.  If you're going to experience the Mojave Wasteland, you're going to have put extra work into it.  Keep multiple save files.  Keep your PS3 offline so that your machine isn't doing work that isn't needed.  Be prepared to restart your PS3 when the game starts getting choppy and/or freezes.I choose to take the good with the bad because I love this game!  I find the story and world to be endlessly fascinating, even moreso than the better-received \"Fallout 3\".  The options available to the player are almost-unmatched --- aside from the very beginning and very end, you can explore this massive world however you want to!  Do you side with the militaristic New California Republic, or the blood-cleansing Caesar's Legion?  Will you use your Speech skills to your advantage only to attempt peace, or will you also use it to intimidate the weak?  Do you steal, pickpocket, hack, and lockpick to survive...or do you make your means through combat?  Do you kill only those who attack first, or everyone who stands in your way?  Do you want to complete as many quests as possible, or do you just want to see the main story through?  Do you travel alone, or do you bring a companion with you?  And if you happen to stumble across a scenario where your companion might have to be killed to please another person, what choice will you make?This game forces players to make hard choices yet always rewards the choices they make.  This indeed is going to the experience you want it to be.  I urge you to forgive the technical shortcomings, and realize what a stunning achievement \"Fallout: New Vegas\" really is.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2012"}

This new chapter uses next-generation technologies to create a fully immersive gaming adventure.","reviewerName":"Jon Snow","summary":"Fun game","reviewText":"Great controls in this game.  There are so many different things you can do and the controls are set up very well for a real-time RPG on a console.There are so many ways you can replay this game with different character types.  It is not linear by any means, but can be if you want it to.  It's entirely up to how you want to play.  It really sets the bar for other games of this type in many ways.  The world is giant.  There are so many places to go and missions to accomplish.  It's crazy.There is one big problem I see with this game: The creatures you fight get tougher as you advance in level.  This is a real deterrent to making you want to level up.  Imagine fighting a wolf as a new level 1 character with no problem and then getting to level 7 and having the same wolf easily kill you.  As you gained 6 levels and all the experience and skills that go along with them, the wolf gets equally tough.  How does a wolf train to become equally better?  Does the wolf go to jujitsu school???  So as you advance, it becomes increasingly tougher just to get to your next mission location because a wolf comes up and bites you from behind and you're outta there.  A wolf should not gain experience the way your character does.  In just about any RPG, the wolf would maintain its level of difficulty and as you get better, killing a wolf becomes like squashing an ant. I can accept tougher creatures as you advance (ie demons, dragons, the undead, etc...), but not wolves getting tougher.Anyhow, if you advance too quickly, the game becomes impossible.  It's easier to play all the way through without advancing beyond level 3.  But then you don't get to learn and use all the skills of the higher level characters.  As a result, the game can become somewhat repetitive.I heard this problem is remedied in Fallout (which uses the same game system).In the next Oblivion, fixing this issue alone will make it so no RPG can touch it (unless someone comes up with an MMORPG version of Oblivion for the 360).  But until then, it's not the greatest.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000038IFX","reviewerName":"Brian Seiler","summary":"I Have to be Honest","reviewText":"Truthfully, I really want to be able to recommend this game.  It's not as though there's not a lot here to recommend--the story is well written, and though it doesn't stray TOO far from the well-beaten RPG path, it does break some new ground.  The battle system, while not revolutionary, is at least workable.  More than anything, I got around forty hours of solid enjoyment out of this title.The only problem is that it took me sixty hours to finish the game, and it's those other twenty that get in the way of my giving an unconditional recommendation.  There are a lot of ways to screw up a game.  You can poorly design the levels, you can write a broken combat progression, you can blow the ending--the list is pretty well endless.  One way that I never thought I'd witness, however, is simply not finishing the thing.  This game is not done.  There is no other way to put it.All the way up through the end of the first CD, things cruised along nicely.  Then, all of a sudden, the world map disappeared.  That's the only way I can think to put it.  Whereas before I had been able to control where my characters went and explore the environments, now I was forced to sit through rather uninteresting sequences featuring one of the lead characters sitting in a wicker chair and telling me what I supposedly just did.  The ONLY interaction between the game and the player through that second CD consists of fighting the boss battles that it unceremoniously thrusts you into.That is a terrible, criminal sin of game design.  You are allowed to put the plot on a rail if you want, but you DO NOT get to take away any ability the player may have had to control the game or interact with the world.  At that point, your \"game\" ceases to be a game and becomes an experiment in button pushing.  I don't mind exposition, but I do expect to have some control over my own fate when the speech gets done.  If you take that away from me, I get angry, and this game made me VERY angry.There are other problems here as well.  By Square standards, the localization is dismal.  While it's not as incomprehensible as, say, Okage, there are still some pretty serious mistakes in the English script.  Is it just me, or is it reasonable to expect that the people localizing my game for me know that the word is \"should've\"--not \"should of.\"  Mistakes like that are strewn throughout the game text, and I must admit that it detracted a little bit from my ability to enjoy the experience.  Of course, as the game progressed, those errors got worse.  Around halfway through the second CD, the script writers were dropping words by the twos and threes.  Now, that didn't throw me SO much, since I normally read like that anyway, but for people who, you know, like to have all the words, this could be a problem, particularly coming from Square--a house made famous in part by its great localization efforts.The plot is a little bit more adult than you're likely to find with other games in the genre.  Indeed--any parents out there who might be concerned with their children reading thinly veiled discussions of pedophile priests and cartoon buttocks would be well advised to avoid this title.  It's really pretty standard anime/manga fare on the whole, but, strangely enough, you don't see much of that in the video game industry, so the game manages to be unique and interesting.  Of course, the religious references could use some work.  I know from Dogma that Metatron is the recording angel (and that's pretty obscure), but I find it difficult to believe that somebody who hasn't been through seminary is going to be able to appreciate all of the parallels that this plot has with the Christian faith.On the whole, this game is ALMOST incredible.  Had it stayed in production for another year, it might have made it all the way there.  Unfortunately, the product that we're left with is unfinished, with some incredibly serious problems near the end (for example, what is the point of letting me run around all over the world map and collect all these great pieces of character gear if the last dungeon is a GEAR dungeon?).  As it stands, RPG faithful and anybody willing to overlook the game's faults should find an interesting experience, but I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who's not a member of one of those niche groups.  We can only hope that Xenosaga (NOT a prequel, as most would have you believe), due out early next year in the U.S., avoids the mistakes that hold this title back.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2002"}

You can get rear or hood mounted shotgun which can be aimed with the right analog stick like a 1st person shooter, or rocket launchers which are also upgrade able and aimable like the shotgun, and two high powered mashine guns that reimind me of the smg on Halo 2 but much larger. The other wepons are grinades and land mines.(also upgrade able) While playing the game It has the effect of sucking you in to the action. Mainly because you just dont know what will happen next. The out come to every desison you make will have a different effect every time. There is a unwreck feature that has been added to the single player mode which allows you to rewind time and save your self from destruction or watch you destruction over and over. There is also a instant replay feature too. I use this feature to watch the realy good action and the 360 shows alot of power through different effects that are cinima worthy. Like ripple effects added to explosions, the ground cracking from the focus point to the outer edges of the impact area and the sparks and bullet holes which is not new or special just look great.

It was a great game, but I felt trapped in the city and missed the open spaces of San Andreas.  Well, we are back to San Andreas now, with all the stuff we liked from GTA San Andreas on GTA IV level graphics.  The graphic jump per se isn't as large as it was between San Andreas and IV, what we get is a greater map, and a much larger variety of terrains and features.  There is some improvement to texture (i think) but not on the level of the previous \"jumps\" of improvements of the series.The story rocks, and I liked the multiple characters idea.  Now larger missions have heist mechanics where you can choose ways of performing the mission which impact not only the basic approach of the mission but how it will unfold (a incompetent hired help can mess up things, while a capable one will want more money).The characters are great, but IMHO Trevor just steals the show. He probably has the most incredible introduction of any character in GTA history, specially if you played and liked The Lost and the Dammed DLC for GTA IV.The driving is really responsive once again. They listened to us so bicicles are back, you can dive the depths and fly the skies (the flying mechanics are pretty neat too).  The mini games changed (mostly) from more indoor to more outdoor.  So golf and tennis instead of bowling a pool, but you still have darts.I might be biased since San Andreas was my favorite GTA, but GTA V keeps up with the franchise.I should note the story is overall a bit more serious than San Andreas, but quite a bit less serious than the more dramatic parts of GTA IV.

It was like a huge tsunami of awesomeness that no one could have predicted. Thus the first Kingdom Hearts was born with lots of charm and character, but had a lot of problems with combat, and had one confusing story. The second game came out and really added depth to the game and was fan-freaking-tastic. Birth by Sleep is a prequel to the first game, and you really get a lot of stuff that was answer-less in the last two games. You play as Terra, Ventus, and Aqua who are three keyblade wielders trying to stop the darkness spreading through the worlds and within themselves. While the story works and is a lot simpler than past games it never feels like it really goes anywhere and isn't as emotional as the other games.With that aside the next biggest thing is combat. While it's a lot deeper it's also a lot more confusing and can be daunting to understand especially to new comers and younger players. You have a command deck that allows you to swap out abilities and there are a lot of them. You can eventually equip up to 9 commands, but flipping through them is tedious and not so combat friendly. Using the D-pad to flip through commands can really kill you especially during tough boss fights. Having to move from the analog nub to the D-pad means you stand still while switching. This leaves you vulnerable, and can mean life or death if you have one hit left.You can use a shot lock command which is like a special attack that requires focus. You go in a first person mode and lock on the target for a few seconds and it unleashes a pretty devastating attack. Summons are no longer available instead they are replaced with the less spectacular D-links. As you beat worlds Disney characters can be selected, and basically you just have a different set of commands to choose from. Your health replenishes, but this doesn't seem as exciting as seeing the character fighting with you.You can meld commands together and add boosts to create new commands. This can be really interesting and you can make commands you can't normally buy or find. Other than this the menus are the usual with character bios, documents and what not, but once you get used to the menu you will have no problems. The biggest issue with combat is the stupid camera. Relying on a camera is critical with PSP games due to the lack of a second analog nub, but this camera is stupid. Locking on seems like a good idea until the lock on breaks for some unknown reason and you lose sight of the enemy. This is really irritating during highly intense boss fights because you lose sight of them and can walk right into their traps. The camera likes to flip-flop around constantly and fighting enemies above you is like down into a swirling toilet with needles stabbing your eyes. It jitters and jutters and spasms and it feels like the game is having an epileptic fit.Despite this it's manageable and you get so used to it you just deal with it. Exploration is still the same yawn fest, but even more so since most of the environments aren't as active or lush as KH2. The worlds are super short and you can get to each boss without even fighting a single enemy, but if you return they re-spawn and this is only because of the irritating amount of level grinding. No matter what you do or what level you are bosses can kill you in just a few hits. At level 25 I was still getting my butt kicked by a boss late into the game. This leads to each character's story completion time to about 10 hours. The worlds just don't feel alive and as exciting as in KH2 and just seem like bite sized samples of what they should be. There are a few original worlds which is a nice touch, but they could have made the game so much better.There is a command board game that is so complicated and boring that you may not even care about it. You move around a board trying to collect new commands, and it's overly complicated as all Square mini-games are. This is more like a mini-mind meltdown than anything else and co-op doesn't make it any more fun. The game's best  feature is its technical achievement being one of the very few games that push the PSP to the max. You could easily mistake this game for a PS2 game, but there is some frame rate issues and if you don't install your data to your memory stick you are most likely going to experience horrendous load times. The voice acting is a bit iffy, but the game looks amazing. The enemies are pretty boring and generic and they could have been a lot better.Overall Birth by Sleep is a great start and I hope this isn't the last KH on the PSP. If they improve the game's many flaws we are looking at the best portable game ever made. What the game really needs is a re-boot because this formula is tasting a bit stale in 2010.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Mistwalker was formed by industry veterans who worked on Final Fantasy, while Artoon was formed by industry veterans who worked on Sonic the Hedgehog, Phantasy Star, NiGHTS, Burning Rangers, and Silent Hill. It's easy to see why Blue Dragon reminds us of the classic games we used to play, because it's a product of the visionaries who brought us those classics.Many criticized Blue Dragon for being too \"traditional\" or \"classic\" in its approach to the role-playing game genre, but that's a positive for me, because this is the kind of game we no longer get in today's day and age, which is sad.The turn-based battle system is polished and fun, while the graphics are some of the best I've seen for this style, and the story is very enjoyable throughout. Quite notable is Nobuo Uematsu's soundtrack, which is top notch stuff. The boss battle theme by Ian Gillan of Deep Purple is ridiculous, but that's what makes it so cool.Blue Dragon is inexpensive, lengthy, and fun, so buy it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2012"}

But that counts for nothing when it doesn't function.First day I got it I played maybe five hours, then stopped to take a shower, came back, and  was met with an error message saying my multiplayer data was unreadable and I had to start over from the beginning. I responded by ejecting the disk and tossing it behind the TV.The other day I thought I'd give it another try and popped it in. Deleted my save data (because if it's unreadable, who cares?) and tried again. To my surprise I had my unlocked equipment back. I proceeded to play amid some light freezing issues and enjoy myself thoroughly with a well balanced tactical FPS.Today was different. Today the game froze almost nonstop. I lost and reclaimed my data maybe half a dozen times. I fought this game for over an hour and a half, just wanting to play the fun game. I was met with more freezing. In the menu, within the game, between loading screens. As you can imagine, I became frustrated.I responded by bending the disc in half twice and depositing it into the trash, where it belongs.11/7/12 EDIT - All right, my 360 went into a downward spiral of not reading games and general freezing shenanigans not long after this review.  So I came to the assumption that it was my system which produced these issues, not the game.  I've since sent my 360 in for repairs and got a refurbished console in to replace it.  I decided to try my Battlefield 3 Single Player disc which also froze often and randomly on the previous machine, thinking the problem was my 360 and would now be fixed.  I was wrong.  The freezing issue persists regularly at random intervals.  Vote my review down if you like, but these are the facts: the machine is essentially brand new, well-ventilated, and properly updated.  The game disc is free of the slightest imperfections.  It still does not function for me.  I can not give it more than a 1-star rating.  By all reason it should work fine and it doesn't.  If you had a proper experience with it, I am glad.  It is a very fun game (when it works.)","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2012"}

I'm not mad that Uncharted is pretty easy. I need to be able to progress at a pace that matches the narrative without having the opportunity to forget what is happening.If you change TR to accommodate a stronger narrative to the point that you remove challenging puzzles and platforming, you are doing it wrong. You are scrapping what made TR great to pursue the strength of another game in another genre.Honestly, I would forgive the TR reboot for the pointless XP bars, the Batman-like ESP-vision, and the pointless crafting system. I think those things are mostly superficial and wouldn't necessarily hurt a TR game if you borrow so heavily from Batman, Far Cry, etc. How is it not obvious that taking the computer-assisted platforming and puzzles from games in another genre that is not known for its puzzles and platforming is a mistake?If this game was called &#34;Lisa Croft: Island Survivor&#34; and didn't portray itself as a &#34;reboot&#34; I wouldn't even care.

Overall the gameplay stays the same with the exception of the added features of the WiiU gamepad which makes playing the game easier to do as you can now switch equipment,search maps and locations and switch between sight modes without problem or having to pause the game to do so.The graphics are the same as seen on either the PS3 or Xbox 360 as are the online features,also if you still feel uncomfortable using the WiiU gamepad you do have the option of using the pro controller but that kind of defeats the purpose of getting the WiiU version in the first place. So rejoice WiiU fans of the more hardcore games as now you have Splinter Cell to add to your Nintendo game library.Update 06-10-2014PS3/WiiU ComparisonGameplay: The overall graphics and detail on the WiiU are equal to those seen on the PS3,the basic control actions like stealth/cover/climb are the same the difference is the items equip function. The WiiU has the mission equipment inventory and quantity on the gamepad screen and when you need an item say a smoke grenade or sticky camera you just touch icon on the gamepad screen and use the L button to target and throw, the same with the spec goggles as you can easily switch between functions with a touch on the gamepad screen. Some functions do still use the cross button but that was mostly just choosing between lethal and non-lethal take downs.The load time for the WiiU version does take significantly longer then the PS3 version though it's a little annoying it's understandable too since the WiiU version only installs 75MB onto the WiiU's internal/external hard drive unlike the PS3 version which installed a huge 12GB onto the PS3 hard drive.  The online gameplay is the same as well and have not seen any signs of lagging or freezing during gameplay.  Ultimately it's a tossup for console owners but both versions are incredible to play regardless though the WiiU's gamepad does give it a good advantage over the PS3 version in my personal opinion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2014"}

So I sat down and watched him for a bit before he eventually asked me if I'd like a go.  I said sure and within 24 hours I owned this mother of a gem.If you've never played this game or it's sequel, you are missing out on some serious fun.For starters, there is a pretty good amount of things to do in this game, from the basic story mode, which is insanely difficult for the most part, to the mini-games, like bowling and flying.  The games are fun and addictive, espescially with a friend or two.  You will find yourself going round after round, rolling down a huge ramp only to be shot off the end and launched into the clear blue sky.  You then open your ball up and use it as a glider to navigate your monkey through the air and try to land of score specific targets floating in the water.  If you miss, you fall in the water and get nothing except a whining monkey, who is also drowning for a brief period of time.I can't really say too much about this game that isn't just praising the fun level of it.  There really is no story, you are just a group of monkeys and for some reason they are in balls.  I really don't know the story behind that.So go out and buy this game, or have a swarm of angry, monkey-toting balls on your hands...wait a minute, that doesn't sound right...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2004"}

It was a fun game, with an emphasis on style.  It had great graphics, dozens of cars, and a huge single player.  There were some problems though.  It was extremely hard in areas, people wanted more cars (only 80 or so in the first), and the multiplayer wasn't very fun.  Because it was hard for people to just pick up the controller and play...Well, Project Gotham Racing 2 has everything the first one did, and so much more!  Its funner, looks better, plays better, and isn't as frustrating.  You can really get good at it, and you never really get stuck.  Here's what I thought of Project Gotham Racing 2:1) Single Player~ This game has an amazing single player.  Dozens of tracks, hundreds of cars, and a ton of fun tracks.  The game is divided into 2 sections: Kudos World Series and Arcade Racing.  The overall goal is to earn Kudos (for every few thousand Kudos, u get tokens.  With the tokens you can buy new cars).  You can earn the tokens in either the World Series or Arcade modes.In the Kudos World Series, you start out in the lowest class (there are 15 or so classes, each with about 10 cars).  Once you select a class + pick a car, you can begin racing.  You pick either to race, cone challenge, 1 on 1, pass as many cars as u can, finish a lap in a certain amount of time, etc...  There are several challenges in each class.  Each challenge has 5 difficulties: steel, bronze, silver, gold, or platinum medals.  Once you complete a class (and earn as many tokens as u can while at it), you can move on to the next.In Arcade Racing, you either street race or do cone challenges.  You are given a car (no car classes here) and try to beat each challenge.  There are also 5 difficulties here.  Its pretty much just a chance to earn more kudos, and tone your skills.The single player is huge, tons of cars, medals, and challenges to complete.  Just single player alone will keep you busy for dozens and dozens of hours.2) Online Play: This is where the game really shines.  First off, online play is a WHOLE new game.  There are no medals, no cone challenges.  The only thing that comes with you from single player is the cars you unlocked.  Once online you can race with friends, or just random people.  You can use any of the tracks you unlocked in single player, or join a game with a map you haven't unlocked.  When doing &quot;Kudos Racing&quot; you can earn Kudos to increase your Kudos Rank (online).  Everyone starts at 1 on LIVE.  After you earn your first few thousand Kudos, that will increase to 2.  The next ten thousand, 3.  The next twenty thousand, 4.  etc...  Its sort of a badge, telling people how good you are at this game.Online you can race with up to 8 people.  Voice Chat, rankings, friends, etc...  And with Kudos Rank and racing, it really is an unlimited game online.  There are really good people out there, so if the computer is just getting too easy, meet your challenge online.3) Graphics~ The graphics in this game are...amazing.  Cars get beat up, glass smashes, license plates become bent and smash off, doors get bent, etc...  Your car really does look beaten if you have a messy race.  Hard slides have smoke coming up from the tires.  Screech marks remain in the steet for the race after a sharp turn.  Crashes are greatly improved over the original.  Nothing like walling a rival, seeing his perfect car smashed into peices, then driving off taunting.  The graphics really do make the game better.Weather changes are great in this game too.  At night, its hard to see, and your headlights are your only guide around the track.  Oh, if you break them, they dont shine anymore...  When its raining, its hard to see.  You car slides all over the track (go a little slower perhaps?)  And it just looks incredible.  The rain gets on the cars, makes them shine a bit.  The track is wet and slippery.  Weather really is fun in this game...Overall the graphics are incredible, and really show off the XBOX's power.4) Gameplay~ This game is just..really fun to play.  Its a blast to hit a perfect slide, keep control, and leave your oppenant in the dust.  Steering is hard, and knowing when to slow down, or how to take a turn is really important.  In other words, newbs don't beat experts in this game, and you can really get good.  This game has rankings online, and you can work your way to #1 (permanantly, as stats dont reset in this game)Overeall this game is just a blast.  Worth every penny, anyone looking for a fun LIVE game, or who loves racing HAS to buy this.  10/10Thx!obryanstars*","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2004"}

The 3rd Birthday distances itself from it predecessors via gameplay style and story.  What we have here is a third person shooter in a similar vein Resident Evil 4 and Gears of War.Ducking behind cover is automatically initiated upon positioning the main character, Aya Brea, next to obstacles on the map.  Due to the PSP's lack of a second analog stick, running is done with the only analog stick on the system and aiming is managed by locking on to enemies with the L should button and switched to different enemies via the D-pad.This is a third-person shooter after all, so gone are the days of random battles with detailed inventory and stats menus.  The 3rd Birthday has retained a bit of its RPG pedigree with a rudimentary leveling system, weapon, and \"OE Chip\" menu.  The OE Chips are bits of DNA collected from killing enemies by \"Overdiving\" into them and exploding them into a bloody mess.  Honestly, throughout my time with the game I didn't really pay to much attention to the OE Chip system.  I'd equip some chips here and there to increase my stats such as healing, aim and whatnot, but I didn't really put too much emphasis or time into it.  That being said, the system does increase your stats so you will have to spend a little time with it.Weapons; well I didn't spend to much time with either.  You can purchase various weapons to assist you in the game but I just found myself purchasing two rifles and keeping the standard pistol.  I upgraded their accuracy, capacity, et cetera and that was about it.  You can only equip three weapons and I found myself with the same three from beginning to end...except when overdiving into other people.Also, there's kind of an armor system.  Kinda.  You can switch between wearing a jacket and not wearing a jacket.  Having the jacket on ups your defense stats, which slowly wither away with the amount of damage you take and the amount of clothes that are torn from Aya.  Yes, he clothes are torn off to the point that she's running around in close to a bra and panties.  Geez, Square....  I guess by beating the game you can unlock more outfits such as a sexy maid's outfit and whatnot.  (At least that's the one I unlocked when I beat it.)Now for overdiving.  Overdiving is a technique in which Aya transplants her consciousness and possesses anther human being.  You'll inherit the abilities, and a fourth weapon, of anyone you overdive into.  You can also overdive into helicopter pilots and tank operators for more military might.  Additionally, upon inflicting enough damage on an enemy, a triangle will appear on the enemy indicating to you that you can overdive and inflict massive damage on the enemy or make them explode.How does all this stuff I just cover mesh into the rest of the game?  Well, its cool, I admit but the story is a convuluted mess which is really just there for the sake of progressing the game from level to level.  The non-playable characters lack any sort of palpable depth to them and come in and out of the script with really no bearing on the game, or caring, but the gamer.The gameplay itself is mediocre and consists of running of room to room killing all enemies and moving on to the next.  Towards the end of this, albeit, short game I really found myself just slogging through it just to be finished with it.The graphics are very good, not as great as Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, but definitely make the PSP shine.  FMV sequences are very well done and the music is stellar.All in all, The 3rd Birthday was a decent action romp.  It's definitely a good time waster.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2011"}

I did not play this on the PS2 as I was in the Army at that point, and when I got out, it made no sense to get a PS2 for this game alone.  Having played the PS3 and PC Final Fantasy games, I felt that Square was heading down hill since they merged and became Square Enix.This was so much fun for me as it took me back to the simplicity and enjoyment of Final Fantasy 6 (3 in the US (Espers and Kefka)) and that is something that has been lacking for a long while.  Some say that Final Fantasy 7 was the best, others say 6.  I think that 10 gives them both a run for the title.

But it never did.  It's somewhat reminiscent of the GTA series with the free roam mode and the crudeness of characters.  This game actually sort of reminded me of Kill Bill if you've ever seen the movie.  Saying that there is a lot off blood in this game is a drastic understatement.  The storyline if fun and the idea is very cool.  You are a nobody that accidentally got in to a fight with a guy and killed him.  Turns out he was an assassin in a group of assassins that are continuously killing each other to be #1.  Obviously you are involuntarily sucked into the game.  You have to earn money doing monotonous side jobs or minor assassination missions so you can enter in for the next boss battle.  The controls are very clever and the weapon usage is pretty unique.  But I just wanted more than the single track, linear game.  This game completely lacked variety in my opinion, that's about it.  The graphics also looked very poor on a big LCD with and without the component Wii cables.  But if you're in to games with unique and fun controls this may be the game for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2008"}

Once I picked up a PS3 and saw the low price this game was going for, I decided to give these classic PS2 games a try.  This pair of games has to be one of the best deals in all of gaming right now, and if like me you haven't played God of War before you should seriously think about getting this game.  These games are pretty gory and violent, so if you're a parent you might not want your younger children playing this game, but it's isn't any more violent than a lot of other popular M rated games currently available.Everything about these games is fantastic.  The controls are reasonably simple yet deep enough to add real strategy to this game (mindless button mashing mostly works on lower difficulty levels, and absolutely does not work on higher difficulty levels), and most importantly, are precise.  The animation and art in this game are top-notch.  While God of War isn't really faithful to its source material, this doesn't really matter, and if the game gets teenagers more interested in reading classical mythology, that's a fantastic side effect of a game which is already lots of fun to play.  There is a lot of bonus content which only becomes unlocked after beating the game, some of which requires you to beat the game at the highest difficulty level, so for very serious players there's plenty of challenge to be had here.The graphics have been upgraded from the original PS2 games, although of course these games don't look as good as games which were designed for PS3.  Nevertheless, the games are much better than what you would have seen on the PS2, and certainly do not detract from the gameplay experience.  It's a bit odd that some of the cut scenes weren't remastered, but this is just a minor issue since these cut scenes are only a minor part of the game.Two awesome games at a really low price make this a great purchase.  As if you weren't already getting enough when you buy this game, you also get a code which lets you download the 2009 E3 God of War III playable demo, and of course if you buy this game at Amazon right now you get a 5 dollar credit towards GOW3.  Remaking great PS2 games and releasing them on the PS3 for a budget price is a fantastic idea, and hopefully other publishers and developers will follow in SCEA's footsteps and release their own compilations of classic PS2 games on the PS3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2010"}

The fairly new anti-hero has established himself as a greatly unique character in the video game world.  With his painfully deep back-story, to his constant deception by the gods of Olympus, Kratos is a character that fans can truly appreciate.  Within the few years Kratos has existed, he has truly become something remarkable.  From the PS2 to the PSP, Kratos has always been one of the most interesting lead characters in a game franchise.  However, several years into the PS3 life cycle, Kratos has been absent from the new hardware.  Sony has revitalized God of War with this collection so that even those who have purchased newer, non-backwards compatible PlayStation 3 hardware may be able to revisit the games that helped set a new standard for action games.God of War Collection is just that, a collection of the first two games in the trilogy.  The two games tell the story of Kratos' initial deception at the hands of the gods, all the way to his epic confrontation with Zeus himself.  The disc features all of the original content from the first two games, but all stored conveniently on one disc.  Running in native 720p, as compared to upscaling to 720p via backward compatible units playing the PS2 versions, the games run much smoother than their last generation counterparts.  With great anti-aliasing being utilized, the game looks like a new game all on its own.  It's almost impossible to think that these were once PS2 games.  The one thing that Sony did overlook when producing this game was enhancing the cut-scenes of the game that utilize the in-game engine.  These still appear to have the same resolution of the original games since when the game gets to these moments a drastically noticeable drop in resolution occurs.  This is just a minor flaw and I can completely overlook it since I still think they look fairly good, just not as good as the rest of the game.If anyone has not played the first two games of this franchise, then I highly recommend this game.  If someone owns the original two games, I also highly recommend this purchase since you will be missing out on trophies and native 720p resolution.  The game also comes packaged with a voucher for the demo version of God of War III.  So there is really no reason why someone who owns a PS3 should not pick this game up, even if you've played the originals they fail in comparison to this version.  If you've ever been interested or intrigued by the series, now is your chance to get the first two parts of the trilogy for the same price it would cost to purchase the two PS2 versions.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

Weidman \"beawei\"","summary":"The Best Game Out Now-Yes, It Still Is!!!","reviewText":"A Good game comes along, entertaining millions of fans worldwide. Then, a year later another good game comes along and steals the fisrt ones place. Ever since the beginning of game history, every good game that came out eventually got replaced by a better game the next year. Since Sept. 98, that cycle has been broken, stopped by one game that never got replaced, even by it's sequals, nothing ever ended out better than Zelda: Ovarina of Time. This game has revolutionized 3D gaming with its Z-Target system. It has enchanted and bewildered people with its magnificant storyline. It has taken the lives of thousands of people because of all the side-quests and collectible items in it. This game, I am predicting, will probably still rain supreme until the next system comes out (The one after gamecube). Its Z-Targeting system makes Link (the main character) look at an enemy, within this looking, he can circle around it in stategic patterns, accurately aim and strike the sword without missing and hitting air a yard away, and eaily and quickly dodge and backflip attacks. Many games, even nowadays, imitate this system, but fail to get it as correct and perfect as Zelda did/does. The storyline starts off telling of a magical forest with many never-growing children in it. All these children have one compainon fairy with them, except one boy, who does not. Right from hearing this setence in the game for the first time, you know your in for an adventurous, complicated yet slightly realistic storyline that will take your life for at least a month. And, this game has many, many side quests to do. There are 100 special spiders to defeat and get treasures with, 50 magic beans to be planted and give a passegeway to unaccesible areas, 25 heart pecies to collect to get a whole lot of health with, 15 masks to sell and play around with, 6 empty bottles to collect, a chicken to rais, and a huge trading sidequest that eventually leads to the possesion of the strongest weapon in the game. And much more. This game also has the perfect sound to it. The cheerfull, happy nature of the magical forest can be perfectly heard in it's background music. The adventurous, wide and far meadows of hyrule feild are perfectly expressed in it's background song. The fast-paced and action-packed lives of the desert theives is clearly expressed in it's song. Everywhere you turn in this game, you are greeted with a new background song that sings perfectly the attributes and unique features of that place, and transations perfectly with whatever the player/link might be doing in that place. This game's sequal, Majoras Mask, suffered horribly from the lack of this. And the prevous games in the series didnt meet this either. One more thing though, I'll admit it to the world, I hate the main Zelda theme. I'm glad its not in Ocarina of Time, In a game that so clearly stands out with it's music, one old sounding, bland song that dosnt fir well with hyrule feild wouv'dv ruined the experience of going out of kokiri forest and seeing it for the first time. Oh, I forot to mention that part too, the game has a perfect attidude for adventure in it. The places are designed very well, and when mixed in with the fabulous background music, gives a feeling of adventure that is completely unparelled to any other game, whatsoever. The first moment you walk out of the small and cramped kokiri forest, which actually used to seem so big, onto the your first grasses of hyrule feild, the sun will blind the screen for a moment, and as rising, reveal this spectacular, wide open feild with a tuft of trees, a monstor here and there, a ranch in the middle, and a clear blue sky with a brightly shining sun. Along the feild, a rise in elevation starts, as you climb the hill, you can see even more than you could before, a magestic, huge catsle, a winding clear blue river, a deep valley, a menancing volcanoe, and a huge lake, along with a tuft of trees, and a monstor here and there. As you travel to new places, you will feel almost the exact same feeling of adventure too, when seeing the towering windmill of Kakariko village above the small, humble houses of the village below it, with the perfect backgrond music for example. With this great feeling of adventure, huge enviroments, much huger than even the ones of nowaday games, and a great storyline and absolutly stunning soundtrack, Ocarina of Time is the Greatest game of all time, until a greater game will come out, wich will probably take a very very long time. If you dont already own this game (Shame on you), you should buy it immediatly, and while waiting for it to ship, download an emulated version. Now.

Reviews weren't too kind and I've played Mario Party games before.Maybe it was my expectations and my 4 yr old, but this is game is a surprising winner.9 yr old also has fun with it.I think the great thing is the diversity of the modes organized along how much time you want to spend combined with the solid fun mini-games that is the fuel each of the modes runs on.There's the longer board game mode.  Players have to roll dice and traverse up the mountain.  First to reach the top wins.  Along the way you'll encounter obstacles that can send you forward or backward depending on pure luck or skill in mini-games.  And each round you play a mini-game to see who rolls the dice first and how many dice you get.  IT's a really well done streamlined version of the various Mario party board games.There are shorter modes as well.  Bingo is one of the shortest.  It's Bingo using the Miis on your system with a handful of \"mini-game balls\" that ask you to play a mini-game in which the winner gets to pick a spot on their board.  IT's a quick simple 5 minute game mode.  Great for the younger kids.There's the direct mini-game competition where 4 Miis compete to see who can be the first to win 5 mini-games.  Each game you win your a block rises out of the ground with the a screenshot of the mini-game on it and your Mii standing on top of it.  Nice easy visual way to show who is ahead.  1st won to stand on top of 5 blocks wins.There's a Mii matching game.  Basically you are pointing at Miis and trying to match their color.  They are milling around in a 6 separate areas in a big courtyard.  You can see their faces, but not the color of their clothing.  Get  a correct match.  Go again.  It's a good young kid's game or parent and kids game or family.  And you play a Mini-game every round to determine the play order.There's another matching game of sorts.  You have six Miis and have to get 2 rows of 3 in the same color.  EAch round you take your turn choosing one of the 4 Miis in the center.  The order is determined again by playing mini-games.  The Miis in the center are sometimes displayed hidden behind a question so you don't know what color they are.  There are a few \"special\" Miis which let you trade Miis with another player or wipe out one of your rows or choose the color of the Mii.  Extra points are scored by getting all guys or girls or getting platinum Miis or all 6 of the same color.  You can play 3 to 5 sets.There's a cooperative mode where you play 10 rounds of balancing Miis on an old Pirate ship.  IN between you play cooperative mini-games where the outcome determines the difference in sizes of the Miis you place on the ship.  Do bad in the mini-games and you and your son for example will be placing a tiny Mii and a very large Mii on the ship's sails.  This makes it more difficult to balance out.  IF you don't balance out the Miis they slide into the ocean.  And it keeps getting more difficult the farther you advance.  By the 10th round you have 20 Miis on the ship.It's a pretty creative collection of modes and mini-games.There is one last gem that deserves mention.  There's a strategy game mode inside in which the object is to water the plant with the watering can by placing your Mii in the correct location so your Mii follows the arrows on the floating no-walls grid-like maze without falling off.  AS you progress these modes get more difficult as some of the squares in the grid will be ice that can only be walked on once before collapsing.  Some will be platforms that move.  There will be fire.  Trampolines.  Switches to to reverse the arrows.  Transporters.  etc.  Plus you will eventually be using 3 Miis working together to achieve the goal.  MY 4 yr old clicked on this mode and eventually gave me the controller and 1-2 hours later I had finished all 30 stages.  It was that fun.  4 yr olds being what they are.  They remember exactly where I placed the Miis in the first 15 or so levels and and can go back and play these modes by themselves.  btw, once you place your Miis you hit the play button and watch to see if your Miis ends up watering the plant or not.  IF you are unsuccessful you get to try again until you get it right.I haven't covered everything.  I think there are a few things we haven't tried yet.  And probably a few things I forgot to mention.Anyway if you have kids under 10 this is a no-brainer.Older kids/adults will be less enthralled except for playing the mini-games directly against friends and family or playing the strategy mode that I mentioned.Anyway this beats out 99% of Wii 3rd party titles.  IT's a very solid well-done affair.  The vast majority games work.  A few of them are pure luck.  Good for young kids who wouldn't have a chance otherwise.  (or good for parents if your kids are a bit older.)Thumbs up.  Buy it.  I even say full price isn't a bad price to pay although I'm always one to find a deal no matter what.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00004SVS3","description":"Mega man 2 nes cartridge","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"The Blue Bomber returned in the breakout sequel","reviewText":"If it wasn't for the underground buzz that Mega Man received, Capcom would had most likely not released the 1989 sequel for the NES outside of Japan. If anything, it set itself up for Mega Man 2 to be a success. But not even Capcom expected how much of a success it would turn out to be: millions of copies were sold across the world and Mega Man would be quickly recognized as much as Nintendo's mascot, Mario. And when Mega Man 2 was released, the Blue Bomber returned in the breakout NES sequel that had gamers in a frenzy. I never bought it because I borrowed it from my best friend numerous times and it was worth it.Mega Man 2 had Mega Man return to save his world. Dr. Wily was really upset that he lost to Mega Man before and he vowed to get his revenge. To show he was better than Dr. Light and to crush Mega Man, Dr. Wily invented eight Robot Masters and challenged Mega Man to beat them and to fight him again. You picked one of eight stages to play through and beat the Robot Master to gain its special weapon. In addition to the special weapons, you were able to acquire three adapters that helped you cross gaps, climb walls or reach platforms out of reach. Once you beat all eight stages, you were whisked off to Dr. Wily's castle. There you had to play through six more stages, filled with more enemies, boss characters, the same eight Robot Masters from before and finally, Dr. Wily and his new robot contraptions. The game provided passwords so you could save your progress and come back later to finish your game.The PROS: Capcom responded to those gamers who felt the first game was too hard to beat by offering easy and hard modes. Because of that move, Mega Man 2 was accessible to every gamer and that helped it gain popularity. You had new Robot Masters, new weapons and more stages to play through. Everything here was better: the graphics, music, stage layouts, enemies and boss characters. The sound effects were mostly the same from the first game but were still good and so were the controls. The new weapon adapters were pretty cool and helped out in certain sections of the game. Since the game was longer, the password system was a nice addition so that you could play for a bit, copy the password and then use it later on to finish the game. Mega Man 2 was the first game to introduce \"energy tanks\": a health power up that filled up your energy bar when you needed it (the only catch was that you could carry up to four at a time.)The CONS: Mega Man 2 went down in the franchise's history as the easiest game in the series to beat. If you played it through the easy mode, it was an absolute but enjoyable walk in the park. But if you played it through the hard mode, the game gave you a mild challenge but nowhere near what you saw in Mega Man. Some players wanted more of a challenge besides those two modes but Capcom wanted everyone to enjoy the game so that's why it wasn't as hard as the first game. When you use the passwords, they saved your progress as far as how many robots you beat. If you used it during one of the stages in Dr. Wily's castle, the game always brought you back to the first stage of the castle. Also, the passwords never let you kept the energy tanks or extra lives you collected; you started without any energy tanks and three lives.Mega Man 2 was and still is regarded as one of the best in the NES series. To this date, it stirs the debate as to which NES Mega Man game reigns supreme and it's always been between Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3. No matter which game was your favorite, this one had a lot of fans and brought a lot of good memories to those gamers who were fortunate enough. If you're a Mega Man fan, you have this game in some form: the actual NES cartridge, the Mega Man Anniversary Collection released for the PS2 and Gamecube consoles, or downloaded it to your Wii from the Virtual Console Service (500 points.) This was a game that anyone could have enjoyed and millions of gamers can attest to it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Do NOT call this a remake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","reviewText":"Calling Metroid: Zero Mission a \"remake\" of the original NES Metroid would be technically accurate, but you'd be missing the point. It's a total upheaval: a surprising modern reinvention based on old 8-bit blueprints and what Retro Studios did with the Metroid saga on the GameCube. It's awesome, even if you're not old enough to know what an 8-bit system is. Metroid: Zero Mission retells the story of Samus Aran's first visit to the planet Zebes as well as her first encounter with the life-sucking Jell-O molds called Metroids and the jarred evil known as Mother Brain. If you've played the original game, you'll recognize areas, tile sets, names of bosses, and secrets in ceilings, but Nintendo has gone back and seamlessly inserted entire sequences and areas based on the Chozo lore and Space Pirate story arc from Metroid Prime on the GameCube, adding depth and substance to the adventure, and making connections where none really were before-sort of a Star Wars Special Edition-ing of the series but done right. Stick around after the old \"escape from Tourian\" climax for a huge surprise-you won't be disappointed. All of the usual classic Metroid gameplay is here: lots of secret areas to find (and lots of backtracking) with a control scheme and feel that still have yet to be accurately cloned. Some tweaks have been made, all to a greater effect: weapons, functions, and abilities from Super Metroid (Samus's dash move, auto-map, and power bombs) and Metroid Fusion (the ability to grab onto ledges) have been grafted into the gameplay. Plus, techniques like \"bombing yourself up\" to get over walls seems a lot easier to do rather than being a difficult-to-exploit side effect. Some moves are inevitably awkward-angling your shots while equipping your missiles (holding both shoulder buttons while pushing Down and pressing the B button) nearly requires a contortionist-but the designers have otherwise made fine use of the GBA's layout. The presentation is A-list. The graphics are virtually identical to those in the already-excellent Metroid Fusion, capturing the weird, creepy feel of an utterly alien world without compromising color. The sound is classic, too, and Metroid's unforgettable tunes play far more frequently than in Metroid Fusion. But most importantly, it's compelling and fun-a carefully crafted example of what cleverly placed enemies, intelligently placed floating blocks, and a whole mess of secrets can get you. The only real downside is that, despite its size, the game can be blown through pretty quickly. All the new moves and equipment (not to mention a generous helping of save points) make the game feel less challenging than its more open-ended, unforgiving ancestor. Metroid is a classic, but nostalgia doesn't make great games...knowing what to do with it does. Rarely does a game (much less a GBA one) keep the player so constantly surprised. Bring on more, more, more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2004"}

Its one thing to play a unique game, it's another to play a great, unique game. Smilebit was a no-name company before Jet Grind Radio and now two years later their major players in the gaming industry (They've been given the job of making the next Panzer Dragoon, that's a tall order.) So returning to their roots we have their first Xbox title, luckily, Smilebit knows that Jet Grind Radio's system wasn't broke, so why toy with perfection that was well received by critics everywhere? You don't, but running over the Dreamcast version one problem did appear and that was the graffiti system, some enjoyed mimicking the motions displayed to spray walls, others found it to be a thorn in the toe being you were a sitting duck for the hordes of cops, assassins, tanks and choppers that already hounded you during movement alone.So take it one step at a time, now graffiti is sprayed on with the touch of a button, it may seem like nothing more than a cheap extra topping on a hot fudge Sunday at Dairy Queen, but it considerably keeps the action consistent rather than stopping for breaks and cheap hits from enemies. Asides from the graffiti, enemies themselves in the levels have been removed; you will never encounter enemies during your spray painting frenzy. Enemies are now dealt with in \"Battle Modes\" sort of speak in which you and your enemies are enclosed within an electrified fence area and must be spray painted to win. These battles require different approaches from simply bowling police officers over, to smacking them down with a turbo boost, or covering search lights bulbs with paint. These battles may seem a little out of place for a game such as this, but they provide a unique twist on the old ones \"run away\" technique.So the graffiti's been fixed what next? Future also boast enormous levels, and I stress the word \"enormous\" some levels are huge, very huge. So huge in fact that playing some levels seems reminiscent of trekking through streets of Shenmue. Smilebit really wanted to put the word \"free\" into Future's Gameplay, and for that they do succeed in making Future a \"do what you want\" world with no levels, no time limits and no certain path to follow, you make your own instead. Want to go to the bus terminal? Skate through traffic on a street behind your hangout and you're there, visit the sewers? Jump into the drain at the slums and head into the underground sewage plant. But with so much freedom comes a glaring oversight from the developers. More than half of your time will be spent seeking out where the graffiti points are, especially in the Sky Scraper District you'll be jumping 100 story buildings blindly hoping to land on the one over.Exciting? Yes, at times it can be quite the rage. But after consistent falls you'll get fed up rather quickly, after all Jet Set isn't a platformer, even though a few levels treat it as one. Still, thanks to Future's gargantuan levels you'll find grind and eye-candy galore. Mixing in old levels such as the Bus Terminal and Sewers as well as some new genius levels like the highly enjoyable Dinosaur Roller Coast level that has snake like rails of an amusement park to grind built on the roofs of sky scrapers. And with large levels also comes a long journey, after completing the entire game I clocked in at a total of 23 hours. And with over 20 characters available including a large amount after you've beaten the game, it's a sure bet you'll be sticking with Future for awhile. For fans of the first or those interested in trying something new will find a steady-challenging game that no Xbox owner should be without.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2002"}

KILL EM!","reviewText":"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a third person shooter published by the recently deceased THQ and developed by Relic better known for developing the real time strategy games Company of Heroes and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War. The game is set in the Warhammer universe and you play as an Ultramarine known as Captain Titus.Gameplay: The game for the most part is your standard third person shooter, it has similar shooting mechanics to games such as Bionary Domain, Army of Two, and Transformers Fall of Cybertron. You'll go through most of the game using a melee weapon, assault rifle, pistol and you'll have the option to swap these weapons out with other weapons such as a grenade launcher and flame gun. The best part is when you get to occasionally use a jetpack and swoop down on enemies, it's really awesome and quite enjoyable.For the most part gameplay is fun, but at times can get a tad tedious and repetitive. 7/10Graphics/Environment: Graphically the game looks nice, it's not super detailed like some games but it gets the job done. 7/10Story/Characters: The story is well done, it gets the story across without overstaying it's welcome and carrying out long cutscenes which become dull. I found certain parts of the story really intriguing which made me want more especially when the end drew near. I really liked the characters in the game, especially Captain Titus and his 2 other companions. I found the Orks to be very annoying and obnoxious, and that's just how the developers wanted me to feel so I personally enjoyed the antagonists. 8/10Overall Warhammer 40K is a good game that isn't without its flaws here and there, it has a few quick time event moments which should be outlawed when playing with a KB&M.; The gameplay can get repetitive to a certain extent and at one point I just wanted to rush through and beat the game.Relic did a nice job and for a price point of currently 10 dollars I say go for it if you are looking for a decent third person shooter that will last you around 8-10 hours.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2014"}

And when I got the first 3 games: \"Dragonball GT: Final Bout\", \"Dragonball Z: Legends\", and \"Dragonball Z: Ultimate Battle 22\", I was overjoyed. \"Ultimate Battle 22\" was pretty good (even though there was no story) with good graphics and pretty cool moves. \"Legends\" was awesome... the graphics and the fighting style used in this game were very unique and made each fight exciting, just like the ones in the show. \"Final Bout\" was pretty awful, despite the fact that it was the first game in 3D. But \"Budokai\" has proven to be the best so far. The story mode is awesome: this is the first fighting game I've seen that actually has a story built into it and it's almost completely accurate to the show.The graphics are great and the fighting style... well, it's not wonderful, but it's alright. I'd say it was like a mix between \"Dragonball Z: Legends\" and \"Dead or Alive\". There's also a tournament mode (you take part in the World Martial Arts Tournament), practice mode, duel mode(v.s. mode), and edit skills, where you customize the fighters with fighting moves and attacks by using the capsules you acquire in story mode.This game goes from the Saiyan Saga to the Cell Games Saga (although it completely skips the Garlic Jr. Saga); I'll explain how the story mode goes:When you first play the game you're Goku and you fight Raditz, Nappa, Vegeta, Fake Vegeta(while training in the Capsule Corp. spaceship) Recoome, Captain Ginyu (you even fight Ginyu in his own body while Ginyu is in Goku's body), Frieza, and Android 19. Then for a little while you're Piccolo and you fight Cell and Android 17. After that you're Goku again and you fight Cell; finally you fight the Cell Jrs. and Cell as Gohan.The second time you play the game you're Piccolo and you fight Raditz, the Saibamen, and Nappa. Then you're Vegeta and you fight Zarbon, Frieza, Android 19, Android 18, and Cell.Along the way, you also do some special bad guy role playing levels. First you're Vegeta and after you defeat Goku, Krillin, and Gohan, Vegeta becomes a Super Saiyan in front of Yajirobe. Then you're Frieza and after you defeat Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta, and Goku, Frieza wishes for immortality from Porunga, blows up Namek, and heads for Earth on his spaceship. Finally, you're Cell and after you defeat Android 16 and Android 17, Cell absorbs Android 17 and when trying to absorb Android 18 he accidentally absorbs Krillin! Yeah, he then becomes weaker, short, and orange. Then after you defeat Yamcha, Cell gets incinerated by Tien's Tri-beam; suddenly, you see Cell in his Perfect Form waking up from a nightmare in the middle of the Cell Games Ring. It turns out it was all a dream. That was awesome. Oh boy, I typed too much. Get this game... bye.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2003"}

White \"Dragnilar\"","summary":"Doom 3 misses one element that would make it the otherwise perfect sequil...","reviewText":"Doom 3 contains many features to be proud of: state of the art 3d graphics that push most graphics cards and PC's to their limit, an excellent soundtrack scored by the likes of Tweaker and ID's own in-house sound engineers. It also has an interesting and surprisingly fast paced multi-player deathmatch mode (which has had more added to it since the expansion.) The storyline of the game contains some interesting sci-fi details (especaly the ones concerning the \"science\" behind the many weapons and objects in the game.) And it is Doom. But there are also some rather dissapointing aspects about the much heralded and hyped successor to the original game that set the FPS world on fire. The storyline surrounding all of the sci-fi/horror in the game is shallow in places and has left many feeling unimpressed. The game also features a dredging flashlight in the dark aspect that makes many feel like that they are being forced to play out an otherwise uneccisary aspect that the game should not have. There is also the most serious problem that was forseeable with the intense graphics engine: There are no fewer than perhaps 5 demons on the screen at a time. As you can see, Doom 3 lacks the one certain aspect that made Doom... Doom: It's unmistakable slaughterfest action. Instead of having numbers going into the 20's, you instead have small clusters of monsters going at you. As said before, this is understandable due to the fact that making the game into a massive kill fest would hinder the graphics card. Instead of making it a slaughter fest though, ID has instead gone the horror route. Which is thus why the flashlight is in the game. The whole point of the flashlight is to add to the horror element and increase the surprise feature. And it does work (for the most part). There are some frights that come off as badly timed and also a little cliche (I.E. random evil laughter), which ruins the fun at some times. One last problem that Doom 3 has is that the demon battles can at times feel a little repetetive. While the creatures do have better AI than before, they sadly all seem to behave the same in their own little ways. The most common trend is that they all jump around and close in on you while shooting you with projectiles and dodge your attacks, but when they get in close, they switch to their claws and proceed to smack you around. I suppose this could be attributed to the fact that there are only so many ways a demon can behave, but ID could have been a little more imaginative with the enemy AI than this.Despite it's shortcommings, Doom 3 is still a worthwhile prospect. It may not have the constant blood spilling that Doom 1 and 2 had, but it offers a graphical treat and an expanded (although still in need of work) storyline that Dooms 1 and 2 did not have. It also features some of the coolest versions of the best FPS weapons ever (the plasma gun and BFG 9000 are incredible), and let us not forget the demons and their improved look. Hopefully now that the graphics engine has been created, a future Doom 4 will have the slaughter fest that this game was missing (if everyone's computer/gaming console is up to par by then!)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2005"}

On the fringes of known space, entire human colonies are vanishing. As Commander Shepard, you must assemble the galaxy's deadliest team and stop the most terrifying threat humanity has ever faced.","reviewerName":"cplowens0331","summary":"almost a photocopy of the 360 version","reviewText":"Every generation of game consoles has its defining titles. When one thinks back on a system and its legacy, an association with those games is often made. For instance the NES and SNES eras gave us Super Mario Bros. and Zelda, while the original PlayStation served up Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy VII. Naturally, this generation isn't without its own defining set of games, too, and one of those titles is undoubtedly Mass Effect 2a project from the minds at Canadian developer Bioware.If you only pay attention to the PlayStation 3 scene, you might be confused as to when the original Mass Effect came out and why you never heard about it or played it. Unfortunately, 2007's Mass Effect never made it to the PS3. The series' first entry came only to Xbox360 and PC, and due to Microsoft having published the game, PS3 owners will never see it on their native console. Mass Effect 2, however, is another story entirely.It's perfectly natural for gamers to be wary of jumping into the Mass Effect series with the second game, but BioWare has delivered a compelling package that does its best to quell any uncertainty with skipping the first title. It's worth noting that the original Mass Effect is a different game in many respects from Mass Effect 2, so in terms of gameplay, you're getting the better experience right off the bat. And while Mass Effect 2 is certainly a story-driven affair related directly to the original title, you'll have access to an in-game comic book feature that explains the story of the first game and lets you make choices that will affect your playthrough of the sequel. Combine that with the fact that Mass Effect 2 on PS3 has a slew of DLC extras and even an upgraded game engine, and you'll be struck by the obvious: Mass Effect 2 on the PlayStation 3 is the best, most complete version of the game available.Mass Effect 2 is the product of artfully mixing certain genres. On one hand, it's a third-person shooter. On the other hand, it's an RPG with sandbox, open-world sensibilities. BioWare has brilliantly blended together these genres and influences to craft an experience that's not only much better than the admittedly-fantastic original Mass Effect, but also better than virtually all of the like-minded games on the market today. It provides a more streamlined experience than the original, with more focus on character development and action and less on some of the minutiae that bogged down the series' first outing.The Mass Effect series introduces gamers to an alternate form of our galaxy where humanity has found alien life. Using a special device orbiting Pluto called a Mass Relay, humanity jettisons to the far edges of the galaxy only to run into a bunch of other species that have known about each other for some time. No one really trusts the humans (the new kids on the block) and our species is left struggling both for galactic trust and identity in the face of a brand-new existential threat. That's where you come in.Mass Effect 2 begins under dire circumstances. You'll immediately witness the abrupt and violent death of the main character named Commander Shepard, only to find him or her resurrected by a rich, xenophobic human-first group called Cerberus. There's a reason Cerberus used its unlimited resources to revive Shepard, however, and it has to do with stopping the threat posed by the Collectors, a nebulous species that targets human space colonies. As this threat grows, so too does Cerberus' resolve to stop them, and they'll use Shepard and his or her team of assembled bad-asses to get things done.But Shepard isn't a static character. The beauty of Mass Effect 2 is that it is what you make it. While Mass Effect 2 certainly has a string of events that ultimately lead from point A to point Z, getting to and through all of the points in between opens up a staggering amount of choices, paths and outcomes. All of this is centered around the Paragon/Renegade choice system, where Shepard can make kind, understanding and righteous decisions (Paragon) or harsh, to-the-point and uncompassionate decisions (Renegade). But it's the gray in between that's truly riveting, and this particular aspect of the game will no doubt floor players. Everything you say, everything you do, and everything you decide upon has lasting, real consequences in the game -- both for the better and the worse. And be mindful, because those choices will one day affect your playthrough of Mass Effect 3, too.Apart from its story-driven nature and RPG influences, Mass Effect 2 is a third-person action game at its core, and the gameplay is fluid and well-executed. Under most circumstances, you'll get to bring two party members of your choice along with you. The computer will largely control these two characters, though you can use various weapon and skill wheels to offer up commands for those characters during the heat of battle. This is, of course, in addition to controlling Shepard himself (or herself), which will require you to quickly become comfortable with your particular character's strengths and weaknesses. Mass Effect 2 relies on character classes, so if you're playing as a Soldier, you better get used to using a wide variety of weapons. On the other hand, Vanguards and Sentinels will be relying far more on Biotics and Tech than conventional firearms.Much of the game revolves around recruiting your team members from various corners of the galaxy, and each member of your team plays an important role in ultimately working to stop the Collectors. Better yet, the aforementioned Paragon and Renegade slants you can take through the game will help you nurture or maim your relationships with each person. Treat the characters well, tend to them, listen to their ramblings, and even complete character-specific quests for them, and they'll become loyal. Ignore them, treat them badly, and use them solely as battle fodder, and they may not like you so much. Relationships can even become romantic under certain circumstances, so you can try to cultivate something more than friendship if you so desire.With the combat, characters, setting and story so solid, you would think you wouldn't need anything else. But there's more. Mass Effect nerds know full-well that one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game is the insane amount of detail put into everything. So while combat and conversation may wear you out from time to time, that won't stop you from going to planets and mining for minerals that will allow you to upgrade your ship, your weapons, and your armor. This also won't stop you from completing one of the game's many side quests or reading the insanely-detailed codex and planet entries.Mass Effect 2 is a game with a staggering amount of high quality content. And better yet, it's all painted over with a slick coat of awesome.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2011"}

The TV in the hotel is old with no HDMI input. It was perfect time to try the G155.First both PS3 Slim and XBox 360 Slim fit very well. The hard case is simple but handsome looking. The latches are good enough that I wouldn't feel nervous about it snap open. Tried to sit on the flat side and realize it won't hold my weight (185lb)!  At the airport I still had to take out the machine during screening, which is unavoidable but easily done.  The case fit as a carry on bag. I have a laptop bag and a carry-on luggage and didn't want to check one in. This time I put my laptop and bag in my luggage as it was squash-able. For long flight where I'll need my laptop, I would have to check in the luggage.The two long round pouches inside the case can hold couple of controllers in addition to the AC adapter for the screen and power cord for PS3. My XBox Slim has a big transformer so that will reduce room further. I have the PS3 wireless headset and that won't fit in the case (bummer). 7.1 wireless virtual surround gaming on the road and fit in one case would be fabulous, but fully understand room limit. I simply allocate more room in the luggage.The screen feels bigger than the 15.5\" spec. It's bright, sharp and beautiful. I tried racing and few action games that had very fast movement at 720p and the screen showed no lag. The viewing angle is limited. Horizontally it's good enough for two kids sitting side by side comfortably. However, the up and down angles are more restrictive for games with dark scenes (e.g., Socom 4, COD Black Ops and Heavy Rain). Since the case opens and angle is fixed on flat surface like a desk or table, the player must adjust the height if sitting on a chair. With most people's height, sitting on the floor to play should be fine. I like to play late at night in bed. The angle of the open case is greater as the surface is not hard, coupled with the user sinking in the bed, made viewing screen difficult for folks with normal height (below 6 feet from my estimation).The speakers are OK. They are not \"bright\" speaker types if you know what I mean. Not great but not bad either. I haven't tried playing music (since I use iPod for that), but am impressed with the voice coming through. It's clear and deep.All in all, this is an innovative product and probably the best solution for the road warriors to date. Few things the user will need to adjust but it's remarkable to be able to take a PS3 on the road with a beautiful and bright screen. If I'm to take it on a long road trip, I'll certain consider a portable generator or battery with a 600 watt inverter!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2011"}

As time goes on and this series tries to refine itself, it does tend to be more generic with each new iteration.On the PS3, the game had plenty of options that impressed me.I like some of the things they've done under the hood and how they have refined the control scheme so that you simply &#34;do&#34; what you want without having to fumble around with a bunch of options.The story was not immersive, and toward the end game, I really didn't care for any of the characters.The use of the f-word was ridiculous and is at least 40% of the reason I traded this game, take it or leave it.  I spent a great deal of time with the TV muted not to have to listen to Psycho.The game was technically beautiful, but there was no emotion, no feeling to the work.  (Though not the same genre, consider Bioshock or Batman that has technical *and* emotional facets.)Overall, it was okay, but there I wouldn't recommend paying more than $20 to own this one.  Corporate developers need to learn to start letting people with heart to work on these things instead of putting them through the grind mill.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000VJRU44","reviewerName":"Jonathan Oyama \"Welcome to die!\"","summary":"Fitting title for fitness","reviewText":"\"Wii Fit\" is one of the first games to make physical fitness friendly and accessible for all ages.This isn't the first physical fitness game--Konami did it first with \"Dance Dance Revolution\" on the PS One. However, \"Wii Fit\" is superior to it by making the action much less based on competition and sweating 'till you drop.It plays more like a physical fitness all-in-one video, with exercises for strength-building and aerobics. There's plenty of yoga positions and balance games. However, it excels as a physical fitness instructor for people who aren't typically health nuts. The balance board is necessary for people to find their true center of balance.It seems a little silly and embarassing at first, but it's surprisingly enjoyable. Whereas DDR was solely about fast-paced foot-stepping and loud music, \"Wii Fit\" is all about keeping people comfortable while staying fit. With the cute, cartoon-like Miis exercising along with your movements, exercise is much more fun than you might expect.Some of the games and exercises don't work as well as they should. I really couldn't figure out how to get a high school in the lotus game, in which the person must sit cross-legged on the balance board and remain as still as possible. Other exercises, such as the last Yoga poses, lack the interactivity of the balance board.Still, the balance board is an excellent measuring stick for people to maintain a center of balance. The actual challenge is in maintaining the proper form--by keeping your balance so the red dot on the screen doesn't escape from the yellow area. It's like an optomotrist eye check, only without the eye strain. The colors on screen are light pastels against a white background, making everything easy on the eyes.Wii Fit may not be the most groundbreaking, exciting game of the year, but it certainly is the most innovative and useful one. It's definitely worth the high price, and people will definitely want to upgrade to \"Wii Fit Plus\" if they enjoy the original.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003GSZ9ZE","description":"","reviewerName":"Tyler Johnson","summary":"Single player is fun, Co-Op is better","reviewText":"Let's get down to brass tacks; this is a fantastic Co-op game. Online is cool, but splitscreen is a blast. You play as pointman ( the silent protagonist of the first game, who can slow down time) and his deceased brother, whom he killed Fettel ( a morbidly amusing spectre that can use his ghostly abilities to levitate his enemies, setting them up to be shot by pointman, exploded in a cloud of gory awesome if you walk up to them and melee, or posessed and used as meat suits, giving Fettel all of pointmans abilities, sans time slow, until the meat suit dies, you run out of ghost juice, or you blow it up yourself, tee hee). You are trying to find your mother, a terrifyingly powerful psychic, who looks like a little girl, a naked woman, or a creepy pregnant woman after she raped the second games protagonist; don't ask, it doesn't matter.The story is superfluous. What does matter is the pitch perfect, lightning fast, gameplay that you and a friend will have a blast playing. Pointman and Fettel's individual abilities complement each other perfectly. When pointman slows down time, Fettel's melee becomes much more powerful. When Fettel levitates an enemy, they become a sitting duck for pointman to fill with holes. Fettel can also put a shield around pointman when things get hairy.While playing through the game, you will notice that you gain levels by performing in game challenges, like levitating ten enemies for your brother to shoot, getting fifteen melee kills, and shooting enemies from cover. Whoever plays better in the level is the \"favorite son\", and if they are the better player, the character they play as will get the ending.Now, take everything I have said, and cut the fun in half if you don't have anyone to play with. I'm not saying there is no fun to be had if you play this game solo, but it will not be the same experience. Only play this if you definitely have someone to play with. The online modes are all enjoyable, depending on how many people are online. All in all, if you have a partner, I highly recommend this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Only minor scuffs on a nearly flawless diamond","reviewText":"Tomb Raider is the reboot of Lara Croft, sex icon and spelunker extraordinare.The plot is actually pretty good. Lara leads an expedition for the lost kingdom of Yamatai, and winds up crashed on an island filled with natives who kidnap and kill her friends and colleagues, all the while surrounded by what she was looking for. And in traditional TR form, as they explore the island and peel back the alyers of myth, the start to encounter darker things hidden among the island ruins.Gameplay is traditional McChestie High Wall, for the most part, with some inventive twists that make it an actual worthwhile close combat setup, complete with dirty tricks and stabbing people with arrows. The stealth elements are more worthwhile, and its actually a challenge to take out a whole squad with nothing but arrows to the head.Graphics and audio are top notch, and the detail in some of the environments is stunning to the point its almost as much fun enjoying the various vistas as it is debating how to make it from point A to B. Lara is superbly voiced and injects rela emotion into her character.The exploration, collection, and crafting are surprisingly nice. Rather than feel like a trophy chore, it actually pulls you in listening to the various stories of the islansd inhabitants, Naizs, and other survivors struggling through their own stories that you're collecting. Artifact inspections are a little blah, but do manage to make you fel like you care about these things you're collecting rather than just scouring every surface for them. The tombs are short little puzzles, but do add a bit of variety and ouzzle to the game without turning into long winding dungeons on their own. The fact that every layer feeds every other layer is also really nice.Ironically the nits do knock off the fifth star for me. Theres the story oversights Lara never gets a jacket or a coat from all the dead guys she passes, despite spending part of every cutscene shivering. And most critically, Lara is not Batman, not even Arkham Origins Batman. After taking a spear through her side, having her arm lain open by an arrow, and falling 30 feet from a parachute, they should've spent some more time having her recuperate from her injuries rather than just hop back to her feet, or choke out men three times her size with a bow curve. There were more opportunities to do emotional and character development that were rather glossed over, and certain plot points just made no sense.Overall, a great game. I'm mad that they've force injected MP into this, as TR is a solo puzzle adventure, and I actually started to set miy heart on maknig platinum for this, but I'm not going to waste an extra 40 hours on that without some kind of extra story a la Assassin Creed, but no one seems to do that.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0086V5V8G","description":"","reviewerName":"MikeB \"Metalhead\"","summary":"Forgettable","reviewText":"When the first Splinter Cell came out on the original Xbox, I instantly became a fan. It was one of the first (if not the first) game to use light and shadow as part of the gameplay, not just for visual effect. I was impressed with the enemy AI, the robust gameplay, the responsive controls, interactive environments, and impressive real-time shadows. At the time it was released, it was all very cutting edge. The sequel, Pandora Tomorrow, was a decent game, but did nothing to progress the series forward. Then came Chaos Theory, the (still) best game in the series, and one of the greatest games of last gen. Chaos Theory improved in every area, from the AI and graphics to the story and level design, and was a significant leap forward for the series.Double Agent, the next game in the series, and the first SC game developed for next-gen, had some high standards to live up to. Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations, and although it wasn't a bad game, it did nothing to move the series forward and did not feel like a next-gen game. Conviction, the 5th game in the series, was a drastic change for the series, but that change was not for the better. All of the stealth elements that I enjoyed were tossed out the window for a manic run-n-gun approach. As SC games go, this was the worst in the series. And that brings us to Blacklist.Blacklist has been described as a cross between Chaos Theory and Conviction. The truth is it's a cross between Double Agent and Conviction. That is to say, it combines some of the action elements of Conviction, like automatic Execution kills, and cover-to-cover run, and the stealth elements the series is known for. Unlike Conviction, however, you don't have to use or rely on these gameplay mechanics. If you prefer to go in quiet and use stealth, you can take out enemies one by one, quietly, lethal or non-lethal. Or, if you're really good, you can sneak by enemies unnoticed, and never even touch them. Of course, you have to option to go in guns blazing, but you probably won't last long. I appreciated the freedom of choices I was given, and only during a few moments did I feel like the game forced me play a certain way.The gameplay has almost everything you'd expect from a SC game, from climbing upside-down on pipes to peering under doors with fiber-optics, you really feel like a super spy. Unfortunately, the level design wasn't very impressive. Each level felt like the same thing over and over. Yes, there are multiple paths and approaches for each mission, but from level to level I never really felt challenged to change my thinking. I found the most effective approach for me was to hide in a doorway, make a noise to lure in the nearest enemy, then subdue him when he got close. This worked 99% of time, and the enemies wouldn't really care much that their friends were disappearing one by one. Even if an enemy comes across one of the bodies you left behind, they'll search around a 10 foot radius and if they don't find you in 60 seconds, they'll assume everything is fine and go back to not caring. Granted, I was playing on Normal difficulty, but I played previous SC games on normal as well, and I don't remember enemies being so careless. The AI felt like a step back from Chaos Theory.The controls feel a bit stiff and unresponsive when compared to most modern games, and although it's been years since I played Chaos Theory, I remember the controls in that game being more intuitive and responsive than Blacklist. In previous SC games, how far you push the control stick had a direct effect on Sam Fisher's movement speed. Push the stick 35% of the way, Sam moves at 35% speed. Push it 89% of the way, Sam moves 89% speed. Not in Blacklist. Sam has two speeds: slow and fast. Push the stick anywhere between 1% and 50%, Sam moves 50% speed. Push the stick anywhere between 51% and 100%, Sam moves 100% speed. WHAT THE HECK!? Analog sticks have been around since the N64 days, I'd think we'd move past this two speed crap. The fact that previous SC games had 1:1 movement responsiveness makes Blacklist's controls unacceptable. Besides that there were moments where buttons would not respond, and moments where shooting over obstacles would not respond until I released the Aim button, which caused me to inexplicably miss shots and give away my position. None of this made the game unplayable. The game is playable. It just felt dated and awkward for a big budget game from a major publisher in the year 2013. I expect better.The graphics in Blacklist are also disappointing. They're not terrible, but they're not as good as you could reasonably expect from a big budget game in 2013. Characters look plastic and shiny, shadows often look badly pixelated, and frame rate hiccups and screen tearing are frequent. Textures are a bit blurry and some of the poly-counts looks a little low. The animations during cut scenes are really, really good, but during gameplay they look stiff.Sound design is the best aspect of Blacklist. The music is great, and fits with the tone and mood of the game. It reacts to your situation and heightens the tension, whether you're sneaking up on a group of terrorists or running for your life from a firefight, the music enhances each moment of your adventure and never sounds mismatched or out of place. The sound effects are also well done, and many of the classic sounds like the start-up buzz of your night vision goggles return from previous games. The voice acting is great as well, and each actor plays their character with complete believability. When the excellent voice acting combines with the excellent animations in the cut scenes, it really brings the characters to life and made them compelling to watch. The sound balance is perfect, too. I frequently notice weird audio balance in games and I have to go into the audio options to balance the music, sound effects and voice levels. Blacklist does not have separate levels for the audio, but does have settings for Headphones, Stereo, and 5.1 Surround. All three are perfectly balanced for whatever your home audio setup.Blacklist's story is pretty good. It's basically an excuse to travel around the world fighting bad guys, but the plot makes just enough sense to not make it feel arbitrary. What really works in Blacklist is the dialog. The interaction between the characters is strong, and the technical jargon is plausible yet not confusing. Each character has a strong personality and a good reason for being in the story. Even the villains felt like human beings with motives instead of just being evil for the sake of being evil like so many videogame badguys tend to be.The multiplayer component of Blacklist is strong, with the co-op being a highlight. They don't always utilize cooperation like the co-op missions in Chaos Theory did. You can pretty much play like two lone wolves and still get through the missions, but playing cooperatively will make some parts easier. Unfortunately, the graphics, animation, controls, and frame rate all have the same problems in multiplayer that are present in single player. The whole time I was playing I couldn't help feeling like it should and could have been better.It's a shame that the good parts of Blacklist don't outweigh the mediocre parts. The gameplay, graphics, animation, and controls all fail to impress, and feel like a step backward. The sound and writing are great but can't save what is ultimately a forgettable game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2013"}

But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros.

The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"Classic 2d Mario","reviewText":"Having just bought a Nintendo Wii I had a choice to make. What game would I buy? As I looked at the case for the New Super Mario Bros Wii I was swept back to the days of the NES classic trilogy that made Mario the icon he has become. I bought it without hesitation and I made the right choice for my first game. The game's design barrows some of the good ideas from Super Mario 3. It is not an remake, but does have some nods to the classic.There are some cool additions to the gameplay. Suits like helicopter hat took over for the Raccoon suit, and others were added like mini suit, freeze suit, and they kept the fire suit from the original game. Some other cool features in this game are now you can save after the halfway point in every world, along with checkpoints in the middle of every level. This is a nice inclusion so that you don't have to start a whole world over after you lose all of your lives, and if the game ever gets too tough for you there is a Luigi strategy guide. After you die a few times in a row you can watch how Luigi beats the level, and you can even skip the level all together after watching it without any penalty. This helps less experieneced players so that they don't get frustrated and quit the game. I really liked this idea for the younger audience that Nintendo markets for.The length of this game (assuming you don't use warp cannons) will take about 10-15 hours based on your skill level. The only problems that I had with this game is the difficulty. The worlds don't seem to get any harder as you progress. That doesn't mean the game isn't hard, there were. more than a few occasions that had me seething with anger, but you are just left with the feeling that the final world should have been more difficult than it was. There is very little difficulty difference between worlds just singular levels in each stage that annoy the hell out of you.The game is your classic Mario action. Run on platforms while squishing Goombas racing towards the level ending flag (Classic). If you ever played any of the 2d Mario games then you will feel right at home with this game. I can't wait for the next 2d Mario game as I feel Mario was always best when side scrolling. This game is one of the best in this series, and should be treasured by retro gamers and newcomers alike.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2010"}

The concept sounds interesting, but the execution is very dull.The first problem is there are just 16 stories.  The stories are short and simple.  Given how short the stories are, the game needs more than just 16 stories to make it worth playing more than a couple of times.Kids and parents can read the stories themselves or have the game read the stories.  Each \"page\" consists of about two lines of text.  The graphics for each page are mostly static and atmospheric music plays to convey the tone of the story.Another problem is that the game does not become more difficult as you play.  I would have liked to have seen the vocabulary become more complex as kids become adept at reading the stories.  As it is now, the stories are so simple that I don't think this game is something kids (and especially parents) will want to play again and again.I'm not quite sure of the target age for this product.  In book form, I would say the stories are probably most enjoyed by kids between 2-4.  To learn to read, most kids need to be able to touch the pages and follow along with their fingers moving from word to word.  Young kids aren't likely to actually be able to read the stories off the screen - especially if the TV is hung relatively high on the wall.  Unlike most video games, Storybook Workshop isn't really interactive enough to hold a child's attention.  Kids can't really interact with the stories and since they can't touch the TV or physically hold a book, it's likely to bore them.I suppose this isn't a terrible game.  It's just not very good and I don't think it will help kids learn to read.  Recording the stories and playing them back works fine and kids might get a kick out of hearing their voices in a video game, but it's not quite enough to hold their attention long term.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2010"}

For instance, flippin into 3D is pretty cool, but you always want to do that in every room to find all the goodies. Thats fine and all, but it takes to long. You do get to play as 4 characters(mario, peach, bowser, and luigi), and each character can do special moves, but you only use them once or twice throughout the game. Also, only Mario can flip to 3D, so, you havta press start, go to character selection, get Mario, then flip into 3D, it dosent take to long but I liked using Bowser, so it'd be nice if there was a button to switch characters, you know, like theres buttons to flip through weapons in FPS. Another downfall is the amount of talking in the game. Most of it is funny, especialy if it comes from the main character, but when you speak to the old fart in Flipside, who talks about the prophicy(he's a main character, so you hear him alot) and all that, it goes on, and on, and on. Zaps the fun out real fast.The combates real old school. Takes you back in the day of NES when you had to run and jump on the baddies, not like the last Paper, when you were on a stage and it was like Pokemon when you went one at a time. Getting to be gynormus is real cool, they make you 100ft tall, and your all pixlated like back in the old, block looking Mario, theres not to much of that and it doesen't last long. Some more of that would've been niceI'd recommend this game if you absolutly love the Paper franchise, if not, buy the Thousand Year Door(Paper for the Gamecube, $20). Don't rent, you won't make a dent in the game at all.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYUAS","description":"","reviewerName":"&#308;&#308;","summary":"An excellent and nearly perfect addition to the library of kinect games!","reviewText":"I love to exercise and have over 50 DVDs in my workout video collection; I also really enjoy playing video games and have 100+ scattered around my house for various consoles.  Having had a Wii for several years, I've searched for games that merge fun with fitness.  During this search, I found some decent games (My Fitness Coach) and some not-so-great games (Wii Fit Plus).  Finally, though, I've found what to me is the ultimate personal training game on the market:Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012.  While there are a few quirks in the game that keep it from being a 5-star game, I still find it to be one of the best workout options for everyone.  Whether you're aP90X/INSANITYveteran or a stay-at-home mom who has a few more pounds than you want, I believe that this system has something for you.Obviously, the premise behind the game is that you are going to work out, losing pounds and gaining muscle while you do so.  Apart from being able to set a schedule or focus, there is no silly story mode that you can complete.  It's simply you and the animated trainers on the screen.  There is nearly any type of workout that you could possibly want to do from kickboxing to bootcamp to cardio to glute toning to African dance, and almost everything can be made extremely simple and broken down for a beginner or fast and intense for an advanced exerciser.  I'm going to get my main complaint out of the way immediately, though: although there are all of these possible workout options, there is NO stretching or cool down option ANYWHERE in the game.  This frustrates me to no end as I have to do my owns stretching after each workout.  Now, there is yoga and tai chi included, but as I'll say again later, these sections are focused more on toning/balance as opposed to stretching or meditating.  I wish there were some option to stretch as it would make this game so much better.Let's get out of the negative, though, and move onto breaking down everything that this game has (which is a lot!).  When you first turn on the game, you will have a body scan that will put you on the screen in whatever background there may be so that you can actually see yourself exercising alongside your trainer.  I thought this was a particularly awesome feature as it makes it incredibly easy to make sure I'm maintaining good form in all of the exercises.  There isn't any weighing in or filling out a form on your height, name, and social security number; you immediately are scanned and sent into the game.  The main menu can be navigated by simple holding out your hand as if to push a button.  This is how you go right or left and choose your workout; gone are the days of swiping a menu option incorrectly and somehow ending up at the five-hour long credits that you can't get out of.  This main menu is divided into four parts: zone, activities, body focus, and classes.The zone is like your center of operations.  It's where you can track what you've accomplished, set an optional objective, adjust your in-game settings, purchase downloadable content, and go online to the game website.  I personally never use the zone unless I'm checking my progress.The activities are basically minigames, however unlike the aforementioned Wii Fit, these minigames are actually VERY effective while still maintaining a fun factor.  The one-minute warm ups are games where you do basic things (kick a soccer ball, flap your arms, etc.) to get the blood flowing throughout your body; Run the World is running in place while the game takes you through a town (New York or London), telling you interesting facts along the way; Jump Rope is where you jump according to the marks (right foot, both feet, high jump, etc.); Wall Breaker is punching and kicking blocks that are given to you; Stack 'Em Up is a balance game where you hold an imaginary platter over your head and catch falling block on that platter; Stomp It is like DDR, where you stomp right, left, upper right, or upper left, depending on what is lighting up.While the activities are fun, the body focus workouts are where the meat of the game is.  They are personal training segments that focus on what you choose.  The options that you can choose are the following: abs, arms, legs, cardio, toning, glutes, back, or sports preparation.  Each area has about 10-13 routines that you can choose from, ranging from level 1 (easy) to level 3 (hard).  Of the toning workouts, about half of them are just toning, while the other half are a toning/cardio fusion.  The lengths vary anywhere from 2-30 minutes, depending on how long you want your workout to be.  Regardless of which workout you pick, each routine is composed of segments each three moves.  What I mean by this is that assuming you choose a 5-minute ab workout, it might have 2 3-move sections...the first section having basic crunches, straight leg stretch, and plank jacks.  You would then take a very brief break and do a 2nd 3-move section having side planks, basic crunches, and slow mountain climbers.  So, when you choose how long your workout is, that will determine how many of these 3-move segments you do.Onto what I've found by doing each segment:- Abs - It's not too tough unless done on level 3; I wasn't sore unless I did level 3.  Sometimes your arms will be worked because of doing planks.- Arms - Very tough!  I'm sore doing level 2, and I still haven't worked up to even try level 3.  Obviously the intensity of your workout depends on how heavy the weight you use are.  Now is as good a time as any to mention that you do need hand weights for this game and possibly a mat but no other equipment...not even a step.- Legs - Focused more on compound movements (working arms and legs at the same time) rather than just isolating leg muscles; I've only worked up to level 2 and haven't gotten sore yet.- Cardio - The lower levels are more of simple cardio moves with your feet never leaving the floor; as you progress in difficulty, more jumping moves are added.  When you do a cardio/toning fusion section, moves from this area will be used.  I personally don't do this section much; I rather do toning/cardio together than just do cardio.- Toning - This is basically a total body sculpting area.  It's like the legs in that you do compound movements.- Glutes - Although this section is focused on glutes, I still find this is where I can really focus on toning my entire lower body.  I don't find it that tough, unfortunately.- Back - Though this section is focused on the muscles of your back, it will also work your entire upper body.  It's not extremely tough; I prefer doing the arms section.- Sports Preparation - It doesn't look interesting to me so I haven't tried it yet.  It's supposedly supposed to help you get in shape specifically for either soccer or football.  If I ever try it, I will update my review.Instead of pushing buttons after each workout, getting back to the main menu is done by punching options in the air.  I liked this menu navigation; it worked and was fun.During all of these workouts, you will be tracked by the game who will supposedly tell you if you're doing all of the moves correctly.  For the most part, the game was extremely helpful!  At times, it truly felt like personal training with the game pointing out exactly what I was doing wrong in a movement.  However, at rare times, the tracking wasn't perfect.  While doing a move in the arms section, it would tell me I was doing it wrong; but while doing the SAME move the EXACT same way in the abs section, it would say I'm doing it right.  This happened with the same move several times.  There were also a few times during cardio where it wouldn't pick up my arms.  Thankfully, the game doesn't focus much on the tracking and won't make many comments on it at all.  It NEVER tells you anything in a rude manner at all; everything is always kind and helpful (except for bootcamp, which I'll get to later).  By the way, the voice actress is the same throughout all the body focus workouts and is very pleasant in a robotic way.  While that may sound negative, I actually really liked her.  Another thing to note is that all body focus workouts are done with a white, crisp, clear background; it's a little dull, but you'll most likely be more focused on working out than criticizing the whiteness.  My final comment about these body focus segments is that no breakdown or explanation is ever done with the moves.  You do see a personal trainer showing you how to do the move; but if you're wanting an in-depth, step-by-step guide to each move, you'll be disappointed.We've finally come to my personal favorite part of the game, the classes!  These are pre-made routines that are broken down and taught to you step by step before letting you go crazy with them.  You can always choose to skip the breakdown if it's going too slowly for you.  The classes included are the following: African Rhythms Dance, Hip-Hop Dance, Latin Dance, Destination Bollywood Dance, Boot Camp, Cardio Boxing (aka kickboxing), Yoga, and Zen Zone (aka tai chi).The dance segments each have two routines.  In each routine you can break down half of the routine slowly, put the routine together slowly, break down half of each routine quickly, put the routine together quickly, or dance the routine fully.  I loved all the genres of dance; I think the developers picked the best styles and moves.  The moves are all authentic, by the way, no cheesy aerobic knockoffs here.The cardio boxing is slightly the same with the level 1 classes being breakdowns of the moves, the level 2 classes putting the level 1 class moves together, and level 3 putting them all together.  You'll go through all the major punches (front, side, uppercut, etc.) and all of the kicks (front, side, roundhouse, etc.).  You'll also do things like speedbags and jumping jacks.  It's a pretty good workout in the higher levels.Yoga and zen zone each have two options: develop it and master it.  In develop it, you move through select moves several times.  In master it, you put many develop it moves together for a longer workout.  The yoga tracking is the only tracking complaint I have in the classes.  Occasionally when wearing baggy shirts, shorts, or pants, the tracking wouldn't be able to find my limbs.  It could be annoying, but like I said earlier, the game isn't focused all around the tracking.  It's there to help you, not force a \"game over\" on you if you don't match it perfectly.I've saved boot camp for last, because there is a lot to say about it.  While the other classes had different but still pleasant ladies voicing them, this workout gives you a drill sergeant as the voice.  He's not Jillian Michaels tough, he's call-you-names-and-try-to-irritate-you-intentionally-like-a-bullying-jerk tough.  Obviously that's authentic boot camp, but if I wanted that I'd join the marines.  I don't want to listen to a rude man yell at me like I'm not worth anything;  that's the opposite of inspiring to me.  However, others may like his insulting way of instructing, and if that's your thing then great!  Besides his obnoxious personality, his workouts are extremely good.  They are all level 3, and they will work your body intensely from head to toe.  It gets in cardio, upper body, lower body, and everything in between.  I really enjoy doing these effecting and tough workouts, although I could do with the insults.  (NOTE: Although Mr. Drill Sergeant calls you names, I have not heard him or any other personal trainer curse in the game.)The absolute final thing I'm going to talk about in relation to this game is the loading screens.  When moving from the main menu to the workouts and vice versa, you will be given short (about 15 seconds?) loading screens.  Helpful tips and hints will come up during these to keep you entertained.  I didn't find the loading too annoying since it wasn't done more than necessary, and I didn't think that it affected my heart rate at all.I have written a LOT about this game, and I hope it has helped you reach a purchasing decision.  If I haven't already made it clear, I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone who wants to get in shape.  It's amazing virtual training that is probably as close to personal training as is currently possible with the technology we have.  There is something for everyone, and while there is a lack of stretching, every other type of exercise seems to be included.  I do this game several times a week and have not gotten bored with it yet, having had it for several months.  A few cons keep it from having a perfect rating, but if you have a kinect and want to work out, nothing should keep you from buying this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0045F8QD4","description":"","reviewerName":"RKOFANT","summary":"Slight upgrade to the Power Glove...","reviewText":"This is the spiritual successor to the award winning Power Glove for NES. You will love to play this for like 2 days and the stick it in a closet for all eternity. If you are a \"real\" gamer from the 80s or 90s then you can only fool yourself into liking this thing for so long. At least when you got tired of the power glove you got to keep it around as an awesome fashion accessory. I wish I still had mine so I could wear it out to the mall and turn all sorts of heads. So in some ways the power glove was better. Having the power glove entitled you to replace any reference to your hands with the words \"power gloves\".  For example:  \"I can't wait to get my power gloves onto that(fill in blank)\". Also the power glove was a good way to intimidate people. If I went to a bar with a huge bouncer I'd really behave myself, but if I went to a bar with a average sized bouncer wearing a power glove it would have the same effect. This can be seen in the equation below:When P = power glove and I = intimidation and C = coolnessP = (10000000 * I) + (infinity * C)^2Now If I was in said bar and the bouncer had a wiimote instead of a power glove I would trash the place out of principle.It's not all bad, Wii has like 5 good games so if you really want to play one of those 5 good games I guess you should buy the wii. i would also add that the wii is good if you are a little kid, a person that hates normal video games due to lack of hand eye coordination or a small animal. If you are a large animal like Bigfoot you will not enjoy wii very much unless you smash it to demonstrate your dominance to your pack. Needless to say a Bigfoot wearing a power glove would have already demonstrated his superiority by just putting it on and would not require additional smashing.Personally I am probably not the audience for this magical device, but have watched literally thousands of people bail on this product due to lack of quality software. It has basically become a marketing machine for other things like reality tv shows. I am sure Jersey Shore for wii is in the works. I can picture people fist pumping with wiimotes for points.Basically buy this if you want to suck bazillions of development dollars away from the making of quality video games.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2010"}

There are a very few minor hicups but nothing that takes away from the overall satisfying gameplay. Another thing that this game has going in it's favor is it's length. For an action game of it's caliber the game is plenty long enough. It does start to get a little tideous at times,( meaning that there really isn't very much diversity in the gameplay ) but the fun of slicing and dicing the way that Wolverine was always meant to in a video game never goes stale. I would really like it if Raven Software were to eventually make other X-Men action games like this in the near future, with other characters. Heck, even an action game of this type and style with the whole X-Men team.

{"product_name":"B00002STFP","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"Decent and dated MK fighting game","reviewText":"As the Playstation heated up the console wars, Sega and Nintendo weren't the only competitors this time around. So N64 owners were delighted to hear that MK Trilogy would be released and in 1996, it came out and was a moderate success. But with delight came confusion and disappointment as Nintendo's version wasn't identical to the Playstation version in more ways that one. MK Trilogy turned out to be a decent and dated MK fighting game even by standards back then.MK Trilogy is a fighting game combining all the stages, characters, game play mechanics and \"fatalities\" (gory special moves) from all of the past MK games into one glorious version with extra modes and options to give fans of Mortal Kombat the complete experience. Choose from one of 26 characters (plus 4 secret characters that you have to unlock) and you can either play one on one kombat, 2 player vs. kombat, tournament mode or 2 player three on three kombat. The main goal is to beat every fighter you come across and make it to Shao Khan, the game's main villain. Each character has its own background story, ending, moves and fatalities so the game will keep you busy as far as using different characters by yourself or taking on another player. There are numerous codes to enter with varying results so find a guide online and try them out yourself.The PROS: Everything about Mortal Kombat is all in one game: the stages, characters, moves, options, music, game play, codes and secret characters make an appearance. MK fans will dive in head first and feel right at home. And the 2 player modes let you challenge another player for added replayability. Plus, no load times means every match starts immediately.The CONS: While the Playstation version had loading issues, it turned out to be the better version overall. Thanks to cartridge limitations, the N64 version doesn't feature the extra characters found in the Playstation version and takes a big hit in the graphics and music department. Animation frames are missing which means the graphics are not as smooth as it should be. The music doesn't sound as good as it should be since it's been compressed to save space. The controls are spot on but some will find the N64 controller a little cumbersome at first so it will take some getting used to before you forget about the initial inconvenience.What's disappointing is that had this come out a year later, MK Trilogy could have turned out better since other developers opted to ship their games in cartridges with more space and it would have helped out. Because of key sacrifices, this game will only be cherished by the fans and somewhat acknowledged by everyone else. This game would later re-inforce the notion that CDs were the better medium to make games on while cartridges had less space to work with and were more expensive to manufacture. You can pick this up cheap and I would recommend this game to the fans and those who never played the Playstation version.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0047TLIBU","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A very good RPG that is quite different from its predecessor","reviewText":"Dragon Age II, the sequel to 2009's epic fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Origins, is a very different game from its predecessor.  This unfortunately seems to have led many to judge Dragon Age II very harshly, as is often the case of any \"sequel\" in any medium.  While Dragon Age II doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessor, it is still a very good game that stands on its own, does a lot of things right, and delivers a very satisfying gaming experience.Dragon Age II's biggest distinction is its narrative structure.  Somewhat experimental within the realm of video game storytelling, the game's story is more episodic and drawn out.  The best analogy that I can think of is that Dragon Age II's story much more closely resembles an entire season of a well-written television show, where as its predecessor, Origins, is more like the epic movie.  Dragon Age II takes its time and slowly lets everything unfold in a series of acts, rather than present the conflict right off the bat and send you off on an epic journey to confront it.  I personally really, really enjoyed Dragon Age II's story and I applaud the writers for taking a risk and trying something new with the medium of video games.  If your expectations are to get another story similar to Origins, you will be disappointed.  Dragon Age II is simply a different story taking place in the world of Thedas, making it feel much more like a spin off of, rather than a sequel to, the first game.  And it works.  Dragon Age II's story is loaded with some really great moments that really surprised me, and pleased me both as a gamer and as a lover of a good story.Within this setting and story, Dragon Age II delivers a really solid experience that makes a lot of improvements from the original.  You play the role of Hawke, the central character of the story, and guide him/her from being a desperate Ferelden refugee to becoming a legendary figure of Kirkwall, the city that comprises the majority of the game's settings, over a decade-long period of time.  The characters who help you achieve this are interesting, humorous, and very well-written into the story, and the fact that Hawke is also a voiced character gives the interactions between the characters extra weight.  As you complete quests and rise through the hierarchy of Kirkwall's society, you will engage in battles that feature, in my opinion, a hugely improved combat system.  While keeping most of the strategic and tactical nature of the combat from the first game, this game features visceral combat that is much faster, more fluid, and very exciting.  The skill trees used to develop your characters are somewhat streamlined and easier to use, yet still give you great control over your party's growth.  And lastly, the game looks and sounds absolutely wonderful...a big improvement in that department.Dragon Age II's biggest weakness is its recycled environments.  Many times in the game, you will revisit the same environments, even though they will have different names and your objectives will be different.  I am not sure why this is like this, but the only two reasons I can think of are either developer laziness or a product of a rushed schedule due to adherence to a release deadline.  Exploration is a key element of every good RPG, and because of this, it is an activity that should never feel stale.  Dragon Age II came dangerously close to this point after crossing the 40 hour mark, and I hope this is something they address the next time around, which I'm sure they will.So while Dragon Age II may not reach the heights of Dragon Age: Origins, it is certainly a really good game in its own right that fans of the original should enjoy if they keep in mind that this is a very different game with a different, almost experimental, way of story telling.  It's still much better than a good deal of the RPGs out there, and I feel bad that it will be standing in the shadow of its predecessor for a long time, because it really has its own identity and actually does many things better than its predecessor did.  Go into the game with an open mind, and you'll find that there is a lot of excellent content here that will deliver a really enjoyable experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"Average Joe \"Average Joe\"","summary":"The best game on N64","reviewText":"Goldeneye 007 is the best game for the Nintendo 64. Its an amazing game, and its still fun to play today. There was a game called Perfect Dark that was similar to this and came out later, but this is the far better game. Tons of great guns and gadgets are here, and the gameplay is awesome. Its not the best first person shooter ever(Halo for Xbox is), but its still one of the best. The graphics arent the best ever right now, but at the time, in 1997 or so, they were real great. The music is good. It has a mysterious sound to it for some reason. This game has some of the best levels in any game, and it controls great. Multiplayer in this game is some of the most addictive ever. At the time it had the best multiplayer around. It might not now, since there are games like Halo and Diablo II, but like I said, it was the best at the time. There arent really any negatives. All hail to the best game on N64, and one of the best games ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2004"}
{"product_name":"B002I0F5I2","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"What took me so long?!","reviewText":"Uncharted 2 is a stellar third person (my personal fave kind of game) action-adventure shooter and a Playstation 3 exclusive.  In short, it's an essential title for all PS3 owners and offers an enjoyable Indiana Jones-esque experience with topnotch voice acting and gameplay.  In long, well, it's just as enjoyable, sans for a few glitches.The graphics are great, albeit not as polished as, say, God of War 3 or Red Dead Redemption (but considering they were released nearly 12 months after U2 came out that is understandable).  I found a few glitches, including some weird experiences with Drake being able to put himself halfway through walls and whatnot.  When he follows someone I also found him to be slightly harder to move when he's directly behind whatever character he may be in tow, but nothing too much to gripe about here.  Overall, stellar for the time, but not as good now (naturally).I found gameplay to be highly enjoyable, especially following the kind of games I love, ie God of War 3.  There's a lot of long jumps and climbing going on, and shooting while jumping and climbing as well (actually, there's a lot of shooting in general), and Drake frequently hangs off signs and takes out the bad guys like any normal person would.  The most affecting part of gameplay appeared to be camera angles.  Don't get me wrong, third person is my favorite type of game, but God of War 3 at least didn't immediately put the camera overhead so you'd have to move it but not in time before being shot a couple times and almost dying.  Finding where to jump to next on a wall sometimes (or even where to go) can be harder than it looks, largely because lots of the choices that to designers - which were probably obvious to them - to me, at least, blended in so well with the foreground that I often would leap and die several times in some areas before knowing what next to do.The voice acting is some of the best I've ever heard in a game, both in terms of believability and the way it is carried out.  Nathan Drake is humorous and sarcastic, reminding me of the captain of Serenity from the Firefly TV series.  His lady friends also have amazing voices that fit them perfectly.  Cutscenes actually were believable because of how effective the actors/actresses were at voicing their respective character.In the end, Uncharted 2 is an amazing title.  It's got a lot going for it, but has a couple of quips that take away from the experience.  Overall: Get it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2011"}

Play Godzilla as never before with non-linear story paths and all new Toho monsters.","reviewerName":"GameraRocks \"captpicardfan\"","summary":"Pretty Good - Average","reviewText":"For a Godzilla game, I'd have to say by look alone that this is the best Godzilla that has been released as of now. Too bad that it has some flaws that really drag the score down. One thing about the game is that some of the levels, maybe all, can be beaten without even fighting the monster but just by breaking all of the crystals. I had to fight sometimes because the monsters wouldn't get out of my way, but other than that, breaking the crystals was fine. That's another thing, the controls are confusing! Even using the tutorial, I can't remember all of those different things I'm supposed to do with my Wii remote to do most of those cool moves. So, I either just get lucky by pressing a lot of buttons or just press A and B a lot. The camera is pretty bad at times as well.Overall, the look of the game is beautiful and there is finally an actually storyline this time instead of just at the beginning and end like the previous two games! So that's a plus. I'd say that you will like the game if you are a fan of the Big G, but maybe not so much if you aren't","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003R783IY","description":"","reviewerName":"J.S. Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"Just Expect to Have Fun","reviewText":"As someone who has played every single iteration of Need For Speed, as well as every Gran Turismo, Forza, Burnout, and all the small-name titles in between, there's an awful lot that I can compare this recent Need For Speed title to.I felt something as I played the demo.  I felt a return to the simple, point-to-point races from the very first NFS, the adrenaline of those tight, narrow-margin photo finishes from Burnout and the last Hot Pursuit titles, and from Most Wanted, the absolute thrill of running from - and often into - The Man...And that's what Hot Pursuit is - plain and simple.  Don't boot it up expecting hardcore driving physics.  Don't expect to blow away the competition with highly tuned supercars, and don't expect to spend hours tweaking the layout of vinyls or leafing through dozens of aftermarket wheels and wings.  What you can expect is some sweaty palms as you drift the last corner to the finish, a twisted face as you plow into that guardrail you saw one second too late, and a grin from ear-to-ear as you watch the cop car you just plowed into rolling down the road, raining shrapnel along the asphalt.It's not perfect.  I'll concede that.  The rubber-banding is still pretty strong - I'm zipping at top speed down a straight as an opponent in the same car cruises on by...  In addition, the cop chases are still treated too much like a race.  I took a gorgeous shortcut in my cop car, got ahead of my suspects, spun the opposite direction and prepared for a head-on collision as the words \"WRONG WAY\" suddenly lit up the screen...  What'ch'you mean wrong way?!  I AM the Law!!  (Granted, I hit my target at somewhere around a buck-fifty and INSTANTLY wasted the guy...  So I wasn't really complaining.)  Also, it appears that you're supposed to bring down your targets in order.  During one cop event, I wound up between the 1st and 2nd place racers, and could NOT catch up to the first place car.  Once I dropped back to take out the 2nd driver, suddenly the first place target was right in front of me.  It's a bit more scripted than a flat-out cop chase should be.But then you round a corner in your six-figure exotic, see ol' Smokey sittin' on the shoulder, and aim for the pig while pumping your engine full of nitrous oxide...  A second later you're watching his twisted wreckage flipping down the road, only to be slammed into by your AI opponents who are subsequently knocked off their own course, and as control of your car is returned to you, you just can't help from laughing.That to me is worth 4 stars.Don't forget to wear your seatbelts!  HAH!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2010"}
