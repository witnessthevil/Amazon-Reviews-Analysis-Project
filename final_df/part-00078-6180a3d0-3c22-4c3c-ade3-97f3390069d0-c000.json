{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.

So many people have passed it up for whatever reasons they may have, which is really too bad.  The programmers of Ico have managed to instill the game with such genuine emotion that no words or expressions are needed to convey them.  The true genius of the game lies in the animation of Ico and Yorda - a picture may speak a thousand words, but a moving picture speaks a million.The gameplay itself is an echo of this creativity.  No on-screen icons, meters, or indicators of any kind, ever.  Nothing to distract your attention from the vivid, surreal realm of the castle.  The environmental puzzles are still the most clever ever conceived in any game - Ico and Yorda's path to safety lies right in front of your nose, hidden in plain sight.  The smoky shadows of the creatures are as unnerving as any mansion-haunting undead.  The castle itself is washed in a perpetual glow, which is comforting and haunting at the same time.At a glance, Ico is short, easy, linear, and perhaps even repetitive, but that's missing the point.  Under that apparent superficiality is a story and a world built for the purpose of teasing your heart-strings, and only the utterly jaded will come away from the journey untouched.  The purpose of the game's ending is to stoke the fire of one's imagination.  Ico is the closest anyone's come to an interactive fairy tale, and stands as a triumph of how dedication can find the soul in the software. Beyond the atrocious and misrepresentative cover art (the only flaw in the game) lies a waking dream come to life, a work of subtle yet powerful emotion rivalling the best in literature and film.I urge you not to pass it up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000QUYHIK","reviewerName":"Bobby  W.","summary":"Still the best Sudoku game for DS,  but too much Dr. K.","reviewText":"Brain Age 2, like the original Brain Age, is still the best Sudoku game available on the Nintendo DS. It makes excellent use of both screens (no wasted space or tiny, hard to see numbers that plague other \"dedicated\" Sudoku games on the DS). As I said in my review of the original Brain Age, I wish Nintendo would come out with a dedicated Sudoku game on the DS using this layout. They could rake in a lot of extra cash.As far as the \"main event\", I pretty much agree with what the other reviewers have posted here.I haven't unlocked all of the games yet, but so far, \"Word Scramble\" is my favorite.Some of the new games are improved variations of the original games. \"Memory Sprint\",  where you try to keep track of what place a race runner is in, is more fun than the original game of counting how many people go into and out of a house.I also like the \"Change Maker\" and \"Sign Finder\" games, because they provide some real world practice, although some people may find them boring, or too much like homework.The \"Piano Player\" game was a disappointment, because everybody here seemed to be talking it up, including keyboard players, and that's a bit scary because this type of \"follow the bouncing ball\" music game is available on just about any cheap electronic keyboard out there.The \"Word Blend\" game is lost on me - you do need to concentrate to separate the simultaneously spoken words, but it seems to ultimately be a test of one's hearing (and patience).My major gripes with the Brain Age series are:1. Like other reviewers have said, the \"scoring\" implies that a younger brain must be  better than an older brain. This is misleading and insulting. If Dr. Kawashima had a hand in this aspect of the game design, well, he needs to grow up a bit.2. There's too much Dr. Kawashima! Even in \"Quick Play\" mode, there's \"too much fuss\" to paraphrase the good Doctor. I don't want to have to tap past the same screens of the Doctor telling me what's good for my brain umpteen times. I just want to play the dang game!Still, there are worse ways to blow a few idle minutes every day than playing games like Brain Age.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2007"}

First: the quality of the Survival Edition (contents, impression of the items, & etc). The second part will pertain to the gameplay itself.Onward!Part One:As mentioned in other reviews, the Survival Edition (which retails at $79.99; although, if you didn't pre-order it, you may not be able to find a copy at that price) comes with a few things that separate it from the standard edition. Three of those things come in the package itself (which is an over-sized version of the game box, designed to accommodate the art book): the hardcover art book, a variant cover of the Dark Horse \"The Last of Us\" comic book #1, and the game in a steelbox case. The other perks that owners of the Survival Edition (henceforth referred to as SE) obtain come through a special pre-order code. This code allows the gamer to download Playstation Avatars of the two main protagonists, as well as the game's soundtrack. Players need to enter the code through the Playstation Store via their home computer or directly from your PS3.Impressions:So far, I am in love with the SE. While the avatars and the soundtrack are nice, the comic and the art book more than make up for the additional cost of the game. The hardbound book is beautiful and has artwork of the various denizens (and heroes) found within the world of The Last of Us. The comic tells a story about the teenage girl (who is pictured on the game box) and gives you a little bit of insight into who she is and how she came to be within Boston. My impression is that the comic was a bit loose in the narrative; I suspect that it is setting up the rest of the plot for the other three comics being released by Dark Horse. While interesting, I feel that the art book is the better bonus of the two.All-in-all, if you have the extra cash and can afford to pay for the SE, get it. The game is wonderful, and having access to the artwork and a bit of the background story for one of the protagonists is just amazing.Part Two:Controls, Music, and Graphics:The Last of Us, developed by Naughty Dog Software (home of the acclaimed Uncharted series as well as Jak & Daxter), follows in the footsteps of other Naughty Dog games. That is, The Last of Us (TLoU going forward) is a gorgeous game with an expansive world to explore. The music is simply beautiful and helps so much with the atmosphere; between the gorgeously-rendered environments, amazingly-detailed characters, and an orchestral soundtrack, the game shows the care and passion that the developers at Naughty Dog have. With the weather and day/night effects, the world of TLoU comes alive. Driving rain obscures your vision; darkness envelops you at night, forcing you to use your flashlight to see. Music plays in the background, subtle, rising in a crescendo during tense moments of gameplay. The music is something that you may not always take note of, but you definitely notice whether or not it is missing when the environment is silent.In regards to the atmosphere, Naughty Dog borrowed from its predecessor, Uncharted. That is not to say that it copied the story or the characters, rather, Naughty Dog used their experience with creating a gorgeous world for the setting of TLoU. Plants have individual leaves, limbs, and flowers. When the wind is blowing, you see them wave in response to the drafts, rustling as they would in real life. During a thunderstorm water cascades in sheets; the lightning briefly illuminates the landscape and thunder rumbles overhead while you are moving through the world in an attempt to find shelter. Shadows change as the lighting source differs; illuminating an object with your flashlight casts different shadows depending upon the angle of the light. Details like this bring the world of TLoU to life, drawing in the player and immersing them in the apocalyptic ruins of Boston, Massachusetts.Controls within the game are fairly easy to adapt to, yet sometimes I found that manipulating your hand-held item in a frenetic setting can sometimes be frustrating. The game has the controls configured so that you can swap through your inventory by using the D-pad, aiming with L1, shooting/attacking with a weapon is mapped to R1, and using a first aid kit is accomplished by selecting the kit and then holding down the \"X\" button. Since first aid kits take a few moments to use, you have to make sure that you are safe from attack for the duration of healing yourself. This is where things can get hairy: if you are dealing with a room full of baddies, the AI is such that they will move to any sound that you make. The AI is also smart; they will cry out, alerting other nearby bad guys to your presence and will pursue you for quite a while, going around obstacles and climbing over things (if necessary) to get to you.While all of this makes for a tense gaming experience, shuffling through your weapons to use a shiv (melee) or finding which type of gun you wish to use can be frustrating. In one instance, shortly after I acquired the revolver, the game prompted me to switch to it from my currently-equipped gun by selecting it with the D-pad and holding down \"X\". It took me a couple of minutes to accomplish this; I repeatedly followed the directions as shown on the screen but the game did not seem to recognize the command right away. Adding to the irritation is the fact that the game would not allow me to move forward or do any other task until I successfully completed the action. Fortunately, however, the moments when things like this happen are not frequent. As the game progressed I was able to use the hand-held items more fluidly, minimizing my damage from attackers.Story:This is where The Last of Us shines. As the title implies, TLoU is about the surviving members of the human race, nearly decimated twenty years prior to the main storyline. The game opens with the protagonist's daughter sleeping on the couch. Soon he walks in, waking her. She stayed out on the couch, even though it was nearly midnight, to give her father his birthday present: a watch. After that it is bedtime: you find yourself controlling the daughter after a mysterious phone call in the middle of the night. You go searching for your father and find the house empty... the television is on the den, and a newscast about some sort of riot is on. It is near your home!Finally your father runs in the house, slamming the patio door behind him. He tells you to stay inside, away from the windows and doors... and then his crazed neighbor breaks through the glass and charges him. Your father shoots him... to your horror, and then the story takes off.The basic plot of TLoU is nothing new: an infection by a mysterious disease spread like wildfire through humanity, those afflicted going crazy and attacking others. The disease vector is spores, and indeed, those infected look to have some sort of mushroom-like fungi growing on their skin. Twenty years after that fateful birthday night, you wake up again, only this time you are the father. What remains of society is gathered into zones that are kept under marshal law. Ration cards are the currency of the day; survival is a cruel allusion to the game's title.Soon you will find yourself on a quest to cure the disease plaguing humanity, joining your partner-in-survival Tess and a strange teenage girl thrust upon you under strange circumstances. Suddenly dodging the curfew and outwitting fellow survivors becomes child's play as you adventure through the decimated world of TLoU.Overall:Pros:1) Engaging story; truly addicting gameplay2) Excellent camera work3) Beautiful graphics, music, and sound effects4) Voiceovers rock!5) Huge environment to explore6) AI is very intelligent; the baddies WILL find you and WILL do everything that they can to kill you7) Simple menu system to create weapons, improve your stats, and to view items collected8) The art book and comic are beautiful (for those who purchased the Survival Edition)9) Free online play is you buy a new copyCons:1) There are a few glitches; from \"shimmer\" with the graphics to the bullets from my rifle repeatedly being ejected from the gun (it is bolt action).... when the gun is strapped to my back2) Quick-swapping weapons is confusing at first; remembering which combination of buttons to push to swap out guns after using a Molotov cocktail, for instance, can waste precious time until you have acquainted yourself thoroughly with the controls3) Although rare, if any of your in-game partners cross in front of your character on a narrow path, they will keep trying to get behind you while you try to push forward, resulting in a chopping movement forward4) Online play costs $9.99 extra if you buy a used editionI waited anxiously for this title, and I can honestly say that I am glad that I did. The gameplay is fun and challenging; the story is engaging, and the bonuses from the Survival Edition are very much worth it. The Last of Us was one of the most-anticipated titles of the year, and after playing it for the last two days, I can definitely agree. TLoU is a mixture of many genres, with some platforming (&agrave; la titles like Assassin's Creed), some stealth (think Metal Gear), and some shooting. You have to survive, and in order to progress in this game, you need to be aware of your environments, your inventory, and your skills. Do you want to go through, guns blazing? Or do you want to toss a bottle to create a distraction so that you can sneak up and shiv a baddie? The choice is yours, and your decision will mean the difference between surviving... and death.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2013"}

Number 1: Track down and confront the betrayer and number 2: Stop The Darkspawn from the destroying the World.  Oh boy, what fun!  But hold on... you can't do this by yourself.  Which means you have to bring these cool treaties to different species/ classes of people and recruit a varied squad of companions.

I had plenty of issues with this game just like other players. So, I was hopping PS4 version solves some of the issues. Time passed by and I finally decided to write a review about this game because I think EA/Dice had enough time to fix things.Issue #1: Single player save games delete by itself. I was trying to get some dog tags for MP that can only be unlocked by playing SP and finding them around levels, but all my saves were gone.Issue #2: Constant updates and game changes. I follow BF on twitter & Facebook, and pretty much every month there is something changing. Like added recoil to X gun, decrease damage to Y tank,... So, I really need to relearn things every time I play.Issue #3: Playing with your clan or friends is a pain in the ass.Issue #4: No customization allowed in the game menu. Only by joining a server or playing test range.Issue#5: CRRRAAAZZZZYYY LAG. I never ever thought I would say this about BF. Sometimes the lag is so bad that you can't play at all. People jump around, rubber banding, and bad net code makes SOME games unplayable. Some servers are ok ( 4/10 games that I play are good)Issue#6: This one is a personal opinion. I think BF community has changed and they are more COD players in BF than before. As a BF player since 2005 on PC, I can tell you team work is getting weak in BF4.Issue #7: LAAAAGGG. It's so annoying that I have to mention it again. People join U.S servers from all over the world. Last night I was in a server with people from Germany, France, and Canada. No wonder the game lags...Issue #8: Map design is not as strong as BF3. I literally loved all BF3 maps( from CQ maps to huge maps like Alborz mountain), but BF4 has a couple of really bad maps that I just quit when I end up in them.Issue#9: Zero health kills. This happens a lot to me. I see an enemy, shoot him 12-15 bullets and I get some hit marks, he shoots like 2-3 bullets with an Assault rifle with no attachment and I'm DEAD. I look at his health and it shows ZERO. I know it's a glitch or net coding problem and he actually has 2-3 health left, but I'm damn sure he should have been killed.Issue#10: Dog tags are ugly and shows nothing about your skills. In BF3 we had dog tags that showed amount of kills that you got by a particular gun or equipment. My favorite was MVP( most valued player which I got it like 370 times ). I was really good to show your skills in your dog tag, but it's all gone in BF4.Of course there are many positive things in this game like graphic/ Guns/ Attachments/ Huge maps/ 64 players/dynamic maps...This game needs updates & fixes. Net coding problem needs to be solved. Region lock MUST be in this game ( US players in US servers, Canadians in Canadian Servers ).Anyway, I recommend this game if it's cheap. I would say wait a little longer till they fix more issues.My Battle-log ID is  streetracer475 in case you are wondering this review is written by a COD fan boy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2014"}

While other games at the time were branching out to MMOs and hack n' slashes (see diablo 2 and neverwinter nights), Baldur's Gate went back to the roots of what a RPG is.This game is based off dungeons and dragons role playing, turn by turn style, BUT it does not play like a turn by turn game. Battles are fluid, and unless you turn on the auto-pause feature, you probably won't realize that a turn has gone by. This is what makes this game a successful adaption of pen and paper RPGS in the computer world.Now be aware, this game is not for everyone. If you are looking for an online game, this game is definately not what you should buy. BG has online capablities, but from my experience it is incredibly lacking. Also, this game is not a hack and slash type game. You can't just walk around killing everything in sight, there is a storyline to follow(Well a couple variations of a storyline). If you're looking for a straight up hack and slash game, go buy Guildwars.Let me list everything in a pro and con list, since I know most people won't bother to read the actual review.Pros-Strong Storyline-Low system requirements-Several different class types (including dual class and multi class and even sub class)-Several Different races, each with their own advantages-The ability to pick up NPC's into your party OR create a party of 6 custom characters if you go through the TCP/IP mode or multiplayer mode.-Several different quests and side quests, with rewards that vary depending on your class.-A wide array of weapons-Hundreds and hundreds of spells-Fluid game play that appeals to more than just DnD nerds.Cons-Very weak multiplayer-Limited replayablity for most people.-A bit easy (but at the same time you are able to set your own difficulty)-Old Graphics-As with most RPGs, this game is a little slow at first.over all this is a very fun game which I do recommend and it is a shame this game did not get more recognition","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2007"}

The story really isnt that deep, but it keeps it interesting all the way.One of the most important things when playing a shooter for me is the feeling of the weapons. Even though the 360 is a powerful system some games just do not feel right(Perfect Dark Zero) This game is off the charts in this part.Althought looks arent everything, this game is one one of the best looking games on any system (I have a friend that bought this game for the pc and he couldnt play it on the highest setting, and he had just bought a new $4k computer!)Enemy A.I? its some of the best anywhere! on the average setting you dont really appreciate it. But on the harder setting enemies run for cover, flank you, one will cover or try to distract you while another hides for cover.. etc.. its fun! You never get the feeling that the computer is cheating. and it also never feels like the same fight twice.Arguably the most important thing about any game is the controls. The controls are very good, but they seem a bit complex at first. The reason I say this is because you are given more options for melee attacks, you can do some cool slow mo, peak around corners, focus your aim at the expense of moving slower. etc. It takes a while to get used to everything, but once you get the hang of it you will have a blast. especially in multiplayer.I guess some people complain about the game because they are hopeing for a halo type game with different vehicles, alien guns, extra ordinary story... etc.. But this game never even pretends to be that. Its just a shooter like Doom, Return to Castle Wolfenstein.. even Half Life.The only negative for me is that all the levels seem industrial.. so in a way it does get a bit repetive. But to me its very minor since everytime I started getting that feeling a new type of enemy would pop up.My favorite part about this game is the multiplayer, I havent had this much fun since halo 2. The games inovative controls really shine. So if playing multiplayer is your bag then this is your game.Overall this is arguably the best 360 first person shooter. So if your into these types of games you should check it out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00001XDUB","reviewerName":"Robert N. Kallister","summary":"Survival Horror At Its Best","reviewText":"Back in 1997, I purchased a copy of Resident Evil: Director's Cut, mostly because I'd been exposed to the original verion at a friend's place, and thought it was interesting.  The shotty dialogue was a bit annoying, but the game itself was done very well, with good graphics, a puzzle-solving integration, and some really interesting monsters.  So when Silent Hill rolled around, I thought I should see how Konami's take on the survival/horror genre would be.  I wasn't let down, and Silent Hill quickly became one of my favorite PS titles of all time.You play as Harry Mason, a single dad with a young seven-year-old daughter named Cheryl.  You're on a vacation trip to try to get away from it all, when a mysterious woman appears in the middle of the road.  Frantically, you jerk the wheel of your jeep to avoid hitting her, only to end up crashing into a ditch.  You lose consciousness, and awake to find you're engulfed in a strange fog, and Cheryl is missing.  You don't know where you are, or what's around you, but you know you've got to get Cheryl back.Silent Hill features the entire layout of the town of Silent Hill.  The buildings, the streets, the signposts, mailboxes, benches, trees, and everything else are all carved out for you to explore.  It features an array of strange, twisted enemies to fight, and a small stock of different weapons you can use to defeat them with.  But most important of all, the scenarios become twisted and nightmarish as night falls, and you jump into another dimension with scenes so frightening, you'll just be thankful you're not Harry himself.Instead of the usual video-game music playing as you run around the town, the game features a soundtrack of creepy noises and other sounds that keep you on edge.  Your pocket radio crackles with static when enemies are nearby, and the sound effects of the environment chill you to the bone.Any other horror film, game, or soundtrack you've experience before are Sunday-School lessons compared to Silent Hill.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

I don't know who said they rather play the Atari instead of the PS2, if he had one, he'd definitly be playing the PS2, mabe more than the Xbox, but who knows. If you say the Xbox is just another bad microsoft product, try it out and get Halo, and Splinter Cell, with your own soundtrack, you'll be amazed, and if you shut out the gamecube, because of it's tastes(basicly kids) then give it a shot, and you might think kid games ain't so bad(heck they even have enough adult games, so I dunno why they keep saying it's best for kids, but the everyone rated games are a ton of fun). I mean, surley this looks like a waste of a reiview, but in my mind, all systems are good, and I'm really tired of 1 console owning fanboys bashing other consoles(Maybe their upset that they don't have a job, and don't have all the systems, and they just want to write a childish review to make the fell better, I dunno). I'm sure alot of people are tired of this nonsence console wars. I mean I can't even look up on reviews about multiplatform games, without saying this console stinks and this one rules.

Advertising other consoles on other console pages are just dumb. I'll recomend this for ya tho, if you want the best console for games, you can't resist, get the PS2, If you want the strongest game console to date and want pure eye candy, and you're own soundtrack, who's stoppin you grab a Xbox.

For those who witnessed the video game market crash only to see it revived in 1985, it must have been one hell of a trip. Super Mario Bros was bundled with the Value Edition, not the one I received for Christmas (Deluxe Set Edition.) My first and second games that I ever played on the NES were Gyromite and Duck Hunt. Sometime in 1986, I got the chance to play the third game that I got my hands on at a friend's house and it was awesome. To think that a game like this was easy to play and fun to explore spoke millions of words to me. It had the same effect on everyone who played it and it was so good, it still sold very well when it was eventually released as a game by itself.You already know what the game is about, what it brought to video games in general and the effect it had on everything from music, the future of home consoles and to pop culture. This one game gave you more stuff to do than the entire catalog of Atari 2600 games (no offense to the fans of Atari.) Maybe by today's standards, Super Mario Bros. doesn't stand a chance. Back then, you had it all: sharp graphics, simple but solid controls, multiple worlds to explore, earn lots of points and the feeling of accomplishment when you finally rescued the princess. You couldn't ask for anything else at the time and it revived an industry that was supposed to fade away. It didn't and it's the reason why gamers today are all over one of their favorite hobbies.

{"product_name":"B000NJH6YG","reviewerName":"There's No Stopping Space Vikings T. Edwards!","summary":"Fun game but it needs some polishing.","reviewText":"First make a note that I have given this game a 4 for fun.  People like to overlook the fun rating you give a game here and whine so don't, I like this game.Well, my 360 had been collecting dust for a while so I figured it was high time to pick up a new game and this looked appealing.  Everybody was comparing it toElder Scrolls IV: Oblivionand even a game 10 times as bad as Oblivion or any Elder Scrolls game for that matter is still twice as good as most games these days so I chanced it and went out to get a copy.My first 5 minutes playing the game were absolutely dreadful.  I was regretting spending the $60 like no money I have ever wasted before.  The graphics were completely unimpressive, there were periodic gameplay hiccups, the inventory management seemed awkward, and the combat was kind of lame.  On that 6th minute though something in me snapped and I continued playing and as the hours rolled by all of the \"problems\" with this game really only struck me as minor annoyances.Let me break this down for you...Graphics:I'm playing this on aSony KV-27FS120 27\" FD Trinitron WEGA Flat Screen TVso I'm not getting the HD experience.  So eventually I came to the epiphany that some of the graphical \"errors\" I found in this game were due to the limitations of my hardware.  I'm almost positive the game is intended for a wider screen since in the inventory screen text overlaps my encumbrance and the extreme left and right are slightly cut off on my TV.  Obviously the graphics were also less impressive on a standard TV.  All in all though I came to terms with the problems I initially found with the game.  I stopped and looked at the scope of the game and how much could fit on screen all at one time and I was deeply satisfied.  Unfortunately I have no HDTV to test these theories with.  So, on my set up, the game isn't the prettiest thing in the world or maybe just not what I was expecting, but it is really impressive.  You can climb to the top of a mountain and see nearly the whole realm, glacier snow and desert sand reflect sunlight and sort of blind your character, the water looks incredible, and there are some pretty unique and stylized locations.  There are better looking games on the 360 with my set up but this one is by far and away the most large and overall impressive environment I have seen yet.Sound:Well not every category can win; I'm still not entirely over how bad the sound in the game is.  The spells and attacking sound fine and overall the sound effects are pretty good but it's the voice acting and ambient music that just sucks.  There's no two ways about it this is the greatest failure of them game in my opinion.  For example, you can be in a completely deserted and dead town but for some reason the programmers didn't have the sense to remove the standard town audio track from the location.  You're still hearing dogs barking and general city noises even when it is apparent there are no dogs are general hustle and bustle of town life occurring.  They take a chance to make an eerie situation eerie and ruin it by not setting the mood with the music.  The voice acting is simply a joke and often I wonder if it's meant to be that way.  There are awkward pauses during speech, you will hear \"forsooth\" and \"mayhap\" more in this game than you will for the rest of your life, there's bad ethnic stereotypes, it sometimes seems that they have people with obvious foreign accents playing obviously English parts...  I could go on for days about the voice acting.  On the plus side you can skip over the talking so don't worry about it too much because this is really the only way the game completely fails me.Gameplay:For all the talk of this game being like Oblivion I have to disagree.  Aside from them both taking place in expansive open ended worlds they really have nothing in common.  However, there is a game that is so staggeringly similar to this game that I'm surprised I hadn't heard it anywhere and that game isDivine Divinity.  Take Divine Divinity and make it 3D and you have Two Worlds.  The skills are set up nearly the same way, the story is shockingly similar, there's a very real comparison to the consequences of your actions, similar enemies... and again I could go on for days about the similarities but let me elaborate on Two Worlds and leave playing Divine Divinity to you (awesome game BTW).You start the game out as a male human hero, there is no option to change this unless you play online (lame), and you are then thrown in to the world trying to save your sister.  There is a given skill set that you start with and any additional skills must be purchased from trainers before any earned skill points can be put in to them.  Skill trainers are kind of hard to come by and this was one of my initial turn offs about the game but since finding them I have come to enjoy the game a lot more.  You learn spells by finding spell cards much like you would inDiablowith spell books.  In addition to these cards there are also bonus cards that can be equipped in conjunction with spells to enhance their abilities like damage, cost, and duration.  Each skills has 10 levels of proficiency and skill points are earned at level ups, for completing quests, and for reaching milestones in the game like a certain number of locks picked or monsters killed.  The combat is just hack and slash; there are no combos or anything like that.  You can get special moves with skill points but that's where the complexity ends.  So given this info you should be coming to the conclusion that this game sounds a lot like a dungeon crawler a la Diablo, Titan Quest, Champions of Norrath and to that I would say you are right.  That is exactly how this game plays, like a dungeon crawler and this is probably why I have come to love it.I haven't had much success with stealth and stealing yet.  It always seems that no matter how well hidden I am somehow a guard always \"catches\" me.  The thing with this is that nearly all the towns in the game don't have guards so instead of anything negative happening the citizens just complain constantly while you're in town after getting caught.  I haven't found a way around this yet and it can be quite annoying, especially when you accidentally pick a lock or something, but again it's more annoying than detrimental to the gameplay.Missions are frequent and generally speaking are easy to complete since markers are usually put on the map.  There is a great consequence to your actions though in this game and sometimes it's pretty cool while others it is downright annoying.  Be careful with which missions you choose to take or not take, especially with the main quest, since it is not entirely uncommon to make other missions unfinishable by completing quests.  For example, moving along in the main story wipes out an entire town full of quests and another few lines of quests all ask you to kill the same guy.  This forces you to play carefully and really decide which path you want to take unlike in the Elder Scrolls series when it was clear who your enemies were and it wasn't that hard to complete multiple quest lines.Another small gripe I have with this game is that it's a bit easy.  Nearly everything in this game can be beaten with the \"back jump\" button and a melee weapon since monster's attacks are so simple and predictable.  This is another reason that this game feels like a dungeon crawler to me though.  It's more about advancement and equipment then it is about battle strategy and skill.  I think it's actually quite apparent that was the intention with this game given how fast you level up.  I'm nearly level 50 after just over 20 hours of gameplay.  Granted there's much left for me to do but there really isn't much of a threat left to me.  Dragons have been a joke to me since I was around level 30 since on top of the ease of combat, there is no penalty for dying other than having to walk back to wherever you were which usually isn't far.Summary:I like this game quite a bit and I'm sure most people will if they realize what it is.  In no way should you go in to this game expecting Oblivion since it falls somewhere in between a dungeon crawler and an epic RPG.  For all its' shortcoming though this game still manages to remain fun.  If there was a sequel to this game I would expect much more from it and wouldn't be so forgiving of the minor errors that are present in this iteration.  All in all a worthy game, maybe not for $60, but if you're hard up for a fun RPG on the 360 then I would recommend this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00005Y4Q1","description":"Unreal II: The Awakeningreturns to the fascinating futuristic setting ofUnreal, first visited in 1998. Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach. They've made a solid shooter that takes full advantage of Epic's state-of-the-art graphics engine, but did nothing to set the shooter apart from the crowd.

{"product_name":"B0014ULQB2","reviewerName":"Gearhead Mania","summary":"Extreme Home Makeover, Red Faction edition","reviewText":"Red Faction Guerilla for Xbox 360I've never played the other Red Faction games, and plan to try Armageddon once the prices drop. Someone recommended I try Guerilla because of the destruction you can achieve with your sledgehammer and anything else in the game. I was truly impressed with the Havok engine on the Xbox 360 considering the hardware on the Xbox 360 is the equivalent to a 7-8 year old PC. Almost everything in the game can be damaged/destroyed by the player. You have a variety of weapons starting from 3 different types of sledgehammers, a pistol, pump-action shotgun, semi-auto shotgun, assault rifle, RPG, Grinder (shoots buzzsaws - one of the worst weapons in the game), arc welder (useful for taking out groups of enemies), remote charges, proximity charges, sniper rifle, gauss rifle, rail gun (similar to the one Arnold used in the movie Eraser, complete with X-ray scope), the nanorifle, thermobaric warheads, and a few others. You also get a jetpack later on in the game. For multiplayer, there are a few more weapons and backpacks available.Some of the mini-quests include collecting ID tags, ore deposits, destroying 100 hydrogen tanks, etc... but the ID tags and ore deposits are time consuming since they are spread out everywhere. Completing all 104 guerilla missions was a chore since there was no way to determine which areas had remaining quests to complete.The controls are OK. Controlling Mason wasn't a big chore but controlling the vehicles was very frustrating at the start. The vehicles understeer then oversteer on a whim if you're lucky. Otherwise, vehicles like the garbage truck are slow and you might as well go on foot. There's lower gravity on Mars and hitting a slight bump will cause you to go airborne and lose traction. The EDF tactical vehicles are usually the ones I like because they're armored and fairly maneuverable.At the start, I felt the game had a sense of strategy because you could somewhat plan your guerilla attacks. Load up your vehicle with remote charges, drive it into a building but leave the vehicle ahead of time, then detonate the charges. But as you progress in the story, the EDF increase in strength and numbers. There are flying patrols that will follow you and diminish your health. EDF will send out tanks, rocket tanks, and large droves of APCs with plenty of soldiers (and heavily armored soldiers with rail guns). It was very difficult to use the cover system and provide aimed fire. The cover usually lasted 5 seconds as everyone would just blast a wall or object you were hiding behind. I found the best strategy was to keep moving around and use remote charges, rockets, the nano rifle, and arc welder as appropriate. Collecting salvage is important because you want to upgrade some of your weapons early on. Some tips: Don't bother with the grinder or proximity charges. Get all of the thermobaric upgrades you can get as soon as possible (it's only available later in the game). A lot of salvage is required for that.The graphics are good, but the quality of the models is about on-par with a game made in 2003-2004. The Havok engine is very slick but it would benefit from better looking models and textures. The game is fun, but the driving model could be significantly improved. The map interface isn't that great and accessing the map shouldn't take several seconds, it was slowing me down during the numerous transporter missions.I've read others compare Red Faction Guerilla to Grand Theft Auto, and I have to agree - except you can't steal other people's cars. They openly give them to you since you're part of the Red Faction. You can't really steal the EDF cars, you just have to kill the occupants using the arc welder or rail gun, or kill them as they come out of the vehicle.Overall: 4/5 stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2011"}

Namely, anyone involved in the death of his daughter years before. I like this new, stripped down to the core Splinter Cell title for the most part but there's something about it that I can't quite put my finger on. The single player is good but admittedly short. It's over before you know it and while it does have replay value it is kind of disappointing that the game is over so quickly. The game mechanics are pretty good with a new mark and execute function that is pretty awesome in how seamlessly and fluidly you can take out a room full of bad guys who have no idea where you are. They've also added interrogation scenes where you can beat the ever living snot out of your target using the environment to help you get your answers. There's a very deep gratification to be had by smashing someone face first into a bathroom mirror. Multiplayer is the main draw for this game and with a buddy, this game is a load of fun. It literally becomes a story of two ultimate badasses murdering their way through some excellent level designs that are both huge and able to be tackled in more than a couple of different ways. Ubisoft sweetens the deal somewhat with bonus content that has been made available every week, ranging from guns to outfits for your online character. I don't think the voice acting is as solid as it was in the previous installments but of course, Michael Ironside continues to bring us a spot on performance as Fisher. Graphics are nice, sound is nice and overall, its a good package that just doesn't seem to be as much fun in single player as it is in multi. I'd recommend this but anyone looking for the complexity of earlier SC games will probably be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2010"}

Sound fun?  Confusing?Parasite Eveis both.It begins when Aya is attending an opera at Carnegie Hall. The soloist bursts into song and the  audience bursts into flames. Somehow, Aya is the only attendee who isn't affected. Not  surprisingly, she wants to know what's going on. This curiosity, coupled with her duties as a police  officer, grows into a full-scale investigation.Parasite Eve's mechanics are simple, yet elegant. From combat to level advancement, the  game runs easily and smoothly, making it ideal for someone new to role-playing games (RPGs).  Experienced RPGers should still enjoy it for its brilliant storyline.Technically speaking, the game's graphics and sound are good, but not spectacular.

The white gold head of a goat yoked by a crown of flames for instance. Corpses and severed limbs artfully arranged on walls. The boss fights are also a real highlight - impressive scale and continually stranger characters.The story, although minimal I found to be entertaining. The humor is hit or miss for some, but I thought it was good. Shooting gameplay is similar to killer 7 or RE 5/4, but more fast paced and arcade like. I definitely thought the gameplay, while not very deep, was fun to play and controlled well. But the main attraction of SOTD are the strange sights on garcia hotspur's trip through hell.

Ok the first 10 mins of the game is a good opening. I was playing this game in a open area so people comes up and like yo what game is this because they see some chick being hanged for the opening so that's kind of a wow moment. Yeah it has some sexual funny moments throughout the game. It's a cool dark settings, they try not to spend so much time in one dark area so being in caves/tunnels the whole time isn't happening here you pretty much switch areas every 20 mins. I really don't like dark games where you cant see where you're going thankfully this game has lights you can turn on to make dark areas a bit more pleasant. -----> Now on to the crappy part of the game, really there isn't anything that annoyed me about the game EXCEPT how long it takes for the ending to end. It's reminds you of games(fF13) where one boss keeps coming back you have to kill him like 5 times, kinda the case here except it's 3 diff. bosses that come back and you're like just hurry up and end the freaking game!! Also a 2d side scrolling-contra like shooting game where your character is flying and you have to avoid objects is a bit annoying, especially the boss at the 3rd stage.

When you're Team Ninja of course. Painfully unfunny jokes aside, Tomonobu Itagaki was certainly suffering from a case of premature appellation with his stop-gap DoA reimagining for Microsoft's original games system. Dead or Alive 4 is actually the 'ultimate' Dead or Alive game so far, but for the purposes of clarity (and conformity) we'll continue to call it Number Four.On 360 it was impossible to think that DoA4 would look anything less than stunning. Certainly DoA3 was one of the Xbox's best-looking earlier titles and the apple certainly hasn't fallen far from the tree. While the cherry blossom-strewn courtyards, Las Vegas-style strip and wrestling-ring levels are all graphically impressive, this time around it's the little things that make the major difference. The wavy heat haze on the Savannah level, the reflections of the characters and environment in glass and puddles, the neon lighting effects, the sense of scale provided by distant mountains visible from the top of the temple steps, even down to spectators in the wrestling-ring stage holding up boards with slogans and pictures that actually correspond to the fighters taking part (or booing if the fighters don't land a punch for a while) - these are just a few examples of some of the small details that, when combined, add up to a very large and juicy cherry atop the cake.Characters have also received extra attention to detail, with clothing fabrics looking even more impressive than ever before. Fur, mesh and silk are all wonderfully recreated and richly produced. An attempt has also been made to accurately provide long flowing hair for the female fighters, however this is not always successful with some odd results where it appears to flow around their shoulders like liquid. There are also some Soul Calibur 2-esque clipping issues with hair and some characters' clothing. The game also allows for photos and replays of the action to be saved for posterity, preserving forever that moment when you dished out (or received) punishment.The attention lavished on fine detail is unsurprising however when you look at the game's character models. As exquisitely produced as they are, again Team Ninja have backed themselves into a narrow cul-de-sac with the art direction of the game which now seems to have gone as far as it can and even peeked around Number Three. DoA has and always been the digital equivalent of playing Barbie Vs. Ken for adults, with characters that have an almost plastic sheen to them and with some male characters looking very much identikit aside from hair and clothing.Following criticism of the earlier games' fighting system, Team Ninja have made quite a few changes to address issues such as unbalanced fighters and problematic mechanics. More emphasis has been placed on the Critical Hit and Counter system and while it may take a while to adapt, it certainly makes the game more tactical and interesting to play. Fights are much faster (to a giddying degree in later rounds and higher difficulties) and it certainly feels more fluid and fun, with amendments made to characters like Kasumi and Ayane to balance them. This tinkering will certainly go some way to making the game more appealing to those who found it unbearable before.Scenery-smashing moves are again present and have been, quite literally, expanded upon. Levels now often sprawl in a multitude of different directions meaning fights can take any number of paths. As an example, brawling on the Temple Steps means players can fight under the archway and into the courtyard, or in the opposite direction down the steps. This in turn leads them to being able to knock opponents over a barrier and off a tiled rooftop, or down another flight of steps. Players can never be sure of which direction a fight will take them, meaning a new dimension of intra-level variety is created.There are also static and moving obstacles such as benches, trees, fences, traffic and even dinosaurs. There's a real sense of showmanship in belting your opponent into an oncoming police car (as it swerves to avoid the two nutters fighting in the middle of the road), watching with glee as they roll over the bonnet with a thud of metal and a 'plink' of shattering glass. Or much more simply, but just as satisfyingly, kicking your nemesis over a stone table, following it up by vaulting across and punching them in the head as they struggle to recover.Disappointingly Team Ninja is guilty of committing the same crime as in DoA3 (and a felony duplicated recently by Namco in Tekken 5); that of the cheap and dirty boss fight. Alpha-152, a see-through version of Kusami, is a nasty and unforgivable little addition to the game that introduces a difficulty spike that spoils the Story and Time Attack modes. Complete with a low-down, dirty, unavoidable charge-blast attack that decimates half your energy bar (something which should be outlawed from modern-day fighters under pain of death) players will find themselves (at the very least) gnashing their teeth at the vile tactics employed. Thankfully Alpha-152 is not present as the final encounter for every character in Story mode, meaning it's not all frustration and tears.The A.I. also seems to occasionally lose all control and self-restraint, with characters like Hitomi, and most notably Jann Lee, presenting a spike in difficulty that is off-putting and soul-destroying at times.There are noticeable problems with collision detection, meaning some grabs, punches or kicks don't connect. Thankfully there are workarounds as the player adjusts their gaming style, learning when these may occur. However a more sordid glitch means that floored opponents sometimes correct themselves and break into combos in a heartbeat, an almost impossible feat that no recovery move could ever produce and which feels like the A.I. is cheating. In a game where contact is everything, such activity will frustrate when, during a pivotal moment, the player finds their breathing space throttled from them and their opponent attacks instead of going prone.The game's saving grace from niggly faults with the A.I. comes from the system's Live capability. While first unveiled in DoA: Ultimate, Live's seamless integration with the 360 and its games makes taking fighting online easier and much more fun than ever before. DoA4 contains an avatar-based lobby system that allows players to fight, meet others, or simply hang out and spectate. Winning the various online matches (including Winner Stays On, Loser Stays On, Team Battle, Survival etc) results in the player earning Zack Points which can be spent in Zack's shop to change the appearance of avatars or to buy new wacky costumes for the fighters themselves. Taking a leaf from DoA's Volleyball outing, items available change on a daily basis meaning that it will be some time before a full wardrobe of accessories and outfits is accrued. Online play is given a further edge in that losing fights means Zack Points are deducted, adding that real incentive to keep winning.Although unique, DoA's lobby is not as innovative as it could have been. While understandably limited to one fight at a time per lobby, in order to join the queue to fight, players must leave and enter the in-game spectator view. If they choose to go back to the lobby, they then lose their place in the queue, making the fanciful and delightful lobby almost redundant. Far better would have been a system that allowed you to register your place in the queue and then transport you back into the game appropriately. Of course there's nothing stopping those who want to go off and challenge someone to a one-on-one in their own lobby (which is graciously donated free of charge the first time they go online), but that seems overly fiddly and may be far more trouble for some than it's worth. Presently some games also suffer serious lag that can stop proceedings mid-combo as everything plays catch up.As an overall experience DoA4 is thoroughly capable and enjoyable, proving through its latest incarnation that it has certainly evolved into a fighter that can be taken seriously and seen as more than cheap titillation or a T&A; simulator for prepubescents. While not as close to perfection as Team Ninja would have everyone believe, there is certainly enough substance to put the series back on track and offer a serious contender to the next round of Virtua Fighter and Tekken games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0000AI1KK","description":"Sequel to the terrifying Fatal Frame, Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly serves up another chapter of horror that will keep you up at night.","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Its a remake!","reviewText":"Fatal Frame 2 is a slick and atmosphere-laden game full of great graphics and spooky sounds. Sadly, it gets all of these great attributes by copying them from the highly effective first game, and not by adding anything new itself. Impressive games have often been followed by equally impressive sequels, so why did I find this one less effective than it could have been?Well, to start with, the haunted mansion of the first game was foreboding and terrifying, a deathtrap that oozed menace from every corner. Collapsed masonry and rotten furnishings gave a realistic air of paranormal inhabitance. The second game uses an entire deserted village as its location, but a lot of it is quite drab and empty, and the sense of claustophobia is drastically diluted when you go outside, as you are meandering through streets and open areas instead of confined corridors and annexes. The other reason I felt less afraid was that the ghosts just didn't cause the goosebumps I got in the first game, which featured apparitions of people who suffered traumatic deaths like the girl with the broken back, or the woman with her eyes ripped out, as well as totally evil prescences like the man with the unnaturally long arms. The ghosts in FF2  often just look like real people, sometimes attacking you with sabres or flaming torches like any other survival horror enemies, so you don't feel the chill of having to battle a tortured soul who is crying in pain. In fact one set of ghosts in the sequel is a bunch of children who surround you and play &quot;tag&quot; with you...hmmm, I'm getting nostalgic for the first game just writing this. There are plenty of hidden and vanishing ghosts to test your reflexes on, so at least that provides the same level of fun. Sadly, the control system is also still the same, and it's still awful. Mio and Mayu are devishly hard to control because every camera angle change means you lose the direction you are going in and bump into everything (which led to much screaming from me when trying to run towards some of the valuable &quot;miss 'em and they're gone&quot; ghosts). But luckily the Options screen does give you the choice between this and the Resident Evil-style of movement, so if you can't make this one work, you can switch to that one, which is a definite plus. But, once again the &quot;run&quot; mode is nothing more than a dainty trot which looks far too twee coming from characters who are supposedly fighting for their lives.Actually, the two sisters are far less engaging characters than Miku in the first game, who looked and acted a bit feistier, and had some really horrific events to contend with. Although the plot in the sequel does gradually reveal some interesting twists and fateful turns of events for our heroines, the atmosphere never gets as dark as it could due to the fact that this pair are drawn like two big eyed, cute-faced girlies with doll-like expressions that barely change, so they did not get my sympathy or interest, and were just too drippy, especially Mayu, who spends 90% of the game as your computer controlled partner and just gets in the way all the time.So, even though a sequel that simply refines it's predecessor can result in a better game, that hasn't happened here in my opinion. For anyone that is a newcomer, and likes the sound of this type of game, go and get the first one immediately. The whole camera sytem and the power ups that can be earned for it, the ghost attacks and the horrific explanation behind the unfiolding events  work perfectly and effectively in that one, producing an all-round classic game. This one is a simple retread with two lead characters instead of one, and a re-hashed but less gripping plot. Plus, the explanation of why taking pictures of ghosts will actually defeat them is mostly just glossed over here, whereas in the first game, Miku had a personal connection to the mysterious camera, which made its supernatural abilities a bit clearer.I'll balance this rather negative list with a few pros; namely that the game seems a fair bit longer than the first, with more chapters and more places to go. And at some points along the way (just a few), the ghost encounters prove exceptionally difficult. The battles are still fun, though. Plenty of tactical planning is needed, as well as nerves of steel because once again, the most effective photos can only be taken the moment before a ghost moves in for the kill. But in conclusion, I have to say that although the whole package is well delivered, and probably above average for a &quot;survival-chiller&quot; game, this time I just don't feel the hairs on my neck standing up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2004"}

Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"\"Remember, Agent: 'Skills for kills!'\"","reviewText":"I really went back and forth on this game, and had a lot of trouble deciding whether this game deserved three or four stars. As I thought about it more, I felt that even though I had a lot of fun playing it, this is just not a four star game. Allow me to elaborate...A common joke is that the first game in this series would have completely tanked if the Halo 3 beta code had not been shipped out in this game (and maybe they are right). I just thought the game looked like a lot of fun, so I bought it, Halo 3 aside. The original was not heavy on plot, and, like this second game, a lot of the \"missions\" feel grinding and repetitive. However, the first game made that grind a lot easier to bear in a number of small ways, all of which have been completely left out of this incarnation. I'm getting a little tired of developers 'fixing' sequels until they're broken.>>Plot:&lt;&lt;So let's talk about the plot, although this will be a short topic. Crackdown 2 has even less plot than the first one, which is hard to do. Now, my entire review won't just be a comparison of the second to the first, but I think for people who didn't play the first game, it is necessary to make a comparison to the first games' plot. So...in the first Crackdown, your goal is to fully eliminate three gangs that have taken over Pacific City. Reclaim it, area by area, one step at a time. You start with rank and file gangsters, and work your way up the gang hierarchy until you finally are able to go after the gang leader in their stronghold. There were personal dossiers on all the important players within that gang, how this effected that, how it would improve your chances of success if you took out every single one of the under-bosses before going after the heavy hitters.Incidentally, this tiny feature was something I REALLY liked in the original. For those who didn't play it, every time you went after an important gang member, your \"Chances of Success\" would be displayed. So if you were going after an under-boss and you had already taken out the four lieutenants working under him, your odds of success would be displayed accordingly, a much higher percentage than if you had only taken out one -- or none! So occasionally if you accidentally stumbled into the stronghold of a more senior leader and you saw \"Chance of Success: 12.2%,\" I can't speak for anyone else, but I personally thought 'Sweet, this should be a real challenge then!' Of course if I kept dying, I would just give it up for a while. It was a tiny thing, but it added a bit of tension that is needed when you're playing a character with superhuman abilities.Now as I stated before, this second game has even less plot than the barely plot of the first one. But let's face it, Crackdown is not really meant to be a story-based game. The fun comes from being able to leap fifty feet from one rooftop to the next, pick up a streetlight pole and bash your enemies, chain together explosions to cause some massive destruction, kick enemies off of rooftops, shoot out a tire on a fast moving car and watch as it slides -- and then flips over...it's an action game, completely. And like a good action movie, there doesn't have to be a whole lot of plot or character development to have fun. And so it is the case of this game. So why do I give a non-story-based game three stars if I am not taking the story into account? Let me explain...The story is that ten years have passed since the events of the first game, the original agency tower was bombed, a virus leaked out of one of the three gangs' labs, and infected parts of the population (cue 'Freaks'). To go along with this, a new gang has essentially taken over the city. Your objective, your one objective (seriously, in the game there is only one objective [with numerous sub-objectives leading up to it]) is to rid the city of the Freak infestation. You do this by powering up energy sources in groups of three that shoot some sort of magical beams of blue light, and where the three points meet, then underneath that is a Freak lair, where you have to go and defend a beacon that is dropped via helicopter until it powers up, at which point it eliminates all the Freaks in the area. You defend the area by murdering every Freak that attacks the beacon as it is charging. Couldn't the helicopter just let the beacon power up first, and THEN drop it down into the lair? I mean then there would be no need to show a beam of light shooting up out of the beacon to meet the points of light above it...Apparently the beams of light know to shoot straight down to power the beacon remotely...or something. I don't understand...but I don't think the writers and developers really did either. So whatever just go with it. Yeah just don't ask them any specific questions though, ok.There are no plot twists, no secrets are revealed, you just do this. You activate 27 energy things, and detonate 9 beacons across the entire city. Along with that, you can also reclaim 25 (?) tactical locations from the gang inhabiting the city (basically they become strongholds or safe havens after you reclaim them where you can switch your weapon, grenade, and vehicle load-out). Talk about a drag. The same thing 25 times. As soon as you start the battles, about thirty enemies immediately spawn all around you, some of which have grenade or homing rocket launchers. You better run or jump out of there and take cover fast, because otherwise you're going to get pounded and will not be able to return fire. It's a bit of overkill, but I suppose they couldn't make it too easy or it would just be boring. Either way it does end up getting boring. But I guess it could have been worse, there could have been like a hundred of these tactical locations though. ALTHOUGH, then there are Freak Breaches, places where your beacons have damaged the ground and Freaks are pouring out. Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't the beacons sole purpose to eradicate the Freak presence in that area? So please tell me how Freaks are going to pouring out of the ground at or very near a beacon epicenter. Honestly, do they think we're stupid? Basically it is the exact same thing as taking back the tactical locations. Kill a lot of them until no more come out. Boooooooooring. And that is the whole game. I don't say that's basically the whole game, it is the entire game, plot-wise. Obviously there are still things like rooftop races and road races, and agility orbs to collect. But that is the extent of the plot. Also, the beacon detonations are the only thing driving the plot. The Tactical locations and the Breaches are secondary objectives, and are not necessary at all to complete the story, which is extremely short. What lengthens the game is the desire to upgrade your character's abilities, and this, like the first game, is the real fun.The ending of the game is another gripe. So...the game ends, I won't spoil anything. And it leaves it open for...downloadable content? Or a third installment ($$$). But the way they did it is dumb. Basically they end the game where you cannot continue playing after you complete the game. You can just go back and reload your last save game after you beat it. But far from making me look forward to a Crackdown 3, I really feel like it's just a cop-out. Plot is a rare commodity in these games, so why not continue the story? God knows it could have use a change of direction...but whatever, we'll see where the downloadable content takes us, if anywhere.>>Graphics:&lt;&lt;I have read a number of reviews already about Crackdown 2 having lame graphics...but I don't really understand this. The graphics look nearly identical to the original, which is intentional. I would have been upset if the game started to try to take itself seriously and NOT have used cell shading. The game has its own style, and it's one of the reasons I like this franchise overall, because it is original in that way. I know I might be in the minority here, but honestly, can't people stop whining about graphics? Those games you loved to play ten years ago? Horrible graphics, compared to where they are today. Honestly people need to get over having things look nice. Avatar looks amazing too, but I hated it because everything in it was so one-dimensional. So basically what I'm saying is that a game should be judged by what is under the hood, with one caveat: Obviously there are games that boast amazing visuals, or where it would actually be expected of the game, and where this is the case, it can be judged likewise. But Crackdown 2? If what you're looking for is epic visuals or gritty textures, then I'm afraid you have missed the point entirely about what Crackdown 2 is aiming for.>>Gameplay:&lt;&lt;I had a very love/hate relationship with the gameplay in Crackdown 2. It seems like they made it more complex and accomplished even less than the original. I have read numerous other reviews detailing how awful the targeting system is in this game...but for the most part, it's a relatively small annoyance (But don't get me wrong, there are parts when it will really frustrate you. When I went to lock on to one of the ten enemies all firing around me, why did I lock on to an agency (Those are your allies) cruiser way off in the distance? To add on to that, when you are battling a horde of 'Freaks,' (Zombie-like enemies that try to overwhelm you with sheer numbers), I think it would have been better, when you go to lock on to one of them specifically when there are fifty all rushing you, to have it lock on to the one that is the most dangerous to you. I don't know, it makes sense to me. Kinda pointless otherwise.I had a few issues with clipping and with seeing some npc's start to descend a flight of stairs and then fall straight through them (though I had no problems with that myself, so I don't really hold that against the game, it's just worth mentioning). I did, however, have some problems with on-again off-again grappling when I would try to jump to a ledge. In certain locations (few, but still irritating), I would jump to a ledge, hang there, then try jumping to another ledge, and if I missed, I would try to catch the ledge I had jumped from, but my character would not grab it. Then when I would try to jump to it again, he wouldn't grab it. When I came back at other times though, it was fine...so...I don't know, doesn't make sense to me.>>The Silver Lining:&lt;&lt;I should talk now about what the game does right, or, to rephrase, what the developers didn't change from the original. The agility orbs. There are 500 once again, and once again, they are fun to track down. Crackdown 2 also has implemented a twist on this, called Renegade Orbs. There orbs will streak away from you, dive, rise, turn sharply -- as you try to catch them. At first I thought it was irritating, but there is a sense of accomplishment when you do mange to catch one as it slows down to change direction. It just requires some patience and a little luck. They do the same thing with the driving skill. There are Renegade driving orbs as well. 30 of each kind.The weapons are pretty cool, though one frustration they didn't eliminate (go figure) from the first game is that you will have to equip and carry any new found weapons back to a tactical location so that you can use it in the future. It would be nice if you just unlocked them as you leveled up the weapons skill. But whatever, minor gripe. And it just occurred to me that they also did away with pistols in the game altogether, though obviously since I am just now noticing this (after playing through the entire game without noticing it), it isn't anything you will really miss. The weapons are essentially the same as the first game, but with different names. I would have liked to see an introduction of melee weapons though. Since you can pick up environment objects and swing them, it would have been cool to be offered a sword or a baseball bat or something actually designed to be used as a melee weapon (as opposed to picking up a car and smashing it repeatedly into enemies' faces!). Some vehicles also have weapons on them now. The Agency Buggy has a gatling gun, as do some Cell (gang) cars, as well as a rocket launcher variety. The Agency supercar also still has the 'Scoop' ability (You can drive under other vehicles and it scoops them out of your way without interrupting your driving).>>Conclusion:&lt;&lt;My final advice is not to expect too much. I think a number of people did, and then were let down. This game should be played for fun. The over-the-top-everything in this game has to be the ends in itself, and not the means to the end of the story, because there isn't much of one. I still think that this game is extremely fun and addicting, even taken with all of the flaws it has. This game can provide you with hours of fun if you don't try to force it to be any more than it is.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2010"}

Play ping-pong, of course! So what if the world is coming to an end, there's still time to play the claw game. Of course, after slaughtering all those zombies, your arms might get a little tense, so how about a relaxing massage? Talk about a game with a split personality, albeit one that works. Now, you may say, if you've played one zombie apocalpyse game, you've played them all, but that's not the case here. Even though it's difficult to talk about this game without comparing it to the Dead Rising series, they are different enough. One of the best aspects of Yakuza Dead Souls are the characters. My favorite character was probably Goro Majima, who is happy that there is a zombie apocalypse going on in real life, so he can slaughter zombies. If you aren't laughing halfway through the game, then this is just not the game for you.The only drawback are the controls, which take some time to get used to. The auto aim is a bit more forgiving than you might expect, but the manual aiming is really tricky, since it defaults over to the right control stick. However, after you get used to it, you'll find that the game plays really well.In conclusion, Yakuza Dead Souls is like Dead Rising meets GTA meets Sega's quirky arcade style seen in games like Chu Chu Rocket and even Shenmue. Yakuza Dead Souls packs hours of gameplay into this massive adventure filled with side quests and hostess dating (yeah, meet a virtual girlfriend and eat some virtual fried chicken!). Fun characters, solid gameplay, good humor and a cool storyline make Yakuza Dead Souls worth owning.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2013"}

Oh, well, what he doesn't know won't hurt him. Anyway, I must say that this game is by far the best FF for ANY Nintendo system and the second best RPG for SNES (next to the amazing Chrono Trigger). Let's explain why!(Note: all scores are based on the time of the game's release, 1991).Visuals: 10 (out of 10)The graphics are very early for SNES, and while so many games didn't look a whole lot better than that of the NES, this one was just as good as Zelda: Link To The Past and Super Mario World. The magic effects and characters are simply designed, but once more, this is 1991 we're in, not 2005.Sound: 10Okay, so some of the sound is a little bit irritating, not to mention the occasional recycling of an effect. However, the true triumph in the sound is the music! The boss theme and battle theme have stuck with me ever since I first played it at a friend's house six years ago. There is no denying how awesome some of the other tunes are as well, but the battle tunes are pretty much always the best in FF games, as well as many other RPG titles.Challenge: 9Though it's not as hard as FFVII or VIII, it is quite difficult...but the beginning is easier than any FF game, the Mist Dragon may be the easiest boss I have ever fought, and the monsters can all be destroyed in a single hit (Imps have 6 HP!). But after that, it becomes VERY hard.Innovation: 10Of course, every FF game has to feature new characters and have nothing or very little to do with the previous. And this is very different from the first (which is probably why FFX-2 is my least favorite), the characters still have classes, but they actually have real names! All the characters prove beneficial, and a few even change! The battle system is fine, but no FF game has a better battle system than that of 10.Overall: 9.95So it isn't 100% perfect, but everything in the game is beautiful for the time of it's release. I can recommend every game in the series from I-XI (XII is coming soon) except X-2, and FF Tactics is also excellent.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"M. Ram","summary":"A solid title that takes cues from the greats...","reviewText":"I recently bought a PS3 and Uncharted 2, and decided to play the original adventure first. Even if the sequel is one of the best games of all time, why not appreciate it more by experiencing the progression after playing the first one? Drake's Fortune is pretty much the game I thought it would be. The vast majority of the game is made up of platforming segments and gun battles. Only a small portion features exploration and puzzle-solving, which is fairly simple to decipher (the clues are spelled out right in front of you). There are also a few vehicle segments (one of which is extremely frustrating), but these go by fairly quickly.Much of the game reminded me of the Tomb Raider series (the platforming and puzzle solving, as well as the jet ski levels), with shades of Gears of War (the gunfights - where you \"stick\" to cover and pop out to shoot), Metal Gear Solid (the sneaking parts, shooting a gun from the back of a jeep) and even GoldenEye from back in the N64 days (the enemies behave similarly and have the same kind of repetitive animations and lines). Uncharted melds these games and genres well, at least until the last few chapters. Towards the end, the fun starts to wane as you're directed to fight the same enemies over and over. The battles never seem to end, and there's not enough variety in the enemies (there are zombie-creatures later in the game, but they just charge right at you). There are plenty of guns and different kinds of cover though.I have to say that I wasn't a fan of the controls in the game. I found myself turning the camera or aiming in the wrong direction many times...yes, you can invert the axis and such, but switching from the standard view to aiming is dizzying. I've almost never had this problem before. I also found the cover system frustrating as it wasn't easy to run and \"stick\" from one corner or from one box of crates to another. There's one level where you have to drive a jet ski up rapids (and around explosive barrels) that's really grating and could easily have been left out of the game...the other vehicle segments aren't nearly as bad.Graphically, the game can be astounding, even photo-realistic at times. Nate is animated with remarkable fluidity and the environments are stunning. Water looks incredible, whether in puddles, streams, and even oceans. There are some issues occasionally (screen tearing, clipping, slowdown, and sometimes the base textures will load and then a second later the high-res textures will pop in) but they're forgivable in light of the scope of what you're seeing.Story-wise, I thought the quest was interesting, but didn't feel much for the characters. I know the creators wanted to make Nate an \"everyman\" with flaws and such, but there's no spark to his character or a feeling he's obsessed with his ancestor. Somehow, the big revelation at the end of the story felt like it was done before, and the final enemy was pretty much a letdown.There are collectibles in the game which unlock extras such as production galleries and alternate clothing choices. I also liked that there was a \"making of\" video included (also in high-def) that explained some of the choices that were made in development and point out some things you might not notice while playing (Nate stumbles after certain maneuvers, etc).All in all, it was a good game, even great at times...but towards the last few chapters, I was wanting it to end. Here's hoping the sequel will have more variety!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2010"}

I watched a friend play the first game, and it seemed dumb in my own opinion. I also had a mobile version of AC on my old phone. Thats it.A few months later, i researched Assasins Creed 2, and i bought it at a cheap price, thinking i wouldnt want to play it that much,oh boy- was i wrong..Not knowing anything about AC or ubisoft, in fact, i came into the game clueless. Lets just say that the story hooked me almost immediatley.(quick storyline: you are desmond miles- who uses the \"animus\" to go back in time to experience what happened to different assasin ancestors, in this game- Ezio Auditore Da Firenze. The story of ezio explodes within the first hour of the game, where he soon learns everything will change from his normal life)Anyway- i was engrossed into the story and fasnciated by the way you can climb buildings. Additionally, the combat was satisfying, and there are a variety of weapons to choose from. This game has really proven me wrong and has gotten me hooked into the AC series(as i am currently playing AC Brotherhood). I should have bought this game a long time ago as almost everything is amazing about this game.For the few things that annoy me:-As fun as the Freerunning is, the game as serious clipping issues, where you can accidently jump off a building to your doom by pressing a button.-the game has some diffiiculty spikes, as ive gone into rage before, but its possible to beat the game.-when you dyschronize(fail a mission/kill innocents/leave area,ect), you are put into a trippy loading screen where it can give you a headache over time.Thats my only compaints, but the pros conpletley outweigh the cons of this game, and has a brilliant story to be told. It is cheap enough to get for anyone, however i would wait for the AC ezio trilogy, so you can have the full AC (ezio story) experience.I cannot wait until i play AC3.Get it now- totally worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2012"}

I hear that they made massive improvements. Six months pass its release price is reduced by half and I had a gift card. So I decide to give it a second chance.I have to say I am quite impressed by AC2. Why?- MUCH BETTER PRESENTATION.The game does a very good job in terms of explaining the character development while putting you in the front seat. Unlike 1st one it is not like you just go kill and get an upgrade, go kill and get an upgrade. The game takes you through so many events, each contributes to your motive, your thinking and your ambition as a character.-VARIETY OF WEAPONS AND GADGETSAs you may have seen in the commercial, this game features Leonardo de Vinchi. This genius will make you some really cool weapons and gadgets (double hidden blades, poison blade, pistol, flying machine etc.).-THE ELEMENT OF CURRENCYHaving monetary system in this type of open world game truly adds motives to the different activities in the game. You want to upgrade your weapons, your fort, well you need money. How can you get money? By performing variety of actions, such as stealing, assassination, beating up cheating husbands, investments (YES INVESTMENTS AS IN BANKING INVESTMENTS), racing etc. etc. NOW THIS IS WHAT I CALL VARIETY. In the 1st Assassins Creed it was just like steal document, evedrop or collect flag which was pretty boring. Like first many of these events are OPTIONAL. So that is a HUGE PLUS. If you don't want to waste time feebling minor things. You have options to do so.-VERY INTERSTING MAJOR SIDE MISSIONSWon't spoil, but there are two major secret items you can uncover by exploring very nicely designed HUGE SECRET AREAS and PUZZLES.-YOU CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THE STORYHated the first one. You could understand why you needed to kill people, but could not connect the dots as clearly as you can in this one. LOTS OF LOTS OF EXPLANATIONS PROVIDED should you be interested.-GREAT MUSIC and DECENT FACIAL MOVEMENTS AND VOICE ACTINGpretty self explanatory.With this lowered price, it is a must buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2010"}

There was Dungeons and Dragons, Adventure, and so on.  However this introduced the common RPG that we see today.  The idea of experience points, levels, random encounters and so on.  This series introduced a lot to the genere.  To bad this is teh final chapter in it's legacy.Back before Final fantasy rolled around, a company known as Enix created a game called Dragon Quest.  You had one character, and you had to explore dungeons save a princess, and slay the Dragon Lord.  The idea was simple yet proved to be a very deep game.  it met equal sucess in America.  Than came the second chapter in the series where where the psrty expanded to three characters, and the spell system grew and the wrold to explore was literally 4x as large as the first game.  Than came a the third chapter which introduced the job system and the world still grew.  than came the fourth chapter near the end of The NES life and without a doubt the most succesful statewise.  Expanding into 5 chapters with a party of around 6 charcter basic and than an additional 8 cahracters to assist you throughout the game.  than the SNES rolled around and they didn't release Dragon warrior 5-6 state side, which hurt tham financially.Now we have # 7 and although it is not the best, it is a powerful testament to their legacy.Dragon Warrior 7 revolves around a young man and his two friends who discover teh secret to the small ruin on their small island, in fact the only island in the world.  Soon they discover that the world is indeed larger and through their quest they bring back cities lost due to the dreaded Demon Lord.the game play is basic Dragon Warriro.  You build levels to get stronger.  You buy better armor for higher defense.  But a few things have changed.  the most obviouse being going 3D.  Which case the Camera system is easy to utilize.the job system also expanded.  You have mulitple jobs (not accessed until later) and you gain levels in that job through battles.  But not weak creatures.  YOu fight creatures of your current or slightly less level and ou build up experience there and you grow in there.  With each level you learn new skills until you master it and than you step into another job.  than you can learn monster jobs and learn skills some specified to monsters only, and others not.I won't give away any details on the fun factor and challenge this game holds but I guarentee that this game is worth owning if you are and RPG fan.

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

Walls of text, generic task, no possibility of death or challenge, move on. It's fun a single time to consume and forget but not to revisit, which is starting to irk in an alt-encouraged game.Battlegrounds never got the shot in the arm they were promised... again. Gear grinds are still through the roof, classes are still too homogenous and possess too much of everything, etc.Basically, it's Cataclysm 2.0. If you like Cataclysm, and it's fine if you do but it's not for everyone, then I'd recommend it. If you don't, I'd avoid it, simple as that.What, I'd personally want, in future WoW:1.) A new, branching form of progression you can be highly challenged in with small groups. Raiding needs to cease being the be all end all2.) A total crafting revamp. Crafting really needs some purpose and excitement, this is something that's never really been legitimately good, and it's a shame.3.) Class abilities compacted, down from 4-5 bars to 2-3 bars, tops. This genre is outright broken in it's situational ability bloat, when a single sub-genre is forcing the development of 12+ button mice, it's a problem.4.) No more dailies unless they can engage and challenge, stop with this trash, it's literally daily chores, only not as fun. I'd honest to god rather wear a bracelet that could sense I loaded my dishwasher and give me points for it.5.) More cooperative leveling and less text, difficulty selection for quests, more non-linearity and less giga-quest lines.6.) Better progression for BGs. Entry level battlegrounds with supplied gear to gear up with, then moving on to ranked battlegrounds with another tier of gear and rewards, then group based ranked battle grounds where you can go in with smaller teams.Basically, I want the core of the game finally built upon again and retuned. The current staff is doing a wonderful job on certain areas, and polish and niche features but the core has been left out to dry since...arguably TBC, although some of WOTLK got the hint.Apparently Rob Pardo is returning to WoW development next expansion, but it may just be in a smaller role, sadly.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2012"}

{"product_name":"B008CP6RWU","description":"","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"A Journey you'll never forget","reviewText":"JourneyI just finished my first playthrough last night, and it was truly on of the most beautiful experiences I've ever enjoyed, not just in video games but in any artistic medium. Trying to sum up Journey in a few words feels both easy and difficult. It is so simple yet so incredibly rich and stunning at almost every moment. The game design in particular is simple enough for anyone to pick up and thoroughly enjoy whether they have never played a video game or are a veteran, yet it never loses that element of wonder and rapture as it draws you further along in completing your journey. The graphics are phenomenal, and I do not mean in terms of realism but just raw artistic beauty. From the way the sands glimmer in the sun to the flow of your scarf and cape with the winds, you cannot help but get drawn in to the sprawling world laid before you.One of the best gameplay elements is integration with other lone wanderers along the path. With nothing more than a musical note to communicate, there is a wonderful bond that forms with a complete stranger in this beautiful yet connected world. This is the first time I've found myself waiting for a complete stranger to catch up, have someone help me across a difficult jump, and the first time I've found myself searching for my partner and them for me when we get separated. Whenever I needed help or they did, we immediately rushed to each others aid. This is the first time on any game where I have enjoyed forming this brief but powerful relationship, and it always felt natural. I knew that we didn't have to help each other, and we could have gone our separate ways but we didn't. My partner became the first playstation 3 player that I've added as a friend in years.What deserves particular note for helping this game truly connect with me was the soundtrack. It is truly on another level, and is well-deserving of the accolade in being the first video game soundtrack nominated for a Grammy award. I am listening to the soundtrack in fact as I write this review, and has a way of teasing out and evoking such strong emotions as you lay back and enjoy it. This is probably the second video game soundtrack I plan to purchase for myself - the first being that of Flower. Overall, I cannot recommend playing Journey enough, it is absolutely one you will never forget and certainly one you will recall very fondly in the years to come.FlowerThe previous title by thatgamestudio before Journey, and it does not disappoint either. Flower tells the story of a flower petal as you help guide it along its way to connect with other petals in the land. I know that at face value it seems incredibly simple with no real story to tell, but there is so much more to it if you give it a chance. The gameplay is built around fully utilizing the six-axis aspect of the playstation 3 controller, and it is the first true implementation I've seen of that feature. It makes guiding your flower petal feel both natural yet engrossing, and without knowing it you'll find yourself being drawn further in as you try to keep building your trail of flower petals.I was trying to figure out what key element really brought Flower together, and that is the soundtrack. I first played Flower after a tough day at work when I was feeling frustrated, and within the first few minutes I could feel all of the tension melt away and felt like I was in a blissful state. The soundtrack goes a long way to help you transition to this state, and is exactly why I purchased the soundtrack for this game - the first time I have ever done so for a video game. I never expected a game about a flower petal could be this involving, but it was and it made me more optimistic about where video games can still yet go. That this work led to Journey is very evident, but Flower is a wonderful game in its own right that you should absolutely play and enjoy on its own merits aside from its relationship with Journey.FlowHave yet to play Flow, so I won't comment on it until after I do.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0002CHIWO","reviewerName":"Alabaster Jones \"perpenhopher\"","summary":"3 1/2 stars.  Part Masterpiece and part mess.","reviewText":"Here goes another attempt at reviewing an old game that isn't even on the market anymore.  That's what I hate about consoles...  the games are so disposable, most of these games will be forgotten, while a lot of the great classic PC and arcade games are still being sold and talked about today.Anyway.. Baten Kaitos..My experience with video game RPGs goes back to the NES game called Dragon Warrior.  I remember that game fondly as it was the most time I'd ever spent on a game to that point, and the emphasis on exploring and customizing your character was something that really appealed to me.  I've played a hell of a lot of them since then, including Chrono Cross, which was made by the same company that made this game.  Chrono Cross is a great RPG and it was the sequel to my all time favorite RPG, Chrono Trigger for the SNES.  So, with that in mind, I really wanted to like this one.The thing that separates this game from the others is the lack of customization options and the really odd battle system.  I will be complaining about the battle system toward the end, so stay tuned.What's good about this game?  A lot.  The story is very well told, the characters are interesting (except for Lyude, who is really just annoying), and there is a lot of random humor sprinkled throughout.  Humor is very important in a game like this, where you spend close to 1/3 of the game reading text and getting the story.  It's nice to have a laugh once in a while what with all the cheesy sentimentality that the characters in RPGs are so fond of spewing.There is definitely a LOT of text to scroll through in this game.  I swear at one point I encountered about 15 solid minutes of cut scenes with characters just talking and talking and talking.  Most of the time, I didn't mind it, because the story is interesting enough to keep you going.  However, the placement in game of some of these cut scenes is a little bit on the ridiculous side, because there are sometimes very very long cut scenes right before a boss battle, which means if you lose the battle, you're going to have to sit through the cut scene again before you can retry the boss.  To make it even more annoying, there are times when you have to sit through another really long cut scene (or series of cut scenes, as this game is fond of doing) before you can finally save.All of this would be minor if not for the way the battle system works.  I'm sure that if you're reading this, you know something about it.  It's card based.  Each member of your party can hold a certain number of cards that determine how they attack and defend in a battle.  Also, for each turn in a battle, you can only use a few randomly selected cards at a time.  This system is really fun and interesting in the beginning stages of the game, but very quickly starts to show its limitations as the enemies get tougher.  In your attack rounds, you will very often find that you have only defensive cards available in your hand, which means you can either do nothing or discard.  Discarding means you can throw off some of your active cards (which are usually healing items when you're in this position), or discard ONE of your inactive cards.  As soon as you use an inactive card, your turn ends.  I can't count the number of times that I've ended up with a handful of the exact wrong type of card at any given time.  When this happens, it basically means you lose a turn.  Alternatively, when you're being attacked, you will often find yourself with a hand full of offensive cards.  Many of the melee weapons can be used defensively as well, but if you use them, you're likely to find yourself without any cards to attack with in the next round.  I can tell you right now, when either of these starts happening in the middle of a tough fight, it is NOT FUN!The card system is a great idea, but is very very flawed at its heart.  It's a shame, too, because I really did enjoy playing through this game for the most part.  There was one time in particular when I was in a boss battle, and was getting seriously screwed with the card shuffle.  It took me 5 hours to get past it.  I swear to God.  Then, when I finally did get past it, I had to fight the exact same battle AGAIN because of the way the story goes.  I almost threw the controller through my TV screen.  Luckily, I got a better deal in the second battle, and after a 30 minute fight and another 10 minutes of cut scenes, I could finally save.I hope I'm making myself clear here.  I like the game, and it's got a great story that will ease the pain of spending hours and hours of your life fighting the same enemy, but this is for the hardcore only.  Most normal people would have turned the game off halfway through and never thought of it again.  I think maybe I should have done that too, but I'm I'm not ashamed of myself that I didn't.Baten Kaitos:  3 1/2 stars.

The last Dragon Quest game to make it to America it was all but ignored because of its far behinde-the-curve 2D graphics and out-dated gameplay. Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King has the same tired NES style gameplay people were complaining about last time, but its wrapped up in shiny, technically polished package so everyone is tripping over themselves to praise this old-school gaming goodness. I have to concur with the guy who said Dragon Quest VIII is everything we hated about old school, but I have to add its everything we hate about new-school RPGs.The story of Dragon Quest is a mess of cliches and poor character development. It begins in middle, with The Hero, the titular cursed king, and Yangus, a bandit, tracking down an insane jester. Said insane jester has a very evil agenda. From there you discover what he did and what he plans to do. If you've ever played an RPG before, you should know how it goes. What I really dislike about the story is that so little time is spent on stuff relating to the main plot. Everywhere you go you have to do worthless quests for NPCs to advance. And that means that the NPCs history and problems will be conveyed to you through cut-scenes, so many cut-scenes. In general I like the extra cinematic flair cutscenes can bring to a game, but Dragon Quest doesn't seem to clue into the fact that its story is not that great from the beginning.The battles, the meat and potatoes of an RPG, represents why I never liked Dragon Quest back in the NES days and why I don't like it now. As people have mentioned, Dragon Quest is stingy. It makes you work hard for everything, gold, experience points, stat increased at level up. Dragon Quest isn't so much difficult as it is a time sink. You have to devote many hours to the task of leveling up, a task that becomes more and more time-consuming the deeper you get into the game. That isn't to say there is no fun to had in this game, its just that this shallow game play gets really old really fast somewhere after the 50 hour mark. I say shallow because the game requires no strategy at all. Its a strictly menu based battle system that is very limited in the number of skills you are allowed to have. Surviving the various lengthy dungeons is similar to an endurance test. Its just a matter of being at the proper level and not wasting your resources until you get to the end.Dragon Quest is undeniably a great looking, great sounding game, but I imagine that the graphical upgrade and the Square-Enix name is what is garnering all this near universal praise. I imagine this will be one of those blockbuster titles that has everyone swinging from chandeliers at first, but after a year or two it will become really cool to criticize. I just love to be a trend setter.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2006"}

{"product_name":"B004X56OU8","description":"","reviewerName":"Distant Voyageur \"Nicholas Computer\"","summary":"Just like old times! The best Sonic game since the Sega Genesis era!","reviewText":"I remember full-well the magic and feel of the original 1991 Second the Hedgehog Classic. Much of my leisure time was invested in that game and the music, bright colours, and adventurous levels, along with entertaining characters made for a game that more than 20 years later, remains among my all-time favorite video games. I would eventually go onto &#34;Sonic The Hedgehog 2&#34;, &#34;3&#34;, &#34;Knuckles&#34; and even &#34;Sonic Spinball&#34; all of which carved their own niche in my universe.&#34;Sonic 3D Blast&#34; though, while good, I thought was where to a greater or lesser degree the series began to show some cracks in consistancy.Eventually, as all consoles did, the Genesis Era came to an end around 1997 or early 1998 and I tuned out for years afterward. In 2003, I went on to the Gameboy Advance &#34;Sonic Advance&#34; games and the newer appearance for Sonic came about. It took me some time but those games were fun to play, although they fell a bit short of the originals.Then there were some duds like the 2006 game that for some reason was missing some magic, and that god-awful 'remake' of the original classic that was released on Gameboy Advance was virtually unplayable. I was become worried that the franchise was about to fade into the history book.Fast-forward to 2011 and low and behold! We have a game called &#34;Sonic Generations&#34; and WOW! This game is fantastic and pays a marvelous tribute to the original classic version of our beloved Blue Hedgehog, while also maintaining the current-day version of him.In this game, the 'classic' Sonic found his universe intermingling with the 'future' Sonic as they encounter mysterious 'time holes' caused by a mysterious force of evil that has the ability to travel between universes. As in previous games battle 'their' hated archnemesis Dr. Robotnik/Dr. Eggman who aims to utilize this mysterious evil force to establish domination across these universes after all colour is stripped from their respective 'realms' leaving them lifeless 'white spaces'. Now the two 'Sonics' must team up to stop Robotnik/Eggman and restore their 'realities' back to normal again.With the two Sonics, the very best of both worlds are brought together onto the Xbox 360 with the ability to alternate between the 2D Classic Sonic with 2D style platform gameplay, and the 3D 'Current' version of Sonic and utilizing 3D gameplay, both of which are required in order to beat Robotnik. The graphics are gorgeous and must I say it, the music is FANTASTIC! Not since &#34;Spinball&#34; or &#34;Sonic and Knuckles&#34; did I deliberate let Sonic lose lives just to dance to the background music. The music for some of the Bonus Challenges rank right up there with the best of the Sega Genesis-era music.Some of the levels are a bit ludicrious, especially some of the challenge stages but overall, the plot is great, the gameplay is also great, and the overall magic of Sonic The Hedgehog is back with a vengeance. Sega has definately created a lot of stinkers in the last few years of gaming but with &#34;Sonic Generations&#34;, this is Sega's redemption and overall, I rank this game as my favorite Sonic game since &#34;Sonic & Knuckles&#34;.My only major gripe is that Sonic, in his 2 and 3D versions is the only playable character. Perhaps a future sequel, if there ever is one, can utilize the other characters down the road. Anyway, for what it is, &#34;Sonic Generations&#34; is hands down the best Sonic game in the last decade, and is right up there with the Genesis-era games. Highly recommended!On a side note, I rank Dr. Eggman/Robotnik as the greatest archvillain ever created.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2013"}

Without doing any of the \"Bonus\" games, this was twice the play time as Curious Village.* The graphics are just as good if not a little better. There are cutaways of movie-like scenes as well as the traditional dialogue scenes, some with voice overs, some without.* The puzzles offer a variety of simple to very challenging. There is a terrific selection of puzzle styles, sure to please all ages.* Hint coins are still readily available with the option of buying up to three hints per puzzle.* Puzzles are everywhere and seem to be just the right mix of puzzle to story/dialogue ratio.* There is a huge improvement to the puzzles with the addition of a MEMO mode. Memo mode allows you to see the puzzle (slightly faded back) and have a scratch pad to make notes or work through the puzzles. This mode holds your notes as you go back and forth from the puzzle to memo again so your notes stay intact.* The storyline is much more enjoyable and the scenery changes often enough (multiple villages, trains, etc.) so you are not traveling back and forth to the same spots over and over.* The introduction of puzzles into the dialogue is a little more natural whereas in Curious Village when you needed to do a puzzle, the character intros to give you the puzzle were much more forced.* The mini games include exercising a hamster (amusing), rebuilding a camera (interesting), brewing tea with different ingredients, as well as the old trunk standbys of a journal, mysteries list, and puzzle index. There is also a 'locked' diary.* The music is fine and doesn't seem to get annoying but the fake English accents are still pretty bad.* The story ends and after credits, allows you to go back to a previous scene to finish playing any puzzles you may have missed.* There is a bonus section that you can get into when starting the game that includes the \"Weekly download Puzzle\", the puzzle index (the same as in the Professor's Trunk), Layton's Challenges which include some more difficult puzzles that progressively unlock the more you complete. There is also the Top Secret section including character profiles, art, music, and additional sections that unlock with clues found in the game.The only problem I have with a couple of the puzzles is that they are based on noticing details in \"photos\" and looking at them on a DS screen is difficult since the resolution isn't so hot.I would highly recommend this game for ages 8 and up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2009"}

After beating all 6 worlds, collecting 92 stars and over 40 comet coins, I'd say I have a pretty firm grip on the game. First of all, Super Mario Galaxy 2 is very, very fun to play. FUN takes precedent over any other comments, compliments or complaints I have in this review. Second, Super Mario Galaxy 2, contrary to popular opinion, is not harder than the first Super Mario Galaxy. If anything, it's easier.In the first SMG, which was also a pretty casual game by Mario standards (especially after the relatively brutal Super Mario Sunshine), I ended up getting frustrated with a couple levels and I gave up on trying to collect every star. After 3 years, I'm still sitting at 73 stars in total in the first game (I've gotten 20 more in the 2nd SMG ... in a single week). There wasn't a level, or boss, in SMG2 that was difficult to the point of frustration. The levels are very short and even the toughest won't last most gamers longer than 15 minutes (usually not more than 7 or 8).The most disappointing thing about the difficulty level is the ease of beating the bosses. Only 2 bosses in the game even killed Mario as I played. Not a single boss brought me to a game over. I beat the final boss without even getting hit. If only one thing changes for the next Mario, I hope it's the difficulty level of the bosses. Rosalina (IE - The \"Cosmic Guide\") offering more casual gamers a play-through affords Nintendo the chance to make bosses the like of which we haven't seen in at least half a decade. The kind of bosses that make you want to throw your controller through the TV set out of sheer aggravation.Outside of the bosses being too easy, does Super Mario Galaxy equal the first? It's even better! It loses the originality that the original had (obviously), but the level design is even more stunning. As mentioned above, levels are much shorter than those found in the other 3-D Mario games. Because of this, Super Mario Galaxy 2 is the first 3-D Mario to 100% successfully translate the pulse-pounding gameplay of the 2-D games of yesteryear into the 3-D visual style gamers crave today. The other 3-D Mario games were great -- but Galaxy 2 keeps the frantic energy level up from beginning to end in a way that I haven't seen since Super Mario World.Other advantages to Super Mario Galaxy 2 over the original Super Mario Galaxy (or any other 3-D platformer out today) are the return of Yoshi, a map that's the easiest to navigate since Super Mario World, slightly improved graphics, the ability to trade off and play as Luigi every few levels on the first play-through and some great new power-ups. For a game that I incorrectly thought was going to be nothing more than an expansion pack, these improvements were a welcome surprise.Despite the improvements, one downside from the first hangs around for the second. If you didn't like the controls in the original, they'll still annoy you in the sequel. I wish they'd allow you to play with your choice of motion-control, a GameCube or a classic controller like Smash Bros or Mario Kart. The precision of a gamepad is missed. I died from the spin control not registering at all or fast enough more often than I did from anything else in the game. These are cheap deaths that would be easily avoided with a gamepad.Even with the motion-control (or in spite of it), Mario Galaxy 2 is an excellent game. In the 18 hours it took me to collect 92 stars, never once did I get bored. There's always something new and exciting to see. The power-ups are scattered throughout and just when you tire of one, another is offered. The level design really does boggle the mind. You have to play it to understand how epic it truly is.Super Mario Galaxy 2 is the very essence of gaming. It, like all the best Mario games, is timeless. The game will be as fun 15 years from now as it is today. Super Mario Galaxy 2, just like Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World will be considered a classic when 2010's Call of Halo or Gears of Madden feels like an antique. And maybe in 15 years it will be available to play on a Virtual Console with a gamepad. Woo-hoo!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2010"}

The ability to create a boxer and go through the ranks, fighting some famous opponents along the way, is an added treat.Gameplay:The controls are tough at first, but you'll get the hang of it; after some practice, the controls become second nature and very powerful.  The analog stick is used to throw most punches.In addition to the classic career mode, there is a multiplayer mode and a single, quick-fight type of mode.  During career mode, you get to train before each fight to improve your boxer's attributes.  This is great: the game improves as your boxer does, allowing you to tackle tougher opponents and actually get tougher yourself.Creating a boxer and guiding his career is fun and rewarding.  I enjoy games with customization, so the ability to shape his face and body was entertaining.Graphics & Sound:Fantastic on both counts.  The boxers look real--not perfect, but realistic.  They sweat, bleed, and get visibly tired.  Punches connect with bone-shattering realism: faces wobble, knees buckle, and eyes roll back.  The explosive sounds can make you cringe at times.  The environments are beautiful and appropriate.Value:The game loses a star on this one; after fifty or so matches I was spent.  There is no sense of ranking or progress in this game.  You gain reputation with each victory, but no rank or other indication of your position overall.  If your reputation is high enough, tougher boxes will offer a contract to fight you.

It was a great system, though don't expect much as far as limit break stuff (trances according to FF9), they take forever to fill and happen at odd tiems when you don't want them to, but they don't go away when you die and last longer than 7's.  8's limitbreaks were too powerful and too easy to acquire.  9's weren't all that exciting excpet for Vivi's, which could do the most damage, just shy of 20,000.  But it is definitely one of the most challenging games as far as sub-quests and the &quot;Omega&quot;.  Omega being the term referring to the hardest creature in the game.  Emerald and Ruby were the Omega for FF7.The Game itself was great, good story line, a little leaning towards FF8's as far as the interaction between the two itemized characters.  The storyline was a lot more realistic than 8's depsite the obvious fantasy locale and look.  It was a more traditional FF as it didn't have &quot;ultimate&quot; party capabilities.  Like FF7's ability to have everyone cast a double blow of Knights, like 8 where low level characters could still manage to cast high level magic.  It had more like the class system of FF4 and 5 which there in essence with 6 and then exchangable among characters in FF7... virtually nonexistant in 8.  But it does have the original magic names... Firaga, Cura, Panacea.It still doesn't compare to the epic nature of FF7 or the great characters and multiple storylines of FF6 (where the main character was not so obvious), no enemy was quite as cool as Sephiroth and no hidden character was ever as fun as Gogo.I would heavily suggest playing FF8 before this if you already haven't.  For those who love graphics... play the earlier FF's before you play this one, definitely.  For storyline lovers... start out with 5 or 8... placing 4 and 9 afterwards and 6 the 7.  For systems...  Well this is class system with something that worked like 8's junction system except you junctioned items instead of GF's.  4 was clear and cut, 5 was job skills and stuff, 6 and on were almost the same.  It's a great game with hours and hours of side quest play and a lot of hidden things that keep you thinking and running to that players guide.  Playonline does a good job with it.  Some sidequests require you to play for hours just on the sidequest and another requires you to speed your way to the end of the game for secret items.  The card game isn't as functional as 8's or as predicable... in fact the card game could have been left out... but anyway...I also recommend playing Chronocross and Zenogears for a completely different look of play.  As well as Legends/Secret of Mana.  Chronotrigger is a great game as well, if you can find it that is.Zelda 64 fans (both of them) would enjoy Megaman Legends and that series.I would also suggest a good PS for FF8, any of the older PSx's will not perform well and will either freeze up or simply skip some of the coolest CGI's, especially since the Summons like Bahamut and Odin have great appearances.Definitely worth it, thought look out for a few new status effects and some other suprises like ATE and Synth.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2001"}

The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar.

{"product_name":"B00006Z7I3","description":"The Getawayoffers shooting and driving action in gigantic London environments, from busy streets to gritty warehouses, that are re-created in obsessive, photorealistic detail. How gigantic? One of the developers boasted that it takes 15 minutes of real time to drive from one end of the city to the other. The game follows the story of an ex-bank robber, a vigilante cop, and their battle against Charlie Jolson, a notorious crime boss of London's East End. This game will inevitably draw comparisons toGrand Theft Auto IIIandMax Payne, but its ambitious scope puts it in a class by itself.","reviewerName":"Yousaf Rehan","summary":"The Getaway","reviewText":"Well if youre wondering why im writing a review on a game thats supposed to be released early next year,the reason being that ive played \"The Getaway\", on my PAL version which was just released lately.You play as Mark Hammond, an Ex-Gangster, brought back into the spotlight of crime, after the kidnappingof his son by his ex-boss. This is where the first level starts off from. \"The Getaway\", is a story-driven,3rs person shooter game, very similar to \"Mafia\", and 'Max Payne\".The graphics are stunning. Simply superb. You can drive around London within a 40Km area, which ishighly detailed with traffic signals, pedestrians, sidewalks, real time cars(Including Rover,Lexus,Mercedes,Range Rover,Volvo, Fiat and quite a few more), and not to forget, the Police. For your navigationin the game, there isnt a map(which I found quite bothersome), rather you navigate throughout themetropolis following your Car Indicators. So if youre not in a car, then theres absolutely no way ofknowing where you are, and where you need to go. Visual effects of the cars getting damaged is veryrealistic, and so is the effect when you or anyone else gets shot.The controls is where \"The Getaway\", loses a star. The controls are awfully sluggish and slow. As statedbefore by another viewer, Hammond moves like an 90 year old man. It takes him about 5 minutes toturn around, and 10 minutes to get from one end of the street to the other. The driving controls arenothing different. The car moves slowly, takes ages to come to a halt and takes  ages toaccelerate. There is no auto-aim, so you have to aim at the enemy yourself, which is prettydifficult and frustrating.The gameplay deserves some praise. Well thought out story and well executed. Levels are highly detailed,however are pretty difficult. Player damage can effect Mark Hammond. If he gets shot too many times, then he slouchesand gasps for breath. You can increase his health by making him lean against a wall, thus thereare no Medi-paks in the game.In conclusion, \"The Getaway\", is a  fun game, but extremely difficult. Its not as fun GTA:Vice Cityor GTA, but its still an entertaining gaming experience!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2002"}

The Nintendo Entertainment System changed all of that.Sure, there were other home-based consoles floating around before the NES's debut in 1985, like the Colecovision or the Atari, but they are now remembered more for their nostalgic value than for anything else.  The NES was the first system to really \"get\" the concept of home gaming by providing (at the time) the very best of every gaming platform in terms of graphics, sound, and gameplay.This system produced a ton of games, most of them admittedly crap in terms of percentages, but some true gems are also in the mix.  Everyone has there favorites, mine being Super Mario Bros., Batman, and Punch-Out!  Unlike today, the games of the NES were surprisingly \"simple\" (in terms of design), but also ultra-difficult due to the same reason.  Instead of picking up a controller and sifting through a plethora of objectives, most NES had one simple game strategy: you either defeated the level/adversary/boss or you lost, as simple (or mind-numbingly complicated) as that.About the only knock I have on this system is how cheaply made it is.  Once your connector pins wear out, good luck trying to get anything but a blinking green screen.  Luckily, a sort of niche market on Ebay has now developed to replace those troublesome pins and allow you to enjoy your NES for more years to come.Overall, I consider this system to flat-out just be the most pure fun of perhaps any system ever created.  My video game \"lineage\" also includes the Super Nintendo, Nintendo '64, Nintendo Gamecube, Nintendo Wii, and XBOX 360, but which system is still in my bedroom ready to rock-and-roll when I need it?  Yep, you guessed it...NES.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2010"}

Nope. That would be the Sega Saturn. Is it the most fun? Nah. That's the Dreamcast. The most powerful? The best designed? Negative. What the PS2 is, is the greatest console of it's generation. I bought a Gamecube for Smash Bros. and and Rogue Leader and have wondered for years where the rest of the good games are. I bought an Xbox for Knights of the Old Republic and Panzer Dragoon and find it the Saturn/Dreamcast of its generation, with few games, but superior versions of the ones on all three systems, in addition to some fantastic exclusives like Set Grind Radio and Advent Rising. On the whole though, the Xbox left me cold. The PS2 on the other hand just keeps giving. But first...the BAD.The Pinnacle of Modern Design? Ha!The PS2 is badly designed. The on/off switch is on the back. There's two controller ports instead of four. And the original design is REALLY ugly. The first games released, and even some of the later ones, feature some horrible aliasing problems (seems to be the SONY trademark, as even PS3 games suffer from this problem). If you get a game that's available for Xbox, Gamecube, and PS2, the PS2 version is never the best (unless you're in love with the controller or playing Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2).Ah, the PS2 controller. Many people were hoping it would be a big upgrade from the Dual Shock, but nope, it's almost exactly the same. The only difference is the alalog buttons (which is actually a bigger deal than it seams, as it can be a blessing and a curse {racing games where you think you're going full throttle but the analog button means you got to constantly crush the button to fully accelerate, and the awesome Ace Combat 4 where the degree you push the square button zooms the map [sweet!]}).There's a DVD player built into the system, but not all DVDs work with it, and using the controller for a remote is absolutely out of the question. The picture quality isn't all that either. All in all, I'd say you should use it for a DVD player only if it's the only piece of electronics you own besides a TV, as just about ANY other DVD player is superior in every way.Live in Your World: Play in TheirsBut let's get the reason why you DO want one of these: the GAMES. The reason why I bought a Playstation 2 is the game Jack and Daxter, and that's a great example of Playstation 2 games in general. You see there are developers like Naughty Dog who applied the lessons learned from the Saturn and the Dreamcast (which did extremely well in Japan despite foolish American tendancies and fickleness). In other words, the developers learned to overcome the limitations of the hardware and push the system to it's absolute max, and to break new ground for every game type.The Jak and Daxter games are incredible, the first games to every feature a seamless world with no load times (eat that Grand Theft Auto!). Ace Combat 4 is the best console Air Combat Sim ever (the graphics actually rival the 360 sequel). Gradius V is one of the best side-scrolling shooters ever made. There's tons of compilations and 2D and 3D fighters from Street Fighter to Virtua Fighter.But to me the real gold of the system is the same area that made the original Playstation great: Japanese games. Like the original PSX, there's not a couple of good RPGs on this system, there's a TON. From Xenosaga to Final Fantasy, from Wild Arms to the Tales Series, there's just so MANY. And then there's the quirky games exclusive to the system like Sky Gunner and the Red Star, Sub Rebellion, and Eye Toy Kinetic (I had to mention my favorite exercise program!). And that's not even mentioning the PSX games.In the past few years backward compatibility has become a big deal, because there's so many games for old systems that no one wants to lose the ability to play. The 360 has downright BAD backward compatibility (which was getting better but Microsoft put the brakes on). The PS3 supported back to the PSX but SONY cut that and the PS2 backward compatibility is no good for certain fighting games ect, which have timing issues (for the record I've never played a PS3 except in a store). The Wii plays Gamecube games perfectly, but then again, it basically IS a Gamecube with motion-sensativity added. The PS2 got it about as right as it's going to get (sadly). While there have been numerous emulators that vastly improved the graphics of the PSX by simply smoothing the graphics, the PS2 gives the graphics exactly as they are. For what it's worth the emulation has no issues except a VERY few games that are incompatible. Bravo, SONY. I could wax poetic about how the PSX has a totally awesome library of games, but that's another review.As far as imports go, the PS2 is one of the most unfriendly systems ever made. If you want to play that spiffied-up version of Nights into Dreams, or Thunder Force VI, or perhaps the awesome Macross arcade game by Sega, you may want to buy a Japanese PS2. Bummer.Moving On Into the FutureSONY wants you to move on to the next console generation, but makes it silly to do so by keeping the price of the PS3 high and continuing to support the PS2. There's still games coming out for the system now and then, and now that developers have mastered the system so well, they're fantastic (Odin Sphere anyone? How about the Red Star?).There is no debate here. Everyone should have a Playstation 2 who plays video games. If you've never bought a game system before, buy a Playstation 2. You won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00004U5VK","description":"PlayStation2 owners with a passion forResident Evil's  genre-launching gameplay are in luck: Capcom delivers the same  world-famous gameplay style (sans zombies) in a beautiful action-adventure  set in a mystical medieval Japanese kingdom.Onimusha: Warlordsprobably won't win any awards for groundbreaking gameplay, but the  fast-paced action promises to overload the senses with more than enough  stimuli to notice.The experience is set in 16th-century Japan, a fantastical era in which  warlords clash for control of the country. As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords.

It was good enough for game saves and game patches. I play most games on PS3 via retail blu-ray discs, so my initial mentality is to buy the game cartridges and swap in/out as I switch between games.However after buying few retail games, I find swapping cartridges painfully frustrating. I have short nails, and usually opening the cartridge cover takes 5 to 10 tries.Also after playing some of the games, it become obvious that few games now and many later will have replay value on day-to-day basis. This makes carrying an album of game cartridges a hassle. With a quick glance of games to be released in the near future, many seem to have the potential to be highly re-playable (on the daily basis) for me. I also like to download game demos and keep them around. With Uncharted takes just under 4GB and Unit 13 takes 1.2GB without patches, it seems logical to get this 32GB memory card. It's extremely pricey (which why it's not 5 stars), but the frustration of swapping game cards is enough for me plunge the $100.If you don't mind copy game and music back and forth from PC/PS3 with Content Manager, then you may not need memory card of this size.The rating of \"How much fun is this game?\" should be \"How much frustration does this game accessory spare you?\"","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}

You take the role of Alucard son of Dracula in an attempt to find out what has happened to Richter Belmont a descendant of the game's first hero.","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"WHAT CASTLEVANIA IS ALL ABOUT","reviewText":"So I get this game free with purchase of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow (which is also a pretty good game). People say Lords of Shadow is a great game, but it is NOT a Castlevania game. So to figure out what Castlevania games are all about I give Castlevania: Symphony of the Night a try. AND WOW JUST WOW. This game is simply incredible. After finishing this game (both actual and secret endings) here is what I thoght.***************PROS********************CASTLE EXPLORATION GAMEPLAY: No spoiler here, but most Castlevania games are about going into Count Dracula's castle and finding and destroying him and in process of doing so, encountering and finding a great number of vicious enemies, some really awesome monsterous bosses and awesome weapons and upgrades. Similar to other Castlevania games, this one also has A HUGE CASTLE where you, the son of dracula, can roam around structure to another doing everything stated above.WEAPONS, SECONDARY WEAPONS, SUMMONS, RELICS, UPGRADES, TRANSFORMATIONS AND ALL TYPE OF SPLENDID STUFF: While exploring HUGE castle (emphasis on the word huge) you will find great number of different weapons (swords, mace, blades), secondary weapons (holy water, throwing axe and some weird things) and relics that will either allow you to summon various allies by your side or transform you into beasts with different abilities. Guess being a human sympathetic son of dracula comes with its own advantages. Search for these items will really push you explore the castle. While some are not so hard to find, the good ones are well hidden and will require a through exploration (or use of a guide).RIDICULOUS VARIETY IN ENEMIES AND TREMENDOUS BOSSES: Loved it just loved it. I was surprised to see there were so many different types of enemies in the game. To top it off, defeating them and making your way through the castle rewards you with spectacular boss fights. These bosses vary from your own doppelganger to almighty you know who. There are so many so many awesome bosses. JUST BE SURE TO EXPLORE THE CASTLE THROUGHLY.CASTLE AND REVERSE CASTLE: Now if you just rush through the game without exploring all the area, you will not get to challenge the real main boss of the game. To do so you have to explore the castle throughly, meet certain conditions and unlock the REVERSE CASTLE, which is practically a reverse version of castle you play, but with  tougher enemies and more awesome bosses. I can't tell you much without spoiling, but it is not hard to do. You just have to know something.LEVELING UP THE MAIN CHARACTER: Beating enemies and bosses will give you XPs and level you up making you stronger adding RPG element to the game. So if you are not as skilled then leveling up and then fighting the boss is always an option. I personally got addicted to this and finding items.GREAT GRAPHICS, ART, LEVEL DESIGNS FOR A PS1 GAME: Yup not much to elaborate here. I loved the REVERSE CASTLE design and idea. Again you have to play it to see what I am talking about.PLAY WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTER: In addition to son of dracula, you can also play as a Vampire hunter with very different abilities, you just have to finish the game once.******************CONS******************SECRETIVE PLACES: While you can get map of the castle early on, you still can't locate many important secret places on that map. I wish they had some type of secret map available so one wouldn't have to rely on online guides. Other than this I can complain about the graphics and stuff, but it is a PS1 game, so judging it by today's standard won't be fair.*************CONCLUSION********************If you are new to castlevania franchise and want to learn more, this is a great place to start. It will truly give you a good idea what Castlevania games are all about and why lords of shadow is a great game, but it is not exactly a Castlevania to be precise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Nate Great \"Nathan\"","summary":"Good,and bad","reviewText":"Another Mario game, which actullay turns out to be quite enjoyable. there's something new about this, something that's normally in a Mario game, there are flaws. In almost every subject that I'm about to write about, which is sad.Graphics: 9/10Pros:It's amazing how good the grahics are, very smoothed out, with lots of textures. I tell you, I've never seen a game so colorful, so bright. Almost everything is pretty well detailed.Cons:All the colors are great and fun in a Mario game, but there's just too much of that in this. It really bothers my eyes sometimes. I'm confused here, why is Yoshi all diferent. What's going on with Orange, Purple, Yellow, Pink?!?!? What happend to Green? It's really stupid, just because you gobble a banana, dosn't mean your going to turn that color.Sound: 7/10Pros:Very well done in this game, I enjoy lishening to it. Backround music is enjoyable. A new small feature they added, is when Mario is weak and low on health, his voice will get quieter and weaker, a neat little feature.Cons:Mario's voice will bug you like crazy. When your bellyhopping, the \"hah\" noise is very distrating and annoying that I could round kick him in the throat so he couldn't say anything. The most downright annoying thing in this game, are the island fatties. When you talk to them, instead of giving you advise, they might say something like \"Oh, I love the sunset tonight,\".Gameplay: 5/10Sometimes I'll get a speed nozzle, spray the fatso's in the pants then I'll flee, with the speed nozzle, that's how annoying they are, you know, I think that the designers of this game ran out of ideas very quickly, because Mario's mission is to collect all the shine sprites (what happend to stars?). 20 of these sprites are in the hands of these fools on the island. It's really ridiculous. The levels are downright terrible, and you can only go for 1 shine at a time, were in SM64, you could get for 4 stars if you felt like it. It's rare that you'll be stomping anything, and the only point in doing so is to collect coins for health. Another thing about the levels, their all the same, nothing's defferent about any of them. SM64 we got volcano, desert, water worlds and SMS, we have paradise, that's it. Oh, there's a park of paradise, and a hotel of paradise, forgot to tell you that.Secrets/Unlockables: 6/10They put alot of this stuff in this game, 1/3 of the sprites are Secret. One thing I hate about this game, the blue coins. First off, it seems pretty neat, but when you discover that you need to get blue coins to help collect every single sprite, this turns into a hassle. Enough about all the bad stuff, let's talk about the nozzles. There are 3 types, a hover (makes you hover in air for a few seconds), a rocket (you can soar high in the air) and a speed nozzle (you can go 5x faster then you normally run). This gave the game some taste. The rocket nozzle helped me unlock 3 hidden sprites (which is actullay pretty good) and the speed got me about 7 hidden shines.Contorls: 8/10I don't know why people find the controls slopply, I say it works out well, very easy to learn too. Aiming the spray nozzle is tricky like 1 star people said, but it just takes a little practice to get good at it. The camera controls are very disrupting, sure you can move the camera, but if your in a certain spot, the camera won't move a notch.Overall:6.5/10The game is very enjoyable, but they changed the story a little to much to call it a Mario game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2005"}

It crashes every hour or so and once it does it many times will not load up again and you have to back up some number of saves to find a working starting point.I am a die hard Fallout fan.  I was ticked when I heard that Bethesda was going to do the game because I knew that meant FPS and not the fallout I wanted.  But I found a good deal online on the game so I got it anyway.  WOW!  I feel sorry for any Fallout fan that does not try it.  Yes, it feels a lot like a FPS but I do not get the \"motion sickness\" I remember from the DOOM days.  Boy is it fun too.  As I contemplate it, I find that this is a most appropriate sequel.  Here is a summary of the good, the bad, and the ugly.The GOOD:1) plenty of questing and subplots, many quests have depth to them.  Its both quality and quantity.  There is easily two orders of magnitude in questing and game locations as compared to Fallout and Fallout 2.2) good visuals, VATS is great, IT IS NOT what some were calling a \"half baked attempt at turned based combat\".  It is an integral part of the experience.  And the physics engine (gravity/motion etc.) works pretty well too.  There is nothing like decapitating an enemy and then watching the head take 15 seconds to roll and bounce down a big hill (cool!).  You will also like it when you get a critical kill, and three or four seconds later you hear \"kaplunk\".  You think \"what was that\" then realize it was the body parts you blasted off the mutant, falling into the water around you (hehe).3) new badguy types introduced into the game over time.  Yes, I know, go for the head shot critical.  But this only works 50% of the time.  The rest of the time you will need a strategy other than or in addition to \"combat shotgun to the head\".  To survive, you will have to use cover a lot (don't underplay SNEAK skill, it makes a difference in this game).  Also consider shooting to disarm your apponent when they have you way out gunned.4) nice balance of weaponry: not all weapons are equally effective against all foes.  You will have to conserve your ammo for though you can always find ammo, not all ammo types are plentiful at all times.  You won't feel good when you hear the \"click click\" of an empty cartridge in the middle of combat.  This means you will need skills with multiple weapons types and multiple strategies to go with them.  Do not underestimate the value of a good solid club against the right opponents.  Besides, don't you want to see what the Abraham Lincoln Repeater can do?  After all, trying each different weapon type to see what it kills and how it kills it, is part of the fun.5) skills and perks have changed emphasis a little: this is actually good, because it means some skills and perks that were ignored in Fallout and Fallout 2 can actually impact gameplay and character development in Fallout 3.  There will always be plenty of killing (this is a FPS in many respects after all), but you can't kill if your gun don't work so you will be using REPAIR skill often, and you get an guaranteed critical if your first shot is in SNEAK mode plus your aim is better, so why not use it.  There are clearly two alternate aspects to character development, combat ability, and NPC interaction.  It is just not clear how different the dialog and hence the game would be if someone put more into the second rather than the first.  I will wager for example that few will take \"Child at Heart\" perk.  I haven't.  I wonder what kind of conversations I am missing.The BAD:1) Perks are somewhat unbalanced: for example, the Explorer perk should come early on (maybe as a reward for some big quest?) so that we can explore the game more fully during regular game play.  I suspect this comes at the end of the perk list because developers did not want to have quests end early because the player did them out of sequence somehow?  Not sure.  Just seems a shame that we have to wait till the end of the game for it.2) Character looks to be limited to 20 levels: This means that you can't have all level 20 perks.  You get only one of them.  Everyone takes Grim Reaper's Sprint so why bother with the others.  I would like to have access to the other perks too and as I said before, earlier in the game.  I don't want an invincible character, just an interesting one.3) At times the dialog is unsatisfying.  There are neat extras in places \"like the disc of you dad getting frisky with your mom\", but many have complained about transparent plot and obvious answers during dialog with NPCs.  I for one have never written this dialog for a game so I hesitate to make such judgements.  Still as I said, in places it is unsatisfying.All in all though, not much bad to talk about.The Ugly1) Crash Crash Crash: what is there to say.  This is a \"game of the year\" game.  I should be giving it five stars.  But I can't.  No matter how fun a game is, if it crashes to your desktop, or hangs your machine, every fifteen minutes, then how can the game be enjoyed.  Someone at Bethesda really screwed up.  I write software for a living too, and if I released software with the severity and number of bugs as this software product has, I'd be fired and even sued for it.  Shame on Bethesda Softworks.  I really hope you guys make a Fallout 4, but if you aren't able or willing to make sure most bugs are out, then your are fired.  Don't bother us with the frustrations please.  We can find something else to play instead.Hail Flavius.UPDATE===============================I installed a patch.  Almost all game crashes have gone away.

The action begins on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship, the 'Queen Zenobia', where horrors lurk around every corner before players head for the mainland and the devastated city of Terragrigia. With limited ammo and weapons available, the race is on to survive the horror of Resident Evil Revelations.","reviewerName":"S.

There was the much panned Operation Raccoon City, then there was the mixed reaction to Resident Evil 6.  Who'd have thought that the best of the Resident Evil titles released in 2012 was the 3DS game: Resident Evil Revelations?  The experience was so good, evoking so much of what made Resident Evil so good in the first place that at the time I felt it was a shame that so few fans were going to be able to experience it.  At the time of the original release, the 3DS didn't have a huge install base.  Now that it has gotten a release on consoles, fans can finally experience one of the best Resident Evil games around.  Resident Evil Revelations is a fantastic experience.Set before the events of Resident Evil 5, Revelations focuses on the BSAA. A counter Bio-Terrorism group started by Chris and Jill. Our game begins when Jill and her partner Parker, sail out to the Mediterranean. They've lost contact with Chris and his partner Jessica and their last known coordinates were there. When they arrive they find a cruise ship, the Queen Zenobia, strangely abandoned. And soon it becomes apparent why. There are Bio Organic Weapons (B.O.W.s) running around all over the ship. One of the things that made some of the earliest Resident Evil games amusing was that there was a mystery at play. A sort of, \"What's going on?\" feeling to the game. Resident Evil Revelations has this in strides as the plot is actually extremely engrossing. There's a lot of mystery and suspense. And the stories are intertwined as we're introduced to new characters and situations that can, at times, take surprising turns. The story is just all around amazing.  At first it feels a little jumpy by introducing so many different plot points, but it actually all weaves together fairly well and makes for a good story.As you go exploring the various environments you find yourself in, you'll come face to face with several enemies that are usually dispensed with your trusty weapon. Aiming and shooting is similar to Resident Evil 4. You can take aim at various parts of the body, and when your enemies stagger you can go in for a quick melee attack. If you've kept up with the series since the fourth installment then this will be familiar to you. You can also strife while aiming, but chances are you'll find it much better to pop an enemy a couple of times, retreat and then pop them again. There are, however a few things added to the game itself that keep it interesting. You'll do a lot of running and gunning, but one of the most unique items your given is an item only known as Genesis, which you can use to scan several areas for hidden items or data on your enemies. It's hard not to go into a room and use it. The rewards are usually finding more ammo or precious herbs to heal your wounds.  On the 3DS the controls were pretty precise and tight, but the use of a second analog stick makes the controls a lot better in the console version.  You can play in the \"classic\" sense, which maps out the controls to be fairly similar to Resident Evil 4.  I don't particularly recommend this.  The \"classic\" controls feel more restrictive.  You can't rotate the camera and in some moments in Revelations you're definitely going to want to.There aren't many puzzles in Resident Evil Revelations at all. There are moments where you'll have to move a few circuits around, but they're hardly mind-bending moments. It's much more about the gunplay here and there's an emphasis put on that. You'll not only find weapons but also custom parts for those weapons that will make them more powerful, or fire faster or perhaps might help them do a better job of stunning your enemies. You can mix and match all you like and apply them to any type of weapon you want.After running through so many Resident Evil games, it's a wonder if Resident Evil can actually be scary anymore. Well, not really. But Revelations has various ways of trying to be scary. The first and most obvious is the atmosphere. Especially on the Queen Zenobia. Hallways are suspiciously empty, music hits some really eerie notes, and sometimes you'll find dead bodies or see some enemies pop out as you run by. Resident Evil has been doing these things since the very first installment and it's hard to be creeped out by the billionth enemy popping out at you when you've been exposed to that for seventeen years now. In spite of the atmosphere and the mystery given by various documents you'll find through the game, Resident Evil Revelations isn't going to scare anyone. You have to give credit to the game for trying at least. It does this in other ways as well. You'll find various keys to unlock locked doors, find yourself backtracking through previous rooms only to find them repopulated with new horror, and sometimes you'll find yourself wondering if you'll survive. All this is compounded by some very well done set pieces. Early on, for instance, you'll find yourself unable to stand as a pack of mutated dogs set their sights on you. It's a very tense moment where you, the player, may actually begin to feel just a little frightened you won't survive. Moments like this make you feel as though Resident Evil is returning to its roots. So at the very least Revelations tries to be scary and give you a sense of fear. It basically tries to take the best of the two styles of Resident Evil and mesh them together. The atmosphere and mystery is inspired by the early installments while the gunplay is drawn from the latter ones. It's a well put together hybrid. Just don't expect it to scare the pants off you.No matter who the game has you play as, you'll always have a partner, and this is perhaps the most glaring shortcoming that Revelations has. The rest of the game is great and it's other flaws forgivable, but when it comes to your partner, CAPCOM still hasn't made a competent one. They won't spend time wasting your resources like Sheva in Resident Evil 5, but a lot of the time they just stand there doing nothing. They rarely even shoot at your enemies, and most times they just follow you around like a confused puppy. If they did a little more such as point out objectives or even tried to battle a little more it wouldn't be so bad. The only use your AI partner really has is soaking up damage on your behalf.  The good news is that they can't die.  They can take as much damage as they need to.  They may be useless, but you are not in a position where you must babysit them.There are a few things about the 3DS version that I do miss to some degree.  While it's always easy to switch between your weapons and subweapons using the D-Pad, I do miss that all my inventory management is no longer on a bottom screen.  It doesn't clutter the heads up display, but on the 3DS it was easy to be immersed because the top screen where all the action took place was completely clean.  It made for a more immersive experience.There are other differences between the consoles and 3DS versions of the game aside from the hardware.  For one, load times are more noticeable.  While even the 3DS version had to load new areas causing severe dips in framerate (which isn't a big deal, you're in no real danger during these times) it's kind of strange that powerful consoles have to take a moment to load up some of the pre-rendered cutscenes where as the 3DS has little problem transitioning into them almost seamlessly.  Likewise, while the console version has a lovely HD remaster you can definitely tell that it was made for the smaller screen.  When blown up quite a bit of the game looks really good and detailed, but you can definitely see some blemishes that were not really noticeable on the 3DS version of the game.  The game looks good, but sometimes it looks better on the 3DS (where those blemishes don't stand out as much) and runs better on the 3DS (where you aren't interrupted nearly as much by \"Now Loading\" screens).The most noticeable difference between the versions, however, is that the console versions offer a new difficulty setting: Infernal Mode.  This is a lot more than just increasing how powerful enemies are.  This puts entirely new sets of enemies in some parts of the game.  You'll encounter the strongest of enemies a lot sooner.  For those really wanting to test their skills, this new difficulty setting is certainly worth a try.The original 3DS version had another mode called Raid Mode.  This mode returns.  It's a co-op mode that sends you through about twenty different missions killing your way through enemies, trying to earn the highest score and upgrading your equipment along the way.  Raid Mode is highly addictive if you're one who really loves the gunplay.  You may even find yourself spending more time here than you do in the main campaign.  Mostly because it also has difficulty settings and it changes up the enemies and how many you'll find on each difficulty setting.  It's almost like getting an entirely separate game along with the main campaign.  It's very fun and being able to really customize your weapons and level up makes Raid Mode worth playing.  You can play solo or you can go online with a friend (or stranger).  The only downside to Raid Mode, really, is that the co-op can only be done online.  It's a shame that there is no split screen multiplayer.  There isn't a lot added to Raid Mode, however.  There are a couple more costumes and a new character to play as, but not a lot of additions.  Don't think you can just jump in, however.  In order to access everything Raid Mode has to offer you'll have to complete the main campaign.With the console version of Raid Mode, it's important to note that the experience is completely different from the 3DS counterpart in several ways.  The first is that there are far more upgrades that you can find and use throughout the Raid Mode experience.  New custom parts means that there are very different ways to play.  Yes the maps are the same, but all the new editions in this regard will make the experience wholly different for any player who experienced Raid Mode on the 3DS.  Likewise, there are now weapons that come with inherint custom parts.  You might find a weapon in a level that has a \"Light Weight\" characteristic.  This means your character will run faster, reload faster... but the gun might have a reduced firing power in light of having greater speed overall.  This makes Raid Mode a much different experience.  The same can also be said for enemy layouts.  If you had this game on the 3DS and you were a pro at Raid Mode the console version is going to be a different experience overall.  Especially as you go into higher difficulty settings.  Enemy layouts are also different in many levels.  The addition to being able to use a microphone is also a welcome.  But perhaps the biggest difference to the co-op play on multiplayer is that characters can now go into a \"dying\" state where you have a chance to revive them before an enemy does them in for good.  This doesn't mean you won't die at all on Raid Mode, but it does mean that playing on co-op has more benefits than it did in the 3DS version.  Lastly, there are no recommended levels to tackle a level on.  And playing through a mission at these levels (or lower) rewards better experience.  The experience of Raid Mode is going to feel fresh and new even to those who mastered the 3DS variation of it and that alone might make it worthwhile to pick up for those who already played through the game.All this makes Resident Evil Revelations a near perfect package of content.  The campaign is a good length and Raid Mode has such an enormous fun factor that you'll find yourself playing through the missions several times on end.  As with every reissue of a game, however, the big question is whether or not you should buy it if you already have the original game.  If you already have it on the 3DS the idea of a whole new difficulty setting and a couple of extra costumes in Raid Mode might not be enough to justify a fifty dollar price tag to those who already have the 3DS version.  On the other hand, if you've never played it before (or lack a 3DS) then it's not such a bad idea to grab it.  There is one reason to pick up the console version if you already have the 3DS version, however, and that's Raid Mode.  As I said, the experience is actually quite different here.  And if you found yourself addicted to Raid Mode on the 3DS then you should try the console version of Raid Mode because it's a completely different (sometimes better) experience.If you've never taken the time to play Resident Evil: Revelations then now is probably a good time to do so.  It's a good game that provides some of the aspects about Resident Evil we used to love so much, while keeping some of the new gameplay enhancements there to keep it from being dated.  Resident Evil: Revelations is a good game that no Resident Evil fan should miss.  If you've already got the 3DS version, however, there isn't much reason to rush out and buy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2013"}

However, there's so many bad things about this game, it was clearly rushed into manufacturing. Since first-person shooters are my favorite type of title, I hurried out to buy a copy, but I should have rented it first.The game, for all it's incredible sounds and graphics is incredibly poorly made. It uses the \"checkpoint\" style of save games, so you'll spend hours (literally) shooting the same people at the beginning of the level, only to die near the end and head back to the checkpoint. This is the most frustrating experience I've ever had, since some of the levels are so poorly made that there's no possible way to pass them except by luck. I would not play this game over again for that very reason alone. In addition, the game has incredibly stupid bot teammates (who walk into your line of fire and won't shoot a guy that runs right past them) and incredibly bright enemies (who will shoot you and NOT the bots, because they know doing so will end your game). I cannot tell you how many times I've had three bot teammates in front of me and the enemy runs right past them (without my guys firing a shot) and kills me.Once you get past these incredible oversights in single player, you'll be disappointed to find that Xbox Live play is even worse. There's a petition on the Internet right now demanding that Activision issue a patch to support 16 player support, the ability to create custom games and many other features.I strongly suggest renting this title instead of buying it. There's no need to feel the same frustration I did and then have it sit on your shelf.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2006"}

Also, when enemies drop \"energy\" or \"missiles,\" they just don't leave them sitting there.

No doubt that it's a small sexy looking device but after giving it some thought I can't think of a single reason someone should get it.Aside from super sexy aesthetics what really differentiates the PSP Go from it's main competition (the Nintendo DS) is that it's an all digital device.  What does that mean?  Well, you no longer go to a physical store to buy games for the PSP Go because it doesn't have a slot for UMD games.  Like the iPhone it has an online store where you purchase and download all your games.  You'll be able to find PSP Mini games (smaller games that you'd find on the iPhone) as well as regular PSP games such as Gran Turismo.  Pretty cool huh?But think about this.  With a downloaded game, you can't share it with a friend without giving them your system.  Also you loose the ability to sell the game after you've finished it or realized that you actually hate the game and want to get back some of the cash you just wasted on it. So the only real benefit of an all digital system is that you get instant gratification.  See a game on the store you just have to play, pay, download and play.  That would be pretty cool except Sony botched up wireless service for the PSP Go.First off the PSP Go uses an old standard for wireless connectivity, 802.11b instead of the more recent and much faster g and n.  Why create a device that can only function wirelessly then use an outdated, slow standard?  But it doesn't end there.  Sony also designed the PSP Go so that if you are downloading a game and you loose the network connection for some reason (which tends to happen a lot more on the outdated b standard), the next time you connect the system doesn't pick up form where it left off but instead starts downloading all over again.  Insane!  It's not uncommon to hear reports of three hours download times for a single game.  Ouch!  And it's all because of the Sony is using older wi-fi technology.Why did Sony choose to make getting games such a pain in the neck?  Shouldn't this, the big selling point of the device, be quick, simple and painless?  I'd rather spend the three hours driving to a store, buying a game, getting home and playing it than just sitting around waiting for a download.  Oh did, I forget to mention that when the PSP Go is downloading you can't do anything else with the device?Aside from core functionality problems, there are other concerns.  Sony created a new proprietary connection cable for the PSP Go so all you previous PSP owners can't use any of the cables, or devices you have for the original system.  Controls are cramped and the system in uncomfortable to hold.  And of course to enjoy all the agony that the PSP Go offers you have to pay $250.  That's just $50 less than a PS3!  A Nintendo DSi is $170.  An iPod Touch is $199.  Why pay $250 when you can buy a PSP 3000 for $170 and it will do all the PSP Go does and more (like play UMD games and movies).It seems to me that the PSP Go will only appeal to blinded fan boys and gadget freaks.  Who else would want to deal with all the pain of ownership?","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2009"}

Now here is my review.Graphics: Awesome, and definitely show what the system is capable of. and you gotta love the ragdoll physics.Controls: Genius, especially since there are no R3 and L3 buttons on the device. the screen is used mainly for grenades and other non-frequent devices which save the buttons for the good stuff. Sprinting is handled like Gears of War, and locking to the walls is handled by pressing the &#34;o&#34; button. Melee is the Square, and Triangle switches your weapon. grenades are handled with the screen.Gameplay: aside from adjusting to the discomfort of the device itself (so I bought trigger grips from PDP, which infinitely solve this) the gameplay is fast and furious. it is smooth, and you forget that you are playing a handheld.Multiplayer: It works, and it is awesome. however, only 2 players co-op, and no deathmatch.Story: Well, here is where things get bad when it comes to the game. but its also good. The game as far as I know, doesnt tell a cohesive story, but its ok, because Unit 13 is like G.I.JOE. many missions, many requirements, and each mission has its own storyline/plot. the voicework sells the badass-ness of the characters. There is no Cobra, but the characters are everything you want, and span all of the races. this is what army of 2 should look at. The Missions are pretty cool, from stealth to assassination to all out gun fights. the levels are a great size also.Sound and Music: They are great. Action packed music, and pretty clear gun sounds.The only negative impact of any game like this is the fact that when you only have a few games to play that are this good, yo only play those games, and you get bored pretty fast if you play them too much.

For one Sony has made it much easier for people to not have to get up every time they want to turn the PS3 on or off.  That is what the PS button is for.  Secondly they have changed the L2/R2 buttons and made them triggers.  These triggers take getting used to.  Generally the L2/R2 or what was referred to as shoulder buttons were rarely used.  Except maybe in a shooting game.  Now these triggers have a starring role in racing games.  For many years I have been accoustomed to the X button representing throttle.

The sticks were tacked on in response to Nintendo's innovative thumbstick for the Nintendo 64, and they're STILL tacked on.  Your left thumbstick, which is the primary control, is unnaturally low.  The distance from the \"triggers\" to the thumbstick is too far.  My 7 year old can play the XBOX and Gamecube conrollers, but complained within minutes of his hands hurting while trying to play Formula 1 on the PS3.  Also, I'd like a little more resistance in the sticks--after going back to the XBOX controller they almost felt too stiff in comparison, so maybe there's a happy medium.Which brings me to the triggers . . I think the level of control with the XBOX triggers is more precise.I never thought a controller could weigh too little, but this one does.  I'd prefer the heft of most the other controllers, which comes from having rumble feedback and larger batteries to run the rumble.On the plus side, you can charge it with a standard USB cable, without having to buy the \"play and charge\" kit that Microsoft sells.  Also, it's more intuitive getting it connected to your console.I understand that controllers are a matter of personal preference--and if you've played hours on the PS2 then  you're probably going to love the PS3 controller.  But I think an objective look at it would conceded that they should have evolved--the XBOX controller has evolved twice since \"the duke\" came out originally.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2008"}

{"product_name":"B003Q53VZC","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"Great Single Player Campaign, But Too Short","reviewText":"Homefront came out and received mixed reviews from both gamers and paid critics alike. Is it really as mediocre as some have said? No, not really. The multiplayer is certainly on the mediocre side, but it does offer some nice features; however, the star of the show in Homefront is the single player campaign. Yes, it's over a bit too soon, as it only lasts like 4-5 hours, but it's a pretty great 4-5 hours. Homefront is really about building atmosphere and tension. In some ways it reminds me of games like Bioshock or Metro 2033, because it really builds the setting through in-game storytelling that doesn't hit you over the head with cutscenes to tell the narrative. Instead of that sort of storytelling I mentioned, it has a Half-Life approach and it ultimately succeeds because of that. You feel like you're part of this horror.In terms of gameplay, I have to admit that it's not fantastic, as it's not as buttery smooth as it could and should be, but it's ultimately serviceable. If you're used to any other first-person shooter, though, you'll feel right at home, but it just might not feel as smooth as you're used to. The collision with some environmental objects can be odd, and you sometimes can't move in very close on objects because of this.The graphics are pretty solid. In terms of art direction and building atmosphere, they deliver 100%. The texture detail is lacking when you compare it to other big budget games, but the lighting and everything else delivers a good looking title.Homefront isn't for everyone. It's a short game. The multiplayer won't add much replay for people since it's not very good. But believe me, if you like a good atmospheric experience with solid storytelling, Homefront is a pretty good pickup for an affordable price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2011"}

The controls are the similar to the Call of Duty series but modified slightly. The 3rd person cover view works perfectly and makes the game much more interesting. This uses the same cover system Gears of War uses. Not too sure why this game is so underrated but I'm guessing people wanted something amazing like the N64 was but it didn't meet their expectations but it did for mine. The shooting was fun and the storyline didn't hold your attention for you to watch the entire clips so i usually skipped them.

As other reviewers have noted, the transfer process from the old wii seems needlessly complicated, and the UI isn't the prettiest (perhaps hire some ex-Apple for design)?  In addition, the wii u, when switching between programs seems archaically slow, but that is currently being resolved by software updates. Nevertheless, releasing the wii u into the wild in this condition is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5; it seemed odd that it came out a little rough around the edges in this way when Nintendo's competitors had smooth running systems for years.  Odd.  The games are a good deal of fun and the incorporation of the second screen on the gamepad is a nifty addition.  A quick glance at the gamepad shows you other components to the game (weapons, maps, etc.) and is pretty cool.  The graphics are also excellent on those games that showcase them (COD, Zombie U).The system is great in another way: for those with kids, or spouses who aren't into the zombie/blood and gore-type gaming, this is really the only system that offers something for everybody. The feature that allows gameplay solely on the gamepad without using the tv is awesome when wanting to play those games that not everybody in the household would appreciate seeing on the tv (Assassin's Creed, Walking Dead, this means you).*Update 4/26/2013: after Nintendo has updated the Wii U's software, I've decided to give the Wii U five stars.  My basic complaint was that the system was a little slow, but the update helps a good bit.  And the introduction of classic games is pretty sweet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2013"}

However, Remember me couldn't reach my expectations. Let me tell you this, the game is amazing, the music and story are the strongest points of the game. The music is just perfect for this game, as you are fighting with enemies, the rhythm changes; basically music follows you through the game. Story is very interesting and fun to follow. Now the down side of this game.As we know, there is no gun or shooting in this game except a power that let's you shoot some sort of memory destroyer to your enemy, and occasionally open doors and slide things around with it. It's all about combos that you use and some powers ( like perks that you use for few seconds like a massive explosion to kill multiple enemies at once). Here is the deal about the combos: since you can't button smash, you need to pay attention which button goes next in order to make a perfect combo. For example: you do 2 triangles and 1 square in order to gain health and increase power. In my opinion, it's a good thing and a bad thing because it takes away the tension of fighting and kills the interest of the player to fight. Anyway, the environment is very well designed, but there aren't much to explore. I wish I could go to stores and upgrade my suit or buy upgrades rather than just gaining them as I play. That would increase the sense of exploration to find stores and hidden stuff( only hidden things are memory packs( increases your health) and some other thing that I really didn't care about( it unlocks 3D models and pictures in gallery). Another down side of the game is that it is very linear, all you do is climbing, remix memory and fight 5-10 enemies. Don't get me wrong, remixing memory is very interesting and takes time to figure out the right order. By the way, the game is really easy and doesn't need any skill, super easy for me. Compared to God Of War or Uncharted it's really easy.The first hour of the game was just perfect, I enjoyed it, and I was emotionally touched to the point that I had tears in my eyes( One part of the game, you are passing homeless people begging someone to give them a memory, he said\" I beg you, I do anything for a happy memory, I need to remember something happy\"). Shortly after 2 hours in the game, everything becomes linear and repetitive. Designers tried really hard to keep the game going and make it enjoyable, but it's a short game with tons of opportunities to make 10/10 video game, but lack of exploration & customization killed the game for me. I recommend this game to people who like to play a game that offers: a very beautiful environment, cool story line, no button smashing, linear gameplay, amazing music, and take a break from COD and other shoot them up video games :-)After playing this game I realized why I have trouble remembering biology terms during exams; maybe a bastard student has \"Errorists\" like Nilin to steal my memory and give it to other students :-)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00BGAA29M","description":"","reviewerName":"Pikminfan \"bobsworld3\"","summary":"Knack Smaaaaash.....","reviewText":"Make no mistake-Knack is a very different type of game.  It's essentially two parts brawler, one part lite strategy.  I was pretty keen on the game myself but I could definitely see how it would not be everyone's cup of tea.  Of the three PS4 games I bought at launch though, Knack was the one I kept finding myself drawn back to.  Without going into a lot of explanation I will just say that it was &#34;fun&#34; and I kept wanting to play it even after I had dabbled in the graphically superior Killzone and Assasin's Creed games.Knack's biggest fault lies in its repetitive game play.  The first several hours I played of the game on launch day were a blast.  By day two though, the formula of &#34;turn a corner, fight a set of enemies, collect some shards, turn another corner, fight another set of enemies, collect some shards, wash rinse repeat etc.&#34; began to get a little stale and the game grew more and more monotonous.  For the final stretch to beat the game however, Knack seemed to get fun again.  For the bulk of the 10 or so hours I put into the game I had a good time, It was just those middle hours I guess where the game seemed to drag a bit.Should you buy Knack?  That's a good question.  First-forget about the ridiculously low review scores on certain gaming outlets.  I'm sorry, but giving a game a 5 or less out of 10 is only warranted if the game is broken.  Knack is not broken.  Nor is it buggy.  There are no technical issues that I found what so ever.  In fact-this game seemed a whole lot less wonky to me then Assasin's Creed or Killzone (which actually quit on me while I was playing and sent a bug report to Sony).  But as a $60 game, I would say, &#34;No&#34;-Knack is not worth $60.  The graphics for starters look a little dated (though they do get better towards the end), but there's nothing here at all that really screams &#34;next gen&#34;.  I don't want to harp to much on this point since to me game play is more important but even so, the characters and locations seem dull and lifeless with no lighting to make them pop (hard to explain until you see the game for yourself) and no real pizazz.  Knack himself looks pretty decent when he's shiny and such, but the other characters look very, very dated.  Do you remember the film &#34;Hoodwinked&#34;?  Yeah It's kinda like that-serviceable enough but not especially pretty.  Also, the simplistic game play, though fun-is not a triple A experience.  I think this should have been around $30 honestly.  It would also have made a really great PSN game.  For $30 I would say this game is a steal and it probably would have gotten better reviews.  I thought Knack was a great game, but it's way over priced at $60.  It's just too rudimentary of a game to earn the full $60 asking price.  Sorry Sony, I love the game but that's a cold hard fact.Perhaps what struck me most about Knack though was the potential that lies within it to become really great in the future.  I had a blast with Knack, but there's so much room for improvement.  There were a lot of great ideas in the game, but most of them were a little half baked to be perfectly honest.  Opening up the world a bit and making it not quite so linear would be a good place to start.  I would also suggest polishing the graphics, giving the story a little more oomph (or dropping it all together) and adding a bit more variety to the style of game play.  Do this, and the next Knack could be a masterpiece.  Seriously.  There's a great concept here, it just needs to be fleshed out more.In closing I would say that Knack is definitely a game you will want to experience eventually, but $60 for this game is way too much.My final thoughts are to wait for a price drop or borrow from a friend.  Don't miss out on this game though!  It's a refreshing and different experience than the countless first person shooters out there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2013"}

He's 11 years old and has just outgrown Pokemon within the last year or so. We don't allow - and he is not a fan of - realistic war games or first person shooters, so his frame of reference is not Call of Duty or Halo or any other game that includes humanoid violence.The game included with the starter kit is a sequel to the original Skylanders game. Gameplay is pretty much the same, except that the portal is usb-powered, rather than battery operated. The puzzles and missions keep my son engaged - the game is a huge time-sink for 11 year old boys - and the multiplayer aspect makes it great for playdates. The art is beautiful; the characters are adorable.The game is also friendly for younger, even much younger, children, because the onscreen instructions are spoken and the action is exciting, but not frightening. I'm pretty sure there are probably a few choking hazards present for the really little kids, though.Which brings us to the evil part of the game:As I said earlier, my son has just outgrown pokemon. We had pokemon this and pokemon that and a thousand pokemon marketing tie-ins from the time he was about 3 years old and saw his first pikachu. Luckily for me, because we're not a family that is exactly rolling in dough, lots of other kids had traveled the pokemon road ahead of him, and there were beloved hand-me-downs to be had. But Skylanders are different. The collectible game pieces are not cheap, and game play is different for each one. The game itself is expensive, and the initial outlay is only the beginning.So, yes, the game is gorgeous, fun, and has a lot of re-play value for kids in the right age group. But it's likely to cost you a lot more over the long haul than what you pay to start playing.Five stars for fun.

It has the same premise, you complete quests and missions in an open world environment.  And the environment is beautiful.  The landscaping in the game is incredible, with detailed forests, desert reminiscent of the southwest US, and much more to look at.  The story is enticing, and it just gets better the further in you go.  It has the typical backstabbing and double crossing, but you feel much more attached to your character compared to previous GTA games.You can also do side missions, like hunting, chasing down bounties, play poker, and even arm wrestling.  These can keep you entertained for hours.  The wildlife is diverse, and shooting them is a blast.  Hearing a bear run after you while not knowing where it is can be terrifying.  You have a decent array of weapons and horses to use as well to hunt your pray.  The dead-eye mechanic is sweet, it is basically a slow-mo energy bar that you can activate to target multiple foes, and then unleash hell in quick and devastating fashion. Overall, the single player is excellent, deep, and beautiful.  I rarely even noticed a glitch.Multiplayer is fun, as it has the same 3rd person feel in familiar locations.  There are quite a few game modes, but nothing too exciting.  It is a little shallow, but you will be spending most of your time in single player anyways trying to get that elusive 100% costume.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2010"}

I've had a few moments where I just stopped playing and looked at the scenery of the Northern lights or a sunset.PLENTY of people to talk to and side quests to start up.  Honestly too many in my opinion.  I've been playing every day for weeks now and have barely even started the main quest.  There seems to be a kind of tier with the quests, 1-Main Quest, 2-various guild quests and other semi important ones, 3-the \"Miscellaneous\" quests where you are just going to kill a bandit or something.Leveling is a little off from Oblivion, some skills build naturally and some are advanced with perks that you can choose for special abilities.There are some bugs involved.  My game has frozen up on me three or four times.  Other than that the only ones I've run into are graphic related where someone's arm is in a building or something like that.The big con for me is the fighting system.  You've got a lot of options for weapons and spells and such, but you're using the same two buttons for everything.  It's fine for a while but after dozens of hours of playing it gets a little monotonous when you're just twitching your left and right trigger fingers in order to play the game.

{"product_name":"B00005ATSM","description":"One of the most highly esteemed digital adventures is back on your Game Boy Color console in two new games:Oracle of SeasonsandOracle of Ages. Both are independent games, but when they're linked between two Game Boy Color consoles via the separately sold Game Link cable, players can share items, uncover story elements, and unlock hidden areas in each game.InOracle of Seasons, players help Link embark on a quest to recover the Essences of Nature. To do so, he must first find the Rod of Seasons, a magical item that lets Link transform the landscape into the season of his choice, helping him overcome obstacles and solve puzzles. Ricky the kangaroo, Moosh the winged bear, and Dimitri the dodongo accompany Link on this adventure.Using the Harp of Ages, Link must travel through time and space to save Nayru, the eponymous prophet inOracle of Ages, who's been kidnapped by the evil sorceress Veran. By learning new melodies to play on the harp, players will travel to the past and affect changes in the present to solve the game's varied puzzles.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"A must own for Zelda fans","reviewText":"The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons & Oracle of Ages both proved to make history for two reasons. One, Nintendo did not produce these games. They handed off it to Capcom, one of the most respected producers and publishers of video games. Two, Capcom had originally produced three Legend of Zelda games at the same time and worked to sync them altogether as a trilogy set. However, they had problems synching them so they cancelled one game and kept two in the end. What resulted was a pair of Zelda games that proved to be a must own for Zelda fans. Not only was each game worthy of a game in its own, but depending on which game you played first, it had an impact on the game play and ending when you moved onto the next game. Though they weren't perfect, the Zelda Game Boy Color games were a joy to play through back in 2001.In The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons, Link witnessed the kidnapping of Din, the Oracle of Seasons. Though you don't know why Din was kidnapped, you had to save him from Onox, the game's main villain. As a result, the seasons in Holodrum are mixed up and wielding the Rod of Seasons is the only way you can change the weather and get past places that are blocked by the changes in the land the weather brought upon. For those who have played Zelda games on the Game Boy will feel right at home. The game play is similar as are searching for items, heart containers and rupees. One major new thing here was the ability to befriend animals who had abilities you can use to progress in the game. Only after going through the numerous dungeons and defeating the enemies and bosses there will you reach Onyx and have a chance to defeat him. Once you did that, you got a password to continue the story when you played the Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages.The PROS: It looks and plays like a Zelda game on a portable system. This time, it was in color and the story was pretty good. The graphics, sound effects and music are top notch. The controls are spot on and the difficulty of the enemies and puzzle solving progressively build up but not to the point that it's impossible to go forward. Capcom did a commendable job making the name under Nintendo's guidance and instead of just playing one game, it was two games to play through if you wanted to see the entire story so there was incentive to buy both games.The CONS: While the graphics and sound effects are top notch, you've seen them before. Unfortunately, they had been heavily recycled from Link's Awakening. The layouts for Holodrum and music for Oracle of Seasons are different than from Link's Awakening but there are still too many similarities seen here. It's not a huge knock but you couldn't ignore it from the get go.In the end, this was a game worth picking up and you had to tip your hat to Capcom. Both Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages sold well despite the few flaws here. The idea of playing through two separate Zelda games that connect to tell you the entire story and the game play was affected by which game you played first was new to the franchise and it worked well. It was worth buying and hopefully Nintendo will consider releasing Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages to the 3DS Virtual Console service in the near future.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2011"}

I love a good western just like the next guy, and maybe the plethora of good reviews also helped.  Maybe I wasn't instantly attracted to it as much as God of War 3, which - in my opinion - is the best game of the year, but Red Dead Redemption is an instant classic.  John Marston is an amazing character and is voiced superbly, and as the game progresses you feel for him more and more and actually care about the outcome.  The graphics are amazing, although there have been a number of glitches that have humorously been shown off on YouTube, which are to expected considering this game is an open world-type game; that said, I've encountered characters halfway through walls or doors aplenty, and some characters suspended in midair in a cutscene where a horse should've been.  Another qualm is that while it's amazing to explore the open world it's sometimes annoying to ride from one side to another of the map, and sometimes you have to go almost everywhere before you reach where you were supposed to go because there is no clue that helped point you to the next mission.  Sometimes, you just want to complete a chapter, you know?  Overall, though, Red Dead Redemption is everything you could ask for in a game.  It's a western with a twist, and by far one of the top games of 2010 and of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2010"}

This game was the thing I was most ecstat with when I got Wii.  Everybody was saying how Galaxy is the bees knees even compared to it's predecessors.  And although the gameplay was fresh, new and the \"galaxies\" were diverse, I personally did not appreciate some aspects of the game.  Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome game and I did have fun, but my point is, it did not exceed my expectations. And for that, I was somewhat disappointed.  But let me break this down by the pros and cons.PROS-Classic controls. Basically the same basic moves as 64 and Sunshine.-The new 3D environment. Round planets, running upside down, traveling through space.  This was what impressed me most about Galaxy.-Variety.  Many gamers complained about Sunshine's tropical theme and hoped for Galaxy to go back to it's roots with more diversity.  And with the 42 galaxies, you get just that.  However, some galaxies seemed a bit similar, still delivered.-The challenge.  Now, this is a little controversial.  Don't expect to get star after star easy.  Some stars take a lot of time.  And while the game is easy to \"beat,\" (60 stars) it is a pain to \"complete.\"  While many gamers would appreciate this new difficulty, there are many more like myself who would find this tedious. I want the challenge but I also want to move on in life too.CONS-Annoying camera angles.  Can't emphasize enough.  This made it extremely difficult at times to control mario's movement.Weak story.  I can tell Nintendo tried to get a little more emotion in the story.  Didn't work for me. Too corny and just boring.  Sunshine had a better plot.-New player- Luigi! Woop de doo.  You play the game all over again, getting every star with Luigi who has pretty much the same moves.  And you do it all just to get one extra galaxy and star.  Who wants to beat the game twice just to beat the game?? LAME! Also you have to beat Bowser twice just to unlock Luigi.-Difficulty.  This does go hand in hand with the challenge, but Galaxy stepped up tremendously in this field by making the stars much harder to obtain, and if you go on the 121 star quest, good luck! Some stars took me hours to get.-Music.  Surprisingly, the music was not as good as Sunshine as well.  It had dramatic, orchestrations like from Smash Bros, or even God of War.  Just a little weak.BOTTOM LINEGalaxy is definitely unique from other Mario games, but it does fall a bit short of expectations.  What's mainly different about this game from it's 3D predecessors is less walking around and exploring and more progression with more obstacles. Like I said stars are much more difficult.  The replay value, for me is lower than that of Sunshine and 64 because of this.  Graphics, can't say much, not a big step up from Sunshine.  But overall, fun gaming experience, but unfortunately a bit too many set backs for a 5 star rating.  I do recommend this game for adventure game fans, but it may be too annoying for anyone else.  Galaxy 2 is out now, so hopefully it's better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001GGO1GG","reviewerName":"Lionheart","summary":"Not much different from the original","reviewText":"The final word here is, thin on substance, but still remarkably fun to play. As in the first game, you play a character who was never in the movie, yet somehow you're an integral part of the story, which is a little bothersome if you're hoping for an authentic Godfather-type experience. But the original was also disappointing in this respect, wasn't it? More filler scenes are invented this time (many of which are highly improbable). But if you can put the screenplay issue aside? The game is actually a lot of fun -- GTA like, except without the autos. The main task is to build a criminal empire up (just like in the first one) using all the tools and tricks of the trade -- threats, bribery, sabotage, and (of course), just plain old shoot-em-up-style violence. And you are allowed to choose the kind of leader you want to be. Do you want to hedge your bets, stockpile your assets, and then send in your crew to take over a rival business? Or just go in yourself with nothing but a handgun and your wits and blow the place apart? Do you want to take out an enemy family quickly, with the minimum amount of fuss, or weaken them slowly by picking off their made men and bombing their businesses? It's just fun to decide these things.The combat system is also not as one-dimensional as some others, and in some respects is even better than GTAs. For example, if a guy really irritates you, you can take your time in sending him into the next world -- thus also proving a point to any remaining enemies. You get bonuses for throwing a guy off a roof, or beating him with a melee weapon -- yeah, brutal, but fun. Really fun. Not just aim, fire, repeat until no one's moving anymore. There's some thought required before you directly attack a business, or compound; again, also found in the original, but expanded on here. If, for example, the owner has hidden himself behind a locked fence with his goons, and you have no one to cut through the wire to let you in, you can't take over -- you can only make the opposing family angrier.The driving system, however, is terrible. No improvement over the original. You scrape one guy's bumper, and it seems to take a minute just to get rolling again. Not fun to tool around New York, Miami, or Havana. Mostly just aggravating.The map was fine in the first game -- this one, though it's three dimensional and gives you more information, really just reminds you that the whole gaming world here is much, much smaller than in the original. If you really try, you could probably even finish this game in a day.The \"killing Castro\" mission felt promising at first, even exciting, but the player is shortchanged in the end: no matter how perfectly he plays it, he cannot kill Castro. I shot him with a rifle directly in the head, and still it triggered the cutscene where he just gets up and shakes it off. So what is the point of all the painstaking sneaking?The over-the-top violence here is just as unapologetic as in the first game. You can play your character just as bad as you want. Or be the good guy in a bad business, if you prefer.But the best aspect of this game is how you're allowed to evolve -- more money, more skills, more weapons, more family members, more businesses, more \"rackets,\" until you're practically unstoppable. And this building-up process is FUN, something the folks at Rockstar still don't fully appreciate, at least in my opinion.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

Steam is nothing but a vault to keep your games safe in case your computer crashes or is stolen. Why is that so hard for people to understand? Anyway, Bioshock Infinite is a tough game to review. There is nothing else like it. Not at all similar to the first 2 so get those out of your head. I can say truthfully this might be my game of the year right now, although Tomb Raider is right there too. But for brilliance, you really can't get any better. It has an amazing story, great first person stuff and pretty violent to to boot.  The game requires a hefty amount of your hard drive, I think 30+ so keep that in mind if your hard drive is getting full. For a first person shooter, it's one the best I've played. Unique and the way you take out your foes is so fun and bizarre at the same time. IT's a graphic powerhouse, so even the toughest machines will be tested.

{"product_name":"B00002CF9M","description":"InDiablo II, players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"Nathaniel V.

This is the kind of game that both you and your spouse will enjoy playing together.  It's also the best party game for the Wii available to date.The \"most helpful\" review nails it.  Boom Blox is extremely intuitive so is very approachable to even those who've never played a video game before.  It's very cute, very fun, and makes excellent use of the unique Wii controllers.The concept is so simple, it's amazing no one has done it before.  (The concept works better with Wii controllers so maybe it couldn't have been done well prior to the Wii.)  In a nutshell, it's like playing with children's blocks.  Make a tower of blocks then take turns throwing marbles at it to knock it down.  Or play Jenga -- see how many blocks you can remove before the structure crumbles.  Or shoot it with a water hose.  Or blow it up with a bomb.  Or swing some blocks like a wrecking ball to try to knock down the big towers.  Or build a castle fort and try to destroy your opponent's forts.  There are dozens of different styles of games all around the theme of structures made up of differently shaped blocks.  There are also a handful of shooting gallery games thrown in for good measure.The game has solo modes including an \"adventure\", multiplayer competitive modes, and multiplayer cooperative modes.  Some modes are great, some are only good, but they're all interesting and fun.  Though some modes or levels are initially locked, plenty are unlocked out of the box.  This made for a great party gaming experience, as we were able to try out dozens of 2-4 player modes right away.  The tutorial mode is also very well done and teaches you the basics inside of 2 minutes, but you don't even need it; even non-gamers will understand how to play this game intuitively.Why only 4 stars?  While hard-core gamers can definitely enjoy this game, it doesn't have a lot of depth or breadth and is a bit too simple to be one of my favorites.  Boom Blox was a bigger hit as a party game than Mario Party 8, but the latter has a wider variety of mini games so might last longer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2008"}

The presentation and structure of the game itself its actually well done, each chapter has a main quest and a few side quests, and is fun aiming to complete all of them; the biggest drawback I should point is the plot itself, once the earlier chapters are finished, and without spoiling the game too much, there's this machine called Zenith, that play a huge role on the story, and after more than 100 hours to beat the game, I felt that this title didn't reached all its potential; suffice to say I was kind of disappointed.The best aspect of Resonance of Fate is the gameplay, what makes it enjoyable is that most of the battles are difficult and requires a lot of strategy and careful thinking.

The glowing reviews were well deserved.  But with each passing day since, the bugs and stability have gotten worse.  It has now gotten to the point that the servers go down everyday.  And each time the servers go down the length of time they are down gets longer. Most of the time the servers are down for a few minutes to a couple of hours. Today it is now approaching 12 hours downtime and that is for nearly half the servers and the most popular ones.  It wouldn't be that bad if the downtimes were when most people were not playing.  But the downtimes almost always occur in the evening at the peak player times.There are many bugs that many players know about and go unfixed.  It has become the old doctor joke.  You know, the patient says \"Doctor, it hurts every time I do this\" and the doctor says \"Don't do that\".  That is how many players play the game, there are many things we are supposed to be able to do but when we do it the game locks up or crashes, among other things. So we avoid doing certain things. Again, with each passing day more and more bugs appear.The PVP(player versus player) system in the game is probably the worst and most pointless of any online only game in existence. This can be especially frustrating for players trying to level on a PVP server. There is supposed to be a system that punishes players from killing other players of a significantly lower level.  This is called \"ganking\". After the first couple of areas on a PVP server you enter areas that are PVP enabled, meaning the other faction can attack you.  Unless you have very high level players with you, you will be \"ganked\" and many times.  Which makes it very hard to level and complete missions in these areas.  After about level 15 you enter the PVP enabled areas.When you do PVP with players of nearly equal level there is no reward for winning or punishment for losing.  You also do not gain any experience.  It is pointless. The community has been screaming to Blizzard to give PVP meaning. Blizzard was supposed to have a meaningful PVP system in place when the game was released and have promised this ever since the game came out.  But, again, with each passing day, we are told something is coming soon.  We are still waiting.All things considered, with the server instability, the bugs and the meaningless PVP system I would suggest waiting to buy the game at this time.  I would wait about 3 to 6 months, check the latest reviews(make sure you read the date the reviews were submitted, don't be fooled by reviews that were written when the game first came out) to see if things have improved.(Edited August 13, 2006)As you can see the original review was written over a year ago.  What has happened since then?  If I didn't know better, it almost appears that Blizzard had my concerns at the top of the list for things to address.The game works almost flawlessly, with only the occasional down time, lags and bugs.  But honestly what MMO doesn't have these problems?  WOW now works as good or better than any MMO.Some people now say the PVP is the best part of the game and it is something that everyone should give a try, especially the PVP haters, you may be surprised how much you like it.Kudos to Blizzard for doing it right!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2005"}

Vivendi's officially authorizedThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringfalls disappointingly short of that goal. The game is intriguing enough (credit the source material) to play through entirely--once. For the cost of the game, you are guaranteed a reasonably pleasurable 10 hours of gameplay. After that, it will likely sit on your shelf.There are good things in this game: the RPG mechanics are fine (at various points in the story you play as Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf), the visuals are beautiful in parts, and certain aspects of game design are fantastic (Gandalf's magic-casting stands out). Little touches make it appealing to true fans, like when Aragorn receives the repaired Sword of Elendil, and it glows during fighting. It would be a great game for even non-LOTRfans to play, since a good deal of backstory is provided in lengthy cinematics throughout the game.Fellowship's greatest asset, of course, is the story itself, as well as the bevy of villainous creatures that provide great boss-fight material. I'm sure many other gameswishedthey had a Balrog to offer.But the story deviates strangely from the book in order to satisfy the format of an RPG game. The final boss-fight (which we won't spoil here) is completely unrelated to anything devised by J.R.R. Tolkien, and it seems hollow, strange, and unsatisfying. The puzzles sprinkled throughout the game are random and often frustrating, as is your first encounter with the Ringwraiths (inevitably, you die many times--too steep a difficulty curve right out of the gate). This game is still strongly recommended, but with many caveats. Proceed with caution and you're likely to enjoy yourself.

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"MikeB \"Metalhead\"","summary":"Rockstar does it again","reviewText":"GTA5 is incredible. Was there ever any doubt? The Grand Theft Auto games have been ambitious since the first, and GTA3 redefined open world games on the PS2. Continuing that legacy, we have GTA5, a gigantic open world game with something for everyone (except kids... keep this game far away from kids).Despite GTA4 being the highest rated game of this generation (Metacritic score: 98), Rockstar didn't see fit to rest on their laurels. Virtually every aspect of GTA has been refined, omitting what doesn't work, and improving what does. Gone are the annoying phone calls from friends wanting to hang out. You can still hang, but now you decide where and when, if at all. The driving physics, which some complained were too \"realistic\", have been tightened up to feel less like Gran Turismo and more like Need for Speed. The cover and shooting mechanics work better (though not perfect) and a new stealth mode changes things up a bit. There are tons of extra activities, like golf, tennis, yoga, off-road racing, and triathlons to keep you busy when you're not wrapped up in the story. All of them play well and feel like they could have been separate games in their own right.Of course, if you're playing a Grand Theft Auto game, you really want to cause some mayhem, and boy can you. Cars and pedestrians are everywhere in large numbers, and you can play with them however you want. What's really impressive is the AI. People in the game act like people. If you walk into traffic, drivers will (usually) stop and honk at you. If you point a gun at them, they'll try to speed off or get out and run. If you jack a car from a yuppie, he'll run away and call the police. If you jack an 18-wheeler from a trucker, he'll try to fight you. Jack a ride from a gang banger and he'll get his friends to pursue and shoot you. At one point in the game, I walked into a convince store I have previously robbed, and the clerk behind the counter said, \"Hey, I remember you! Get out of my store!\" and began to shoot at me. This wasn't part of the story, or any mission, it was just a random event I made happen through my actions. It's these little touches, the attention to detail, that makes the world of GTA5 feel real.The story of GTA5 revolves around three characters, all of whom you play as and can switch between at almost any point in the game. There's Michael, a retired thief who is brought back into the world of crime through circumstances caused by his own inability to control his temper; Franklin, who is tired of working for petty money and is looking for a big score; and Trevor, who is a psychotic meth dealer with ties to Michael's past. All three are different, but the story does a good job of bringing them all together for logical reasons. Each mission has you doing something different, from robbing a jewelry store to stealing a top secret weapon, and all of it keeps the game feeling varied and fresh while also giving you insight into the characters.Although the story is engaging, it can be tempting to get distracted and explore the massive San Andreas. There are sights to see, locations to explore, and events to participate in. You can do everything from buying new clothes, getting a haircut, customizing your car, and hitting the strip club. You can drive all manner of vehicle, like cars, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, boats, planes, jet-skis, golf carts, helicopters, dune buggies and anything else you can think of.  Sometimes a blue dot will appear on your map indicating an encounter with random people who will ask you to do them favors, like driving them home or taking them to the hospital. And just when you think you've seen and done it all, the game surprises you with something new to do. The amount of content in GTA5 is staggering.The gameplay in GTA5 is much better than GTA4, but still isn't perfect. Driving, running and shooting feel more natural and responsive than previous GTA games, but still aren't quite up to the standards found in dedicated driving or shooting games. There is a strong auto-lock for shooting, which is fortunate because without it hitting targets with any accuracy would be very difficult. Driving cars is probably the best controlling and most responsive part, but other vehicles can be tricky. Planes and helicopters I found especially difficult to pilot, even after taking the flight school challenges in the game. None of it controls terribly, and driving, boating, shooting and running all control well enough that it never hindered my progress through the game. The same can't be said of the flying parts, as a couple times I failed because of poor flying, but I wonder if that was a conscious decision by the developers to make the game more challenging.The graphics in GTA5 have been improved since GTA4, as would be expected, but the level of detail present in the game, from textures, lights, poly-models, and animations, are all so impressive I'm constantly blown away. This is the best looking game I've seen on the current gen hardware, PS3 or X360. Whether it's looking out over an astoundingly detailed city from high above in an airplane, or seeing the detailed close-up faces of the characters in the real-time cut scenes, it's incredible that the game manages to maintain it's level of detail from extreme wide-shot to extreme close-up. From both a technical and artistic perspective, it's a monumental achievement, especially considering it's all running on 7 year old hardware.On the audio side of things, the soundtrack is good, although music is subject to personal taste, and I didn't really find any of the licensed music tracks very exciting. The game also features an original dynamic score, which fits the mood no matter what you're doing. The sound effects are very realistic and lend a big hand in making the virtual world of San Andreas feel real. The voice acting, from story related cut scenes to little bits of background banter by people on the streets, is all very well done. The actors playing the three main characters all do an excellent job, bringing humanity to characters who participate in some rather despicable behavior.If you've been a fan of GTA and wondering if this is a good addition to the series, I have no reservations telling you that this is by far the best game in the series. If you've never played a GTA game before, this is a good one to start with, as it is the best playing and most accessible GTA game. In fact, the only people I wouldn't recommend the game for is minors. Anyone under 17 should not play this game, as it includes frequent and graphic depictions of blood, gore, nudity, sex, drug use, adult language, and anything else that parents might find objectionable.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000085AHJ","description":"In the open-ended space action/adventure gameFreelanceryou play a ne'er-do-well with a lucky streak, one of two survivors of a space disaster. Penniless and shipless, you venture around a space dock until you find a ship and a job. You'll encounter a heady mix of canned missions that follow one main quest, and a million opportunities to make money or aggravate the various factions that co-exist in the universe. Like an online role-playing game, or Bethesda'sMorrowind, you determine who your enemies are and who your friends are by your own actions, and, in another nod to role-playing, you can customize your ship with guns, rockets, and equipment just as you would customize a RPG character with swords, bows, and magic items. Best of all, you can play cooperatively with friends or fight it out with enemies online.The backstory posits a future where various countries, divided by both nationality and, seemingly, race, have boarded massive colony ships and ventured into a wormhole that appeared within reach of our crude space technology. They found themselves in a galaxy far, far away and they got stuck there when the wormhole collapsed. They quickly colonized new home worlds and named everything with familiar locales that make navigation a breeze. In the American sectors you'll feel at home entering the New York system and landing at a spaceport called Manhattan, for example. While contrived, this device is used beautifully and it's far better than having to memorize a bunch of sci-fi names and remembering where they are, perfect for a massive universe such as this one.ThoughFreelanceris set in space, it is technically not a space simulation. The game was designed to be accessible to casual gamers. For example,Freelancermakes you use the mouse for ship control. This is quite a shift for a game genre normally known to require joystick control. But even old-schoolWing CommanderorX-Wingfans may find that the sacrifice of verisimilitude is made up for with gains in agility. The mouse controls your guns, while you use the keyboard to maneuver around the rich universe that developer Digital Anvil has constructed. Much like a first-person shooter, you can dodge and weave while precisely blasting your enemies.Despite the game's age, its graphics are spectacular, as is the sound and voice acting, and in that way, fighting and trading with friends or alone,Freelancerproves worth the wait. Just keep in mind that it is explicitly not a hardcore space simulation, and you'll have to leave your joystick on the shelf.--Andrew S.

Some decent ones included the Star Wars X-wing/Tie fighter series and Freespace series, as well as a number of WW2 based games.  However, all are mission based, so you have to select a mission, ready the mission, then launch, wait for it to end, rinse and repeat.  Freelancer isn't like that.  Your buddies (or enemy players, for that matter), can be in the middle of selecting a mission, can be retrofitting their ship, trading goods, blasting baddies, or being a wingman for you, all at the same time, so this game best approaches a MMORPG (without the RP, I suppose).

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

Jongeling \"slice of heaven\"","summary":"No hassles, no extras - just a great gaming console!","reviewText":"XBox? PS2? Gamecube? Where to look?By now you probably own all three, or at least have in the past. But if not, and you're considering the Gamecube, listen up.The Nintendo GameCube, in my opinion, is the best console out of all three competitors on the current market. Its simple fool-proof design is the sturdiest, longest-lasting, and best looking of all the consoles. 90% of the time you will never have a single problem with the Gamecube. The other systems have about a 40-60% problem percentage. That's risking a lot for a console that you could easily spend a whole paycheck on.Who HASN'T heard the horror stories about PS2's going bad for no reason? Maybe it wasn't the laser that quit working, or just plain stopped reading discs; but perhaps it was one of the PHYSICAL components that broke, like the CD tray or perhaps the cooling fan. You don't have to worry about anything like that with the Nintendo Gamecube.So let's consider the XBox. Well, there's Halo...Halo 2...and well, I think that's about it. Sure you have the average racing games and the sports games, and you can probably store more than 1,000 CDs worth of MP3s on the unit, but let's face it - unless you're a hardcore FPS (first person shooter) fan, you're not going to be satisfied with the XBox.So what does the Gamecube have to offer? Oh, so much. There's so many secrets that so painfully few people have had the pleasure (or patience) of finding. On the outside, the Gamecube looks like a system geared towards the youth between the ages of 6-12. But upon further examination, you find that these \"kiddie\" games aren't so kiddie after all! They're actually quite fun.No, I'm not saying you should swear off \"Devil May Cry\" and fall in love with \"Dora The Explorer\", but you would be pleasantly surprised at many of the excellent titles that this console has to offer. Mario, Zelda, Final Fantasy, and who could forget the Resident Evil releases? Games like \"Toadstool Tour\" will have you laughing comically at the cute characters and their \"moves\" - but at the same time you'll be ooohing and ahhing at the beautifully rendered backgrounds and smooth gameplay. Other famed titles like \"Zelda : The Wind Waker\" scored an average of 97/100 from numerous, numerous reputable sources. NINETY-SEVEN out of 100. Can you say Wow? And let's not forget the Resident Evil series. This is the whole reason I bought the console, and for the most part, these RE games do not disappoint.So while the Gamecube may not have hundreds and hundreds of titles that the PS2 and XBox have to offer, the quality of games certainly makes up for it. The added reliability factor of the Gamecube allows you to comfortably play whenever you please and spend less time worrying about how long the system will last. Many friends of mine have purchased several XBox systems and Playstation 2's, yet they are still on their first Gamecube. It's rather ridiculous how many video game systems these days are built with \"cereal box\" parts and poor craftsmanship.The crew at Nintendo refused to cut corners or add anything that really shouldn't be there (can anyone say a 60GB hard drive or a built-in DVD Player?), and simply chose remain faithful to the gaming community - excellent move, Nintendo. Any average game tech worth his paycheck knows that it's simply too much workload on a gaming system to have it operate like an all-in-one unit. It's pretty much like having a pack mule pull a passenger vehicle. It's a procedure that's bound to fail - and most of the time it does.Summary -PROS:Elegant, sleek, fool-proof designGreat construction and durabilityQuality gamesBest value on the marketCONS:Limited game libraryNo DVD-capability (if that's your thing; personally I don't care)Only one Final Fantasy title available for the system ;-)(...)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2006"}

It's got great graphics, a compelling story line, tight controls, and is just plain fun to play.  If you have a PS3, consider picking up the disk with both God of War 1 & 2 on it.In GOW you taken on the persona of a Spartin who committed a horrible act and has been trying to wipe the slate clean and remove  his tortured visions by serving the gods.  You don't know much about his history when things start, but you learn his story in dribs and drabs as you go.  The story is compelling and it makes you want to keep going a little further to learn more.  Your situation ultimately compells you to try to defeat the God of War.One thing GOW is not though is a kid's game.  Unless you have a really mature kid, you should probably not be letting your kids play this game until they're at least in their mid-teens.  In addition to the violence, of which there is pleny, there is also frontal nudity (toppless) and one mini-game where you are pleasuring two prostitutes.  If it were a movie, GOW would be R or NC17.The mechanics are pretty straight forward for a PS2 game.  You have attacks, blocks, jump, etc.  You have to do some puzzles from time to time and there are a fair number of button pushing mini-games where pushing the correct sequence makes you pull off some cool looking cinematic move.  Sometimes these are optional and just make a battle easier, but often they're required to win a fight.  Many games have copied this feature and a lot of times they will make you concentrate so hard you miss the cool moves on screen (e.g.Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude), but GOW is pretty forgiving on the timing to press the button so it never really frustrates you too much.  Even when it was difficult, I considered it to be fair and not cheap.  I also never really had much trouble figuring out where to go next.I can't encourate you enough to give this one a try.  It's got decent length, minimal annoyances, and no major bugs I could see.  Really a top of the line title and well worth the minimal price you'll pay to get it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00CBVHI56","description":"The highly anticipated family comedy The Smurfs 2 is now a video game! The evil wizard Gargamel has created the Naughties, who kidnap Smurfette from Smurfs Village and imprison her in Paris. It's now up to the Smurfs to travel from the Enchanted Forest, through the busy streets of New York, into Paris, and everywhere in between to save the day and bring Smurfette home safe!","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"Smurfing underwhelming is the polite way to describe this game.","reviewText":"It's no secret that games based on movies are rarely good. Every now and then you'll get something great like The Chronicles of Riddick, but they're few and far between. Games with kids in mind get the same treatment if you ask me. The Smurfs 2, while I wasn't expecting anything mind blowing, is such a disappointing game that if this is the first game your child plays, they probably won't be that interested in the hobby since first impressions are everything. What bugs me is that The Smurfs 2 isn't a -bad- game by any means. No, it's just boring and insanely overpriced for how little content there is. Unless you're a hardcore Smurfs fan, there's no reason to pay full price for this game. Give it a couple of months when it goes down a good 80% and maybe then it'll be worth checking out.I haven't seen the new Smurfs movie, so I can't say if the game here follows the events of it, but once again, Smurfette is kidnapped. Though this time, it's not just Gargamel who's involved, but now you have grey skinned Smurf-lookalikes: the Naughties. It's up to you as one of several Smurfs to travel through 6 worlds and get her back. Yeah, nothing new here plot-wise, though you just need to keep in mind the target audience. The game is a standard platformer where you move from left to right, jumping over pits and taking out what few enemies there are. Scattered throughout the levels are countless Smurfberries. These act like the rings in your typical Sonic the Hedgehog game, allowing you to keep playing as long as you have some berries. When you defeat an enemy, they drop a small vial of blue liquid (I'm guessing Smurfberry juice). As you collect thse, a big vial on the side of the screen slowly fills up. Once it's filled, the classic \"La la lalalala...\" song kicks in a for a couple of seconds, making the Smurfberries bigger/worth more.And...that sums up the game in the 3-4 hours it takes to complete it!You can play through the first world of this game, and you'll have an idea of how the rest goes. Enemies will usually walk off cliffs and kill themselves if there isn't something causing them to turn around. Some enemies just plain fly away once you jump on them, almost like you snapped them out of a trance or something. Boss fights are easy to figure out, although there is an oddly fun to watch fight with Azrael the cat. For some reason, the cat can summon human skulls that he launches at you. Early on, Gargamel will show up at the mid-point of the stage and simply mock you, then shoot some very slow moving fireballs down from the sky.Seriously, I think this game was made for very young kids who have never played a game in their lives. The mini-tutorials in the first couple of stages aren't too helpful. They just show pictures with no text (aside from what button to press) and no voices telling you what to do. Don't get me wrong- I hate it how a lot of modern games tell you what every single button does, or holds your hand through the first hour of the game as if you've never played one before. I joke about how if Super Mario Bros. were made today, the first stage would take 10 minutes telling you how to jump, what to jump on, how to hit blocks, that coins aren't enemies, and so on. That's...actually exactly what The Smurfs 2 does. I never thought I'd play a game where it shows you that you're supposed to jump over pits, not walk into them. I'm not trying to hate on a kid's game or anything. We all have to start somewhere. It's just that The Smurfs 2 is as dull as you can get for a game of its kind. Skylanders, Disney Infinity, the HD collections of Ratchet and Clank or Sly Cooper, the MUCH better all-ages platformers Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends...you have some pretty good alternatives out there that cost less than this. All of the games I just listed, my 6 year old daughter adores and can play over and over. With The Smurfs 2, she got bored fast and only liked a few things, including Azrael summoning skulls. The game can be completed in just a couple of hours, the Smurfs play alike for the most part, and to get Smurfette, you have to beat the game. There isn't a lot of extra content once the game's over aside from going through the levels again with different Smurfs to get all the collectibles.The one thing I can give the game is that the graphics aren't terrible. Some of the backgrounds are surprisingly beautiful, and I did like the model for Azrael. It's not exactly a good looking model of cat, but it sure looks better than I was expecting. Oh, and I did get a laugh out of the official Smurf seal on the game's box, as if people are worried about it not getting the Smurf seal of approval.Rent the game or borrow it from someone if you can. There's really no reason to pay for it unless you can get a good deal. And most importantly, remember to not collect the little vials after defeating enemies. You're bound to hear that song 100 times an hour if you do.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0038MUCPK","reviewerName":"Mindful Consumer","summary":"a joy-inducing romp!","reviewText":"I have been playing video games since I first obtained the original NES (which I still have and play) back in the early 90's, and never have I had such a wonderful time playing a video game! There were many times I literally squealed out loud in delight at elements taking place within the game. I will not rehash the details of the game (which you can find above in the item description), but I will tell you on my first foray in Toy Box mode I played for four hours straight and would have played even longer had it not been for the late hour and work in the early morning.The options and elements to customize are vast...you can alter the appearance of buildings (and townspeople by giving them the heave-ho into any building you have customized), as well as purchase and place new buildings (some allow for placement options and others do not) so you are altering the landscape of the entire town. Customizations are easy and hilarious (giant Nemo fins are on the sides of my jail right now).Everything is an event, from completing a mission (it's a party!) to the arrival of new toys (it's actually really excitement-inducing to see the stagecoach coming with your huge \"present\" even though you know what it is), to mining for gold, to riding Bullseye around and hearing the wonderful sound effects. As expected, the graphics are amazing with only a hint of jerkiness here and there. Sound effects are spot on and the game features most of the original voice cast from the films (another major bonus).The reward system seems very balanced; they make it easy enough to earn gold coins to purchase new items (buildings, toys, etc.), but you are never sitting on all that many coins because so many new items are being unlocked for purchase all the time. Each new toy you purchase comes with new missions you can complete and the open world format is just a joy to tromp around in to complete them. The mission log is also very helpful, as is the compass feature which can be a real boon if you are stuck trying to complete any one task.I can honestly say I can not wait to play this game again. Some games when purchased have a shelf life, but Toy Story 3 will live on my shelf forever. I can not recommend this game highly enough...and I haven't even touched Story Mode yet!Viva Toy Story 3!*** In addendum ***A few things I have noticed after several days of gameplay that I felt were worth noting are the time consuming loading screens and the difficulty maneuvering motorized vehicles (although this could just be a lack of coordination on my part). For a game such as this, it seems the loads are far too frequent and of too long a duration. I'm not sure if this is only on the PS3 version, but it is a bit of a frustration at times.As for the vehicles...like I said, I don't know if it is just my lack of coordination, but I seem to have a real issue getting the cars to go in the direction I am trying to go. Any of the creatures I am just fine with (Bullseye, the Dragon, etc.) but those dang cars...Also, the robbers at the bank and the attacks on the town can be a little random. Even if you are standing right next to the bank you can miss some of the bandits and lose some of your gold coins which is nonsensical to me. Fortunately my bank is right across from my jail so I just turn around and toss them in. :)Despite these additional issues, I am still loving the heck out of this game. Truly a grand time!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001FPBZ3U","description":"","reviewerName":"Raven A. Wind","summary":"The Best Deal, Even If XBox Live Customer Service is Rotten","reviewText":"I've had an Xbox 360 since launch day. I won my first one, a launch console, and enjoyed it a lot. I never had a Red Ring of Death or any problems with it, but it did have a very loud optical drive that drove me crazy whenever I'd play a game like Oblivion. It always sounded like the fantasy realm of Tamriel was near a major airport.I sold the original console, and picked up a newer model later; One that had the BenQ optical drive. This did cut down on the drive noise quite a bit. Not long after that, though, I decided to give it as a gift to my nephews, who enjoy it to this day. I replaced it with an Arcade model (I hung on to my own hard drive) and was happy with that one for a while, too. I never had any technical problems with the Xbox 360.Then, a dark day came when Xbox Live customer service treated me VERY badly (they were billing an old bank account, causing overdrafts, and wouldn't remove that account number from my records no matter how much I explained that they'd never get any money out of it, and that it was just costing me 35 bucks each time they tried. The outsourced CSR's response: \"Oh well. You need to just deal with it.\" and other very rude things.) After this bad experience with their customer service department, I was just fed up, and so I sold my Xbox 360 and all my games, and bought a PS3.For a few months, I enjoyed the PS3. It's not the devil, like so many 360 gamers say. It's just another console choice. I can't say there was anything wrong with it.  However, there were some things wrong with the games on the PS3... Fewer downloadable add-ons. I'm a big fan of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and on the PS3 you can't get most of the optional content. Damn it! I need my Wizard's Tower and Mehrune's Razor!So eventually my attitude toward MS customer service softened, and combined with the desire for the Arcade games I'd already purchases, and the DLC I already had, I switched back to the Xbox 360.This time, instead of using a debit/credit card, I will only use Xbox Live Marketplace cards sold at retail, and Xbox Live Gold subscription cards sold at retail. I WILL NOT trust the idiots at the foreign-soil, barely-speaking-English, outsourced customer service centers with my credit cards or bank cards anymore. They abused it, and never offered an apology or compensation for their erroneous charges or the backlash they caused. (In the end, I reported the card stolen due to unauthorized charges, in fact.)With a year of Live Gold paid for, and all my games purchased or traded second-hand, I'm finding the Xbox 360 gets a lot more use than the PS3 ever did. System exclusives like GTA IV: The Lost & the Damned are making it a fun experience.As for the hardware: It's better now. The NXE (new dashboard) is an improvement, most notably in the area of allowing games to be played from the hard drive. Now I don't have to hear that loud optical drive when playing a game! That makes up for a lot, in my book. The system does seem to run cooler than my Falcon chipset Arcade model did, but not remarkably so.And the pack-ins: Well, I played them for about half an hour, and grew bored with them. The LEGO Indiana Jones is better than Kung-Fu Panda, but frankly, these two games are nowhere near as fun as the Marvel Ultimate Alliance pack-in from previous models. Really, I'm not overjoyed with the pack-in titles, and would rather they just include a coupon for $30 off a game. I wouldn't have bought either of these games myself if I had the option.In summary, I grudgingly admit that the Xbox 360 is the better console when it comes to game selection, arcade titles, and DLC. It suffers a bit in that it has fewer actual multimedia features, and no web browser. It has the better controllers, but the accessories are usually more expensive and everything for the MS offering is proprietary; WiFi adapter, wireless controllers, hard drive, etc. -- You pay more for them because MS is jacking the price and making it difficult or impossible to use 3rd party accessories. Personally, I think that sucks, because there's no way I can justify the price they're asking for a bigger hard drive when I know that the actual hardware, without MS's proprietary software on it, can be had for a fraction of what they're asking.If only we could combine the Xbox 360 and PS3 into one perfect console... but then what would the fanboys have to complain about?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2009"}

However, I am giving the game 3 stars because for me, personally, it couldn't hold my attention for the bulk of the game.The dialogue is fantastic, the characters deep, the graphics colorful and creative, the plot exciting and captivating and the music fits very well (though I definitely wouldn't listen to it outside the game). I didn't mind the slow start at all - I found it captivating and it pulled me in. It was the gameplay that ultimately led me to lower my rating.My problem with the game is that it is very, very repetitive. There are two aspects of the game that are repetitive:1) The non-combat, day-to-day life aspect. You go around town, exploring and talking to people and building your social links. This is fun at first but ultimately becomes the same thing over and over again. It starts to feel like The Sims without the customization aspect.2) The dungeons. Dungeon design in this game is terrible and nothing like elaborate dungeons you would find in other RPGs such as Final Fantasy, Baldur's Gate or Skyrim. The dungeons are just endless, randomized hallways with treasure chests full of dull loot and monsters that all look and act pretty much the same as the monsters from the previous dungeons.Even the Persona aspect of finding and fusing them to fight for you got repetitive quickly, even though I initially thought it would be very fun.If you don't mind repetition (or even like it), or if you're a die-hard JRPG fan or a fan of Shin Megami Tensei games in general, then you'll probably like the game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2014"}

I bought this because it's hard as a single player to get a game online with the XBox.  I installed it and started it, and INSTANTLY I could tell a difference in graphics quality.  The XBox version of Halo has MUCH better graphics.  Even toned down for the PC, you need a strong machine to run it, and it's still not close to the graphics quality of the XBox version.I've played through the storyline so many times I'm not going to play it again on the PC.  I bought this for the multiplayer.  People are also complaining about all the team killing.  Yes, I've seen some of that, but it's not TOO bad.  Also, you can turn off friendly fire, but not everyone who makes a room does.  But, and this is a big but, everything in the PC version seems a little slower than the XBox version.  I'll shoot someone, and it seems to take a moment for the shot to register.  It's not nearly as responsive as the online Xbox version.  Forget grabbing the sniper rifle, it's just too hard to get a clean shot.  And for those of you playing on Gamespy or XBconnect, there is STILL lag!  I was hoping playing the PC version would have done something to decrease lag, but it's still there.  Not bad, but still bad enough to notice.But, I still love this game!  I have only had this game for about a week and a half, and I'm really having fun playing it online.  I've already sunk hours into it.  I've never played a Halo game (with the exception of tournaments) with 16 people.  The action is fast, and the deaths come quickly.  Imagine 16 people in Wizard!  I still hate alien weapons.  Just give me a pistol and a couple of grenades, and I'm a killing machine.If you've been thinking of getting this game, I hope this review helps a bit.See ya on the map,Craig","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2003"}

The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah.

I didn't care much for the fact that you ahd Malaria throughout the whole game and had to keep locating medication to keep you alive, but that was a novel Idea, so somehow it worked, however annoying it may have been.  The \"buddy\" Idea was interesting too.  The Idea that you had a \"buddy\" that would provide you with concurrent missions and whom could heal you once if killed in combat made for an interesting twist.  Fianlly, aside from the main missions there are numerous side-missions you can get either from buddies or from varios location throughout the game map.  This very much reminded me of a RPG more than a FPS.  Im never finished all the side misssions, but believe me, there were more than enough main missions and buddy missions to keep one busy for many hours/days of gameplay.

{"product_name":"B00309U0M6","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Frustrating Good Game","reviewText":"I enjoyed playing this game, even though I made myself wait until it I could find it as a cheaper pre-owned game because of EA's Ad campaign. Suffice to say that the \"Your Mom Hates This Game\" ads were the worst game ads I've ever seen, and are a detriment to all gaming culture. The biggest reason I'm only giving it four stars is that when the game tried to be scary or difficult, to me it was just annoying or frustrating. The first Dead Space was much more scary, I was never startled or creeped out when playing Dead Space 2. When they had the various monsters jump out at you, all it really did was cheaply take away a decent amount of your health. You will be dying many times in this game, and while I like the cool deathscenes some of the harder sections have the longest deathscenes, which means you'll be repeating the same animation over and over. It would be nice if they somehow had an option to either not have the deathscenes, or only show it the first time you die. The weird thing is that when I kept dying I never felt like it was from plain difficulty, I always felt it was because of cheap overpowered enemy attacks or running low on ammo or health. I know that limited ammo and health is a survival horror must, but I felt like I had to make decisions between buying ammo and health or new guns and armor. Also, the upgrade system is so extensive, it's impossible to fully upgrade more than 2 things in one playthrough. I just find it curious that the developers expect gamers to replay the game multiple times, because nothing at all would change, you can't make any choices in the game, and I assume all of the fights would essentially be the same. It was also strange that the game's ending chapter had two of the most annoying sections in the whole game. First they had a regenerating monster, where you had to blow it up, freeze it, then kill the other monsters/unlock doors/run away. This really didn't make sense, because you couldn't pick up the pieces of the monster with kinesis and throw them far away, which would be the logical thing to do. It's just annoying being unable to kill a monster you face. Then for the final boss battle, it was just so frustrating. You have your dead girlfriend slowly moving to you (when she touches you you die) and a swarm of the child monsters (that cause you instant death at the first hint of red in your health bar). At first, I thought I just had to repeatedly kill the dead girlfriend, but after killing her around 6or7 times before dying the hundredth time, I reasoned I had to be doing something wrong. It turns out you have to shoot this thing in the background each time after you kill the woman. It still wasn't easy, but it was doable, I wish your objective had been a bit more obvious. I did enjoy the end though, it was a classic horror ending.As for the actual gameplay, I generally found it to be much too slow. You have three speeds, crawling as slow as a snail (after being vomited on), walking like a granny, and jogging like a fat man chasing a truck full of Twinkies driving through a school zone. I also find the main gameplay aspect of dismembering the limbs of the aliens to be much too simplistic/cookie-cutter. They always separate at the same spot, which is just so unrealistic. If the whole game is going to be about slicing the monsters into pieces, there should be multiple irregular pieces, it shouldn't be so easy to put it back together if they sold the dismembered monster as a puzzle. Furthermore, I still felt like I was running errands throughout the game, and it was much too linear. The story was very vague as well, none of the introduced characters evolved and we never were even given an inkling of their backstories or motives. To me it just felt lazy, there was room for more story development, but they avoided it.There will obviously be a third Dead Space, and I can only hope that the developers take more risks with it. Dead Space 1 and 2 were very similar, and really the only gameplay aspect that evolved was the zero gravity sections. I had fun playing the game, and any fan of survival horror games or sci-fi/horror movies should check it out, but I still ended up a little disappointed, hence the 4 star rating.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2011"}

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

It got panned by critics when it was first released because it was extremely buggy and the graphics were less than stellar. But 8 or 10 months after its release (something like that), the devs overhauled the graphics and fixed all the bugs, then released an expansion (which is included here) that was almost as long as the original game...each part takes around 50 hours if you do all there is to do, for a total of over 100 hours of gameplay. If you rush through the main story, you could probably finish it faster, but in a game like this, why would you want to? We play these kinds of games (literally ROLE PLAYING games) to immerse ourselves in the world the devs have created...and this one does not disappoint. The extra time the devs spent polishing the game up were well worth it. I didn't play it when it was originally released, so this was my first experience with it, and I'm quite impressed. The graphics actually look pretty darn good. Rich detail throughout, and very few areas look less-than-completely polished. The character animations aren't the strong suit here, but they are on par with most other RPGs, and better than many.The main story is pretty good, for a game like this (which, for games based on story, are frequently pretty lame, sadly). The side quests are decent...fairly standard RPG fare, but they take you into some pretty cool environments, which are all fairly well developed.It's not perfect, however. My biggest gripe (and, frankly, one of my only ones) is with the controls. Generally, they're fine, but if you want to highlight something/someone (like when you want to talk with someone), you have to get a tiny little cursor perfectly on them before you can push a button to initiate a conversation (or pick up an item, or whatever). It's extremely frustrating, and even after many, many hours of play, it doesn't get much less frustrating.That being said, that really is one of my few gripes. The gameplay is, by and large, quite fun, with varying and unique enemies and environments. The game really comes into its own, though, when it allows you to take dragon form...something that unfortunately doesn't happen (except once, briefly) until quite far into the game. This is a shame, because it's the best part of the game. Flying around as a dragon is loads of fun, and the flying controls are excellent. Insofar as such is possible, I really felt like a dragon flying around, spinning through the air and breathing fire. Very cool. I just wish they had introduced this far earlier in the game, and (thus) allowed for a lot more time spent as a dragon. Note to developers: being a dragon is cool. When you pull it off well, make it a large portion of the game!Overall, this game is very fun, and highly recommended. I didn't play it when it was first released (largely due to the bad reviews), but the devs have clearly fixed the vast majority of these issues. A quick search of reviews for the updated version shows that most reviewers love the new version, and rightly so. It's awesome. The expansion, which again is included here, is just as high quality as the original campaign, and for the cost here, the package is an incredible value. Highly recommended!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2011"}

It's not bad though.","reviewText":"Recently I got the chance to pick up the Tekken5 collectors edition that came with the stick and all that. It was a really nice package and the only reason I purchased it was because of the stick. I never really liked Tekken all that much. My first Tekken game was Tekken 3 that I purchased when it first came out and was all the hype. It was so long ago I forgot most of the characters except a few ones that I recognized for their fighting styles. So playing Tekken 5 I think almost 10 years later is really a weird experience.I forgot about Tekken in all this time since I also misplaced the PS1 game somewhere. I knew there was a reason I didn't fall in love with it but playing Tekken 5 I was reminded and flashbacks were to follow.I really love playing 2D fighters, and when your a 2D fighter fanatic the one thing that sticks with you throughout any game are the controls. Most 2D fighters believe it or not have really similar controls. Any time I pick up a 2D fighting game It's really not that hard to get into it and start enjoying it because of that factor. I mean it can be just about any title and you can mostly figure out the control scheme. With Tekken a 3D fighter I quickly remember how the controls were a pita. Pulling off moves are award because on the D pad lay out and having to press one of the buttons in sequence or at the right time or whenever. No more half circle back fun this thing is like starting from scratch and I really hate it. Since I have the T5 arcade stick it really bugs me even more.Usually I use an arcade stick to play Street Fighter and I'm really used to working those directions. With Tekken I find myself going slower and making movements with the joystick like I'm trying to pull a plush toy from one of those vending machines. It just feels unnatural and so not fighter like.Aside from Tekken the only other 3D fighter I played was Virtua Fighter in the arcade sigh* when it was brand new. I remember passing that up to play the Xmen 2D fighter right beside it more my style.Tekken 5 also irritated me because of the movements of the characters. I guess these game is supposed to be more realistic with the fighting but why are the characters so slow in movement and both response time? I almost feel like I'm playing chess. One thing I love about 2D fighters are how fast the characters are and how quick the combo's can be. In this game it's just punch punch kick kick and slow motion falling \"you win!\".Not to mention that I still can't figure out how I can get KO'd by someone punching me IN THE SHIN! How does that work? Who ever got knocked out by being punched in the Shin or the kneecap or whatever. It's just silly and looks ridiculous. Speaking of that know I remember what I disliked the most about this game. All the characters fight like their arms and legs weight 400lbs each. Like they are struggling to make some simple movement, and the game does the sound effects to simulate that to. WHoosh! Whooosh! It sounds like someone swinging a cardboard tube and you get to hear this every single time someone throws a punch or a kick it's annoying! I also remembered Tekken 3 had that same annoying movement sound couldn't they have thought of something else at this point other than that annoying whoosh sound?Then there's the glowing fireworks. Why are there fireworks every time you land a hit on someone? am I missing the abacabb code? should there be blood? Tekken 3 also had that effect and I remember feeling about the same. I just never understood why Tekken tried to be so realistic yet was so cartoonish at the same time.Graphics wise the characters look great and the women... the women look amazing. One thing Tekken always had were great graphics and cinematics as well as an interesting story with plenty of hidden gems and unlocks. I did like this feature about Tekken. Although I personally thought the fighting was slow and boring the unlocks kept me entertained. With the features I've seen so far it looks like that reward system hasn't changed.Overall I give Tekken 5 a 3/5. It might be a 5/5 to some but I'm a 2D fighting fan and have been for years I don't really think I'll ever get into these kinds of games. If you like 3D fighters You'll enjoy adding it to your Ps2 collection. If you like 2D fighters like me you probably wouldn't really be interested in the game.Again it's not bad it's just not my style. Kind of like how some people prefer NFS over Gran Turismo.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001TOMQOY","reviewerName":"R. J. Gutt \"Tigercat\"","summary":"Army of Two 40th Day Review","reviewText":"This is a fun game. Other reviews indicate it is very very short, but I had 6+ hours of FPS fun with this title. With the optional DLC, one can easily get around 8 hours out of this. It is an Excellent Co-op game. I played it solo.The allied AI for solo play is very good; I had a tough time keeping up in stats. Your ally can heal you when you are down, and likewise, you can heal him. Furthermore, giving orders to your ally is very easy. You can have him go aggressive or stay passive. Also, you can have him stay near you, go forward in a wild spree, or stay in one spot. The ally orders were very good, and he is a agood shot, as well.Enemy AI is also pretty good. They hit harder on the more difficult settings, obviously, but they use cover and try to pin you down. Part of this is based on the Aggro system. If you do something, like shoot your gun, it causes Aggro, and the enemy will attempt to hit the one team member with the most Aggro. Very useful to flank or take a quality shot when your partner is the target!Upgrading guns is very cool. There are multiple part types and parts to choose from. I went with a high-damage and accurate assault rifle. Getting more ammo is easy as most enemies use some sort of assault rifle. You can carry three weapons and grenades. I had an assault rifle, pistol and sniper rifle. Since the assault rifle can have an excellent optional scope, the RPG in the third slot is a viable option. Upgrades are available any time out of combat.In the game, you get to make a few Morale decisions. They are not timed, so you can think about your options. Everything is not as it appears! After you choose, you see the results of your decision in a comic-book like series of still shots. Some things work out really weird. Hint: Support your Russian Ally!This is an excellent FPS. There is not a lot of stealth in the game, just straight forward missions. I found the level designs to be quite good. This game plays well, I had one freeze up, but other than that no problems.Army of Two 40th Day is a good investment. It is fun.

Play as the chest-bursting aliens, the sci-fi-friendly Predator, or the poor marines stuck in the middle.This classic came out in 2001, so by now it's rather cheap compared to current releases. The gameplay is still great fun, though. There are three different single-player campaigns, each with storylines that weave in and out of each other. You can face-hug as an alien, stealth-attack as a Predator, or fight off the enemy as a marine.The graphics aren't top notch by today's standards, with faces looking painted on a balloon. Still, many of the scenes are rather impressive and keep you involved in the game. The sound really helps emphasize the trepidation and surprise that are involved in many of the scenarios.Where the game really shines is in multiplayer. Train yourself up through the campaigns, and then join a faction on line to see if you can compete against net players. You can have up to 16 people playing at a time, and it gets for pretty intricate strategies if you're good! Each character type has a wide variety of attacks to choose from, and its own strengths and weaknesses.Highly recommended for mature first-person-shooter fans. Might be a little much for younger players, between the body parts flying and death screams that sound pretty constantly as you prowl the halls.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2003"}

It's true the combat isn't as good as it likely could be (and apparently is in Bioshock 2).  The inhabitants are represented in more of an animation (rather than realistic) style, but this is very likely intentional, and for me it added to the surreality of Rapture.

I am not one who actually played many games online with other online players, being more of a solo type player in most of the games I play but because it is from a series that is/was one of my favorites, I figured I would join in. And with the initial versions, I was willing to over look the glitches, bugs and game freezes but as time went on and the game got closer and closer to release, a lot of those glitches and bugs were/are still there. And sure enough even when the release date came, a lot of the same issues that I came across and reported along with many other beta testers were/are still there. Bugs in quests that prevent you from completion, the game suddenly freezing or screen going black that would require a computer reboot and combat glitches just to name a few. In addition to the gaming trolls and those that interfere with game play. For me preferring to solo adventure, the game at times forces you to join groups to complete quests that are way too difficult on your own. The group adventuring was not fun for me and at times downright a pain to get 4 different adventurers working together to complete the quest with a clumsy interface. For those more comfortable with group adventuring maybe this wont be so bad but for me used to solo questing it was an act of frustration for sure.  And battling with 10000 other adventurers to try to complete your individual quest that everyone is doing at the same time is an issue for me as well.  Waiting for a boss or an item to respawn from all the other adventurers grabbing it, is not my idea of fun.Not as big a deal though but an annoyance was the voices of the characters tended to be some of the same voice actors with little variation in the sound of the character's voice.Don't get me wrong the scenery and design of the game is beautiful and well done and several of the quests were fun to do although sometimes repetitive. I actually initially enjoyed doing the beta tests and some of the early game but that quickly wore off and after seeing relatively little improvement in the bugs, it became more of a chore than fun.But the final straw for me was when a bug basically locked me out of my account and prevented me from basically doing anything and after several failed attempts at getting it fixed through customer service, I gave up, asked to delete my account and went back to solo adventuring games I can play without being online to do so.This game is ok overall but not without issues and maybe not quite the Elder Scrolls you know and love.  The bugs and game trolls really drove me out of the game in addition to being forced to join groups to complete certain quests.  Without these bugs and some improvements in gameplay and this game could be so much more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2014"}

I read the FF:Origins theory, which is plausible, but more likely, Rockstar released a shoddy product in this regard because they knew people would buy it. Heck, the product description boasts \"amazing visuals\"; the only thing amazing here is how lame said visuals are.Another problem is control. As usual, your controls while driving are stellar, with different vehicles giving very different feels, but while walking, aiming, or shooting, it is very frustrating. The lock-on can be almost useless at times (the game rarely locks on the opponent you wish), making free aim absolutely vital, but unfortunately, those controls are bad as well. Add the utter darkness present in most of the game, and you have a very frustrating experience.The story? It's OK, I suppose, but tiresome. Yada yada yada, climb your way up the ranks, etc.; you can pretty much tell exactly what's going to happen. Not that story has ever been terribly important in these games, but this time around, it feels particularly lazy.However, it is still fun, despite the frustrations. As usual, getting yourself into and out of scrapes with the local law enforcement is incredibly entertaining, and you'll be tangling with cops and rival gangs early on in this one. Hence, I gave 4 stars for fun...However, Rockstar need to get on the ball. This engine is incredibly tired - it's time for the company to show some of that ingenuity that made Rockstar a force to be reckoned with.

No matter how well it did, people are going to judge its \"wow factor\" against how amazing the original Halo felt to play back when it first came out. Now that we are used to the weapons, races, environments and plotline, nothing is as cool as it was that first time. It's the same issue that plagues any series, be it Dune, the Matrix, Star Wars, etc.Halo 3 does get a boost in that it is released for the 360, so you get an automatic upgrade in abilities there. We're playing on a high end HD TV, and yes, it looks really nice. The backgrounds look like a painting in motion, with swirling clouds and dancing dust storms. From the light glinting off the metal surfaces to the detailed shadows in the rocks, it can be really gorgeous. Is every detail as beautiful as every detail in, say Gears of War? Maybe not. Different developers focus on different items. There are always trade-offs for speed and visual appeal reasons. For a Halo world, I think they did a good job.The sound and dialogue are really great. I like the background music, and I find much of the dialogue hilarious. There are some conversations that have me laughing out loud. This is a good game to play with your surround sound stereo system hooked up, and of course the subwoofers.I hated the ending of Halo 2. I dislike it when a story finishes with a \"and now wait a few years to find out what happened.\" They can at least have you feel like you achieved something, and ended a chapter. For that reason alone it's good to have Halo 3 here to wrap everything up.Unfortunately, with all the time they spent in development, this third outing is a bit predictable. I really enjoyed the multi character play in Halo 2. I thought that was a great touch. They completely removed it for Halo 3, setting you back into a Master Chief only mode. To be honest, I really thought we'd get THREE races this time around, and get to play as the Flood too. Why reduce ourselves to just one?Also, while there are a lot of \"missions\", some of them are maybe 5 minutes long. That's a bit on the short side. I realize you can go back and replay on harder and harder levels to challenge yourself - but they could have put more depth into the basic story line.Now, all of those things being said, the key to any game in modern times is its multiplayer ability. No matter what single player game you play, it's pretty much a limited time game. Multiplayer is completely unlimited - and you're not stuck with the formulas built into the AI brains. Halo 3 is definitely the best multiplayer experience of the three games - the most balanced, the most fun, the best graphics. You could literally play this for years and not get bored of it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}

Origins is the third installment of the highly praised Arkham series; a series that has shown Batman, at long last, finding success in the video game world. Rocksteady did a wonderful job making him a force to be reckoned with, as well as show his smarter, more investigate side of him. Also, up until now they did a great job of spreading out the many villains Batman has over the last few games.Arkham Origins, unfortunately, feels like a simple copy and paste of the other games. It leans heavily on borrowed elements that made Arkham Asylum and City great. It&#8217;s sad to see since the Arkham series is arguably, not only the best of Batman video games, but maybe the best superhero licensed video games we have had. Origins simply rides the coattails of its predecessors in a cheap cash grab from WB Games.Origins is a prequel to the series, taking place before Arkham Asylum. However, you really wouldn&#8217;t know that as it never seems like an origin story to anything beyond the first meetings between the characters. Bruce Wayne has been Batman for two years now, so the &#8220;origin&#8221; story isn&#8217;t much of an origin there either, making it apparent they&#8217;re just selling it on the Arkham name.With Rocksteady off on another project, Origins is in the hands of Warner Bros. Games Montreal, and Splash Damage who cover the multiplayer. WB Montreal did a simple carbon copy, adding little  and changing almost nothing from the previous games. People like myself that are big believers in &#8220;don&#8217;t fix what isn&#8217;t broken&#8221; can understand and get behind that, but it would have been nice for them to take some risks and do more to stand out from the previous two titles.It&#8217;s Christmas Eve. Black Mask has escaped from Blackgate prison and put a bounty out on Batman&#8217;s head. Eight villains hoping to meet Batman for the first time are vying for the ultimate prize, $50 million. Over the course of one night heavy-hitters like Bane, Deathstroke, and Deadshot are all looking to make their claim to fame. But with a bounty of $50 million, it&#8217;s bound to bring out the bottom of the barrel-types too like Firefly, Electrocutioner and Copperhead. It&#8217;s campy, but just solid enough to work. But, as I mentioned earlier, Origins relies on old tricks, and it isn&#8217;t long before the assassins take a backseat in favor of the grinning, green-haired clown, and the story comes crashing down.This game makes light of Batman meeting the Joker for the first time, yet has him become a pivotal role in the game&#8217;s story. The Joker was the big baddy in both of the last two games and didn&#8217;t need to be in Origins at all, but was shoehorned into the narrative to play it safe. Under the guise of Black Mask things felt fresh, and it should&#8217;ve been left that way. The Joker is obviously Batman&#8217;s greatest rival, but he has been at the center of two games already. Let another villain have his day to shine as Batman&#8217;s rival.With Origins being so much like the other games, it also brings with it the Predator-type gameplay of Batman; stalking bad guys from atop gargoyles and trying to take them out as silently as possible. This is what Asylum did so well, making gamers believe that Batman could actually have a good video game. Unfortunately in Origins, these predator situations are few and far between, especially with the combat becoming so much more prominent.Batman: Arkham City, building on Asylum&#8217;s foundation, just about perfected hand to hand combat in video games so much so that afterwards many games took a shot at copying it. So it stands to reason that Origins followed suit as well, probably better so than most other games that have tried it. It&#8217;s just that WB Montreal not only followed suit, but sent it into overkill. Combat still flows very well, but it happens far too often, and lasts for far too long. The fighting in this game is simply relentless.Each combat scenario takes forever to take down every opponent. It completely pulls you out of the game seeing Batman hit a guy so hard that he clearly breaks his jaw, yet the guy keeps getting up five times over. Now imagine that with three to five enemies at a time, and sometimes more. At one point in the game Batman gets shock gloves to use while in combat, that supposedly makes these situations easier and faster. Honestly though, I saw no difference what-so-ever outside of the shock gloves allowing me to attack some weapon baddies straight on.Asylum and City had everyone head-over-heels for the combat, but Origins shouldn&#8217;t have made it the de facto element for Batman interacting with enemies. Batman is more brain than brawn, and this is the reason he would stalk bad guys from the shadows. Of course there is the excuse that Batman is new to this and more of a hot head, but that is just ridiculous.Origins is open world much like City was, even to the point that many of the land marks from that game show up here. It is kind of interesting seeing these places while not being in a prison-city, but more interesting and very odd, is how Gotham City is basically a prison-city. With the game taking place on the night of Christmas Eve, it was actually really cool seeing decorations on buildings and Christmas lights up in the windows. It added a nice touch to the environment that makes it feel real. Never before has an open world game done something like this.Of course that realism is ripped away almost instantly when the only people on the streets are thugs standing around or walking patrols, just waiting for Batman to show up. There are also cops doing exactly the same thing, even though Captain Gordon (not Commissioner yet) keeps mentioning how busy they have been that night. So basically, Gotham City runs exactly like it does in later years when a large part of the city is turned into a prison. It&#8217;s no wonder Hugo Strange had no problems talking government officials into creating Arkham City.Not surprisingly, Origins packed in multiplayer, but what is surprising is that it isn&#8217;t that bad. It&#8217;s pretty standard control points-style gameplay. There is a Joker team and a Bane team, each with three players and each team is trying to control three different points of the map for points. They are trying to kill each other to do so, but there is a third team that consists of Batman and Robin played by two other players. As the Joker and Bane teams run around trying to kill one another, they must also be on the lookout for Bats and Robin lurking in the shadows, looking to silently take out both teams.It seems very chaotic, but it works out pretty well. Each team has their own unique set of gadgets to help them take out the other two teams. Batman and Robin even get gadgets that are uniquely independent from one another. You can also customize your characters for both Joker and Bane&#8217;s team and buy items with credits you earn in-game. Batman and Robin can both be changed too, but just from a list of different costumes we have already seen them in before, which, admittedly, is still cool. These modes aren&#8217;t special by any means, and will most likely be forgotten in the near future. It&#8217;s just refreshing to see a slightly different spin on a classic match mode, and one that&#8217;s actually fun to play.Batman: Arkham Origins has a decent story, but nowhere as fresh and original as Asylum&#8217;s or as large as City&#8217;s. The plot involving all these villains hunting Batman on the same night is flimsy, but it works. However, it&#8217;s quickly broken apart and some of the assassins are merely reduced to side missions you can take out at your leisure. Origins copies almost everything from its predecessors. WB Games Montreal had a chance to make some real changes here, do their own thing and maybe show they could do right by Batman. Instead they played it safe, which in the gaming world is never excusable. Arkham Origins is not only the weakest of the trilogy; it manages to kill any interest in another Batman game in the foreseeable future.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2013"}

It was a BIG hit for all Loyal Nintendo fans and Mortal Kombat fanatics. Those little 64-polygraphic characters provided hours of entertainment, because it was something completely new. I mean, C'mon, what other game has characters from OTHER games combine into ONE game where they battle each other in places from OTHER games and use items from OTHER games? Tick-Tock, Tick-Tock, Tick-Tock, BZZZZZ! Times up, NOTHING!Well now, it's back! With EVERYTHING from the old games (Except for 1 element, I'll get into that later) plus MORE, MORE, MORE! This time with perfectly smoothed textures and tons more moves, plus more options. Super Smash is a super smash!As I've already said, much of the original version has been included in to the newer one. The old characters: Mario, DK, Link, Samus, Yoshi, Kirby, Fox and Pikachu, plus the 4 hidden chatacters, Luigi, Captain Falcon, Ness and Jigglypuff, are all in it. (In the newer one, Captain Falcon and Ness have already been unlocked for you. You must unlock Jigglypuff and Luigi.) Every level and item is in it. It would take forever to explain all the details, but basically it is the same as the 1st one. You unlock levels and characters like the 1st one, more moves, etc. It's amazing. However, what happened to Board the Platforms? Oh well, I can't put anything lower that 10/10.Don't get me started on the Graphics. Really, don't, or I'll be going on...and on...and on...and on. I was blown away the first time I played Super Smash Bros. Not because my TV overheated and exploded, however that could add into it, because of the Graphics. Full 360 degress character, items and levels. The texture is SOOOOOO smothed. I love it. I can't explain much more. You can Zoom in and out, and the texture and quality will remain the same 4eva! There's no doubt in me saying this gets a 10/10.Pika! Pika! Pika! Pika! Pika! Pika! Okay, I swear, If Mario goe's &quot;Ha Ha!&quot; or Captain Falcon goes &quot;Falcon!&quot; again I will scream! The sound in this game is the bare minimum. Everything has a sound, but unfortuantly it is always the same. Most smashing sfx are the same. All weapons make the same sound, and when players perform moves they say the same thing. The constant DING sound whenever a menu is changed will annoy most users. I really thing Nintendo could have had a field day with the sounds, but just slapped some crude sounds and called it quits. I have to knock 'em down with a low 7/10.Well, for one thing, the speed is definitly not as fast at Pikachu running, but it gets there. The only thing that kinda bugs me is that it saves at every menu. It takes about 4 seconds or so, along with some other things as well. All I can say is that it is fast but not superman. It's about as good as a 9/10.With any fighting game, controls are key. This game makes it very easy with simple commands such as &quot;a&quot; is punch/kick/slap, whatever. &quot;b&quot; is a standerd power move. Z is throw, R is shield. The most technical is goes into is having to move the analog stick up, down, left or right with pressing &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;. The control makes the grade, with a perfect 10/10.The great thing about Super Smash is that it's not fun, fun, fun ... then it's over. The great multiplayer option lets you play endless hours with friends or againts the CPU. Unlike the original 1p mode, where you would fight Link, 12 kirbies, Fox, etc. and it would be the same everytime, this game bends the rules. It is simply Fight one random character, then fight 12 random charactders, then fight one random character, etc. Replay again and again, knowing that you can't go wrong with a 10/10.All in all, Super Smash makes it's trademark by being Nintendo all the way. Made by Nintendo, made only for Nintendo, this game will beat Xbox's trademarked games anyday.Let's review:Gameplay: 10/10Graphics: 10/10Sound: 7/10Speed: 9/10Controls: 10/10Replay value: 10/10CHEATS: Nothing really. You get some trophies, you get some secret characters. I give Super Smash an extra point for cheats.Total: 56/60 giving Super Smash Brother Melle a 94.34, + 01.00 for cheats, so it's a 95.34","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2002"}

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"Great Apocalyptic And One Of The Few That Doesn't Rely On Aliens Or The Walking Dead","reviewText":"Naughty Dog has done another great game with this survival post apocalyptic world that has neither zombies or aliens as the main enemies but other humans trying to survive this new harsh reality.The game feels like a true survival story gameplay where almost everything has to be ration carefully from food to first aid. Also the game isn't only a third person shooter,that's not the point but more on using your environment and the tools and equipment to help you along your mission. The characters are also very well thought out and done in the story as you learn their history and not only the main characters but other characters along the way that both hinder and help you. The environmental effects and background are incredible in the game and the A.I. is pretty decent too, meaning when you try and distract an enemy with a bottle or something it won't just dumbly follow the noise but keep looking around so you can't just assume the enemy is going to the noise and won't pay attention to anything else.The character voice cast picked for this did a terrific job in their character roles bringing incredible believability in the game making you almost feel like it's happening to these characters for real, also the personal history you see and learn later on really helps you connect to them especially the tragedy that befell Joel and the reason for his now harsher outlook on life and his almost apathetic nature to what's happening with the world.Ellie is also understandable in her personality and while she sometimes seems naive you can also see she understands the nature of what's going on and has a more understanding of the actions needed to survive then you might suspect from a young teenager.The game also allows you to upgrade a little like the new Tomb Raider from weapons to first aid equipment and also like with Uncharted you can fight if needed unarmed so you're not helpless if you have no ammo though you are at a disadvantage.So for those looking for another great game from Naughty Dog here it is and trust me you'll get your dose of action/drama/tragdedy/humor(Not much) that will have you playing this game for hours without noticing how much time has passed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0GF72","description":"","reviewerName":"M.","summary":"Surprisingly exciting and innovative for a remake","reviewText":"When Wind Waker HD was first announced, I was unsure of whether or not I would buy it. But I ended up having to pre-order it later on in order to get Gamestop's exclusive collector's edition with the special Ganondorf figurine. I'm really not a huge fan of remakes, so I wasn't expecting an excessive amount of excitement to come out of the game, I just had to get it for collector's purposes. But once I started playing, I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, the graphics aren't just updated. Instead, it seems like a whole new art style, having a less cel-shaded, more HD look, while still maintaining the cartoonish feel. Also, the gamepad actually is extremely useful, allowing you to do all sorts of things. Sure, the gyro controls may not be the greatest, but having all your maps and items right in front of you without even having to pause the game is a real time-saver. Plus there are a couple other fun things about the gamepad, like being able to swipe the Wind Waker's directions on the touch screen. What I find the most fun is to use both the gamepad AND the pro controller (yes, you can do that!) at the same time. In fact, I found the pro controller to be even more comfortable than the Gamecube controller. Another thing is the Tingle Bottles. You can write messages or draw pictures, and put them in bottles for other players to receive. If you have nothing to do, it's fun just sailing around and seeing what's inside the bottles. The music is the same as the Gamecube version, just higher quality (definitely not a complaint, Wind Waker's music is amazing!). Also some sound effects have been changed, to give the game a more definitive Wii U feel. Another thing about the game is that Hero Mode, a more difficult version of the original, is available right from the beginning for veteran players. The new Swift Sail is also incredibly useful, allowing you to sail much faster. Miiverse is also really cool with this game, because you can post \"selfies\" of Link with different facial expressions complete with a caption for you to write. I'm not this far in the game yet, but I've also heard that you can store a lot more photographs in your Picto Box, making it easier to complete your figurine collection in the Nintendo Gallery. I would definitely recommend this game, especially the collector's edition, to any Nintendo fan, adventure game fan, or Wii U owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXGU8","description":"","reviewerName":"Courtney L. Osborn","summary":"A Good Change From A Typical Shooter","reviewText":"Intro:Crysis 3 is the third game in a cool franchise of post apocalyptic alien shooters and is arguably the most enjoyable, in my opinion. The Crysis games are not your typical &#8220;bro-shooters&#8221;, like Call of Duty or Halo, that everyone plays. Instead, they are a mix of loose storytelling and badass gameplay set in a crazy, and hopefully fake, future on Earth.Story:The story of the Crysis games is set in the distant future after an alien race has invaded and destroyed most of Earth. Full cities have become forests or gravel wastelands and are crawling with alien predators looking to hunt you down. You do not need to play the previous two games in order to know what is going on in this game because it gives you a brief recap at the beginning; though it makes it more meaningful if you have played them. You play as a character named Prophet who is in control of a cyborg-like body armor suit and are tasked with (you probably guessed it already) saving the world from the aliens. Crysis 3 improves the story from the last game by giving you a sidekick named Psycho to interact with and make you feel much more human. This actually makes the player care more for the story than in the last few games because they no longer carelessly drop you into a level and give you an objective to complete.Presentation:The graphics of the Crysis series has been the most talked about part over the past several years. Each time a new Crysis game releases, all people can talk about is how they have never seen a more beautiful game, and this game is no different. Not only is this game beautiful and realistic, but it has some of the most stunning scenes to admire and be a part of. I can only imagine what this game must be like on a super powered PC instead of a PS3.photo 131014-0854-51.jpgGameplay:I loved the gameplay of Crysis 3 for many reasons. The ability to switch between super strong body armor and an invisible cloak instantly returns in this game and can change any fire fight into a different experience for every player. Sometimes you might feel like stealthily creeping through a level and silently assassinating enemies, or maybe you just acquired a big gun and feel like going in guns-a-blazing with your souped-up body armor; either way it is fun to try the levels differently. Each level is made up of a humongous area, both in length and height. You can creep underneath buildings or climb them, in most cases, which adds to the multitude of options in which you can complete each level. You also have several different weapons in which you can upgrade, as well as body suit upgrades, and different types of ammo for weapons, including your predator bow (which was my favorite weapon by the way).photo 131014-0951-45.jpgThe Verdict: 8.0 out of 10.0This game was honestly just really fun to play. The story is not super enticing, but it is set on a really interesting future version of our planet. The graphics are stunning which was to be expected of a Crysis game. The gameplay is what really pulled me in for my 8 hours of playtime through the campaign mode. I loved trying to beat levels in different ways by using different ammo for my bow, trying to go invisibly under a level, or just turning on my body armor and running up to everyone firing my assault rifle like crazy. If you need a good first person shooter that is different from your typical bro-shooter, this is the game for you. It was exciting from start to finish, and you won&#8217;t regret the experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00B67ZTUW","description":"","reviewerName":"Arch Stanton","summary":"A Worthy Addition to the Tales Series","reviewText":"Tales of Xilia is a lot like other games in the Tales series. Whether you liked those previous games or not will play a big part in whether you appreciate this game. To those coming at the game fresh, the Tales games are a JRPG series that goes back to the mid-90s. Along with Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest it is one of the top three series in Japan. It has a lot of standard JRPG elements with a few interesting twists. For example instead of fighting through turn-based combat the game goes into a battle mode where you fight the enemy in a more traditional action-game style. Other commonalities are centered around the plot, which generally features two worlds connected through some means, as well as bureaucratic religious organizations and Anime-like characters.When I say this game is like previous incarnations I mean it. There are very few additions or improvements to the basic gameplay mechanic. Which is fine really, as the series had a pretty good mechanic to begin with. The only change from earlier games is that the overworld map is gone, replaced by basic paths to other levels. I kind of miss the overworld, which while cheesy I never minded. It was a cheesy I could accept. The style of the game is heavily Anime-inspired, which I really like. The look of Fennmont city and the wonderful ships absolutely took my breath away. This seems to be the most popular approach since they first tried it inTales of Symphonia, although they rely less on cell-shading now. It provides an easily recognizable style for these games. There are some elements that are a little bit too familiar however. I'm getting a bit tired of how the main character always looks exactly the same except for occasional changes of hair color. Jude in this game looks Asbel fromTales of Gracesbut with darker hair. I don't just mean faces, Jude's costume is just a black-dyed version of Asbel's which was in turn identical to Luke's fromTales of the Abyss. I miss the days of unique character designs.That said, the plot can always be relied upon to be complex and unique. I've never seen a franchise able to keep so much of the same style while making each entry uniquely different. This game is no exception. I will say that it has a much slower start than some of the previous games. As much as I love the beautiful city of Fennmont, they don't do much with it at the beginning. When the action does pick up it seemed a bit unbelievable and forced. As with previous games in the series the plot can move a bit too slow at times so that they can drag the game out for 40+ hours when it really only deserves half that. There are the usual moments where one character could explain the entire plot from the very beginning, but they decline to because the plot says so. If this didn't ruin previous games there's no reason it should ruin this one. Just be prepared for the plot to continue for longer than you expect.The characters in this game don't shine as much as previous games. Alvin is a good deal of fun as the adventurous rogue, but he's the main one to stand out. Milla (as one of the two possible PCs) had the potential and dialogue to stand out, but the voice actress is so flat and uninspired that she drains all energy from the character. Jude (the other possible PC) seems to be the logical development of the Tales series protagonists. He has no personality apart from being very Japanese, and all the characters seem much more impressed with him than he deserves. He does get some moments to prove himself later on, but they come too late to prevent this early impression. You know that picture of him looking cocky and confident on the cover? Don't expect to see him act like that in the game. He's quite meek and unassuming. The main character advancement is a typical coming-of-age story, where the lead must learn to grow up and take responsibility for himself. A lot of this is cultural so it may make more sense in Japan, but I find it a bit wearisome and yearn for the days of Yuri inTales of Vesperia, who knew how to handle himself and was going through a different struggle. This game and Graces have really over-focused on the coming-of-age story.Another amusing quirk of these games is the names. They range from perfect and fantastical to ridiculously out of place. Character names tend to be taken from Western sources, but since they're all just cool sounds to a Japanese audience they can be hilariously out of context. Thus for the leads we get the relatively normal Western name Jude for the hero but Maxwell for the heroine. Maxwell is technically her last name, but since nobody is really on a first name basis with a goddess they always refer to her that way. Then you get the cities and or organizations which are given either awesome made up names like Rashugal, or else utterly random names like Exodus (replacing the somewhat more random Japanese Ark Noah). These names don't symbolize anything, they're just there because the creators thought they sounded cool.As with previous games, the best bits are the random character skits that pop up throughout. These show up as a message at the bottom-left of your screen and you hit the select button to watch them. Then you get to watch a brief skit as the characters chat to each other in animated 2D images. They are insightful, frequently amusing, and always worth it.I wouldn't normally complain about the graphics in a game like this, which isn't trying to tax the graphics engine at all and is more intent on looking pretty than looking expensive. And indeed, the locations and characters look perfect with just the right balance between necessary 3D models and Anime character designs. The problem isn't with the looks, it's with the extremely outdated level design. As I said before, none of the graphics in here come even close to stressing the PS3's capabilities, so why does each new area require changing screens? Sure, it's done almost instantly because the PS3 can handle it, but why does it exist at all? The PS3 is more than capable of handling levels twice the size of even the largest one here without it being split into sections. But here you go a hundred feet and the screen will cut to a different model as characters slowly appear to populate it. They're just lazily recycling the engine from earlier games designed for systems that couldn't handle it. I understand that this is the first Tales game designed for the PS3 (Tales of Graces is a port from the Wii) but they should know better than that. It's a lot more irritating than it sounds, possibly because the rest of the game feels so fluid and natural that these constant pauses remind us that it's a game.Overall I liked this game a lot, but I felt it was relying too much on elements from previous games. It's almost like a Greatest Hits album at some points. I understand that this is the most popular game in the series in Japan, so future installments are likely to borrow much from this. I do hope that they make some improvements the next time round. I enjoyed this one despite its failings, but too many more that suffer from the same problems and that tolerance will likely fade.

The controls on a mouse and keyboard are garbage.  You collect combos and new moves throughout the game, but they don't really work.  The mouse clicks don't register properly.  It would have been better if they'd utilized one of the many keyboard keys for each move.  Also, the controls in general are seemingly set up by someone who's never played a PC game before.  There is a pretty ubiquitous standard for these things, but Square-Enix says \"screw all that\" and assigns buttons at random and in groups.  It's a mess, and it's more work to play than it needs to be.  Besides all that, there are tons of general bugs and glitches, like characters not reacting when they should, often stopping missions in their tracks.  There are pathfinding glitches, crashes, and all kinds of weirdness that makes it obvious that the game was rushed out the door.  It's pitiful that this stuff hasn't been patched in the year+ since its release, but they've found plenty of time to make new DLC content to sell us.  Most of which is buggy as hell and barely works.  That's how games are these days.  They're all assembly line material, made as quickly as possible, hyped to hell, and then abandoned.  Nowadays the good ideas in games seem accidental, and the fun comes in spite of the people who make them.All that said, I've had a lot of fun with this game anyway.  It breaks my heart that its makers didn't care enough about it to do it right, but what they have left us with is worth playing if you can get a good price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2014"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Half-decent cash-in attempt that's way too short","reviewText":"Remember how just a few weeks back X-Men Origins: Wolverine managed to kind of restore your faith in licensed games?  Well, playing Terminator: Salvation will bring you back down to Earth, as it is as much a cash-in game as you could hope to find.  That's not to say that it isn't any good, as it does offer some occasional engaging gameplay, but other than that, the game is too short and too unpolished to be anything other than a rental at best.  Once you get past the fact that the game looks pretty good and features a suitably gloomy atmosphere as you trek through a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, you realize that the game's overly simplistic and repetitive gameplay becomes more apparent than anything else.  Shoot, cover, shoot some more.  That's all that Terminator: Salvation boils down to in the end.  That's not to say that it isn't done particularly well, which it kind of is, it's just that at it's heart that's all the game really is in the end.  Combine that with the fact that the game is incredibly short and is definitely not worth the full retail price (not to mention the fact that there's no online multiplayer either), and you get the kind of relatively half-decent, cash-in, licensed game that we should come to expect by now.  That being said, if you're a Terminator fan, Terminator: Salvation is worth a look, but in the end, the game is best left on the shelf instead.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0086V5V9A","description":"","reviewerName":"DrNegative","summary":"Great game","reviewText":"I had by doubts that Ubisoft would deliver on this one.As a vet of the series and having put some time into it, I must say they cut a beautiful gem. The rumors of the game taking less emphasis on stealth were quickly proven false, you can complete an entire mission undetected with making one kill, in fact the game rewards you higher for doing it this way in contrast to going Rambo. There is nothing wrong with that, but 'Ghost' has always been my preferred playstyle and it is quite fun. Subduing the bad guys from the shadows of a door is bliss. The animations are fluid and spot on.Ubi added a touch RPG elements to the mix, you can earn money to customize your gear, loadouts, and your HQ which is a high tech C130 aircraft called the Paladin. Upgrades the Paladin helps you on your mission in a variety of little ways, like putting enemies on your minimap for example. I thought the customization and upgrade system was a nice touch to the series.The graphics, sound, and music are all superb. Ambient music cues whenever certain actions are taken are spot on and add the rush at certain points. I recommend installing the HD texture pack from Disc 2 if asked, it really pushes current gen to its boundaries in that department. Looks beautiful. I was at first disheartened from the lose of Ironside for Fisher's voice, but admittedly I must say I have warmed up to the new voice. The new voice actor did a great job.Social features such as friends, leaderboards, and challenges add another dynamic to the mix that I really like. The game will sometimes challenge me to beat my buddies' best in score or time on the solo campaign or kills and hacks on multiplayer for a cash reward. Special co-op missions are also available for those that wanna try missions with a buddy.I have always been a fan of Spy vs. Merc from the series, particularly from Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory. It's nice to see they listened to the fans and brought it back. They made a lot of nice innovations to it, and they also included a \"classic\" mode for those who preferred the old style. That leads me to my one complaint: classic SvM isn't truly 'classic'. I'm glad it's even in there as an option, but I was hoping for a more retro experience with it. The team should have looked at its predecessors more deeply in that aspect. The spy is also a little too powerful...the prior games had always encouraged stealth by limiting spy kills to behind the back neck grabs, but when you have a ninja that can \"taze & knife\" or 1-hit melee kill from any direction 6 feet away, why be sneaky?  I have to knock off a star for this.Overall it's a 4-star package and I'm having a lot of fun with it. I now have a restored faith in Ubisoft when it comes to this series, but the SvM multiplayer, despite its grand return, isn't quite where it should be in my opinion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2013"}

Also get several different types of not only guns (like the Tommy Gun, Shot Gun, Grenade Thrower and Chemical Thrower) but also different types of ammo (like Armor Piercing, Explosive Shot, Freeze Shot and Electric Shot).- Interact with the environment; electrocute water (and the people standing in it), use telekinesis to throw and move objects (even throw a rocket back at its shooter, this effect works very much like the Gravity Gun in Half-Life 2), set up booby traps like electric trip wires, land minds, as well as spring pads.- Great A.I. that not only can really fight back and set up tactics (like flanking and covering) but also stalk the player to sneak up and try to kill the player. Also note that the enemies will not always try to kill you but sometimes try to kill each other, seeing as there are many groups that are at war with each other in this game. Another noted effect is that the enemies will flee when losing a fight and go to an ammo/health pick-up machine in order to even their odds (you can also ahead of time booby trap said machines).- Great and realistic sounds effect, which really help drive mood as well as theme, also note that the music ranges from period pieces that drive the games theme (like Papa loves Mambo, and Unforgettable) and mood pieces that help establish the horror/action atmosphere of the game.- Top notch voice acting that really drive home the games story, setting, era, and mood, note that some voice-overs are not only passionate and memorable but will creepy you out.BAD:- Some might feel that the endings (one good and one bad) are a lack-luster compared to the rest of the game.- System hacking mini game (which plays like the old game Pipe Dream on Game boy) might get old/annoying after a while.- Game is fairly linear, which will make replays of this game less enjoyable to some players.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A unique style which is a mix of Art Deco, industrial, and something all its own.- The game takes place in 1960 but a Sci-Fi theme runs through out, with things like flying robots and underwater cities. It should be noted that nothing here feels out of place and tacked on (think something like the movies Dark City or Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow).- Most of this games story comes in the form of spoken dialog from either audiotapes you pick up and listen to or people who talk to you over your short-range radio, this is how most of this games story is played out and told, although you can skip the audiotapes if you want, but you will also be skipping most of the story (the story brings to mind books like The Shining and 1984).- Fight characters called \"Big Daddies\"/\"Mr. Bubbles\" who are huge monstrous creatures that look like they got on heavily armored diving suites from the 1930's; these guys/things are tough and will take all your power and skill to defeat (think the Nemesis from Resident Evil 3). After you beat them you get either kill or save another creature called the \"little sisters\" which are these 5 year old looking little girls, it should be noted that these \"little sisters\" are filled with a power source (a genetic material called ADAM) that your character needs to level up.- Switching between plasmids or weapons on the fly can be a bit frustrating in combat unless you hold down the Left/Right bumpers (think of theses like the Xbox 360's versions of R1 and L1), doing this will pause the game and left you pick your weapon and plasmid.GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- System Shock (PC)- Fallout (PC)- Condemned: Criminal Origins (360)- Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion (PC, 360, PS3)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- There is a demo out for this game on Xbox Live Marketplace.- In the limited collector's edition you get a \"Big Daddy\" figure (they are one of the more noted characters of the game, who look like they wear those old time diving suites) you will also find a DVD that has videos with the \"the Making of Bioshock\" documentaries and it even comes with Soundtrack.- Originally the \"little sisters\" characters were supposes to be a type of sea slug, but it was change to look like a little girl so the player (you) would have a conflicting emotion about if you should kill them (the \"little sisters\") and take their power or let them go and not get much power.- The books and ideas that inspired the story of this game came from the novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand.- This game is also on the PC.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2007"}

Buy it!...that is probably all you need for a review...but that's not a review really. Anyways, if you don't know the plot of BioShock then you've been living under a rock for the past few months. You play a nobody who crashes in a plane and discovers Rapture...a failed underwater city who's founder, Andrew Ryan, turns crazy and all the people of Rapture have gone nuts. They goes nuts due to the plasmids they use to gain powers. Also, the ADAM that can make you turn into anything you want is very valuable and is the key to Rapture. The Little Sisters gather the ADAM and the Bid Daddies protect them. The story is full of plot twists and secrets. It's probably one of the most original stories in any game period. The gameplay is like the average shooter...if you want it to be or can it can be a genetically enhanced one. That's the beauty of BioShock. It can be anything you want it to be...boring, fun, stupid, lame it's all up to you. The graphics in BioShock are the best in any game we've seen so far and the voice acting is superb and amazing. The game is very surreal and it just sucks you in. The big thing here is the gene splicing and all the plasmids. There are so many of them and you can do whatever you want with them. You can shoot fire from your hands or freeze your enemy with an ice blast. There are others as well that let you gain more health or hack turrets and safes better and faster. There is just so much detail here it's nuts. You can use a camera and research your enemies to learn their weakness and gain new plasmids and tonics. The only disappointment was the lack of any multiplayer what-so-ever. All you can do it play this game to experience the true beauty of it all.

{"product_name":"B002V14VOC","reviewerName":"Dan Leithauser","summary":"Fun, but frustrating at times","reviewText":"Metro 2033 is a post apocalyptic hike through a desolate Moscow.  During the first half of the game, you spend much of your time in the dark shadows, trying to stay out of trouble in order to conserve what little ammo you can find, buy, or take off the ones you kill.  Trade currency is military grade ammo as opposed to the dirty ammo you usually use in your weapons, and it is exceedingly rare.  As the game progresses, ammo comes in cases, and is worth looking around for.The variety of available weapons is pretty good, with hand guns, assault rifles, shotguns, and pneumatic guns. Lots of modifications are available including scopes, larger clips, and silencers.  There are also throwing knives for those really silent kills.The real fun here is the atmosphere.  It is dark most of the time, but the central areas are rich in activity.  The sound while playing through headphones was at times very atmospheric and spooky, really adding to that atmosphere.The other part, both frustrating and fun, is how you need to survive in the game.  You need to periodically charge batteries or weapons with a hand charger. Finding the slim supply of military grade ammo is frustrating, especially when you really want to buy a new stealth or armor suit...everything seems just out of reach in the first half of the game, without sacrificing something else.  Replacing gas masks before suffocating puts a time limit on some activities.  In the second half of the game, currency is irrelevant - as things are just found or given.Fighting head on is mostly discouraged when you are alone.  Staying in the shadows and taking pot shots was most effective for me, but the game forces direct confrontation just when you have little ammo or air.  I found much of my time was spent shooting out lights, hiding, and using my night vision, along with sticking with weapons that tended to be lower on the noise.  There were nice opportunities to sneak by enemies, as long as you watched where you were stepping.  The slightest crack of broken glass sends everything after you.  There were a number of sequences that were extremely frustrating, and seemingly only one way to get through them - mostly the ones that seemed to initially encourage stealth and turned into direct shotgun affairs.  Why shotguns?  Notably because once you are out of just about everything else there seems to be a shot gun to pick up and shot gun rounds are more plentiful than anything else.The variation between fighting, following, and being able to look around without threats was well balanced, as were the puzzles associated with some tasks.  The linear nature of the game keeps you on track.  The few places to explore they are usually worth it, and your companions will wait.Graphically, Metro 2033 is a beautiful looking and rich game.  Equally and as expected, frame rate and play were challenged by intermittent slow down, sometimes for no particular reason, recovering later (or not).  This game, based on forum discussions, at its high to very high resolutions, rivals Crysis in requiring the highest end video card to run at a playable frame rate.  I never saw those resolutions.  I have an Asus G50 laptop with an Nvidia GS9800M.  For Metro 2032 I have to run in Normal, DX10, and 1440 x 900, and even then sometimes I have to drop back to Low settings... otherwise things just slow down uncontrollably.  Not to worry though, Metro 2032 is a beautiful game even at the lowest resolutions.  Probably makes me go out and buy a new computer though...Metro 2033 is a fun graphically rich game.  It is a comparatively short play, it took me around 40 hours to finish (and I died a lot, requiring lots of backing up).  At the current deal price, it is worth a pick up and play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2010"}

Now usually, those bundle deals have all of the mediocre N64 games in them that no one wants to buy individually. However, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is easily one of the best N64 games I've ever played.Story: The game appears to take place between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars universe. You're Luke Skywalker, the original trilogy's protagonist and a fighter pilot for the Rebel Alliance. You'll help people with vital intelligence defect from the Empire, protect Rebel-allied cities, and of course fight the Empire!Gameplay: Unfortunately, you never get to wield a light saber or anything. That's not what this game is about. It's a space-shooter. You travel to different planets in your X-wing or  one of the other Rebel spaceships and do missions.Sound: There may be an N64 game with more audio than Rogue Squadron, but I've never played it, if so (and I've played entirely too many of them :P). There's so much voice-acting. There's lengthy descriptions of every ship in the Rebel Fleet, backstories for Rogue Squadron's fighter pilots, and of course in-level communication between the pilots.Graphics: It's a very nice job by Factor 5, here. Of course it looks dated by now, but in the grand scheme of things, I'd say it's aged pretty gracefully. Make sure you have an expansion pack for your system to get the full effect.Replay Value: You get medals for doing well enough in every stage. I'm told that if you get medals in every stage, you can unlock secret missions like the Battle of Hoth from Empire Strikes back and the Death Star run. If that's not incentive to beat this game 100%, what is?It's clearly a classic N64 game, worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Goldeneye64 and Ocarina of Time. I'd only that having a decent N64 analog helps.. a lot. If your controller's analog is dying due to wear and tear, you'll have a hard time towards the end of the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2012"}

[...] is THE place for info regarding the Suikoden games, as well as info for upcoming releases, series games not released in the US, and even the excellent novel, \"Outlaws of the Marsh\" (on which the games are based). No, I don't work for the website, I'm merely a satisfied customer.It is a shame that the game has been delayed AGAIN (judging from the release date up top; I had heard that it would be here in November, then in January, and now we're up to March). The game has been out in Japan for some time; Konami is typically bad about bringing this series over (anyone who bought Suikoden II, maybe five of you , may remember the delays and the still-persisting bugs - here's hoping they get it right), but you can read about the game on the website above.About the game, well, it is set on the Island nations (the home of Amada from Suikoden II), about 150 years before the events of the original Suikoden. You (the main character) are the inheritor of the terrible Rune of Punishment, one of the 27 true runes, but seemingly the worst of the bunch. Sure, the rune gives you power, but at the cost of sapping your life (most runes grant eternal life) until you die, at which point the rune finds another unlucky bearer. I can't say much more, since I refuse to read through the entire plot summary before I play the game, but if you must know, suikosource is the place to go.Yes, I am culling together info from websites, so don't lambast me! Think of my scoring as a potential score - I am a fan of the Suikoden series, and the info I have found makes this game appear really good! Of course, I was a bit disappointed with the third game (as were the makers - check out some of their interviews!), but I have high hopes for this newest installment. Happy gaming (er, in March)!!Addendum: I reviewed this game before it came out, but I still think it was quite good. Many of the reviewers here have underrated this game, in my opinion. Yes, there are flaws in the game mechanics (most notably is the insanely high encounter rate while you trudge out to sea - this is pretty much corrected once you recruit Viki and obtain the Glowing Hand (Blinking) Mirror for teleportation, but for some reason, the game designers won't let you teleport to key game destinations). However, I like the storyline (particularly after a 2nd runthrough) and the battle mechanics. I like many of the characters present in the story (indeed, Snowe Vingerhut is quite nicely developed, and the addition of Ted was a good idea as well). Suikoden has suffered immensely, graphically, from its transition to 3-D (the characters and backgrounds seem washed out and dull, and the Stars of Destiny don't differ that much from common folk). Nonetheless, I found this game much more enjoyable than the 3rd outing (the triple character system seemed to hurt the development of the storyline). I think this underrated game deserves a chance, particularly at the price that Amazon has it at!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2004"}

Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance marks the series' seventh installment overall, and the fifth on a handheld console. While a vast majority of the Kingdom Hearts games have been spinoffs of the primary two (with KH3 being so long delayed), oftentimes featuring storylines of side characters that generally add up to prequels or epilogues, Dream Drop Distance returns to the core storylines of main characters Sora and Riku, although it's never made entirely clear where this particular timeline falls (it is rumored, however, that this game's ending ties directly into KH3, which series director Tetsuya Nomura has supposedly insisted will be the next release). The Kingdom Hearts storyline as a whole is rather convoluted and a bit melodramatic, but very moving and thought-provoking nonetheless. For those initially unfamiliar with the finer details (like myself-this is admittedly the first KH title I've personally played), all you need to know for now is this: best friends Sora and Riku are prompted by the powerful wizard Master Yen Sid (the elderly wizard from Disney's Fantasia) to take the Mark of Mastery Exam in preparation for an approaching threat to multiple worlds. Although they both have already been awarded keyblades, powerful weapons used to correct the balance between light and darkness in the world as needed, they must complete this test before they may be deemed true Keyblade Masters and gain access to the power they'll need for the evil that approaches. This test requires them to enter a series of worlds which were in one timeline destroyed by the Heartless (physical manifestations of darkness, beings devoid of emotion, oftentimes in the guises of Disney and Final Fantasy-themed villains throughout the series) and then restored, but somewhere in between fell into a deep sleep that rendered them incapable of connecting with one another. In an effort to properly \"awaken\" and interconnect the worlds to restore balance once again, Sora and Riku must unlock the seven Sleeping Keyholes, each of which lies somewhere within a sleeping world.Early on in this test, the bright-eyed Sora and brooding Riku are separated from one another, hurled into separate versions of the same worlds. This adds up to separate but interconnecting timelines in which different events occur in the same locations/periods, which also ties directly into the gameplay: in KH3D, you'll spend half the time playing as Sora and half the time playing as Riku, each of whom maintains his own separate progression in each world. This is a unique feature that also incorporates the new \"Drop\" system, which sets off a timer each time you begin adventuring with one of the two heroes. This `timer' comes in the form of the Drop Gauge, which slowly depletes but can reduce or increase quicker depending on what types of items or techniques you use. Once the Drop Gauge hits zero and your time's up, your current character will \"Drop,\" at which point he'll immediately stop whatever it is he's doing and retreat into a sleeping state; then the storyline will switch and you can begin playing as the other character with his own renewed Drop Gauge. This might sound wonky at first but it actually adds an exciting sense of urgency and time progression, encouraging you not to neglect one storyline in favor of the other (they both thankfully tend to remain pretty engaging). You can use items such as Drop-Me-Nots to extend the duration of your Drops, and you can also Drop at will as needed, but keep in mind what you do in one storyline can sometimes affect the other: throughout battles you'll collect Drop Points, which can be used at the end of each Drop to give various boosts to the character you're switching over to, such as increases in attack power, defense, Drop duration and more. You sometimes won't be able to advance to the next section of the world map until you complete a world with both Sora and Riku, so there are many tactical decisions to consider throughout each Drop. My only gripe about this feature is the fact that if you Drop during a boss battle, you'll have to start it over when you Drop back, which can expectedly be really obnoxious, especially for lengthy ones. Because of this I'd recommend keeping watch of your Drop Gauge especially before specific encounters and equipping Drop-Me-Nots as needed.The combat in KH3D is very fast-paced and exciting, and definitely among the game's brightest highlights. Somewhat like a mish-mash of popular MMOs, Kid Icarus: Uprising and various Legend of Zelda titles, you'll rely on different types of melee weapons (i.e. keyblades) and magic spells to attack enemies from either afar or in the fray. KH3D marks the return of the battle deck, a handy system that allows you to set a customizable series of attacks and abilities for use on the battlefield. You can create separate decks (such as one focused mainly on fire-based attacks, one mainly on healing HP, a balanced mix of everything, etc.) and whip them out from the Pause menu as needed. The deck automatically switches through your magic in the order you select from the deck creation menu as you use each ability; you can also use the D-pad to manually backtrack or swap around mid-combat to particular ones, but each move has a cooldown period you'll have to wait through before a successive use. Expectedly, very powerful/useful abilities have longer cooldowns, so you'll have to consider this when building your decks. There are a vast variety of magic abilities, with spells that can set foes aflame, freeze them, trap them in midair gravity vortexes, home in on them from afar, cure your HP or relieve you of status conditions and much more. Veterans of the series will fondly remember the igniting Firaga, electrifying Thundara and ever-useful Curaga. As you progress through the game you'll earn different and increasingly powerful magic spells for your deck in addition to new keyblades for slashing melee strikes. The X button is used to call forth magic spells from your deck while the A button initiates physical attacks and keyblade combos. With several dozen types of enemies and bosses with varying resistances and weaknesses (as you might expect, water-based foes tend to feel the hurt against electricity and icy enemies don't fancy fire), there's a lot to consider (and enjoy).An importantly integrated new feature is that of the Dream Eaters, colorful, cuddly critters found commonly as both friends and foes throughout the game. Friendly Dream Eaters are known as Spirits, and they will be absolutely essential to your arsenal in combat. You can create Spirits from Dream Pieces you gather as you battle, and there are a great deal of recipes that make for all types of useful creatures, whether it be an HP-recovering flower or ferocious T-Rex. This adds a very Pok&eacute;mon-esque element to the game as you level up your Spirits to become stronger and gain new powerful abilities as they fight alongside you in each and every battle. You'll use a Final Fantasy-inspired Ability Link table to progressively unlock new abilities, which will also have direct effects on Sora and Riku. Spirit abilities can in fact come in the form of stat boosts, so using certain Spirits who've gained certain abilities can allow increased resistances to certain attack types or even immunities to certain status conditions. In other words, these little guys can offer both an offensive and defensive edge. They can also unlock brand new magic spells for Sora and Riku to use, in addition to their own attacks to initiate mid-battle. In order to increase a Spirit's Link Points (used to progress through their Ability Link table and gain new abilities), you'll have to play with and feed them, very similar to a Nintendog or a Tamagotchi. You do so by petting them on the touchscreen with your stylus from the pause menu, which is also where you can toss them cakes, cookies and other treats to increase their stats. While it's adorable at first, it becomes tedious as the game progresses, and the fact that it's the only way to push Spirits to their maximum potential becomes pretty obnoxious. Thankfully the Spirits are at least very nice to look at, with quite literally every one sporting colorful, detailed and ultra-cute designs (you'll be very motivated to catch `em all). Be warned, by the way: prevent your Spirit from dying in battle at all costs, because if it does, it reverts back into Dream Pieces. You can recreate it, but it will lose all of its learned abilities and start back at its initial level. Luckily you'll be warned when they're in danger, and you'll have the opportunity to go save them (this also won't be a problem nearly as often as you might think unless you take low level Spirits into intense fights).One of the greatest features of Spirits is the ability you'll have to \"Link\" with them; as they fight with you and gain affinity for you (which happens as you battle with them often, play with and feed them), their Link Gauge, which is displayed on the touchscreen, increases. Once it's hit its maximum, you can tap the Spirit's icon to Link with it, which can cause one of two in-battle events depending on who you're playing as. Sora becomes able to initiate a series of super-attacks (or one single powerful one) with the Spirit itself for a certain period, while Riku physically merges with the Spirit and gains one of its abilities himself. If both Link Gauges are full, you can even Link with both of your Spirits at once for an even more devastating Link attack. The Link abilities range from showering the battlefield in damaging light while fully healing your entire party to swishing around with bat wings and initiating lethal dark magic-infused combos. The individual and combo Links vary depending on your Spirits, and it's great fun to experiment with them and their bedazzling visuals.Another new feature exclusive to KH3D is Flowmotion, a unique ability that allows Sora and Riku to air dash and launch themselves off walls to climb up them, attack enemies, or move very quickly throughout the area. You can also use Flowmotion to swing around poles or slide along grind rails. This is a very welcome addition and should in all honesty become a series staple, as it allows for fantastic maneuverability and thrilling battle sequences. Although it can feel unwieldy at first, once you've practiced a bit you just might start to wonder how you progressed through any game ever without it. Reality Shifts, meanwhile, allow Sora and Riku to enter portals that allow them to bend the rules of time and space; activate one and gameplay will shift to the touchscreen, initiating one of several mini-games (they differ by world) tying into the current theme; cracking codes in Tron: Legacy's Grid will allow you to manipulate surrounding technology, while you can create unhappy comic endings for cartoony baddies in the Country of the Musketeers. Features like this offer some very exciting gameplay changeups throughout.As KH fans have surely come to expect, you'll progress through a series of Disney-themed worlds featuring familiar scenery, characters and self-contained story arcs (the best of which tie into the central plot). Tron: Legacy and Pinocchio all make for beautiful backdrops, but I was never personally the biggest fan of Hunchback of Notre Dame (although it does make for some well-designed stage terrain and shockingly dark storyline action), and The Three Musketeers was flat out a poor choice (it is overall the dullest, most inane world here). The Fantasia world in particular, however, features an array of intoxicating visual splendor, and the fact that most sound effects are shut off in favor of the warmly familiar musical scores makes for a truly immersive thematic experience. The thrilling, heart-racing, generally epic boss battles at the end of each world are among the game's most memorable highlights, featuring once again a mix of Disney/Square Enix-themed baddies. You'll see some awesome familiar faces in addition to some startling new ones.Along the lines of flaws, there certainly are a few but thankfully nothing prevents the game from being generally great. For one, the game unfortunately sports a particularly wonky and uncooperative camera that ordinarily has to be manually moved to the direction most people would prefer (a problem I've heard has actually been plaguing most of the series). You can lock on to specific enemies to make focal points easier to keep track of, but occasionally your lock will seemingly cancel at random, which can prove very frustrating in intense boss battles. Additionally, while most of this RPG's platforming is pretty smooth, oddball ticks in stage environments can make for off-kilter interaction, as you may be unable to jump on or Flowmotion across certain things you'd strongly expect to be able to. There are also odd and vaguely sporadic instances of lag after using certain attacks and particularly after blocking attacks; Sora and Riku will sometimes behave as though they are briefly stunned from shielding, particularly after using several successive attacks or when there's a lot going on. Whether this was intentional or not, at its worst your movement will feel clunky in spurts (which can be a total buzzkill in the frantic pace of certain boss fights). Keep in mind, however, that KH3D's strengths so far outshine its weaknesses that very, very few players are likely to walk away sincerely saying they were wholeheartedly dissatisfied with the overall experience.KH3D as a whole is overall glorious to behold, with beautifully rendered cutscenes featuring spot-on voice acting (much of the star-studded original cast returns) and a generally gorgeous visual style ensuring you're never bored with what you see onscreen. This game really shows what the 3DS is capable of, and what will hopefully be further utilized in the future. Although its storyline strays a bit far from the core plot at times and will definitely confuse newbies, everything comes together during its particularly epic conclusion, as things fluidly segue into what all KH fans have been eagerly waiting for. Whether you're a dedicated longtime fan or a 3DS owner looking for some fast-paced, aesthetically pleasing action, Kingdom Hearts 3D is an absolute must-have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2012"}

Be different, demand better! This is a message brought to you by me, nonrelated to this game.GAME REVIEWI've been playing this game for about a week or so. I have played Gran Turismo 2 and 3 before and started Forza for the first time. This is an opinionated review about how I feel about this game.This game is well made, the graphics is nice and all, however my experience with this game has not been very pleasant. It's not that there's anything wrong with the disc or my system. I was expecting to enjoy this game a lot, however, I found it to be one of the most unpleasant, stressful, anger inducing game ever. I like racing simulation games, but either this game is too real or not real enough, I have found the gameplay to be ridiculously frustrating.I'll elaborate and also add some flaws:1. Saving. This thing has autosave, once you buy a car or buy certain upgrades, you're stuck with it if you let the autosave kick in. You cannot buy a car and upgrade it and test it out and see if it's good first and if it's not reset your game and try another car. Once you buy the car, you're stuck with it and the consequences of buying it.2. Tuning is just crazy in this game, but I've seen it in GT and such, but you have to be quite knowledgable in tuning to get it right. A lot of time is wasted, imo, in just sitting around and tuning it. Tuning is hard because sometimes you can't tell the difference or it's simply because you're driving bad in one race and good the next. I find it hard, it's probably just me.3. I spent 3 hours or so trying to beat the first track, partially because I didn't know about the tuning option because I was new at the time. However, after tuning I would expect that turning would be a lot easier. However, this was not the case. If a fully upgraded car has problems turning a U or L shaped turn at 50-70 mph, then you got issues. I find myself continuously spinning out of control, tuning doesn't seem to do too much. I suppose this is a personal thing hence this is a personal review. It just might happen to you too. Also, you got to watch out for ur opponents accidently nugging you. One nug means losing control, smashing into the wall, and ruining your race. Resetting is a continuously option you must choose if you play this game.4. Again with the autosaving issue. Many of the races require a specific class of car, a specific weight requirement, model type, HP limit, etc. That requires you to buy cars and upgrades. However, cars can be expensive and the upgrades maybe even more. I fully upgrade one of my cars (sometimes u should and sometimes you shouldn't fully upgrade base on race requirements) and it costs me about 30-40K give or take. Now, autosave is the issue because you can't actually buy a car, test it out in the race you want, and choose whether to keep it or not. Once you buy a car, you are stuck with it even if you hate it. You can't change your mind. Autosave just makes the game worse, I dislike it very much.5. You can't sell the cars that you won. So far from what I see it's cars that you win in a tourney or when you reach a certain level (every 5 lvls u get a car). Your max resell is 100cr, which is worthless. So winning cars many times won't help you unless maybe if you plan to use them.6. Funky physics. What do I mean? When you hit the side wall in a parallel direction, physics would probably have it that the car just slides against the wall instead of bouncing me perpendicular off it. I'm talking about the non-cement type walls. It's like I'm hitting a spring and even springs shouldn't do that. It's like you rub your hand against your table and instead of it going across the table surface, your hand gets bounced upwards away from the table.......In conclusionThis game is either a love it or really really hate it kind of game. If you know exactly how to tune then you can get the most out of ur drive or else you'll end up like me. There are many people that have succeed without knowing much about tuning, but it is frustrating imo.I have progressed so little in this game, I have played it and now I no longer want to touch it for at least a few more months. Whether you find this review useful or not is up to you. It doesn't matter to me, it's just my opinion. I also got this game for [...] total.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0056WJA76","description":"","reviewerName":"Dustin D. Smith \"Duster\"","summary":"Finally, an FPS that doesn't pretend to be something its not.","reviewText":"Guns, bullets, and explosions. The barebones essentials to make almost any FPS great.I have grown extremely tired of the Call of Duty/ battlefield/ Halo debates. Gamers have become quite cruel to each other when it comes to these games and they seem to worship these games like they are their holy grail of shooters. I myself miss the days when a new FPS was coming out and EVERYONE was excited about it. There were no flame wars about which game was better or whose graphics were just a bit better, people just wanted to have a good time. Isn't that what games are supposed to be about? I guess I am just a wishful thinker, I better get to the point here.Bodycount throws everything about modern day shooters out the window and I am 100% ok with that idea. This game is all about pure arcade action! Think about the game as a modern day Metal Slug and you will understand what the guys at Codemasters were trying to achieve. Even the ammo and intel pickups you recieve from killing baddies make arcade-like sounds when you pick them up. The game has next to no story, but thats fine with me, in fact im GLAD there isn't a shoddy attempt at a \"story\" because the most popular FPS games these days have poor excuses for stories anyway. At least codemasters had the dignity to just focus mainly on the gunplay and not waste their time on a story that no one would care about, I play most FPS games for the gameplay only ( except for a few good ones like bioshock, half-life,etc. )The graphics are good, they are no Crysis 2, but they get the job done and the game is still very enjoyable. Guns looks great and sound great too. There are plenty of explosions and it will be hard for you to run out of ammo. When you kill baddies they drop orbs that fill your ammo and your special skill slots. Skills include, explosive bullets and even an airstrike! Just know that this game was not aiming for much realism and you will have a great time!Here is where people are gonna whine about this game, when you \"aim down the sites\" of your gun, the camera jusy zooms in on your target reticule...just like the old days of shooters! Remember when \"iron sites\" didn't exist? Games like Timesplitters 2 and Black were fantastic games, and they didn't have iron sights. It may take awhile to get used to, but this aiming system is still awesome. Which brings me to point #2. When you pull the left trigger all the way, you can't move your character withthe left stick anymore. You go into a manual cover mode where you can dodge in any direction, which is quite awesome and inventive. Do not fret though, you can still aim and move if you only pull the left trigger half way down. Its a new control scheme and its nice to see something new.Basically, there is not much more to this game that I can tell you about. There isn't much of a story and the gameplay is solid. The guns look and feel great, and the action never stops. If you are looking for a game that embraces the FPS style of yesteryear, then do not overlook Bodycount!New: I see the big time reviewers already bashing this game for lack of story and simple multiplayer. Even Official Xbox Magazine said that you can only strafe while aiming down the sites, obviously they didn't take the time to even play the game because you can move around with the trigger half pulled. Do not let the big time reviewers persuade you, play this game for yourself.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000WS97QI","reviewerName":"Battlefieldr","summary":"Have a nice day!.... *BOOM!*","reviewText":"It was a long enough wait for this game, and frankly, as i remember- it kind of came out of nowhere. Battlefield Bad Company is a spinoff from the battlefield universe, but still awesome in so many ways. With this game, battlefield changed, in a good way. DICE(digital illusions creative entertainment) really amped up everything in battlefield, graphics, gameplay, and especially multiplayer. Each new battlefield game gets better and better. I highly reccomend this game to all fps fans, especially battlefield fans. Also, i have to admit- i loved the campaign, it was filled with quirky characters, remarkable dialogue, and fun missions. If you are new to the battlefield games, and want to start with one of the recent ones, where dice amped up thier Frostbite software, play this. Its awesome.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2013"}
