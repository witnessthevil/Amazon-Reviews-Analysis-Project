Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Loads of fun","reviewText":"Traveller's Tales returns with another Lego-based game, this time focusing on the Indiana Jones franchise after conquering the world of Star Wars.  Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is exactly what the title implies: the original Indy trilogy in Lego form.  Contrary to some of the reviews posted on here, if you've played any of the Lego Star Wars games, you'll feel right at home here.  The gameplay itself is relatively simple, family friendly fun that nearly anyone can pick up and play.  Co-op mode is where the real fun of Lego Indiana Jones is to be had though, and like Lego Star Wars before it, the game just has a sense of undeniable charm to it that you can't help but get some enjoyment in the very least out of it.  It may not take you too long to breeze through the game though, but if you do, it is worth going back and playing again just to catch all the game's in-jokes and visual gags, along with a horde of hidden items and goodies as well.  If there's any real flaws to the game, it's that the AI isn't all that good in terms of enemies and AI-controlled pals, but as a whole, Lego Indiana Jones is massively enjoyable.  All in all, Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures continues the tradition of wonderfully fun and family friendly games, and is definitely worth picking up for Indy fans or anyone looking for some good clean fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2008"}

Leon and Claire's meeting is depicted in a visually stunning, B-movie cutscene.

Once you reach the station, you discover the remains of a siege. The defenders' desperate final hours are recorded in a fragmented journal.

Once again, the torch has been passed from the Diamond/Pearl/Platinum crowd to the new generation.  And the franchise is in very good hands.Soul Silver and Heart Gold are remakes of the original Gold and Silver installments, loved by many.  The new updates take players back to the familiar world of Johto with several new updates.  For the first time, in some time, the first Pokemon in your party will trail along behind your character.  Its a minor tweak to the recent formula, but very cool nonetheless.  Along those lines, the game looks gorgeous.  The towns, especially, come to life.Another new addition to the gameplay is the Pokewalker.  Taking the notion of a Pokemon trailing along behind you, the pedometer-like device allows you to upload one of your Pokemon.  You then carry the Pokewalker with you and build up energy that you can then import back into the game.  Characters have the ability to level up quicker when you take them along.  Its an interesting idea that may also encourage younger players to get up and move around.Gameplay is handled much like the previous games.  Some of the touch screen interfaces have changed and it was a slight learning curve - but nothing that will keep veteran players from enjoying the game.  I also like the fact that you are essentially getting two games in one.  Unlike previous outing where there are only eight badges to conquer, this game has two regions which extends the game life.  Add-ons such as downloadable Pokemon events keep the game fresh and interesting.  Just when you think thay've done everything they can do, something new comes along to keep the quest for Pokemon interesting.In the end, sentimentality and a sense of true novelty fuse together to make this the best Pokemon yet.

When I first popped it in, after reading so much good about it, I was a bit confused because the graphics aren't horribly impressive (although as time went on, I didn't even notice anymore). I loved the music, I loved the storyline, I loved the codex entries that were nothing short of amazing, considering they could truly be compiled into a book about the universe. The combat, of course, could use some tweaking, as I would be annoyed when enemies would run right past me when I'd target them to attack, and my character wouldn't flank them! However, I do like hack and slash games, and there are so many moves to choose from! I also loved the fact that you could not only choose many different origin stories, there are so many different endings and ways to play the story that it seems to go on forever...but in a good way. The DLC is great as well. This game would have been worth it if I'd even paid full price! What an amazing game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000BI3QK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Nathan T.","summary":"The Big Breakdown of Oblivion's Flaws With Game Tips","reviewText":"If you want glowing reviews, read the other one. I'm here to talk about the flaws so you guys can see both sides to the game. You will probably expect to feel similar when playing the game, but everyone's opinion differs. Again, great game, I'm not saying it isn't. I'm just here to analyze the flaws.FLAWS and ISSUES1. Can't delete spells. I don't understand why not.2. No suspense or later on there's no real suspense. I have my difficulty slider all the way to the right now but I notice that the game doesn't really grip me and put me on the edge like \"holy marshmallows! What was that??\" It's like you just go and attack and the fighting isn't super indepth. You just slash and use spells to kill your opponent, I just don't see a huge amount of strategy when I fight my enemy. I mean sure you can use strategy to kill your opponent, but why use strategy when plain raw power and outright onslaughter will do just the same? I just back up a little and let me summon go in first then I pick at the enemy from the sides. You can give your enemies a bunch of handicaps to make the fighting more interesting, but who are you kidding? Winning with all your strength and smarts is the best kind of fighting. It's like playing tag for real and playing it with little kids that you know have no chance in catching you, but you pretend to let them catch you. Not much fun.3. With the difficulty slider all the way to the right I notice a few things. Either the fighting remains easy as heck or I get beat the crap out of. Like there was the final mission for saving Kvatch, where you're about to open the gate after going through the underground place and there's enemies outside the gate in mass. I got murderized in like 3 seconds? I got hit with spells from A through Z and the only way I beated it at my current state was putting it on medium to easy. Anyway, then there's other times when I raid a whole cave with ease on difficulty max. I'm so thankful for the difficulty slider because without it I think this game would be completely wack. So this game is either not challenging or too hard. It might not be so wack for the experience players, but it will be for many.4. I know your items are organized, but there's many stuff you can keep in this game I wish there was more organization or a different kind of system. I wish I can also scroll down to the bottom of my list with a click of a button, if there is someone tell me? I keep having to scroll alllll the way to the bottom.5. I really hate how you can't have the option to have your map, local or world, on the actual screen. I admit, I have a bad sense of direction, I mean in real life I use my Garmin to go to the store that's 2 blocks away, but I get lost all the time in this game and I have to keep going into my menu over and over to see where I am.6. I hate how you can accidentally steal stuff sometimes and get jumped for it and when you summon or have followers, you keep accidently hit them and then they turn on you. I hate that. I have to save all the time because of that. I like having a follower because I get lonely in the game walking around by myself, but mines is a little snitching dog when I kill people or steal stuff. Oh yeah I also hate how when you click on your follower there's not an option to not choose either one so when you accidently click on them, you have to choose either to dismiss them or tell them to wait and since that was on accident, you gotta click them again to tell them to follow you again.7. Btw just wanted to add that FAST TRAVEL is one of the best thing in this game so I don't know why some people put it down. I would probably kill myself if I have to keep walking around in this gigantic land. Fast travel makes the world a lot smaller and exploring is a good idea. I love Oblivion's world, but getting lost in it is no fun especially when you want to get to that destination and do your thing. I remember yesturday trying to find this ruin, I continuously got blocked by slopes that I couldn't get over and had to do a round trip in order to find a way in. The glarmor and nice graphics are killed by built up anxiety, impatience, and frustration of actually getting to where you want.8. Different types of missions. So far I've only encountered missions that dealt with:a) Having to kill someone or fake someone's death or something relating to someone getting killed.b) Being a messenger boy or getting somebody together.c) Being a bodyguard9. I wish this game mixed itself a bit with Fable 2, where you can form some businesses and whatnot. Fable 2's business real life simulation + Dead Space kind of suspense + Oblivion + Zelda Ocarina of Time's memorable gameplay = Ultimate RPG.10. Not that many unique interesting enemies. You will continue to see rats, cats, bears, wolves, goblins throughout the game. Then in later levels, you find a few more. But there's nothing super cool or special about them and there's not many enemies in general.11. Is it me or are most of the caves look the same? I mean if you go to caves like crayfish, haynote/heynote and greenmead cave, you'll sorta notice some places that look awfully the same. Other than a few different tunnels and endings here and there....once you raid one cave, you sorta raid them all. Another reason is because you also encounter pretty much the same type of enemies in most of them.12. The loading is supposedly a lot better than Morrowind, however, it can get a bit abnoxious sometimes. Enter house, LOAD. Exit house, LOAD. Enter cave, LOAD. Go to the next level in the cave, LOAD. Go all the way back out of the cave, load load load. Fast travel, LOAD. Opps, made a mistake! LOAD. Was I suppose to take the left door instead? LOAD. If you enter and exit a place, sometimes you won't have to load though.TIPS TO A GOOD GAME:1. Look up UESP on google. UESP is something you must check out if you haven't. It's the wikipedia of this game.2. Many of the stuff in this game is leveled including opponents and items. Many of the quest items are leveled, meaning you won't get the best of certain items until you're around lvl 25-30. You'll find much better stuff around lvl 20+++. You also encounter new enemies as you level up higher but some old enemies will still be there.3. Leveling up any skill in this game works like this: The more / fast you use it, the faster you'll level up. So if you want to level up a skill like conjuration fast, use a conjuration type spell like bound item and continuously cast. The lower the magicka cost, the better it is for you. It's not how big or costly the spell is, it's how many times you use it. Same for the other skills, magic related or not.4. Always save often. If you're the type that knows how and when to save and remembers to save, then turn off autosave. After every few saves, make a new save file and don't delete the older save files until you're sure you dont need them. Oblivion has many glitches. You should definitely dl the patches when and if you can, it's worth it. I usually save every few minutes, I find it very worthwhile.5. Use Hotkeys. It's in your manual.6. If you press START and go to GAMEPLAY, you can adjust the difficulty slider left to right. It helps you adjust your character's build and your gameplay to the game. You can adjust it throughout your gameplay on Oblivion.7. If you start having glitch problems such as problems completing a quest and you dont know why, the first thing you should usually try is to reload your game and clear your system cache. Directions in the first sticky on this board.8. The best weapons in this game is a weapon you enchant yourself and is not found in the game or given to you. I mean you can get pretty good stuff, but you'll find that enchanting your own item works best. Enchanting means bestowing magical properties into the items that you wear or the weapons that you use. You will, however, need an enchanting alter found in FrostCrag DLC or Arcane University which is only accessible later on.9. Fast travel is......GOD! But you should also remember to explore. Fast travel by going into your Journal by pressing B. Then scroll to the Map and Quest menu and have your cursor over the location. If fast travel is possible, then the option to press A to fast travel will be available as long as there's no enemies trying to get you or you're in a house or something.10. The magic spells lack on awesomeness. To put it plainly, nothing is incredibly cool, like casting magic. Even a powerful magic will look like blah. Don't expect the calibur of graphics you would see in spell casting in RPG games like Final Fantasy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2009"}

If you've played Batman:Arkham Asylum's challenge maps and like them, then you'll like the time trials here. Hopefully theirs more in the future.Multi-player:I really see the improvements.  After playing them, it will be somewhat hard to play COD4 again.  I like the fact that when your playing a match and the host has a horrible signal the game doesn't stop the match, but pause it and looks up a new host in the game.  So SCREW YOU if your one of those hosts that flakes out(like your skills) if your team is winning or losing and stops the match from finishing.Customizations galore.  Theirs two problems with it... it's too much.  I'm not talking about the guns, perks etc., but the emblems.  I don't care, thankfully you can still play without dealing with it.  And the other is the freaking achievements.  Their is a lot of it.  I think you can get an achievement for just looking at a map and not doing anything called, \"Staring into the Glory of Infinite Ward's Work Achievement.\"  It gets kind of annoying when your so into the game that the next thing you see covering up an enemy's sniper position are letters tell you that your such a good player.The most important and wonderful thing about the multi-player is a problem that has always plagued my experience, lag.  I don't know what happened and how they're doing this, but I was playing several matches with one or two bars of connection and I didn't noticed it. It wasn't cause the game is the great(not a fanboy).  I was actually looking for problems and after haft an hour, I realized I haven't complained about the lag at all.  NON-LAG-ABLE.  Their were lags, but I did not care.  WTF?!  I played through so many matches with one or two bars that the incidences where lag was apparent didn't faze me.Funny moments, at the credits.

Given that, it's 100% OK to compare this to Oblivion (my favorite game next to anything GTA).I felt this game was more like Morrowind - hard to control, far too much unmanageable info from NPCs, terrible fighting, and messy menus.I know it's 2012 and this game came out in what, 2007?  But Oblivion did too, and I would still play that excellent game today if I hadn't already won it to pieces!--Let me break this down for you:STORY: I have no idea what's going on. There's so much badly delivered dialogue and overwhelming amount of info, that I literally have no idea what is going on.  I'm just going to kill bad guys.  How about that?GRAPHICS: The game itself isn't bad. Close ups when people talk is pretty bad.  A lot of times, lips don't line up to what is being spoken (or don't move at all).  But I find it to be really jumpy moving around.  It's just not smooth.VOICEWORK: A joke.  Wow - everyone who trashed this in other reviews here is spot on!  It's so terrible - just.... pathetic!GAMEPLAY: It's OK to explore, but again, it's just not SMOOTH.  And don't get me started about the fight sequences - they're terrible.  First - you can't BLOCK.  Second - fighting groups of enemies is just terrible - you can't single out your attacks or block so you just get pummelled.  This is why I had to use the cheats - it's just a terrible, terrible fighting system.MENUS: My least favorite of all time - well, one of my least favorite.  It's not intuitive how you equip or sort stuff.  Or use stuff, for that matter.  And how many potions have I whipped through by accidentally hitting the bumper buttons while playing?  Ugh!----I could go on but I'll spare you.  To sum up, it's not polished - it's kind of a hassle to play and explore - the story is muddled - menus are painful to use - the voicework is laughably bad.  I'm glad I bought this for like three bucks or I might be mad!  However: I DO enjoy it despite these numerous shortfalls!  If you like RPGs and don't mind having to cheat, this game is perfect.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00004TC6E","reviewerName":"Axel Law \"The Happy Seizure Kid\"","summary":"Lush graphics cannot save a game (SPOILER ALERT)","reviewText":"...Being a fan of the legendary Chrono Trigger, I was enthralled by the coming of this game.  \"Chrono Cross\" is actually not a true sequel (as said by the creators), but originally a game called \"Radical Dreamers.\"  Anywho, this game DID NOT live up to my expectations at all.  Read on to see why.THE GOODFirst of all, the graphics are actually quite colorful.  The backgrounds are well colored and animated.  The battle graphics also flow quite well.  Even if some of the characters are not all that great, they are nicely created.  However, these are the only good points I can say about the game.THE BADAbout the characters: there are about 40 characters jammed into this game and they virtually have no personality.  It's like the creators wanted to boast about the character quantity as opposed to MEMORABLE, AWESOME characters that we play the game for.  Who cares about 40 characters?!  The music: The remixes of Yasnuori Mitsuda's themes from CT are actually excellent, but the rest of the game's music is strictly mediocre.  Quite a shame, considering the same musical composers from CT are here.  The battle system many have boasted about is not that great at all; You virtually don't even level up.  It's pretty much a Final Fantasy Materia/Xenogears combination of a battle system, but it comes off very heavyhanded (not to mention the colors are annoying).THE UGLYThe critical point about this game is the fact that it doesn't really transcend well into CT.  The Glenn here is NOT Frog (as many have said), and is a very vindictive character that we quickly dismiss.  Schala was VERY MESSED UP at the end of the game, being blonde and in different physical shape.  Lavos was supposedly killed in CT and yet, he somehow survives... something which the game doesn't even explain it well at all.  Which leads to the worst part about the game: the storyline.  What could've been a unique storyline is muddled by inconsistencies and loopholes (examples: humans evolved after apes, BUT in CT, the people were human LONG BEFORE Lavos entered Earth; Lucca supposedly gave up her purpose in life, that is creating machines, to be the head of an orphanage, which goes against Lucca's character.  She also talks about regrets, which contrasts the more confident Lucca from CT; The game states that Guardia was destroyed and the Masamune was stolen, but why even bother when it doesn't even appear as ruins in the game??).AND THE ULTIMATE SIN...Robo appears in the game VERY BRIEFLY, and once you find him, he dies!  He was my favorite character in CT (in a close race with Frog) and killing him off like a worthless character was the ultimate sin.  Speaking of Frog, the game assumes that he died and the Masamune was stolen from him.OVERALLIf you take away the references to CT, it doesn't hurt nearly as much, but it's still a rather generic RPG.  RPG fanatics no doubt love this game (which is why this game is very overrated) and I would've given it three stars.  However, since it blatantly defies the CT legend with a muddled storyline, unappealing characters, merely average music, and just for being VASTLY OVERRATED... this game doesn't deserve anything above 2 stars.  You'll hate me for this, but I demand that an RPG has a decent storyline, a decent battle system, and appealing characters.  This game fails in all three departments.  ONLY GET THIS GAME IF YOU'RE AN RPG FANATIC.  Otherwise, pass it on, ESPECIALLY if you are a fan of the classic Chrono Trigger.On a closing note, don't get me wrong, people; The majority of Squaresoft's games are excellent.  The point I am trying to make (by the statement at the very beginning) is that there are TOO MANY fans out there that are blindly devoted to the company; they make hits and misses like everyone else.  Fortunately, this is one of their few misses.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2002"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Not bad, but doesn't live up to the hype","reviewText":"The eagerly anticipated, much hyped about Too Human is finally here, and sadly, it doesn't live up to the hype that has been surrounding the game for so long before it's release.  A mix of action and role playing, Too Human is also a mix of cyberpunk storytelling and Norse mythology as you play as the god Baldur.  The bulk of Too Human revolves around you taking out baddies and making it to an end boss, and repeating the process.  Sometimes this can be fun thanks to the interesting weapons and armors that can come into your possession, and the skill trees allow you to really make the character your own.  While the basic combat and RPG elements are decently implemented, Too Human falls flat with it's story, ranged combat, and the fact that it won't take you long at all to finish the game.  Not to mention that by the time the game's story gets really compelling, the game comes to an end, and naturally sets up for a sequel.  Getting there however may be more difficult than you think, as Too Human is also loaded with frustrating moments, but strangely there are moments where you'll be getting immense enjoyment out of the game as well.  Technically speaking, Too Human looks and sounds wonderful, but there still just isn't enough here to measure up to the hype.  All in all, Too Human is definitely worth a look at the very least, but for those who had been eagerly anticipating the game's release, prepare to be disappointed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Leonard","summary":"A real accessment","reviewText":"Everywhere I go I see mostly the same things being said, and the themes are: \"Not enough like D2\" or \"It sucks because it's Online only.\"  Although it's valid to complain about games being online only when they are single player games.  It's a catch-22 to say that this game isn't enough like D2.  Especially when those same people would be complaining about it if it were the same as D2.Random Mapping: I don't see why the exclusion of this feature kills replay value.  Just because the maps don't switch from being square, rectangular, circular, etc... Or that the big tree moves from point A to point B every time you exit/enter the game.  It doesn't mean that the fun factor goes from 5 to 3 automatically.  So if you absolutely have to have random maps everytime you start the game, then stop reading this review and don't buy it.  However, if you don't really care about the shape of your maps then continue reading.  (I really haven't noticed, nor have any negative thing to say about the maps in this game.  I've been too busy killing monsters).Population of Monsters:  Much like D2, this game starts out easy.  Where you'll see three to four things strung together in a field.  It then builds towards fighting hordes of zombies/skeletons/demons.  This is where the fun is in the game.  Trying to survive a seemingly endless onslaught of hell's minions trying to kill you at every turn.  Can it get boring just killing stuff?  Sure it can, but how many games out there don't get boring?Classes:  This is the part where the games loses some points.  There are five classes, two melees, two casters, and an archer.  The only ones that I really find fun are the Monk and the Witchdoctor, but wall of zombies was bit of a buzz kill...  Maybe they'll add more classes if they do an expansion.  As far as I know they all have their own selection of area and single attacks.  Though it does seem like you have to wait longer to get the good ones on a couple of them.Gear:  Gear is handled in much of the same way as D2, and Torchlight.  Where you have a non magical level, a magical level, a rare level, and a legendary level.  The items are given random stats and the amount of unique stats is dependant on the item quality.  ie a \"Blue\" item will have less unique stats than a \"Gold\" or \"Orange\" item.  In normal mode you'll get most of the Gold items from bosses.  However, in Nightmare it seems like the bosses will only drop Blue items and the gold ones drop off of the Unique monsters.Normal Mode:  Easy until you venture out of the keep in Act III.  It will be too easy on certain classes, and challenging on others.Nightmare:  Continues on the difficulty level at the end of Act III NM, but the unique monsters have two abilities they use.  Which makes it frustratingly fun.  Especially when you get those Mortar Shielding or Extra Health Shielding monsters.  I haven't gotten too far, since I've tried two different classes so far.Graphics:  I don't see why people think the graphics suck.  So what if the Avatars of the characters are art?  If I'm not mistaken, most games of this genre look about the same.  Again, graphics are just superficial.  I'm more concerned about having fun when I play video games.Overall I think Diablo 3 is fun.  Does it live up to the legacy of the previous games?  I don't know, I can't really remember playing D2 or D1 since it's been over 10 years since I've played either.  If you want to have some fun until the next \"big game\" comes out then go for it.  But if you needed this game to be a clone of Diablo 2, then find something else to do.  I, for one, am glad this game isn't the same as Diablo 2.  Because I'VE ALREADY PLAYED DIABLO 2!!  The complaints about replay value are moot.  Because the average person that complains about replay value were going to end up buying the \"next big game\" anyways.  Every game has people like that, who race through the game and beat it the day after launch and complain about everything in between (eventhough they skipped through all the dialogue and ran straight to the objectives).  Eventually they'll leave and the game will be left with true fans that enjoy playing the game.  I don't know if I'll get all the acheivements (mostly because I'm too reckless to play Hardcore characters).  But I will continue to play this game because it's fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002NIP2SM","reviewerName":"Chef Sean","summary":"Not bad at all","reviewText":"When it comes to online shooters I cut my teeth on battlefield: Vietnam and I only recently stopped playing it. The only reason I stopped was due to a lack of servers not a lack of interest! Boy did I get my money's worth outta that game! BF2 was OK but the fact you can only run for about 3 seconds at a time killed it for me. I've been searching high and low for a replacement for BFV and I've come to the conclusion that the old days are long gone. Oh well.BC2 is a fun one though, It's everything that MW2 was not. I never played BC1 so I can't comment on how it stacks up as a sequel but I can say that it delivers everything that I hoped MW2 would.The maps are small with limited vehicle action but the fully destructible environments make each game feel like a new one. That hiding spot you love could be blown to bits before you even get to it, forcing you to alter your strategy. Excessive amounts of snipers can ruin an online shooter match but the fact that their hiding places can be blown up from a distance balances them out nicely. You don't need to get close and toss a grenade into a small window with surgical precision to flush him out, you can blow up the wall and empty a clip into the room! Very cool. There are a few tanks and armored vehicles but nearly everyone packs C4 or RPGs so they can be easily dealt with. Choppers are still feared as in other Battlefield titles but with some coordination with your team they can be taken out without too much trouble. I think that's an upgrade from BFV where a skilled chopper pilot could easily own the battle.The audio is fantastic, the explosions and gunfire rattle the windows in my house! The graphics are top notch, I'd give a slight edge to MW2 in the graphics department but with fully destructible environments in an online setting you have to expect to make some concessions for a smooth fluid experience, the game looks great though. The server list is big and chances are good you'll find one with low ping and a high population. Server refresh takes ages but load in is pretty quick.While It lacks the huge epic battles of titles past it's still fun and worth the purchase. It feels like a PC game not a port and it uses dedicated servers (are you listening Infinity Ward?) so you can play with your friends whenever you want! There is a function that can send you to a match based on what's available with your preference of map and game type not unlike MW2 but lo and behold it's optional! Installation gives you the option of choosing between online activation or disk check. I thought that was a nice touch. EA claims that the engine is too new to allow modding at the moment, and I hope they're telling the truth, I would love to see some custom maps and mods in the future. If there is never any mod support for this game I'll have to come back and knock off a star.There is a single player campaign that's OK but who plays Battlefield offline? It's as good if not better than MW2 but if you're looking for a good single player game look elsewhere. I wish the single player mode was the same as multiplayer (again, like BFV) so you could explore the maps and practice operating vehicles without looking like a noobish jerk in front of the world and costing your team the battle.-1 star for no single player practice games and lack of prone position. What's up with that? MW2 left out lean so EA decided to leave out prone? Grrrr...Update 4/7/10I'm considering knocking off a star. Due to issues with punkbuster, ranked servers are running without it and hackers are become very prevalent. Aimbots are becoming the norm. People running hacks can shoot you through walls and score headshots from a distance with close range weapons. The game is fun enough that I can see playing it long after these issues have been ironed out but dealing with cheaters is getting old. Please fix this Dice!Update 4/30/10They fixed it! All's good in the hood. Fifth star still being withheld due to lack of mod support.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00B15EXJC","reviewerName":"Raven A. Wind","summary":"Works with PC games, too... If you put forth some effort.","reviewText":"I actually grabbed this to try it on my PC with Steam games. Unfortunately, it does not work out of the box. Yes, the PC recognizes it as a USB controller, but games don't recognize it as an Xbox 360 controller for Windows, and pretty much ignore its existence... Unless you do a little extra work to make it function correctly.If you want to use this with Windows games, you need to find and download \"Xbox 360 Controller Emulator\" (available online for free) and drop the unzipped files into the main folder of each game you want to use it with. Make sure to read the ReadMe and follow the directions included with the emulator. Once you install this in each game's folder, the SC-1 will function just like an Xbox 360 controller for Windows, and Steam games that natively support Xbox 360 controllers will map to it perfectly.Now, as for the actual controller, it's pretty nice. The buttons are nice and responsive, the sticks are solid and snap back to center well, and the whole controller has a nice silky rubberized feel to it. The colors aren't too obnoxious, either. The red is muted and not as bright as it looks in photos. The black has a sort of carbon tone to it. The chrome highlights around the analog sticks look pretty slick, too.I have no problem with reaching the triggers or shoulder buttons on this controller, as some have reported. I guess if you have small hands, it might be a bit of a stretch, but my experience has been pleasant.The controller weighs a bit less than an Xbox 360 controller as it doesn't have a battery pack on the back. This is what takes me the most time to get used to, as I'm used to the heft of Microsoft's controller versus the airy, lighter feeling of the Dual Shock series. The rumble works as you'd expect from a lighter controller; It's not as heavy as in Microsoft's version, but it gets the point across.I have yet to mess with any of the special features like the Turbo button or the F1/F2 buttons, which record macros. I'm not a big fan of macros in games, but I could see it being handy for fighting games that require complex sequences to get off a move. F2 even allows you to program pauses between sequences. I also haven't really bothered with adjusting the thumbstick sensitivity on the controller because most of the games I play have sensitivity settings, however I do find it cool that the controller offers the option.So, speaking as a PC gamer this is a nice alternative to the Xbox 360 wireless controller for Windows. I can definitely say that if you're a PS3 gamer who wants a controller closer to the Xbox 360 version, this will fit the bill. If you're a Steam gamer who wants a controller like Microsoft's at a slightly lower price (and with some cool extra features) this is also a good purchase.Four Stars for decent build quality, ease of use, and general fit and feel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00030GS80","description":"There's always been a certain magic to Zelda games. The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways &#x96; simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy to&#xA0;play.The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones &#x96; broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure.One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward. All the elements of The Minish Cap (even its presence on the GBA) contribute to the idea of a tiny force for good that strives to triumph against a huge evil. It's a classic adventure that more than lives up to the legacy of a classic series.Concept:The time-honored Zelda tale retold in yet another new formGraphics:Mixing the familiar images of previous Zelda games with humorous and detailed new character designs results in an impressive success for the GBASound:Some of the most memorable and recognizable tunes in gaming sound great even on those little GBA speakersPlayability:Responsive and flexible with a nearly perfect learning curve that moves from simple to challengingEntertainment:Like many of its predecessors &#x96; a true classicReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:There's a bird sitting on my head, I'm no larger than a toenail clipping, and I've been stuck on the same puzzle for the last three hours. Long story short, I'm having the time of my life. For any of you who played the remarkable Super Nintendo title A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap will bring a tear to your eye. This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can't get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it's one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you'll remember for a lifetime.Rated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer","reviewerName":"dark54555 \"dark54555\"","summary":"Finally, a true successor to A Link to the Past","reviewText":"The Minish Cap is the latest entry into the Zelda series, and is probably the true sequel to A Link to the Past.  While the story follows on the 4 Swords \"Vattai\" plot sequence rather than Link to the Past/Ocarina of Time's \"Gannon\" plot sequence, the game's style is an update to the Link to the Past (SNES) engine.  That engine offers excellent gameplay, and the Minish Cap is no exception.The story and concept are actually pretty original for a Zelda game.  The constant shrinking and growing, while similar to the Light/Dark world dichotomy of ALTTP, does offer something new.  New items make the experience more diverse than the now \"standard\" weapon and item set established in the original Zelda and pretty well established in ALTTP and OOT.  Gopher Gloves, for example, allow you to dig tunnels.The graphics are well suited to the GBA, though a tad pixelated at times, especially if you use the Game Boy Player.  But for a Game Boy title, this looks pretty good.My only complaint is the length.  Compared to ALTTP and OOT, this game is exceptionally short.  It's basically only 5 major dungeons, compared to the usual 7-9.  Some of the dungeons seem more involved than normal, but it's still a 10-15 hour playthrough tops (finding every item, doing every sidequest), with 7-10 being more the average.In sum, if you're a Zelda fan, you'll like this game.  If you liked A Link to the Past, you'll like this game.  If you liked Four Swords, you'll like this game.  Otherwise, most people will like this game, but a few won't.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2005"}

Players can buy up all the land in a town and can become mayor, king, and even emperor of the entire land.Fable 2 presents a dynamic and free-roaming world that doesn't demand a player to take any one set path. At the same time, players seeking a plot line will find an epic story and quest that they can follow if they wish, along with many side adventures.Fight Using Different Weapons and MagicFable 2 introduces a new combat system that allows for mastery of hand weapons, such as swords, long range weapons such as cross-bows and guns, and, of course, magic. Players improve at each discipline with time, and can combine different combat styles when they fight. Other advanced design features include tactical positional advantages that can bring new strategic elements into combat.Bring Other Players into Your WorldFable 2 has a multiplayer mode that allows you to bring other players into your own world. Consistent with the rest of the game, the actions of these other players can be permanent and affect your world. You can explore and fight together with these other players, share treasures, and even fight each other.Note:Fable 2 will not ship with Online Co-op mode. An update with this functionality is rumored to be released shortly after the launch of the game.Xbox LIVE Arcade Mini-GamesGamers can play minigames through Xbox LIVE Arcade and earn currency that can be used in Fable 2 to purchase weapons, armor, and other items for the hero.Fable 2 is rated M for having mature content that may be suitable for persons ages 17 and older.Depending on your choices, the protagonist can turn out wildly different -- male, female, good, evil, and more.","reviewerName":"B. Rose","summary":"Fun, but buggy and short.","reviewText":"Praise first: Fable 2 is addictive to play, the environments are beautifully rendered, the music is compelling, and there are some fairly neat innovations like the dog.Criticism:First off, why is this game so short? To Lionhead's credit, there are hours and hours of extra gameplay that can be had through buying & upgrading houses, getting marrier, opening demon doors and finding gargoyles, as well as completing side quests.These things are peripheral to the actual game -- the story that compels you to progress to the end and requires the player to make an emotional, or at least time-based, investment in the game. You can complete Fable 2 in a day without the use of a guide -- it's too short and actually has less locations than its predecessor, which came out 5 years ago or so.Yep -- less locations. The 'main' quest is actually less compelling -- and much shorter -- than the one in the first Fable. NPCs, quests, and other game functions are often buggy / laggy. Graphics were good but it was weird having to wait every time I went to a new room. After playing games like Dead Space and Grand Theft auto, it was hard to settle for loading screens every couple minutes.There is a wealth of side-quest material, but it's just not that interesting. The demon doors, often guardians of epic weapons in the first Fable, are much less populous now and their prizes usually aren't worth the effort. I'm sure there are a number of people out there who will subject themselves to tedium just for the sake of getting Xbox 'achievements' but I believe the majority of us actually want to be motivated by something in-game -- items, character interaction, etc.All in all, Fable 2 is a fun experience, but it suffers from being a little too light-hearted and the small scope of the main story and a slew of bugs and glitches make it feel rushed.Probably worth a rent, as you'll be able to beat the game multiple times and attempt plenty of side-quests within a week.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2008"}

By that point in the game, I had grown really attached to the characters, the locations, and the story. To see it end so abruptly was disappointing; it just didn't seem like it was the ending Ezio deserved. I'm glad UbiSoft were thinking the same thing.AC: BROTHERHOOD picks up immediately after the ending of AC2, with Ezio Auditore da Firenze in control of the Piece of Eden and everything right with the world. It seems that its about time to settle down and, to his credit, Ezio certainly tries. But the Borgia family have other plans, and their armies destroy the Auditore Villa before Ezio can even get a good night's sleep. Afterward, he is thrust back into the world of Assassins and Templars to retrieve the Piece of Eden and exact revenge on the Borgias.Now, although this is a sequel to a game that only came out last year, don't think of this as a quick cash-in or a rushed product. Get that right out of your mind. This is as much a sequel to ASSASSIN'S CREED 2 as it is a true continuation of the topsy turvy story that ASSASSIN'S CREED 1 began. Of the three games, BROTHERHOOD is the biggest and the best: quality- and content-wise.The main storyline takes place primarily in Rome, where you will spend your time doing all you can to destabilize the Borgia regime. As with the last game, the attention to detail historically, architecturally, contextually...is just insane. Rome is beautiful and just plain fun to run around in. It is also in a state of disarray and has recently been stricken with widespread poverty. The task to rejuvenate it then falls to you.Across Rome, you'll find dozens of shops, monuments, structures and underground tunnels that will need to be rebuilt. Each shop you reopen and each monument you preserve will add to your overall income, which you can then use to do some more renovations, buy weapons and art, etc. This was a really addicting part of the game for me, and it's not as easy as rebuilding the Auditore Villa by any means. It will take you a while, and it's pretty satisfying to see the florins start rolling in and the overall mood of the citizens begin to turn around for the better.Aside from the modest task of rebuilding Rome, you will also find a plethora of sidequests to take part in, some of which will take the better part of an hour to complete, and you'll be rewarded every step of the way.Now, you could still make the argument that not much has changed. You'd be half-right. This isn't ASSASSIN'S CREED 3, it's a continuation with the same engine and gameplay. There are a ton of little improvements to the formula, and it's these changes that make the game. One very big change is the much acclaimed Brotherhood. As you begin to bring down the Borgias, you will be able to recruit assassins to join you in your fight. As long as they're not on cooldown, you can summon these assassins at any time while you're roaming the city. There is something very satisfying about seeing a guard suddenly get pulled off of a roof and out of sight, and then see your fellow assassin take off into anonymity.Back to the story, I really liked how the story's beginning to drive home the fact that Ezio and all of his companions are 500 years gone. It's easy to forget it, but then to see how Desmond perceives the \"ghost\" of Ezio in certain places and finds artifacts that used to belong to the Auditore family...it's pretty sad. A story that takes place across time isn't the easiest thing to pull off, but UbiSoft is pulling it off with flying colors.If the dozens of hours of gameplay in the singleplayer mode isn't enough for you, then there's always the multiplayer. I've gotta say, I was not expecting this to be good, or as addicting as it turned out to be. There aren't too many game modes or worthwhile unlockables to keep you going for TOO long, but I've had A LOT of fun with it so far. I was smiling and laughing and just plain stressed through each game. It's one of the more original multiplayer games I've played in a very long time, and I hope it continues to make an appearance in future iterations.There was only one thing I took issue with: Once again, it was the ending. Ezio gets to continue his story, but it just doesn't end on a high note and almost seems rushed. I still didn't feel a sense of closure or completion, as if there could still be yet another sequel to Ezio's story. That's to say nothing of the complete left field twist ending of Desmond's story arc, which just might make you angry that there's no ASSASSIN'S CREED 3 to jam into your console to keep the story going. I know that's what I'm feeling right now.Overall, this is more of a game than ASSASSIN'S CREED 2 was, and all the more evidence that this is one of the best and most creative video game series out there. Heck, I'd even go so far as to say that this is the best game I've played this year. I was originally so sure that this game would turn out to be a rushed product after only a year of waiting, but I was way wrong. In fact, I hope the next game is due to be released just as fast, because I'm really not sure how long I can wait.Requiescat In Pace.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2010"}

Control is where it shines...and falls...  I'm not sure what their intention to the control.  Most of time, I feel like running on top of a slippery ice.

{"product_name":"B000XJO7A2","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Still creepy and good, but too many annoying problems","reviewText":"Condemned 2 picks up a fair length of time after the last. You now play drunken, disgruntled, former Agent Thomas, called back into service to help investigate the new recent wave of crime. The metal mouths from the previous game make another appearance, and Thomas's hallucinations are well worth the purchase price, especially now that its in holiday cut downs. The storyline is far more bizarre than the previous game, as surprising as that sounds, but I won't include spoilers.Fans of the first will continue to love the game. Forensics has been improved, though some detail is harder then necessary to spot. Combat has been improved slightly, and there are now caches of ammo rather than five bullets per weapon. The atmosphere is as dark and creepy as ever, and you'll find yourself jumping or bracing to jump often.Ubisoft continues to be one of those rare companies that can actually listen to its fans, and not tell them to go pound sand. Levels are broken into blessed stages finally, meaning you can replay your favorite segments to improve your score in each. Each stage has its own reward, and Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels still apply, but rather than finding a piece of scarp tucked behind a soda machine, you're now looking for things that matter: blowing up meth labs and listening to TV and radio reports to help flesh out the backstory. Dead birds are no longer a quest object, but a hint that there's something important nearby. Your rewards as far as I'm aware are all static, and can help tremendously with later replay.The problems, and sadly, there are quite a lot of them, are with the gameplay itself. You're not still smart enough to keep spare bullets in your pockets, heaven forbid a spare clip, but enemies are walking armories, so waiting for them to run out of ammo is a fools errand. Collision detection glitches allow you to be hit through walls, and certain enemies can apparently see you through them. Respawn points appear everywhere and are patently ridiculous and far too hard to overcome. Enemies sometimes are as fast as Agents from the Matrix, whereas you are still a one-two puncher. Due to several of these problems, you'll have to reload, and reload a lot. Far too often for a game on Normal difficulty.In short, C2 managed to improve tremendously, yet managed to hold onto enough of the frustration to sour a large part of the experience. Get the game for the story, and don't waste you're time trying to play through in on harder than Easy, as its all pain for no gain. And brace yourself for the ending, as I'm still trying to understand it, and many people I'm certain will hate it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2008"}

I think the potential for Move is almost unlimited and that there is a tremendous amount of tech contained in these magic wands. In fact I would not at all be surprised if Sony wasn't selling them basically at cost or for very little mark-up. I wrote a lenghty review of sports champions and will not repeat that here. I will concentrate on my impressions of the Move controller and by extention the PS3 eye.The controller itself is very ergonomic. While playing has tired me out, my hands have never felt fatiqued or tired. My wife with a much smaller hand also feels they are comfortable. You can also strap them on very tight if need be. Also it seems to capture movement fantastically with perhaps only the smallest fraction of delay.But here are some things Sony could have done better. The start and select buttons are really small as are the X O, triangle, and square buttons. There also could have been more navigation controls added. I have a PS3 blu ray controller and that works well whenever needed but they could have added more PS3 control funtionality to the Move controller. Finally the PS3 eye is just an embrassment in terms of video quality. Frankly shockingly bad. Great as a mic, horrible, awful video quality.So in many ways this ranks a 3 overall. However its main function is to translate your movement into games. And it clearly is the best consumer technology available and from all reports will continue to be so even after microsoft introduces kinect. So as that is the most important aspect of the controller and that is a strong 5, 4 overall.BTW some of the sport champion games are better with 2 contollers and you will also want multiple ones for multiplayer at home. I am glad I decided to buy 2 right off the bat, because I would have wanted another one right away after having one. If you are reading this and have just added the move starter bundle to your cart, add at least another move controller, would be my recommendation. You can hold off on the navigator one for now, no problem.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSO1","description":"James Bond... Solid Snake... Ethan Hunt... Based on their recent games, all these so-called superspies could stand to take a few lessons from newcomer Sam Fisher. His name isn't important; the important thing is that his game,Splinter Cell, comes from Tom Clancy's game studio and offers up the kind of sophistication and control you'd expect from the studio that brought gamersRainbow Six. It's all about the details. When Sam enters a dark area, he's got two options, thermal and night vision. Thermal lets him see the body heat of an enemy soldier, even through walls and doors. Shoot through cover with a high-powered weapon, and you can watch as the heat fades from the body. Not dark yet? Shoot out the lights. Need a distraction? Pick up and toss a tin can. Come up to a door too thick to pass thermal readings? Sneak up to it, slip a fiber-optic lead under the door frame, and peek at what's beyond. When you're ready, open the door--just a little bit at a time. WhileSplinter Celllacks a famous hero in the lead role, it does sport the famous technical military thriller author Tom Clancy in the title. And you can see the evidence of his expertise in every facet of the game. Who needs the baggage ofMetal Gear Solid 2when Tom Clancy'sSplinter Cellbrings you better weapons, better controls, better graphics, better spy toys, and a coherent story?","reviewerName":"obryanstars","summary":"A game that any gamer must own!!!","reviewText":"I just can't put into words how awsome this game is; but I'll try.  There are so many moves, gadgets, details in every aspect...here goes:The gameplay: Incredible!  This game should easily win game of the year!  Why?  It's so realistic, so breathtaking, so nerve wracking at times that you really feel that you are Sam Fisher.  Here are the basic moves: You can crouch, roll (to move quickly through one area without being seen), jump, double jump (jump off a wall to cling on to a pipe at the top), split jump (where your up against the wall doing the splits.  You cant then jump down in surprise and knock out your enemy, or shoot him), cling to pipes (and move around, even hang from it while shooting down a guard).  Those are just a few!  You can knock people out, put a gun to their head and interrogate them.  Use people as human shields, hide against walls, knockout anybody, slide down a wire, etc...  So many moves, all so very cool, you'll really feel like a secret agent.  Now with these moves, you must make it through dozens of levels to prevent a war from happening.  If caught, the U.S. will have nothing to do with u.  You're on your own.Gadgets: Thankfully, with these awsome moves, you have perhaps the coolest gadgets ever thought up.  You have gadgets to unlock doors, look under the door, climb walls, shock people to death, etc...  So many cool gadgets!  You'll need every one of them to get through this war.  But that's not all!  You later on get cameras that you can shoot into a room to see everything before you enter, giving you time to plan, think, etc...  These cameras though (so cool) can also, when pressing the red B button, make a loud whistling sound that will attract guards.  When they are close, push the yellow Y button, and a sleeping gas will enter the air, knocking the guards unconscience, and leaving your path clear.  These cameras also have night vision, heat vision, and of course, regular vision.  So many uses, these cameras may save your life more than once.  Use them wisely.The game: In the game, you must get through different levels, finding out secrets in various ways, and doing whatever is asked of u.  U can read e-mails from hacked computers, listen in silently on conversations, hide dead or living bodies (you can either knock them out or put a bullet to their head).  Sam is also equipped with heat and night vision goggles.  So when you have been spotted, and several guards are coming your way, you can shoot out nearby lights, split jump and watch blind guards come in.  Put your night vision goggles on, jump down, put a gun to one's head, and use him as a human shield.  Shoot the others, knockout your hostage, hide the bodies, and move on.  So many options of doing almost anything during gameplay, you'll be spoiled of how to beat each mission...or come back later and beat it on a harder setting.  You can also pick up and throw bottles, coke cans, anything.  The whole process of the game is very cool.The graphics: In case you haven't heard, this game has some of the best graphics ever seen in a game.  One of my friend's walked in, sat down, not seeing the controller in my hand.  He thought I was watching a movie for a few seconds!  That's how good this game looks.  The lighting is fantastic.  Knock out all the lights, pitch black.  Leave a tiny bulb on, a lite glow fills the room.  Very cool!  Sam even changes.  He rolls up his sleeves, breathes in and out, steadies his gun when running so as to not make a clit, clat noise.  Etc...  So much detail put into everything.  Even things like when Sam's hands are busy (like hanging from a pole), he cocks his head up, then down, to get his night or heat vision goggles on.  Sooooooooooo realistic!Depth: Incredible!  On the normal setting, you'll be lucky to beat this game in less than 30 hours.  And the ability to go back and beat the game on hard later adds even more replay value!  This game has it all!Overall, this game rocked in every aspect.  Even sound (perhaps the best ever in a game) is ignored because of how good everything else is.  Voice acting is so realistic, as Sam always sounds confident, and yet sometimes doubtful, and even a bit nervous.  You can hear how fast you're running, the footsteps of approaching enemies, the true reloading of your gun (which ranges from silencers and snipers, to machine guns at times), and the shells falling to the floor.This is a classic, a must have, and any gamer should feel left out never playing Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell!(And oh, later on, you may be able to download new levels from the internet so your PC.  So cool!)Thx!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2002"}

A promising candidate for game of year 2011!The graphics is shining! Just when you thought the graphics on PS3 can't get better, think again. Uncharted 3 is making PS3 flexing all of its muscles. I stopped quite a few times in the game just to check out the view and you'll probably do too!The Story is THE BEST experience I ever had. Think Hollywood, think a story well told, think of those games you just wanted to keep playing to unveil the story, yep Uncharted 3 is one of them.Compared to Uncharted 2, there are probably more story telling and less gun firing. The cut scenes are definitely top notch. They also added more fun elements in melee combat. There are a few scenes you could get through by using solely stealth attack. This game is definitely on par with Uncharted 2, only slightly better in every aspect.Regarding the AIMING, yes I definitely noticed the difference in aiming. The official explanation is that they have made the aiming now more realistic than before. For me it is not an issue. It only took me about 10 minutes to get use to it.Multiplayer is really fun! There are team objective mode, plunder mode (like flag capture), and three types of co-op modes, in addition to the every-game-must-have-these-days deathmatch mode. What I like about Uncharted series' multiplayer is that it is not just a shooting experience. Melee combat and stealth attacks are also very useful and rewarding. And I don't see aiming is an issue in the multiplayer. I've seen skilled players with G-Mal in some matches and you don't wanna deal with them face to face.To sum up this fantastic game:The goods:GraphicStoryGameplayCut sceneDialoguesCharacters' personalityMultiplayerReplay valueFive chapters of online Co-opThe not so goods:-Occasional Disconnecting issue during multiplayer (when there is a little icon appearing in the center of the screen, at first glance it looks like your controller is disconnected.

This game is so good and I'm in love with Nate Drake! There isn't a character I hate in this game...besides the bad guys, but even they were interesting. I love the sneaking and fighting more than the gun battles and I still hate that I am forced to enter a gun battle at times when sneaking would have gotten me out of the situation much faster. If another Uncharted is made, I hope it allows me a little more freedom in that department.The cities were exotic and exciting, it had a more adventure feel than the first two. In the second game I didn't like Chloe and said she looked like a man. Maybe the developers knew this because they really softened her features more and made her quite likable here.I really don't know what to say that no one else has said before. The voice acting was great, the graphics were outstanding, the puzzles were more difficult, the gun battles were more extravagant but not piled on you like the first game. It was just enjoyable and I wish there were more.As for the multiplayer, I played a bit of it, but honestly I didn't find it that exciting or engaging.

Yes, it's Samus and pinball, combining for a wonderfully fun marriage on the DS with Metroid Prime Pinball.  Anyone who hasn't been living under a rock for the past decade and a half knows that one of Samus' powers involves her ability to morph into a ball.  Well, guess what the ball is in this game.  That's right, and thankfully, Metroid Prime Pinball provides excellent physics, odes to the series, and all the gameplay elements that make pinball such a fun game on it's own to begin with.  Almost everything in the game takes advantage of what the DS can do.  From the sharp graphics and the inclusion of a rumble feature, Metroid Prime Pinball is a real treat.  The only drawbacks of the game come from the sometimes awkward control scheme which requires you to tap the touch screen to shake the machine, as well as the fact that there is only one multiplayer table and Wi-Fi capabilities are non-existant.

My older set is the wired P21 model (for PS3) from several years ago. For those that have had the older model, I have great news. This new model improves on both the quality of the build and has much better simulated sound. Gone is the hiss of the old model, this new simulated surround has hardly any sound artifacts and does a very good job. It comes with 4 presets for both surround and tone. Set up was pretty easy, using the RCA outputs of my TV. The device for Blutooth that attaches to the controller was easy to set up and you don't need the controller on so if you want to use something like a racing wheel, the controller doesn't have to be left on.ProsUse with PS3 or XBoxVery good surround effect, no hiss of older models, 4 presetsLightweight and fairly comfortableEasy to set upUpgrades to Dolby 5.1 with the Turtle Beach Ear Force DSS2 Dolby Surround Sound ProcessorSeems well builtLong battery life (I have used the near identical Turtle Beach Ear Force XP400 Digital Headset for 8 hours and didn't need a chargeYou can use it with MP3 players using the AUX inputCan be used while chargingEar cushions can be replacedConsSometimes you get weird sounds from the surround processor. I found changing the preset fixed it on the headset itself fixed it.Price? For PS3 users the Official Sony Wireless Stereo Headset does the same for half the price.If you decide to upgrade with the DSS2, it costs more than just getting the XP400.If you use it with an Xbox and a device like a wheel you will have to purchase a wire for chat.Comparison with the Turtle Beach Ear Force XP400 Digital HeadsetBoth can be used with the PS3 or XBox. Basically the two headsets look identical except for the model numbers and a few difference in buttons although the XP300 fit looser and was more comfortable. Using the XP300 with my XBox I find that instead of using an optical out cable, it uses an RCA connection. The XP300 has simulated surround vs the Dolby 5.1 surround of the XP400. The simulated surround though is very good with 4 presets, like the XP400 has, to change the simulated placing of the surround speakers. But there is a definite difference with the XP300 expanding the sound stage for a surround effect while the XP400 gives you \"real\" surround in that you can pinpoint direction of sounds in 5.1 Dolby encoded games and movies.  The XP300 does a good job with simulated surround. I used 5.1 Dolby NetFlix movies to compare the two models with the XP300 used with the XBox and the XP400 with the PS3. It doesn't seem as precise as the XP400 where you can pinpoint exactly where a sound is coming from. But if you get the XP300 and want to upgrade to Dolby surround, Turtle Beach sells the Turtle Beach Ear Force DSS2 Dolby Surround Sound Processor that you can use to upgrade it. The best thing is that the XP300 doesn't have the hiss that the surround of the early wired Turtle Beach P21 model had.I did have to pick up the accessory cord for chat from the Turtle Beach website so I could chat using the MadCatz wheel. The Blue Tooth adapter that works with the XBox controller will only fit the controller so if you are using this headset with the XBox and a device like a wheel, you will need to get the wire from the website. The wire with shipping was around $15 and for whatever reason they will only sell you up to 3 so don't lose your wire. It includes an on off switch and volume. With this set up, turn off the Blue Tooth on the headset, you won't need it, and that will increase battery life for a couple of hours.UPDATE: I am going to have to get the cord to use chat with my Madcatz wheel. Its $15 from the Turtle Beach website, including shipping. Without it, I could hear people chatting but the mic didn't work or even show that I was using one in the room.Comment Comment | Permalink","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2012"}

Usually there is a title that looks so enticing to the game player, that he/she will plunk down a large chunk of money for a system, just so they can play that one game.  Now, if you own a GameCube, Mario is a likely candidtate for this sort of influence, or pehaps the new Metroid games (one is for Game Boy Advance) that have me salivating now.  Well, Eternal Darkness had this effect on me.  I purchased this game because of the amazingly positive reviews I read.  I watched the trailers on the intenet, and it looked so awesome to me, that I had to get a GameCube.  Well I played Eternal Darkness (ED from here on out) and it is a really good game.  It is fun, and there are a lot of innovative features to it.  The sanity meter is genius.  This concept will undoubtedly be used again, although never to the same degree of surprise that this first game gave us.  By the way. Do yourself a favor and do not read what all of the insanity effects are before you play the game.  It will ruin them for you.  Why four stars then you ask?  Well.  For one, the game was too hyped.  It is not a genre beginning title (what is anymore.)  It is not survival horror like the Resident Evil GameCube remake is.  (RE is superb by the way)  The game was pitched in such a way that led be to believe it was scary.  It really wasn't for me.  Yes there are a lot of wonderful surprises with the sanity/insanity effects and all, however, it never acheives the level of creepiness that RE carries all the way through it.  It is really an adventure game.  I love the dynamic camera.  In RE, the camera angles are stills.  ED's camera angles are mobile and fully rendered in 3D!  The magick is great.  There are a few monotonous parts, but in the end the game is very satisfying.  This game is more of a 3D adventure than survival horror.  Yes is is bloody and greusome at times, yet these aspects alone do not define the survival horror genre.  Keep these things in mind, and you will no doubt love this game.  It really is fun and unique, just not the 5 stars I would have liked it to be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2002"}

It took me 14.5 hours, which is moderate. There's a little replay value, because there are some variations of cutscenes and monsters depending on the Ancient you choose as your enemy in the beginning. There are four Ancients: Ulyaoth, Xel'lotath, Chattur'gha, and Mantorok. Each has it's own personality. You can't choose Mantorok, because he's separate from the other three. He's the Overseer. The other three have one Ancient that they're strong against and one that they're weak against, kinda like elements in pokemon.Your spells are based on the three magic types - body, mind, and spirit. A blue spell will be stronger against a red enemy and weaker against a green one. Monsters of different types will fight each other, so it's nice if you have two enemies kill each other. Red is aligned with physical power, blue with different realms, and green with insanity. To create a spell, you choose the type, the desired affect, and the subject. It's a pretty interesting setup. There's some logic behind it, not just random words. You can eventually tell what kind of spell an enemy is using against you and react accordingly. You have to unlock spells, and you can get spells to do things like summon a monster to fight for you or create a shield. Spells use up blue energy. There's also a meter for health (red) and sanity (green). More on sanity later.The combat is a little slow. If using a weapon, the swing or rate of fire is usually slow, because many weapons are old, like single-fire pistols or a heavy medieval sword. You leave yourself pretty vulnerable. Attacking is just hitting a to attack. You can target different body parts, like chopping off a zombie's arms, to leave them completely defenseless. That's fun.To use a spell, you'll have to wait several seconds while the words are spoken. If you're interrupted, the spell stops. So it can be difficult if you're low on life and you're trying to use a spell to heal, but the enemy keeps hitting you. You can get stuck in a downward spiral until you die, which can be frustrating.If you keep dying, you are forced to watch the cutscenes over in the first play-through. That will get old fast, and waste much of your time. After you play through once, you can skip most cutscenes, but that isn't much comfort if you're stuck on a boss the first time and he keeps killing you.On to the story. The Ancients are sealed away (or something like that) and one of them is trying to get free. It's wreaking havoc and building it's power, and if it is freed, it will be the end for humanity. But, people throughout history are working to prevent that. You play as various characters, from a page of the Middle Ages to a doctor in the colonial era. Each of them are wiped out by the evil god's minions until only one person stands in their way - Alex Roivas. Her grandfather was the latest in the fight against the darkness, but he too gets killed. She must use the Tome of Eternal Darkness, read the stories of the people who came before her, and collect the essences of the other three gods to stop the enemy Ancient.The puzzles in Eternal Darkness are pretty light. Things like match a certain object to the appropriate pedestal, or use the correct spell on an obstacle. If you're looking for deep puzzles, you won't find them here.A cool thing about this game is the sanity meter. As it gets lower, you'll see sanity effects. At first, it's just a trickle of blood here and there on the walls. Then the screen begins to tilt. Eventually, it'll look like your TV or GameCube is doing strange things. Your volume will go down or the game will tell you that your controller is unplugged when it clearly is not. You'll try to cast a spell and your upper body will explode. Then the character will snap out of the illusion. It's pretty interesting, and sometimes it'll creep you out a little. Once, I was in the Roivas mansion, and my sanity was down about a third of the way. I went into the bathroom and checked the tub, and saw my character in a bath of blood, dead. There was a flash and a sudden scream. I jumped a little at that one. This game is definitely a bit scary.Overall, this was a unique and enjoyable game. I recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2005"}

So far, having played Hot Pursuit for many hours, my impression of Most Wanted are as follows:+ Graphics and level of detail is definitely more polished compared to HP. Map is much larger.- Car handling seems ok but either very slick or very sluggish.- The \"open world\" concept is much different. You have the choice to do any race for each specific car you find, but YOU must go out into the world and find them yourself, which I have not decided whether is better or worse, but just different for now. Since each car has specific races associated with that car only, if there are cars you absolutely hate, you will NOT be able to enjoy those races. This is not a new issue; HP had the same limitation.+ \"Most Wanted\" races are challenging but exhiliarating when you actually win.+ You earn \"speed points\" even if you lose a race or just driving around, which helps to get you closer to the next \"Most Wanted\" race.Overall, I have to give this game a 3.5 out of 5 for now.

In fact, I'd go as far to say that it's a great game if you enjoy fighters as much as I do.  That's why I got excited when WB announced it would bring Injustice: Ultimate Edition to the Playstation 4.  Taking a great fighting game and bringing it to a next generation console while including all the DLC and enhancements up to this point should be a recipe for success.  And it is.  Mostly.  Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition is good, but it isn't quite as ultimate as the name implies.First, the good.  Injustice is still the same great fighting game it was when it was originally released earlier this year.  Taking a bunch of classic DC superheroes and watching them beat on each other with a versatile and deep fighting engine is still just as fun as it sounds.  The team behind the Mortal Kombat series has taken their considerable fighting game experience and applied it to another universe.  With Injustice, hits looks like they hurt and the interactive stages and cinematic super moves provide a lot of visual flair that keep the action fast paced and interesting.Continuing with the good, Injustice packs in a hell of a lot of content for a fighting game.  In addition to the story mode, you've got the \"Battles\" mode (a series of matches against predetermined opponents, with each type of battle having a different ruleset of handicap), S.T.A.R. Labs (a series of special challenges) and the standard training, versus, and online matches.  Since the Ultimate Edition includes all of the previously released DLC you'll be able to play with an impressive large roster of 30 characters and complete 240 challenges, along with the multiple costumes for each character and a large amount of unlockable concept art, music, and icons.Then I got to the bad.  For starters, despite being on a significantly more powerful console the game doesn't look all that much better.  Some of the textures are sharper than in the other versions, but otherwise the game looks mostly the same.  Graphically, the worst part is by far the cutscenes.  In nearly every cutscene of the story mode there is significant slowdown and framerate drops.  The actual gameplay is rock solid, but we should expect a solid framerate throughout for a last-generation port.Unfortunately the technical issues don't end there.  Connecting to a game online often takes an unusual amount of time.  It's not odd to have the \"Connecting\" message be displayed for 30+ seconds before even getting to the online menu.  Injustice: Ultimate Edition has all the hallmarks of a rushed port job.On the content side (and I'll admit this is a minor complaint), all costumes and characters come unlocked from the beginning.  For the characters, this is a good thing for such a multiplayer focused game, but the costumes being unlocked from the beginning means the game loses a bit of the sense of progression.  The only other change from the last generation versions is that all the minigames can be played with the PS4&#8242;s touchpad instead of buttons, although in my experience the touchpad was sometimes unresponsive making the buttons the best way to play the minigames.Injustice is a game worth playing, but it may be a game you want to play elsewhere.  Between the technical hiccups and low online population thanks to the lower install base of the PS4 it's hard to recommend the Ultimate Edition over the base game.  If you already own Injustice for the Playstation 3 or Xbox 360 you'd be better served to purchases the DLC there, and if you don't it's probably best to wait for a price drop or two.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2014"}

It kinda seemed like someone mixed The Nightmare Before Christmas and Harry Potter into this game.  The graphics are good and the gameplay is okay.  The control's are really repetitive and tedious but the story makes up for it.  The story is basically two strangers, an annoying and whinny girl named Ellen and a overly sarcastic yet funny and laid back reporter named Keats and they're drawn to a Irish village named Doolin or however you spell it in modern Europe with a case of a murder.  Ellen and Keats both have different stories but both characters are still in the same world.  Which makes it less interesting to see what happened from the characters view.  Oh, well.The only problem I have with this game is that the the Folks in which you get to aquire aren't really amazing.  I mean, sure, they'll help ya and all but it's kinda like playing a dark version of Pokemon, which can be kinda lame.(Sorry, I wasn't really a fan of Pokemon back then either).  I like the game, I do, but the makers of this game could've done more.  But the good thing is, I sure did get a kick out of knocking around those Folks.^_^","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2011"}

I have to say that I am very impressed with how the system handles.  The touch screen is bright and colorful.  It has great resolution as well.  The visuals just pop off the screen.  As you would expect, the touch controls work like a dream.  I was able to play the 'welcome to the vita' mini games that showcase just how good the vita features are.  And I was able to play uncharted for a few hours as well.The touch controls are spot on.  I had heard that they were more so than the latest smartphones.  I can really believe it now.  None of my touches have been misread so far.  This goes for the back touch pad as well.  It's a little awkward at first but feels natural to use in cases such as uncharted.  I really cant wait to see what games and apps they come up with for the system.The vita also features tilt actions.  In some instances you can tilt your vita for a certain effect.  This, also, is just done perfectly. It has just the right sensitivity and smoothness to it.There is a camera on the vita.  It has one lens on the front and another on the back.  It's decent but nothing great.  I didn't buy the vita for its camera.The vita has a lot of potential to produce some amazing looking games.  Uncharted is a launch title(a fantastic one at that) and it already is a gorgeous looking game.  Not to over exaggerate, but there were moments when I thought I was playing a ps3 game.  They can get that good.  I was in heaven with the 2nd joystick.  It felt surreal playing a handheld game with another joystick.  They are a bit stubby and hard to get used to but Im getting it down bit by bit each time I play.I might be neglecting to mention some features, but I will just say that I am happy with the vita thus far.  Im excited about what's to come for the system.My only complaint is the money that you have to drop in order to get the system and the essentials.  One of my biggest WTFs is that sony didn't include any memory with the vita.  You actually have to buy a memory stick separately to save any data.  Add in the purchase of a game, case, screen protector and you have one very expensive portable entertainment system.  With that said you do get the top-notch quality of sony and the best handheld system, in my opinion.  I think you'll be satisfied with the system.Im sick of writing about it. If this review seems incomplete and rushed it's because I just want to stop writing and play it some more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2012"}

Well, that all depends.  I'm a huge fanboy of the fighting games which get a bad rap by folks who haven't bothered to learn how to play them properly, so I'm a bit biased by the fact that I really enjoy these characters and the ways their personalities and relationships with one another carry over from game-to-game in the series.  That said, this game certainly does live up to it's affectionate nickname, \"Boobs: The Game\"; but there is more than a little bit of fun to be had on Zack's tropical island.  The original DOAX was a novelty game at best that offered nice visuals, a minor diversionary volleyball game, a boring casino, and a busted social sim.  This time around, we get REALLY nice visuals, a slightly improved volleyball game, several extra annoying mini-games, a much-improved casino, and a pretty killer jet-skiing game on top of the still-busted social sim.  You'll spend most of your days earning money playing the two good games, v-ball and jet-skiing, so that you can attempt to buy thoughtful gifts for girls you'd like to be your friends.  The problem is that the girls will usually return your gifts for no real reason, making your precious time and money a complete waste.  While it is quite fun to see the girls who do accept your generous gifts wearing them around, there are very few items you can give them repeatedly and the overall item list is quite a bit shorter than I expected.  The incentive to woo these girls is nil, unless you love a headache-inducing challenge or are without a volleyball partner.  I was really hoping for a major upgrade/overhaul to this pointless social sim, but chalk that up as another disappointment.  The much-vaunted swimsuits are mostly nothing special and they are impossibly expensive, though they do leave tanlines when you change to another which is a very nice touch.  The casino now has a much better variety of games that you can play head-to-head with the other girls (the poker is quite fun) which is probably the biggest improvement to an existing aspect of this series.  The waterslide, butt-battle, tug-of-war, and flag racing mini-games are all over in a flash, not very profitable, exceedingly difficult, and take up a massive portion of your day, making the lot of 'em damn near worthless.  The jetskiing and volleyball are really the game's biggest saving graces and are pretty damn fun once you get the hang of it.  I got frustrated a the v-ball at first and cursed my partner's terrible AI that spiked at inapproriate times and often watched an opposing spike or serve go by as she looked at the ground.  Then I remembered that Kasumi and Ayane (my DOA girl of choice) do not get along, though I had tried to smooth things over between them, I could practically sense Kasumi's indifference to the outcome of our matches.  So I kicked Kasumi-chan to the curb, grabbed a new partner, and promptly began crushing the competition.  Team Ninja loves this kind of thing; adding hidden depth to a game that appears to the inexperienced eye to be simple and impossibly difficult. Treat your partner right and you'll work together nicely, lose games and skimp on the gifts, and you're game will suffer as a result.  Another nice touch.  All-in-all, this one is barely an improvement over the first installment and, therefore, still a renter.  The game is fun for quite a while but watching the same canned animations -bouncy breast physics or no-, and hearing the same phrases over and over gets old quick so the graphics and DOA characters are no reason to buy this game.  Added social interactions would have done wonders here, but alas, gift-giving is the only non-competitional contact you'll have with your friends unless you count the time-wasting \"be friendly\" activity, where you watch you and your partner stroll down the beach or do other boring things while you snap pictures.  The new mini-games are all lame and since the social aspect is still difficult and unrewarding I'd really only recommend this one to: a) fans of the original's volleyball game who don't mind the redundancy  b) boys who will not know the touch of a woman any time soon and don't have access to porn  c) anyone who actually gets excited at the prospect of a virtual jet-ski race or poker game, and  d) DOA completists who absolutely MUST collect every single item in every single game that Team Ninja puts out or just can't get enough of those delightful DOA girls.  Everyone else should give this one a rental, then go dust off your copy of \"Dead or Alive 4\" (a man's game) and kick some real virtual booty.  Let's just hope that \"DOA: Code Cronus\" doesn't let us down.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0002B90SA","reviewerName":"Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"","summary":"The Sith Strike Back: Return of the Exile","reviewText":"A New RPGThe first Knights of the old Republic (KOTOR), was one heck of a game. It took everything that people loved about the classic trilogy and expanded universe of Star Wars, and packed it neatly into an epic RPG where everything you did had either light side or dark side properties. Sure there was light-saber combat, but the game was more about storyline and immersion than anything else. The countless hours of voice-acting and intriguing dialog choices, to say nothing of conversations that would or would not take place depending on what you did, created an experience that sent shock-waves through the video game world. Of course there were also some bugs to be found (okay, a LOT of bugs), and some of the mini games were pointless (anyone else get tired of playing gunner when it's almost impossible to lose?), but on the whole, that game was awesome, giving you everything from jedi mind-tricks and choking of smart-mouths with the force to dancing with twileks and finding out your own dark \"Luke, I AM your father\" secret. So naturally, the second KOTOR has a lot to live up to.You Should Not Have Come BackIf the first KOTOR was A New Hope with the plot twist from Empire Strikes back, this one is probably Empire Strikes back with the plot and pacing of A New Hope. In a move that sits particularly well with me, the dialog and plot are both much darker and much funnier this time around. I knew that from the moment I found myself half-naked talking to a prisoner in a cell in a station where hundreds lie dead on the ground and psycho droids roam the halls. As the title of the game suggests, this time around everything revolves around the Sith (well, that and finding out why you were banished in the first place). Pretty much the whole has you playing cat-and-mouse with the Sith, trying to figure out who exactly the real bad guys are. Is is the tortured zombie Darth Sion, who is only kept alive by his own hatred and dark-side power, lusting for revenge on his old master? Is it Sith Lord who wears the creepy Sith Mask, so consumed with hunger for force energy that entire planets are devoured by his hunger as he roams the galaxy in his ghost-ship? Or is the true villain the one who manipulates these Sith fools, using them to make YOU stronger?Pluck of an Old (Fashioned) SithInstead of the same old questions of simple \"Do I kill the guy or give him ALL of my money\" good and evil, a lot of situations in this game are gray areas. You COULD help someone, but it may hurt them more in the long run. You COULD listen to someone's innocent comments, only to discover that they are pure evil. And you COULD hurt someone very much by allowing them to get too close to you. Really, if there is one thing that makes this game fascinating, is the way that puts such a wonderful spin on things, making you repeatedly question your actions and why you are doing the things that you are, forcing nice people to kill when YOU are the good guy, making people betray their master to serve YOU. Perhaps the ultimate question of the game (and it's proved by the very end) is just how far are you willing to go in order to help someone you believe in or destroy something that you hate. Far more is at stake than just the Jedi and the Sith, or even just the Republic. What will you do? Sacrifice your soldiers or save the galaxy?The Weapon of a Jedi KnightSome people will undoubted become irked at the fact that they can't have a light saber from the get-go. But storyline is key here, and now that almost all the Jedi are dead, and most of the Sith as well, light sabers are becoming a little rare. And what with people hunting Jedi down and all, well you get the picture. Consider this though, what is a Jedi without his light saber? Have you ever thought about it? A jedi who's an expert marksman would be a dangerous foe, and a jedi with a sword is kind of like a samurai... And much to my delight, when you begin the game you DO have force powers.I Want to Learn the Ways of the ForceWhen I heard about how this game was going to have all these new force powers, at first I was irritated. Great, more confusion, more head-scratching and decision making distracting me from the game. But as the game progressed I discovered something wonderful. Instead of forcing you to choose, the game helps you along by making the choices far more obvious. Certain types of Jedi gain certain abilities automatically (bonuses that come from leveling up in a certain style), and certain super-cool powers can only be obtained by types. In other words, a weapons master can't throw lightening around like a jedi master. More choices, but the impossible ones aren't shown, and the crucial ones are automatic. Nice.Fastest Ship in the GalaxyReally you've got to love most of the changes that have been made in this game. The card game has been expanded and so has the racing (and both have gotten a lot more sophisticated). You can break down components, build new ones, create upgrades, choose fighting styles You have three extra levels of Jedi on top of the old for dark side and light side, and dialog options change depending on your skills. Of course the game is also a lot easier on normal now (which some may not like), and there is a lot more soloing this time (which adds to the narrative, but forces you to use certain characters). I particularly loved the fact that Jedi can now equip armor of certain types and still use force powers. That and the fact that I never ran out of money (like I frequently did in the first game the first time around).From a Certain Point of ViewWhat really makes this game shine though, is the story. Granted, it may not be as ambitious as the first game, and a few critical moments could have been better (I wanted a LONG battle with the main villains, not a quick death for one of us), but on the whole I think the story of this game is better. Essentially you start the game full of questions and end it in a similar way, but along the way to the answers to your main questions you pick up a variety of characters who are just full of surprises, and keep you guessing as to how you should play things out.You can try to get close to one character or another, but inevitably you're going to alienate someone, and as certain characters will give you bonuses as you teach each other various techniques, you're likely to quickly start playing favorites. While some characters will just plain shut up if you have nothing to talk about, and others will allow you (glitch time) to have the same conversations over and over again, on the whole the character interaction is incredible, augmented by some wonderful voice-acting. Depending on what you say and do, you may find yourself with not only a love interest, but a love TRIANGLE, and in this game no one is quite what they seem (even the droids).While the influence you exert over others (turning them light or dark side and opening them up to you) is great, many will doubtless be delighted with the prospect of training their own apprentice(s) in the ways of the Force. There is just something insanely cool about training your own private army of Jedi, don't you think? Of course it can go so many ways depending on how you play...It also seems to me that the characters in this game have a much stronger sense of identity and personal agenda than in the first game, and the conversations feel more personal. In particular I found the new female characters fascinating, as the manipulate Kreia tries to teach you, protect you, and control you, the Handmaiden tries to preach to you, learn from you, and respect you, Mira tries to decipher you, and Visas just plain worships you (or does she?). The frustrating but interesting thing about the characters is that you'll only get certain ones if you are light side/dark side and you can only figure out what they're really up to if you use your powers of persuasion in a concentrated effort. And of course there are also characters that will or will not join you depending on whether you are male or female (how about that?). Some people will completely overlook this part of the game and not talk to anyone, but they will never understand the true motivations of the characters, and certain won't have any padawan learners to educate in the ways of the force.All in all, the story and characters are pretty great, and definitely worth playing the game through more than once to see the full scope of. Your fist time through will doubtless still leave you wondering about the future at the end of the game, as some big questions are still left unanswered (can you say KOTOR III?).The Droids You're Looking ForAnd then there's the droids. Is it possible for our psychotic assassin droid to get any more sarcastic and cynical (and demented)? And what about our little astromech droid? Now you can converse with the cute little guy the way Luke and Obi-Wan did with R2 (how cool is that?). In addition to these guys though, you also have a floating orb that follows your resident mechanic/melee expert, and a new floating torture/assassin droid that is more than he seems.What a Piece of JunkAlright, I'll admit it. While this game has better facial detail and probably more terrain detail than the previous game (and better battle animations to boot), there are some glitches that are simply inexcusable. Yeah, there are a LOT of load times that shouldn't be there (the ones for races are particularly bad), and while you get used to them, they still are irritating. But that's nothing. During battles with vast amounts of baddies, the frame rate occasionally drops to about 0, and you'll have no idea how you (or someone else) just died. Sometimes (and I thought this most irritating of all), the dialog will be cut off and the cinematic (in-game not pre-rendered) will go black. Ugh. THAT ruins drama. And then there's times when your characters will just stand and do nothing in a battle (not good), or someone who is supposed to follow you won't (ARGH!). And of course the graphics aren't exactly state-of the-art. I mean they are better, but they're still look more like something from the N64 or PlayStation than the X-Box. Do these flaws (and others) make the game unplayable? No. But they do take away that vital fifth star...I Have a Bad Feeling About ThisThere were times early in the game where I was so incredibly sucked-in that I could think of nothing else except that I hadn't played a game I enjoyed this much in ages. The storyline really is that good. There were moments when I thought this was going to be the greatest game I ever played (the flying creature from The Phantom Menace who faked being fooled by my mind-trick was one for the ages, as was Mira's description of how to deal with a guy that a girl likes). Some of the lines characters said were so close to classic Star Wars lines I  was laughing hysterically (not to mention some of the wacky things you could say in reply). And no matter how slice it, saving the galaxy, fighting dark lords and wielding light sabers is mighty cool. Sadly though, glitches, gameplay flaws, and weak confrontations with the biggest bosses left this one a bit short of perfect. It's still definitely worth playing though. Especially if you liked the first KOTOR. It's also nice and long. It took me 50 hours to beat the first time through. May the force be with you...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2005"}

{"product_name":"B002I0K3PM","description":"","reviewerName":"C. L. Hanson","summary":"Must own for the Wii U","reviewText":"I'm basing my review on the first 6 hours of game play. First impressions, this is probably the funnest Lego game I've ever played, and I have quite a few of them (all for my XBox 360). Quite the ambitious outing for TT Games this time around, and has to be their biggest Lego game to date, taking place in a sprawling metropolis that appears to be based on San Francisco. There are plenty of pop culture references and humor abound. It is no secret that this game is more or less Grand Theft Auto with Legos, with the developers starting the game with a nod to GTA4: Niko Bellic arrived to Liberty City on a cargo ship; Chase McCain arrives in Lego City on a cargo ship too. Once off the boat, you will make your way to Police HQ and the game takes off. Unlike the hub worlds you'd find in other TT Games Lego offerings, you just follow the story chapter by chapter, you don't HAVE to stick to the story, you can drive around and explore the city, but the main character and dispatcher will occasionally remind you to get back to work.If you enjoy collecting studs, this is your game. They are EVERYWHERE! Streets, rooftops, you name it. Also, when you destroy an item, you collect brick pieces which also appear to act as currency.There have been some complaints by others saying the graphics are not as crisp and polished as it should be for the powerful Wii U. I'm not one to let graphics interfere with a fun game, let alone a Lego game. I own many of the other TT Lego offerings for the XBox 360, and the graphics were always magnificent, with the characters and environments seemingly buffed and polished. I would liken LC:U to the recent Lego Batman 2, where I noticed that the polish seemed to be down a notch from say, Lego Star Wars or Indiana Jones. LC:U still looks fantastic. The colors pop, the cut scenes look great. It is a Lego game, after all, not a first party Mario game. If you enjoy TT Lego games, you will like this.The Gamepad is used to its desired potential here, serving as not only a communication device, but also a audio/video scanner to find criminals and hidden bricks, and also serves as a map. I don't own a ton of Wii U games yet, but thus far, except for maybe NintendoLand, this has the best use of the Gamepad yet.As far as complaints go, the load times get a little old after a while. I think being a Wii U owner requires a certain level of patience, which is something Nintendo console owners have not really had to experience before, so, this being a Wii U exclusive game, I think the load times come with the territory. The driving controls could be a little tighter, as I found myself weaving down the road quite often, but I can't recall a Lego game where I ever felt like I was behind the wheel. I found driving with the D-Pad controls better than the control stick. One wish was that there was a radio station to enjoy while driving. With such a massive city to explore with countless vehicles, it just seems like a no-brainer to have at least one radio station instead of the droning him of the plastic engines and Chase repeating the same comments when he destroys stuff with his vehicle.Final word, this game is awesome. It's sold out everywhere, so if you can get your hands on a copy, you won't be sorry. There is enough packed into this game to entertain kids and adults alike for hours. I haven't even made it to 10% of the game completion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2013"}

Although this game feels similar to the rest of the series it isn't quite right.  I find that the game is more of a corridor based game in which the designers have laid out a path and a preferred way to do the level.  This for me is too scripted.  Blood Money was a persistent sandbox and I like the way that type of game plays.  Absolution on the other hand is a set of multiple corridors with trip wire mechanics instead of persistent game mechanics.  I find trip wire to be an outdated form of mechanic especially with the power of modern gaming machines.  The graphics are really nice and the voice acting is good.  I found the story to be enjoyable but the game was just not what I was looking for.  Many people find this game to be very good and many hate it.

I've played this over 1000 times and still love it. This addition into the series introduces one of the most addicting tools in Video game history, Pickpocketing. I spent so much time pickpocketing for cash and could never stop. My favorite levels are Rajans Palace, Dimitris club, and John Bisons Iron Horses. This one is also harder than the first. Instead of being a pure platformer this one relies more on stealth and tactic. You can't just run up on big enemies and kill them with one swipe. You have to sneak up on them and press triangle than square to slam them to the ground instakilling them. With little enemies it goes the same way to avoid attention. You also get to play as Murray and Bently. Murray is awesome because his strenth allows you to take out little enemies in two hits and sometimes big enemies. Bently is a little more harder to use because hes weakest and is only good for long distance attacks. I have been having fun using his sleep darts though and bombing the sleeping enemies. You also get better upgrades in this one than the first. You get upgrades by either collecting all bottled clues in a level or buying them with cash you picked up by destroying items, enemies, or the addicting pickpocketing. The only thing I hated was the fact that you can't redo missions you've done. There were some missions I loved enough to do over, but once you beat the game you only get to free roam for coins or unlockables, but not do missions.

Those looking for a hardcore RPG with a deep storyline along the lines of FF7 - FF10 will be sorely disappointed.  This game is simply a bunch of missions, kinda like sidequests if you will, where you control Yuna and Rikku (from FFX) plus the new character Paine.This game, however, is loads of fun!  While it's definitely not up to par with previous FF games, it adds that SquareEnix zing to the mission-based RPG.  The campy storyline is very reminiscent of Charlie's Angels, except they're called the Gullwings.  The most fun aspect of it is the dress spheres.  SquareEnix took the famous job system from FF5 and FF Tactics and incorporated it here in the most ingenious, if not laughable, way.  Your characters can change their outfits during battle, which gives them the powers associated with their outfit.  The more you wear each outfit, the more powerful it becomes until you master that job.  Then, there are special dress spheres that are equivalent to the Aeons of the original FFX.The storyline itself is fairly good.  While it's not the main focus, I personally can't wait to see whether Yuna reunites with Tidus (mysteriously referred to as &quot;he&quot; or &quot;him&quot; by the characters).  The graphics are top-notch, as usual.  The sound is great, but the 5.1 dolby digital mix is phenomenal!

This demon form features new visual effects and allows Dante to destroy enemies with one smashing blow.","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Good but too easy","reviewText":"When Devil May Cry burst onto the scene in 2001, it gave action junkies what they really craved: Dante-a cool-as-hell gunslinger with an attitude and fancy moves right out of The Matrix. It was a very tough game that shoved novice players aside and bulldozed those who stuck around with a barrage of oh-so-cool character techniques, eye-popping special effects, relentless monsters, and rewarding thumb-taxing gameplay. Like the recent Shinobi (albeit to a lesser degree), DMC was difficult-but not impossible-to complete, and one got a true sense of accomplishment from beating a tough boss on the umpteenth try or executing a \"Stylish!\" combo. The sequel, Devil May Cry 2, tries to appeal to a broader gamer base, with a \"friendlier\" enemy A.I. and action reduced from boil to simmer. In this case, however, \"easier\" doesn't equal \"better.\" For the unfamiliar, Devil May Cry was basically a playable big-budget action movie: The plot didn't really matter and once the lead started flying all you could think about was the next target. The methods of mayhem at your disposal were awesome and unique, whether it was juggling enemies in mid-air with a steady stream of gunfire, shattering armor with a well-timed punch, or delivering a double-barreled shotgun blast that propelled an enemy across the screen. DMC2 picks up where the original left off, as demons are once again running amok, and devil-hunter-for-hire Dante returning to the scene to do what he does best. However, he's joined by a second playable character, the knife wielding Lucia, who has her own unique moves...and motives. Lucia is the more challenging of the playable pair; she relies more on hit-and-run tactics and has a better selection of exotic weapons. DMC2 uses the original's Mission-by-Mission approach, as you obtain various orbs that can be cashed in for weapon upgrades and assorted power-ups. However, the level design is completely new and that's a big problem: Several Missions take place in huge, wide-open outdoor spaces that reduce your character to dot-size as they move at what seems like a snail's pace. Creepy gothic structures and settings are interspersed with urban landscapes, cities, and factories, which don't exactly create a demon-hunting atmosphere. What's really missing is the intense, edge-of-your-seat close-quarter combat that made the first game so arresting. Here the action isn't as layered, there's no rush from smashing or drilling enemies, and the limited combo system (\"Show Time!\") is unrewarding. The few and far between ferocious battles are peppered with an expanded plethora of puzzle-solving and platform-hopping tasks, the latter of which are all the more frustrating thanks to haphazard and awkward camera angles. Ultimately, you never really get immersed in the game; it feels more like simply passing through levels and fighting bosses, sans rhyme or reason. Not that DMC2 lacks favorable new aspects. The graphics are sharper than before, and Dante's been given some new moves such as the ability to fire dual weapons in two different directions and hike up walls. The new playable character, Lucia, adds diversity and replay value, and it's interesting to watch her and Dante's intertwined scenarios play out. The soundtrack, though, lacks punch-especially the sound effects. Weapon discharges are muted and not as intense as they should be, and the inappropriate disco music that starts whenever you engage in combat will set your teeth to \"grind.\" Competent voice acting lends life to various characters. Devil May Cry 2 is still an interesting second installment in Capcom's new franchise. Those who were turned off by the ramped-up difficulty may find this sequel to be more \"player-friendly,\" while the camp of hardened Devil vets may find this game to take one step forward, but two steps back. Overall, Devil May Cry hasn't lost its edge, but the blade is somewhat dulled.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2003"}

{"product_name":"B0009SQFHK","description":"Sega Sonic Rush Adventure 67001 PC Games","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"Right Were It Belongs: 2D","reviewText":"With Sonic Rush,Sega did something the best they could do: a great Sonic game in side-scrolling action something we finally get to see on the DS.The previous Sonic games received mixed reaction as Sonic doesn't translate very well to 3D,here it is a its true 2D glory right were it belongs.Sonic's first game on the Nintendo DS \"Sonic Rush\" is bringing back old school Sonic for the better,its true to the series and the blue hedgehog's fans have lots to be satisfied with this little gem.The blue hedgehog is back and brings the classic side-scrolling 2D adventure that made Sonic famous.This time instead of playing as Sonic all the time,you also play as Blaze The Cat a pink-purple female feline.That new character ain't bad and she actually has some good skills different of Sonic that makes her worth playing(those two are quite similar).In the story mode you have the Sonic story and the Blaze The Cat story,both of which are pretty good with the Sonic being arguably better.Still the game doesn't take full advantage of the DS'capacities no mic at all and the touch screen is limited to menus and some mini levels(who can be pretty tough).I would have to see more of the stylus in the game but actually i think that the button controls is just easier and probably better, that way the game has more of a classic feel.The element of 2D is back and you can feel and see the speed of the game,and the fact that its a 2D game alone,makes it the best Sonic game since..wow!A good while!The levels are designed in classic fashion not over the edge but always cool and there are a few levels that stand out.The Boss battles,are played in 3D but plays like 2D and those Boss battles plays in an old-school way.You know dodge, run, dodge, hit the Boss 3 times to beat him, hit him when he's down. That's the kind of Boss battles found in Sonic Rush, old school.Now the modes.Well there are 2 story mode with Sonic and Blaze each having their own adventure.Then there is the multiplayer mode where you try to complete a selected level faster than your opponent but that's about it,really.Sega was once a console maker and now it is reduced to being a game publisher and Sonic is probably the reason they're still related to video games or even exist.After dropping console status Sega is publishing its games on other consoles mostly their old rivals,Nintendo.I doubt we will see the day when Sega will once again be a powerful console maker,but at least we can still play their games.The only thing left to say is that Sonic Rush deserves a solid four stars and mostly due to the fact that they brought back the classic 2D Sonic.Nothing to complain about except this:if you are a newbie to Sonic who is used to play 3D games then it might not be that good for you,you won't understand why this game is such a big deal.For those who remember the old Sega days and how great Sonic was,you're in for a treat!Highly recommended,just about anyone can play it and have fun. The sequel Sonic Rush Adventure is also a very good game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2011"}

Very consistant (No wicked rubberband EA is known for), fairly realistic and competitive on All American Difficulty. Well, EA Decided that this year they are going to do LTPs (Live tuning package)to \"fix\" parts of the game that they notice are out of tune.Well as this idea sounds good on paper As of Aug 11 patch 2 was released and well what this does is seemingly takes a great game and makes it a toss up between this and NCAA 2007 current gen (Consensus worst edition ever). Now pretty much the game cheats in order to make it a close game, if you are losing you will avg 20 yards per carry and catch every pass, If you are losing you will get the run stuffed and you will miss wide open passes. This is not rubberband ai this is more like a see-saw AI. It is not that it is harder it is much less enjoyable when I know that 1st down I need to run, then on second I need to call run and audible to play action to get 15 yards. The AI is still easy to exploit but the game is now soo broken you are limited to what plays you can pick. I would say wait to see if they fix the before you purchase it , because this game is not fun as it stands.  I will update this and give a better score if they fix this. If this is how they leave off I will be pretty much done with EA.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2010"}

All are great games. It should be noted that you don't really \"solve\" the crime---which is a bit different than the Phoenix Wright games. These are more \"I Spy\" type puzzles than real point and click clue finding puzzles--so if you are looking for something like Phoenix Wright or Hotel Dusk this is not your game. These games are great to pick up and play for a short while. You can put them down and not have to remember a system or quest or what have you like in other more complicated games.I enjoyed this game. It came in rather short but that's o.k. as it is not a high priced game. I myself do not find too much replay value but others might.

{"product_name":"B003BE6OZ2","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Naruto fans get it... get it now","reviewText":"Being big fan of Naruto anime, this game was a must try for me. After finishing the game once finishing all of the main as well as most of side missions (~27 h) and playing some free and online matches, here is what I thought.**************PROS.*****************LONG AND FULFILLING SINGLE PLAYER STORY EXPERIENCE: Not being a big fan of fighter games, I was a bit concerned whether this game would have a good single player campaign. Now that I have finished the game I have to say I am quite satisfied and at points even impressed how nicely they have created single player story campaign experience. You will be traveling through a variety of areas (different villages, fields, hideouts, mountains from Naruto world) doing variety of missions and participating in some very nostalgic battles. Very impressed.AWESOME ANIMATION OF NARUTO ANIME IN HD GRAPHICS: The creators have done wonderful job reincarnating the Naruto anime in this game by animating the anime characters to utmost details. The game looks spectacular in 720p graphics. There are many fight scenes where you will forget that you are actually playing the game, as the graphics will look so good (play Sasuke vs Itachi fight). I am so happy I am not disappointed in this area as this is the main reason I bought the game.HUGE VARIETY OF CHARACTERS: Pretty much every single significant character you know from Naruto Shippunden anime is playable (starting from beginning of the anime to the Killer Bee-Sasuke fight). If you have seen the anime that is plethora of characters. Furthermore multiple versions of Naruto and Sasuke are also available so you can use ultimate jutsu of your choice (i.e for Sasuke long lightning blade or Amaterasu). In story mode depending on the mission different characters will accompany you and they are usable in different fights. Furthermore at the end of the game you can choose your own team so you can pretty much use every single Konoha character in story mode. Again very impressive.GREAT MECHANICS FOR ONE ON ONE AND TEAM BATTLES: What good is a fighting game without good fighting mechanics? In this game you can have one on one battle or have 1 or 2 side characters supporting you offensively and/or defensively. The fighting mechanics are not as great as top notch fighting games, but they are still great and characters for most part are balanced. Combat controls are for most part simplistic enough, but yet have unique depth to them for advanced players. For example striking punch button will pull off variety of combos, but if you just button mash punch the enemy will easily escape using substitution and punish you. Thus, timing of your attack as well as awareness of enemy moves is very important to win a battle. You won't be disappointed in this department.VARIETY IN GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCE:  Battles are not the only thing you will do in this game. In single player campaign you will travel through vast variety of land as described above. While traveling there will be plenty of side missions to finish and unlockables to find. In addition, there are plenty of mini-games such as catching birds and developing relationship with your comrades. This prevents the game from being redundant and if you like collecting stuff then this adds great length to gameplay.LARGE OPEN WORLD: As you progress more and more through the story, you will open up more and more areas that you can revisit for various reasons. This was not a necessary addition, but I am happy it is there. If you want to unlock most of the things you will be revisiting many areas. I am happy there are stepping into this direction.FORGIVING QUICK-TIME EVENTS:  A lot of games use quick time events these days (i.e. pressing correct button at the right time during a cut-scene to beat up your enemy or dodge danger). While I don't mind them in some games they get to be quite annoying as making one mistake will get you killed. Fortunately, that is not the case here. This game has some of the coolest cutscenes during the quick time events and if you get mesmerized by it and don't press the right button, no worries, you will get one more chance with some health deduction. If you are attentive and you press the right buttons each time then the game will reward you with stars which will help you unlock \"secret factor\". So happy about it.RANKED BATTLE SYSTEM: Not much to describe here. The battles are ranked. The type of jutsus and combos you pull off, the time you take and the strategy you use are all taken into account. So this truly promotes you to pull up the best combos instead of button mashing your enemy to the death. This truly makes you an active participant rather than a passive person who is just trying to get through the game.OPTION TO RELIVE PAST EVENTS: Yup, you don't have to replay the whole game (or level for that matter) to relive past battle or cutscene. Once you collect the scrolls for the scene, the game allows you to simply replay it. If you didn't get enough star rating or good ranks this is the chance to make up for it.PLATHORA OF UNLOCKABLES: Other than in game battles, you can unlock story, secret factors, jutsus etc. There is just so much of it. So if you are a completionist, this game will provide you ample things to do.HOURS AND HOURS OF VS BATTLES: When you are done with the game, you can of course spend hours and hours fighting with your friends on line or off line. These fights also provides you with \"experience\" which will help you unlock more stuff.**************CONS.*****************ELIMINATION OF SOME IMPORTANT EVENTS AND FAST FORWADING STORY: So this game covers large portion of Naruto Shippunden anime and so have variety of characters, but to cover the large portion of the story in relatively short amount of time, it removes some very important aspects of the story. With slight changes, they could have created a much better story experience. For example instead of focusing so much on doppelganger battles (real character vs fake character), they could have included some important fights such as that between pupateers or Orochimaru snake form vs Sasuke. So on the whole the directing is great, but if you have watched the anime like me, parts of the game will leave you somewhat dissatisfied.***************CONCLUSION************Contrary to the con. I mentioned, if you are Naruto fan, this game has hours and hours of entertainment to offer you. Whether you like the whole game or not, you will like battles especially those that are the highlights of the anime (Sasuke vs Itachi type). A must buy (9.4/10).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2011"}

Am I taking my time, working my way through every single dungeon/fort/cave?  Am I trying to finish as many side quests as possible?  Am I having too much fun playing through an immersive, addicting gaming experience?  Sure, around the 120th hour, these were the reasons why I haven't completed the main quest(s).  The reason I'm still puttering around in this huge world is because the main quest is broken.  It conflicts with another quest.  Forty eight days after buying Skyrim, and after playing it nearly every day, I cannot finish the game because it's broken.  Bethesda's released three patches, and I'm still farting around Skyrim, waiting for them to fix their messed up software.You're probably wondering why I'm still playing.  The game's undeniably screwed up: it lags, it crashes.

I promise you you do not want to listen to the 4 and 5 star reviews. One of the Amazon reviewers gave this an 8 out of 10 for graphics. That's ridiculous! I don't know what kind of TV that person was playing it on, but it must be one from the far future because that's the only thing that could make this game look good. I have a high-end Samsung LED(1080p) TV and Thief looks about like an early PS3 title. Not so great by today's standards. Definitely not PS4 quality. Assassin's Creed: Black Flag blows this away graphically. And in pretty much every other way, too.I played this about 10 hours and got bored out of my mind with it. I love stealth games but this one is poorly designed. There was no cool takedowns or kills when you sneak up behind them. You have to double tap the square button to pick up an item. The jump button is L2 for crying out loud! The weapons you use are very basic and not inventive at all. The world they created looks like it could be cool from a distance and had a lot of potential, but the graphics and design kill it. From what I gather this game is supposed to take place in the 15th century. Ok, so why do they all speak with American accents? About as bad as Leo Di Caprio speaking with an American accent in The Man In The Iron Mask!!If you like looting games, such as the Diablo series, then you're not going to like the looting in this one. The items you loot are generic as can be. It's similar to the relics you collect in the Uncharted series. That's fine in Uncharted because it's not a looting/stealth game. Going from room to room looting uninspired items, such as The Golden Mask, quickly grows redundant and tiresome. Yes, you can probably spend 30 to 40 hours completing everything in the game, but afterwards you may be asking yourself.... WHY? There's way too repetition. Too much of the same. Too much genericness. Pretty much everything is sub-par.The potential for a great Thief game is there, but Square Enix screwed the pooch. Do yourself a favor and rent it first? Unless you're really really bored or have bad tastes in games or both, then you will probably not enjoy this turd in thief's clothing.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2014"}

I liked it better when the stories were simpler to follow. That's not to say I dislike the newer Final Fantasy games, though. Things change through the years as do I and I love those games just as much.The game starts off with you(Luneth) assembling a team of heroes(Arc, Refia, and Ingus) to restore balance to the world. To do this, you must choose jobs(23 in all) to help aid you in your quest. Every battle you play through will add to each of the character's job level so you'll want to use thought in building not only your characters main level, but also their job proficiency as well. Although Final Fantasy III is a Very challenging game, it's also an entertaining one. I wish the Nintendo DS had more RPGs done in this style. I simply couldn't get enough of the game and kept on finding myself fighting one more battle & whatnot before putting it down. You'll explore the lands, man a boat, pilot an airship, ride a chocobo, find treasure, and more. Not only that but the game is simply beautiful. I agree, it's simply a better overall experience in 3-D.Maybe it's just me, though, but I get a distinct Final Fantasy VII feel with this game. Don't ask me how but I do. That's a good thing, though.All in all, you're looking at an RPG that clocks in around the 50/60 hour mark depending on how you play. With new side quests and moogle mail, you'll have a bit more to play.Final Fantasy III is a DS gem that shouldn't be missed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2006"}

The world of this game is over 400 square miles in size, contains plains, jungles, rivers, arctic, deserts and mountains, and encompasses alot of action.  You can blow tons of stuff up, can steal ANY VEHICLE IN THE GAME, from jeeps and motorcycles to attack choppers and fighter jets....and you can actually steal them while they are moving or in flight (whichever the case may be).  The best part is, although there is a main storyline, there are other secondary storylines that revolve around three different gangs all vying for control of Panau (the fictional Southeast Asian country you're in).  There is alot to do, much to discover, and many bad guys to kill....plus, you can jump out of fighter jets flying at almost mach one and wait until you almost hit the ground and open your chute to land safely...now that's cool.The graphics are beautiful, the controls are straight, for the most part, and the storyline, although could be better (see the Uncharted Series), is good enough for such a phenomenal game.  If you play it and don't like it,  you're probaby just not into action games anyway.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2011"}

This game has a lot of good ideas, but they are largely negated by some really bad design decisions.There are two HUGE faults that keep this from being a great game.  First: the role-playing system is bad.  Plain and simple.  It's not very useful, flexible, robust, or strategic.  The skills system that helped make the first game so great is gone, and that was a huge mistake.  The replacement, a carved up biomod system and a weak weapons mod system, requires little planning or thought.  There are only five biomod slots now, and the weapons mod system is cheap and underpowered.  The system in the first game was so wonderful, because it was loaded with choices and tradeoffs.  You could spend your skills system to become a tank, a hacker, a ninja, a frogman, or any combination that you wanted.  It's nonexistent here.  There is no sense of power development like what you get in a good RPG, where you start off as a complete wimp and end up the game as a demigod.  That is why \"Deus Ex: Invisible War\" is very shallow as an RPG.The other major fault of this game is the size of the maps.  They are ridiculously tiny.  Most of the areas are tight, indoor cramped spaces.  You have to get to the end of the game before you encounter any big open outdoor areas.  Exploring an area to find the alternate \"secret\" entrance to a well-guarded facility is laughably easy.  Part of the fun of the first game was wandering around the huge open maps and maybe sneaking into a huge building through the roof.  In this game, the front door and the air vent that takes you around it are only five feet away.  What's the point?  Small maps also mean frequent (and long) loading times.One welcome change from the first game is a big improvement in the voice acting.  Both the male and female Alex voice actors sound very good.  Except for voice acting though, the rest of the sound in this game takes a big step backwards.  Alex Brandon's music is scaled way back.  Forget about hearing another great soundtrack like the first game.  The weapons sound like toys, and the noises in the game don't do a good job of letting you know how stealthy are your being.  That's part of stealth just not being very useful in this game.  The riot prod is useless and the tranquilizer dart gun takes two shots now instead of one to take down an enemy.  Silent takedowns are too hard, but you don't need them anyways, since most enemies aren't much of a threat to you.  You can take most of them out easily with the overpowered sniper rifle.Deus Ex: Invisible War has some saving graces that make it worth playing.  The storyline is still excellent.  I think that it would have helped to make the game longer and give it more character development, but it's still great.  The story has one or two very surprising twists in it, and it gets you to think philosophically, just like the first one.  It all makes for a good legitimate sequel story, instead of just a thrown-together rehash of the first one (which is common for sequels).  Warning:  if you did not play the first game, then you will be totally lost, since the plot for \"Invisible War\" is pretty convoluted too.The developers had some good creative ideas too.  Some of the \"black market\" biomod canisters that you find are wicked, like one that lets you control bots, and one that imparts EMP to your melee attacks.  The rocket launcher has a guided missile mode that puts you into the first-person view of the missile.  I also got a lot of amusement out of the NG Resonance character, a holographic AI that provides some comic relief, as well as some hints and side quests.  And, even with the scaled-back role-playing system, \"Invisible\" still has tons of good dialog and lots of open-ended problem-solving.  Plus, there's nothing else like it out there as far as action/RPG games go.  It's too bad though, that there was so much removed for this game.  If it had been a full-fledged sequel instead of \"Deus Ex Lite\", then it could have been as good as the first one.  I would love to see a third Deus Ex game that combines the best elements of the first two.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2003"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"Chaz Ashley","summary":"Great massive adventure","reviewText":"The game is as you'd expect from Bioware, well written and well told. Bioware has yet to really fail with this, they do great writing simple as that. The game is large and epic like perhaps Lord of the Rings with all sorts of different races, Elves, Dwarfs and jobs- Humans, mages, warriors, rouges. And like biowares other games you make your character to how you want/like, you pick gender race and job.The game is massive just to get that out there it's anywhere from 40-80 hours depending how good you are at these games. I'm not terribly great at them but it's fun to play and very immersive.Now this part will confuse you, the game looks great but is ugly at times, the characters and such look great, but then you'll see a carriage in the background that looks like it was taken off a early PS2 game with muddy graphics and just ugly. While it's not deal breaking it does sometimes catch your eye in a bad way. But the game isn't about graphics and even less about a carriage, it's about the story and gameplay, which the game does very very well.If you're new to the series save often and save on different slots so you don't back yourself into a corner.I'm going to cut this review short because there's plenty of reviews that go into better depth and discuss just how expansive the game is and how well done it is and say for the price this game is worth it, there's a lot of replay value and with a game this long, it can entertain for a long, long time.My only gripe is you're playing a silent protagonist, while your character has options you pick, he/she does not talk.If you like Mass Effect or KoToR this game has elements from both, so check it out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2010"}

It really is that good and there's a ton of reader reviews here that explain why.But I am 70 hours into the game and the flaws are starting to show.  There's a lack of character specialization with traits and talents that make all of your characters too much like other characters in their abilities by the time you are 20 hours into this very long game.  Stealing and unlocking are virtually useles since you get almost exclusively junk for your efforts. But the greater flaw is that mages have crazy abilities that overpower anything else in the game.  Some of the fun is drained from the game when you can spam fireball a few times and kill everything while the rest of your team is standing behind you doing nothing.  Enemy mages appear too rarely to offer a balance to this issue and even when an enemy mage does appear it is simply a matter or freezing him.  Basically your mages are gods almost from the start of the game. When you look at the old game Baldur's Gate 2, you didnt not have these balance issues.  Every character type had very distinct pros and cons and mages couldnt spam attacks. Oh and did I mention that mages in Dragon Age have lots of health points too?  Argh.There was a recent patch that nerfed some of the mage spells but it didnt go far enough.I suspect there will be add-ons and mods that really do fix these issues in the next year or so, and its a great game so I have no hesitation reccommending it.  but dont say someone didnt warn you when you stop using your melee warriors and just going in with a few mages and incinerating everything.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2009"}

When a form of evil that goes right back to the dawn of days resurfaces from there, a Special Forces squad, trained in both conventional warfare and the arcane arts, is sent in.

This game was advertised a lot but didn't quite sit well with critics due to its limited atmosphere(which i don't understand considering Bioshock 1 and 2 both take place in the same area with nothing new) and repetitive game play. I say repetitive with a grain of salt here because its not really the gameplay itself as it is the difficulty in switching back and forth from each member of your team once you die. Now if all members go down then the game is over then you repeat the whole ordeal again. Other than that the game is great, the graphics look amazing, even now in 2010 and its loads of fun even if it is on the cheesy side. You play as members of the \"Jericho\" squad who are basically supernatural beings consider to be \"occult specialist\", you might even say your dead yet alive. So each member has his or her special powers that you can use, from slicing your hand and catching enemies on fire with your blood, to killing enemies using telepathy its really different and makes the game unique. One other awesome aspect i have yet to see in any game is when using the sniper rifle(check out the demo) you can follow behind the bullet and lead it straight into your enemies head, while difficult its very effective and looks plain awesome. So yes this game is graphic and scary making you very tense throughout. It definitely has the Clive Barker creatures and feel that fans have all come to know and love, so while its not the greatest game in the world its definitely worthy or a higher score among fans and critics. So pick it up for around 8.99 at Gamestop and have some scary violent fun, getting past the repetition is no big deal, just takes some time to know how to go from member to member. Btw it brings up the names of each one when switching between who you wanna be, so memorize that.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2010"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Steve","summary":"FEAR 2 like FEAR 1","reviewText":"FEAR 2 deserves your time because it's fun, graphically stunning and satisfying. That's it. It's a short game, and there are no new innovations from the first game besides some new weapons, so it's basically the same game with better graphics. Everything looks great, with solid frame-rate and fast loading times. A couple of powered armor sequences seem like filler, although they are fun, and the same scare tactics as in the first game roll out again. Alma sneaks up on you, objects fly around, blood and guts spatter the halls and doors. Truly, this game means to sicken you more than scare you, and developers need to take care that FEAR doesn't err too far from its paranormal origin. The developers could probably make a sophisticated and classy game if they would stop pouring blood buckets on gamers. Using blood and maulings (a la Friday the 13th) to scare people doesn't work so much as spooky atmosphere and a good story. I love FEAR and hope it continues the legacy of quality gaming without becoming too gorey.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2009"}

Peavey","summary":"Super Mario Lost Galaxy","reviewText":"After Nintendo finished making Super Mario Galaxy, Shigeru Miyamoto approached the development team and suggested that a follow-up be produced. The game was originally planned to just do variations on the original game's planets and call the game &#34;Super Mario Galaxy More&#34;, (it was dubbed &#34;Super Mario Galaxy 1.5&#34; during early development), with a projected development time of approximately a year. The first elements that were implemented were anything that was scrapped from the original game, either to ensure game balance or simply because of time constraints, such as Yoshi and the concept of a planet shaped like Mario's head. Over time, more and more new elements and ideas were brought into the game, and it was decided that the game would be a fleshed-out sequel rather than a slightly modified follow-up. Thus, development took two and a half years. Takeshi Hayakawa, the lead programmer for Super Mario Galaxy 2, created a development tool that allowed different staff members, including visual and sound designers, to easily design and creates stages without waiting for programmers, many of which were incorporated into the final game. With that said let&#8217;s begin the review of Super Mario Galaxy 2.Story/Plot: Princess Peach invites Mario to share some cake at the Star Festival, a time when Star Bits rain down from the skies over the Mushroom Kingdom. On his way, Mario finds a Luma, who immediately befriends him and grants him the ability to spin. Shortly thereafter, Mario's nemesis Bowser, who has grown to an immense size (after swallowing Grand Stars, unbeknownst to Mario at this point), appears and attacks Princess Peach's Castle. Kidnapping the princess, Bowser escapes into outer space to recreate his empire at the center of the universe. After launching into outer space, Mario is given control of Starship Mario, a mobile planetoid in the shape of his head, made by a crafty Luma mechanic called Lubba, powered by Power Stars, and piloted by other Lumas; his mission is to fly across the universe in pursuit of Bowser and the Princess and to help Lubba find the lost Lumas that were part of Bowser's plot. Along the way Mario meets new Lumas and joins up with his companion Yoshi, the Toad Brigade from the original Super Mario Galaxy, and his brother Luigi. Upon collecting enough Power Stars, Starship Mario reaches Bowser's main fortification, draining energy from what appears to be a comet. Mario infiltrates the castle and defeats Bowser, retrieving the last Grand Star. Rosalina and her Comet Observatory from the first Super Mario Galaxy appear before Mario and Peach. Rosalina thanks Mario for watching over the Luma that he had found, and the Luma returns to the Comet Observatory, taking Mario's hat with him. Mario and his friends return to the Mushroom Kingdom and celebrate their victory. The game ends with Starship Mario sitting above Princess Peach's Castle, with the Comet Observatory streaking across the sky.Gameplay: The gameplay of Super Mario Galaxy 2 is similar to Super Mario Galaxy, with a focus on platforming based on and around 3D planets (referred to collectively as galaxies) with varying themes, sizes, landscapes, and climates. The player controls Mario (or later in the game, his brother Luigi, though using him is optional), who has special abilities such as the &#34;Spin&#34; attack, long jump, wall jumps, and a variety of somersaults. As in the original, the objective of the game is to travel to the various galaxies and collect Power Stars, which are awarded by completing levels and accomplishing tasks and are used to gain access to later levels. The game retains some gameplay mechanics introduced in the original, such as the blue Star Pointer that allows the player to pick up Star Bits and shoot them at enemies, levels that restrict movement to a 2D plane, balance ball levels, and gravity-reversing background arrows.Powerups: All the original transformations in Super Mario Galaxy return except for Ice Mario and Flying Mario, along with some new power-ups and items. These include the Spin Drill, which allows the player to burrow through some planets and emerge out the other side; Rock Mario, which allows the player to smash through obstacles, such as boulders and enemies; and Cloud Mario, which allows the player to create temporary platforms in midair. Mario is able to ride the dinosaur Yoshi, who is available in certain levels. When riding Yoshi, the player's blue Star Pointer is replaced by a red dot, which allows the player to point at various objects and manipulate them with Yoshi's tongue. Yoshi can also use his tongue to swing across gaps, pull levers, and swallow enemies (with the option to spit them back out as projectiles). Yoshi allows player to double jump. There are also three different power-up fruits available for Yoshi to eat that grant him temporary abilities. These are the Dash Pepper, the Blimp Fruit and the Bulb Berry. The Dash Pepper allows Yoshi to run quickly, giving him the ability to run up walls and run on water; the Blimp Fruit allows Yoshi to float into the air; and the Bulb Berry allows Yoshi to reveal secret pathways.Music: As with the original Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Galaxy 2 features a musical score written for and performed by a symphony orchestra (known as the Mario Galaxy Orchestra in the credits). Early in the development process, when the concept of &#34;Super Mario Galaxy 1.5&#34; was being considered, there were no plans to use different music from the first Super Mario Galaxy. However, as the game evolved, the sound team, headed by Mahito Yokota, realized they needed new music that fit with the new gameplay mechanics that were being added. Although they were hesitant to use a symphony orchestra again because of recording difficulties, general producer Shigeru Miyamoto gave permission immediately &#8211; according to Yokota, Miyamoto felt that players would be expecting an orchestral soundtrack. Miyamoto also apparently suggested that players would want to hear arrangements from Super Mario Galaxy, which is why the soundtrack is a mixture of brand new pieces and arrangements of themes from the original Galaxy as well as many past installments in the Mario series, such as Super Mario World and Super Mario 64. Ryo Nagamatsu, who worked previously on Mario Kart Wii, Wii Sports Resort, and New Super Mario Bros. Wii, contributed nine pieces to the soundtrack.Story 4.5/5 Gameplay 5/5 Music 5/5 Overall 9.5/10 = A","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2014"}

After playing now for about 3 days, I would have to say that it really isn't.  This really is not a complex morality/decision making game, it is straight up survival horror with an emphasis on story more than shooting etc.Controls take some getting used to, they went with the deliberately slow and methodical feel like Resident Evil 5, no running and gunning here.  That is OK, I understand that it helps create the atmosphere, but the controls are choppy and the camera is not very cooperative, but still you can overcome it....it is only a $20 title, what where you expecting?  The graphics are generally ok, not next gen for sure...compare to a ps2 title.  That is ok too....its a $20 title.  The story is good...sometimes very chilling and engrossing, other times very Japanese cheesy and falls flat.  It is OK though, it is a $20 title and the story you get is well worth the money.  The battle sequences are just OK, there are some unexpected QTE's which actually will lead you to death on more than one occasion.  You can save only at 'telephone' locations, so sometimes when you die there is some replaying...not too much, but enough to get annoying.....but hey, its a $20 game.  There are some normal survival horror puzzles, you know-- pushing crates, figuring out patterns and the like, nothing new, but kinda fun....especially for a $20 title.  There are things to collect, infinite respawning zombies, a decent story, and most of all...only $20.Releasing this game at the $20 price point certainly allows it some leeway when trying to be critical.  NO, this game is not a masterpiece....it sometimes feels a little silly calling it 'good'...it truly is just OK.  What I like is the idea to release a sub-blockbuster game at a sub-blockbuster price.  Honestly even releasing this for $49.99 would send that message, and it might have still been worth it.  I hope people give this game a shot, and hopefully other publishers will see its success and consider the idea...not likely I know.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005YTYJ","description":"WithGrand Theft Auto III, Rockstar proves that not all  developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games.  This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a  monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages  to get everything right.--T.

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"Niko's first day in Liberty City - the first of MANY.","reviewText":"Even though I have only played one day in Liberty City as Niko Bellic, the only way to review GTA IV is to take you on a journey of those first 24 hours.After a short 7 minute download to my hard disc drive, the game was ready. At the end of the intro movie I directed Niko into the car with Roman at the shipyard. There's an on-screen tutorial on how to accelerate, brake, handbrake, and turn the radio stations on and off. I'd seen this before in other Grand Theft Auto games, so I wondered: what was new?Quite a bit, as I would soon discover.I saw a map option that showed the quickest legal route in a vehicle to my destination (which isn't always the fastest). I found out that the headlights on the car can go high-beam. When I hit the pause menu, I saw a HUGE list of statistics that I would need another 4,000 characters to describe, such as time spent on the internet, time watching TV, emails & text messages sent & received, times I've played darts, shot pool, or gone bowling? And this is just skimming the surface!After Roman left me in his crappy apartment, I tried out a few controls. I punched the fridge, and it made a sound like hitting porcelain. I watched a little TV, changing channels and adjusting the volume. I left the apartment and saw tagger graffiti in the halls. I tried to swipe a car to speed over to Roman's cab company, but I found out that the Liberty City folks don't take lightly to Grand Theft Auto. They smacked me around a bit, and I had to run through some alleyways to avoid the cops!The first mission was pretty simple, and during that mission I picked up a crummy cell phone. What a feature: we can read and send text messages, make calls, adjust the volume, and even change the ring tone! I even got to use my charismatic skills to get a date with a fine young lady. I had to go shopping first, though. The shopping option is different, we can walk around to different clothing racks and pick out what we want...a welcome change.\"My idiot cousin was in trouble with some Albanians, but how could I say no to my lady friend? I started to take her to the funfair; we had to take a little detour because I accidentally hit a police car. Being busted would have been a sour end to our date! Once we got to the funfair, we decided to go bowling instead.\" [This was incredibly fun! We get a bowling tutorial and five free frames to start out, by the end of the tutorial; you'll want to play again.]\"After I dropped Michelle back at her place, I felt the vibrations of my cell phone. [Yet another reason to pick up aDualshock Controller- I thought my actual cell phone was going off!] Roman reamed me out for choosing the girl over family, but he admitted that he probably would have done the same thing. I dropped him off at his cab company, and I sat in the car and reflected on the day's events.\"I can't even put into words how IMMERSIVE this game is. Hot dogs to replenish my stamina? An in-game tutorial on how to use the controller for popping wheelies on motorcycles? Attention to details like bees at a wastebasket? Chinese lettering on cardboard boxes outside a restaurant? Skid marks on the asphalt from using the car handbrake? It's all here.I ordered theGrand Theft Auto IV Special Editionbut I just couldn't wait to review this game. After two hours of playing it, I know I'll be hooked for MONTHS unlocking all the secret goodies.Obviously this game has the right rating. Blood, violence, sexual themes, alcohol consumption, and many other items dictate that this game shouldn't be played by the under 17 crowd. It's not for everyone, though. Some gamers may not like the freedom Liberty City offers, in which case I would highly suggest a more linear game likeUncharted: Drake's Fortune.This is the type of game that makes me believe there is no difference between motion pictures and video games anymore.Have fun! I know I will.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001C4C4KW","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"My favorite \"Disgaea\" yet...","reviewText":"I could not disagree with the three star review more: the current iteration of \"Disgaea\" is, IMHO, the best strategy game ever made, overtopping both of the original offerings in this series.Why, though? What makes this offering stand out from its counterparts? It's simple, really: it's precisely the bizarre storyline of the main quest. Lots of people heaped praise on the storyline of the original \"Disgaea\". I wasn't one of them. I personally thought that, while the story had its moments, in the end, it was pretty blah (particularly considering the cast of wonderful characters appearing). The storyline for the 2nd \"Disgaea\" was less entertaining than the first (mostly because the cast of characters wasn't interesting in the least, until the post-game madness started). Yet, I loved the first two games, precisely because of what happened AFTER the game. The number of extras in the first game was impressive, and the extras in the 2nd game were absolutely stagerring.But finally, I really enjoy the storyline. I won't spoil it, but it is incredibly strange, and wholly entertaining. Rather, I'll break my review into the typical pro and cons sections:PROS:1) Storyline - It's funny. It's well-written. What more could you ask for.2) Music - At times, it's positively incredible. The music playing in the background while in the academy (i.e. while not battling) ranks among my favorite video game themes of all time, and the main theme is good as well. The battle themes are less impressive, but this is actually nice, if one attempts to beat the game with skill as opposed to level-grinding (I would rather focus my concentration on the battle at hand).3) Voice-acting - I enjoy it immensely. It works very well for the story present (although the Japanese voices annoy me).4) Extras - I'm not talking about in-game extras (of which there are so many, I cannot even begin to describe them). I'm talking about the soundtrack CD accompanying the product. I love music CDs, when they're free.5) Price - Most Sony PS3 games are sixty bucks, and most PS3 games stink. It's nice to get a fifty dollar offering that is enjoyable.6) In-game extras - You could easily play this game for 150 hours. There is so much craziness to end the game, it's not even funny.CONS:1) Graphics - Yes, I know. It's not really important to the main offering. But come on. Most of the time in the game is spent either in battles, or in the school. There's really not much to illustrate here. Why not go the extra mile and make some interesting NEW character designs? I mean, these are the EXACT SAME monsters we saw in the original \"Disgaea\".That's about it. Really.This game, however, will not appeal to anyone. Action gamers, stay away. There's nothing wrong with that, and the comment isn't meant as an insult. Some people don't like the slow pacing of strategy games, or the level grinding madness that ends each \"Disgaea\" game. Strategy gamers, come one, come all. Let's face it, we haven't gotten many strong offerings recently (I deplore the DS \"FFTA\" game, and the Wii's \"Fire Emblem\" was a pretty frail offering as well). \"Disgaea\" fans - well, I don't even have to tell you, do I?Good stuff.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001C4C4KW","reviewerName":"Tristan A. Hayes","summary":"True to the Disgaea Formula","reviewText":"Before I begin I would like to start by saying that I picked up Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice the day of its release on August 26, 2008.  There have been numerous updates to the game since then and I shall detail them first. (DLC=downloadable content from the playstation store)1. Trophy Support added as of July 30, 20092. DLC of Characters from previous Disgaea Titles ($1.99 each)3. DLC of modes to share states online4. DLC of chapters for one of the side characters (Rasberyl) adds roughly 10-20 hours of gameplay.Generally speaking the only addition most players will need is the FREE trophy support update which you may be prompted to get if you are buying the game for the first time.  Who doesnt want PS3 trophys?-----------------------------------Anyway all of that aside, Disgaea 3 is the third in the demon underworld strategy japanese role playing game from NIS.  Although it carries the 3 behind its title, the story is completely unrelated to the other games and introduces an entire new cast of characters.  The only returning characters are NIS signature Prinny's which add a bit of comedic relief.The game explores the story at this underworld school as you, as Mao the overlord's son, are an honor student dedicated to trying to get revenge on his father since he broke his video games that he had invested thousands of hours of playtime on.  You are also trying to be the number one delinquent in this school since that is what is good in the demon underworld. The story proceeds on through about 8 or 9 of these chapters that expand from this minor story to one that is greater and more epic as you go through plot twists, face the upperclassman sophomores and the diez gentleman (a group of upperclassman students), and more.Along the way other storyline characters join the quest such as Almaz von Adamant Almadine (who wants to be a hero), Princess Sapphire, Rasberyl and her friends, a few teachers.  The character cast is actually quite hilarious as you will face a Home Economics Teacher, Master Big Star the Sophomore Class Leader, and even the PTA.The story is enjoyable and lasted me about 100 hours to get through...------------------------------------------Gameplay, Disgaea plays out like the previous version.  You play as Mao and can create new characters to join your team.  Characters can come from numerous classes.  Each class has about 6 tiers with level requirements to satisfy unlocking more.  You can also transmigrate your character to a higher tear (but they will start at level 1) or to another group altogether.  Basically if you want to explore the system you can but some players can breeze through the game using just the first tier of character straightway.Additional caveats to character creation include the ability to alter their weapon choices by having them use a variety of weapons and gaining the skills and level points for it, you can also go into the \"class world\" to boost a few of their abilities, or go into the item world to boost the points of the item.  Furthermore in the items you can move the residents (basically character who give additional features to the item such as higher health, or exp gain), to other items or combine them. Once again the possibilities are endless but you can go through the game to avoid it.Additonal caveats-Players gain experience points in battle to level up-Players gain mana points in battle when they vanquish an opponent-Mana points are used to learn and boost abilities (evilties), boost skills/learn new skills, or to use in the \"Homeroom\" to make new characters, or pass topics in homeroom (tons of topics, useful in the post storymode to unlock the maps to get bosses and previous characters and DLC)Generally speaking the way in which the gameplay is setup it can cater to a variety of players, new people can breeze through it, while other players can invest in FAQS or guides to dig into the statistics and boost their characters for hours on end.  The level limit is 9999, you can do billions of damage, but all of that depends on how much time you are willing to invest post game. Once you beat the story mode you can go back and keep using your characters, everything transfers over except for unlockable characters which you will get at the time you unlocked themFor new players, the game works by you going to the gate keeper and then selecting the next map, there is no exploration or anything of that nature.Production Values-Sound:  The Disgaea soundtrack by Tenpei Sato is true to the series. A few tracks from previous titles return while there are tons of news ones. Extreme Outlaw Overlord will never get old (plays when you are in the schoolgrounds), and nothing ever gets old.  Most of the songs convey the story scenes emotion quite well.-Voices, Voices are available in Japanese or English, English sounds good to be honest. I love the lines Almaz has as well as the passion with which Mao's voice actor speaks.Graphics: 2D sprites are nice, battle animations start off unimpressive, but if you raise the tier higher these attacks look flashier and more powerful.  Vasa Aergun for Mao looks awesome and never gets old.  Get a gunner and try those higher level attacks, lol.  Actually a few attacks look quite brutal!Overall the game can last anywhere from 40 hours to thousands of hours depending on your play style. Ive actually gone back since beating it at 80 hours to unlock more stuff and to raise my characters to above lvl 500, with some characters at lvl 4500!  Some of the trophies are a feat to get.  It was well worth the 50$ I spent on this game.Note to veterans: Borrows Geoblock elements from Disgaea Afternoon of Darkness and expands them","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00008QOL6","description":"When it comes to first-person shooters, there are two schools of thought. One harkens back to the originalDoom--frantic action, scary monsters, big weapons, and story is given short shrift. The second school is best exemplified byHalf-Life: strong narrative, consistent real-world weapons, consistent monsters, and settings.Doom'sheirs up until now have beenQuakeandSerious Sam, but nowPainkillercomes onto the scene leaving bloody footprints, and &#x85; let the carnage begin!You play a man who dies in a pathetic car crash (he's distracted because he's holding his girl's hand) and has spent a long time in purgatory. He thinks this is unfair because, despite being well-schooled in the art of killing, he maintains that he's done nothing wrong. Heaven makes a deal with him. Take care of a little invasion problem concerning Hell, and our hero can enter those pearly gates.Weak storyline aside,Painkillerbasically amounts to a brilliant series of arcade-style levels and challenges. The settings include darkened monasteries, graveyards, a horrifying asylum, a medieval town under siege, and even H-E-Double Hockey Sticks itself. The level design is brilliant, varied, and jam-packed with enemies. There seems to be no end to the amount and variety of cool monsters to fight, and they each explode into chunks of blood and gore in a most disturbingly satisfying manner. At the end of each level is a challenge, such as collecting a certain amount of gold or killing a Boss within a time limit. Winning the challenge gives you tarot cards you can use to make the game easier. The different cards bring haste, double-damage, invulnerability, and so on. This simple mechanic makes the game far more replayable than your average shooter.The graphics are first rate, which means you need a powerful PC to run the game with all the detail settings maxed out. The only other problem is a CD-copy protection bug that makes the game unplayable for some (a patch is available).Painkillermay seem a bit silly at first glance. But the gameplay mechanics, replayability (full multiplayer is also available), variety, and brilliant level design make it one of the finest and most satisfying shooters ever made. -Andrew S.

This game definitely has the been there, done that 1st person shooter feel to it.Your main weapon is called the PainKiller. If you master this weapon and its abilities, it is basically the only weapon you will need. To get to some hidden spots and secret areas you will need to use the alternate mode of this weapon and an object(like a table, coffin, cart) to climb or jump higher to the secret spots and hidden goodies.The weapons and weird monsters make this game fun. There is nothing like using your stake gun to nail a zombie to a wall only to beat him to death with your PainKiller. lolIn summation -This game is worth playing, especially at night in the dark with head phones on. Don't skip this game...but don't blow $40 either!I got a copy from a friend that did not want it any more. If I had paid $40, I would have been very PO'd! Don't spend that much.

If you have never played Fallout 3, play that first, then play New Vegas.My review can be quick and simple. It is Fallout 3, in Vegas! lolNot much has changed, new weapons, some improvements, some neat features added (like HARDCORE mode which I am playing!)but mostly it has stayed the same. And that is GOOD!!!!!!!!!! They did not try to fix what was not broken!My only complaint is that the music is not as fun or enjoyable as the music from Fallout 3. I just liked those tunes better! No big deal though.I would like to see an improved game engine and graphics in the future. It is looking dated.

As I see, amazon offers used discs for cheaper price EVEN THEN SOLD OUT BRITISH  EDITION, so GET IT!Why would you get it? It is game from 2000. or so, graphics are much better today, you can play good online games like Guild Wars or  World of Warcraft with buddies and then some...but!Deus Ex is a game WITH A STORY: story is like fast paced Ludlum and Bourne's identity type of novel, which doesn't mean it's a copy.Deus Ex is a game UNLINEAR: you can be a butcher who does what he is told,  OR try to follow higher moral system of value and never take anything for granted or black and white. Choices decide how others interact.Deus Ex is a game that can be HUMANE: why kill someone when you can just make them unconcious if you creep behind guy's back and whack him with a crowbar or baton?Deus Ex is a game that has RPG elements: more you do, more points you get, and then you distribute them between different skills: you can make yourself computer and electronic hacker OR you can make flamethrowers, pistols and rifles your forte, if you are Rambo fan.What? I didn't hype it enough? GO GET IT FOR 4 BUCKS YOU CAN't GO WRONG!!! I would even pay up to 40 bucks to get it although it is old and graphics is bad for today's PC best machines.PSDon't give up after level one, you NEED to spend time to learn how to play but later it becomes GREAT!!!PPSIf I had to pick greatest game for PC since nineties, I guess I would have to pick some of Real Time or Turn strategies, Pirates! from 2002 by Sid Meyer, Diablo II, Fallout part one and maybe two and Deus Ex!Best pure shooters would be Alice by American McGee and Clive Barker's Undying.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SOME MINOR SPOILERS AND MUST READ ADVICES (AFTER COMPLETING GAME):You have to chose between assault rifle and assault shotgun. I think shotgun is better so don't spend upgrades on rifle. Later, unfortunately, it's easier to get rifle ammo.What you really need in the game are fast legs to run away so upgrade JCs body with leg implants.Don't forget to install and upgrade recovery ability, it's useful to turn it on with F9 when you fight mechs or men in black.Use rocket launcher , it opens all doors except infinite. SAVE rockets,  lockpicks, bio cells and multitools and try to find nano key cartridges or codes for doors and stuff. I spent lotsa exp on hacking, in the beginning, then lockpicking and electronics.YOU MUST have at least one level of heavy weapon and one level of rifle...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2007"}

Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement.

Game & Wario was initially conceived as a customary demonstrative package of some of the Wii U's snazziest features, and was at first planned to be preinstalled on its hard drive... much of it feels stylistically lazy and conceptually undercooked. Smooth development was hampered with apparent misdirection, stretched out and later unpunctually slapped with the Wario label, giving Intelligent Systems the excuse to go crazy with the content, as Wario-themed endeavors often rely on their off-the-wall tone and frenzied overture to attain the desired effect. Even if previous WarioWare efforts weren't all that visionary, they nonetheless managed to provide a significant amount of replay value that took quite awhile to begin the process of subsiding. Only a fraction of Game & Wario's 16 mini-games (12 single-player, 4 multiplayer-only), each spotlighting an anchor WarioWare character, are noteworthy, and the rest can be filed as fundamentally counterproductive attempts to find resourceful uses for the peripheral interplay between the screen of the Wii U's GamePad and your television set.Of the heavily imbalanced batch, \"Gamer\" implements the best usage of the Wii U's dual-panorama coaction, having players assume the role of avid Nintendo fanboy 9-Volt as he plays a number of 8-bit microgames on his treasured handheld under the covers. It's past the youngster's curfew, and his mother, 5-Volt, continually bursts into the bedroom, hollering at you to go to sleep. The goal is, naturally, to not get caught for as long as possible. The GamePad's display is host to a collection of diverting microgames, and the happenings in 9-Volt's room occur on the TV monitor. The exhibited synergy is utterly simplistic yet rather ingenious, sensibly and effectively leading your focal points astray while evoking nostalgia. (Seriously, what prepubescent gamer didn't spend late nights beneath blankets with their Game Boy?) The most durable WarioWare exploits, such as \"Gamer,\" rack the brain, but do so in a way that's inexplicably addictive, stopping short of crossing the line into controller-breaking frustration. \"Pirates\" and \"Taxi\" are also examples of this kind of inspired cleverness: The former is a feverish rhythm game that uses the GamePad as a sort of shield to deflect incoming directional indicators ordered by a mad Captain Wario, while the latter has easily distracted dog-and-cat cabbies Dribble and Spitz starring in a kinetic drive down Route 56. \"Taxi\" is the less inventive of the two, having a first-person windshield perspective on the GamePad and a map on the TV screen, but it decidedly has the least amount of diminishing returns, repeatedly offering a high degree of dynamism even in its preliminary stages.While these three minigames are enjoyable, their inventiveness doesn't carry over to the remainder of Game & Wario. The worst offenders in the single-player bracket are chronically dull, requiring only a few minutes to master and hardly tapping into Wii U's brimming reserve of versatile functionality; their unimaginative names basically discloses all you need to know. In \"Arrow\" you shoot arrows, in \"Bowling\" you bowl, in \"Design\" you draw, in \"Ski\" you ski, and in \"Shutter\" you take pictures, nothing more. Trudging through each is snooze-worthy from the outset, and it doesn't help that Game & Wario's sights and sounds exude an overwhelming air of flash-cartoon shabbiness.In the multiplayer department, the only red-letter enterprise is \"Fruit,\" an occasionally amusing whodunnit that has one player selecting a thief among a crowd of wandering citizens, periodically pulling off discreet apple swindlings, while the other players try to figure out who the culprit is. \"Disco\" is a dance game, but it lacks the finesse of the similarly-styled \"Pirates,\" \"Sketch\" is essentially a low-rent rip-off of Pictionary, and \"Islands\" is perhaps the laziest addition to the compendium, a half-assed take on the darts/marbles/horseshoes dynamic where players launch blockish Fronks at spinning scoreboards, knocking opponents off as they go in a lifeless contest that eventually boils down to who can stay interested the longest. Not much is worse in a modern minigame collection than the bane of instant redundancy emboldened by substandard visuals, and Game & Wario, unfortunately, sinks to that level in its primitive phases and seldom makes a forceful effort to systematically compensate for its laundry list of weaknesses.Basically, the game is boring, short & lacking content, and isn't worth your time - let alone your money.  I would barely classify this as a rental.  This could have easily been a digital download or free demo given out by Nintendo, and it's a shame they have packaged this as a $40 \"game.\"","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2013"}

Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Excellent RPG","reviewText":"In the late 21st Century, China and the United States fought a major war over resources in the Pacific Ocean. After the United States won a great victory in Alaska in 2077, it seemed as if the war might be over. Instead, it went nuclear and civilisation was destroyed. The majority of the human race was wiped out, save a few thousand survivors hidden in immense fall-out vaults, and others who somehow evaded the radiation and eked out an existence in the wastelands.The inhabitants of Vault 101 have lived a peaceful, if somewhat dull, existence sealed away from the outside world, under strict orders that the airlock to the outside world is never to be opened. However, one day nearly two centuries after the apocalypse, one man - your father - flees into the wilderness and you set out after him to find out where he's going, and why.Fallout 3 is the follow-up to the successful 1997 roleplaying game, Fallout, and its sequel of a year later. However, it has been developed by a completely different team and the action has been moved from the West Coast to the area immediately surrounding Washington, DC, whilst the timeline has been advanced by twenty years. A few minor references aside, there are no connections between this game and its predecessors, which is handy given that Fallout 3 had outsold the combined lifetime sales of the two earlier games within about 48 hours of going on sale.Fallout 3 is instead the creation of Bethesda, responsible for the mega-selling 2006 RPG Oblivion, and is based around the same engine. Although initially critically lauded, Oblivion soon became a target for scorn due to a somewhat dissatisfying combat system, a dull main quest and a rather silly levelling system that had the whole world levelling up with you (Fallout 3 does away with this, fortunately). However, many of the side-quests were ingenious and the depiction of a vast, beautiful but somewhat sparse (and given its proximity to the Imperial Capital, surprisingly dangerous) world was first-rate. Oddly enough, Fallout 3 plays to the weaknesses of Oblivion: a somewhat sparse world with a highly dangerous landscape makes far more sense in the context of a post-apocalyptic, vaguely Mad Max-esque world than that of a high fantasy setting. The combat system has been totally revamped and rebuilt into something truly impressive, and the more inventive and imaginative quest structure has been redeployed into the main narrative rather then the side-quests.The result is a much more fun and enjoyable game than Oblivion, although it starts in a similar manner. Fallout 3 replaces Oblivion's prison escape sequence with a set of scenes as your character is born, grows up, learns basic skills and finally decides to pursue your fleeing father into the wilderness. It is an effective way of introducing the world and some of the characters you'll meet later on in the story. Emerging blinking from Vault 101, the vast, blasted landscape of DC greets you with the battered but still-standing form of the Washington Monument towering in the distance, which is a tremendously atmospheric way of starting the game (and, as with the Citadel in Half-Life 2, eventually your path will lead you to that dominant feature on the horizon). Your path will quickly lead to the town of Megaton, where you can pick up quests, find out more about the world and, if you choose to help defuse the nuclear bomb still stuck in the middle of town, even set up a home and garner a reputation for honesty and honour. Conversely, you can choose to set the bomb to detonate, which earns you the gratitude of a local aristocrat and makes you infamous in the wasteland, with the radio stations pouring scorn on your activities and the noble Brotherhood of Steel gunning for you on sight.Fallout 3 is nicely focused in this regard, and draws you in to its world thanks to its memorable characters and the way your deeds are picked up on and reported, either on the radio stations or among the citizenry. The dialogue in the game is somewhat ropey, and they still haven't fixed the problem from Oblivion with the NPCs being rather stiff and robot-like in their movements, but there's definitely been some improvement. Best of all is the fact that there are now dozens of voices in the game rather than the four or five in Oblivion, which led to situations where two identical-sounding characters would be having a conversation in the street. There's also better use of the celebrity vocal talent, with Malcolm McDowell and Liam Neeson getting plenty of exposure (compared to Patrick Stewart and Sean Bean's rather brief roles in the earlier game). Ron Perlman also returns from the first two games for the opening and closing narration.Combat is probably Fallout 3's strongest point. Combat can be performed manually in a FPS-style system, but it's more satisfying to activate VATS mode, which pauses the game and allows you to target specific parts of an enemy's body, such as their head or, if you want to disarm them, their weapon or arm. Once you have queued up your attacks, they are carried out from a cinematic viewpoint in slow motion, which is often spectacular (and insanely gory: decapitation is bemusingly commonplace in Fallout 3's world). The system has its weaknesses - the fact you only take 10% damage whilst in VATS means your character is virtually invulnerable whilst it is activated and there is rarely, if any, reason not to shoot someone in the head - but by and large it is a welcome and effective innovation, and a far more satisfying solution to the FPS/RPG combat problems that have plague the genre for a while (with Mass Effect, for example, putting off hardcore RPGers due to its more action-oriented style of combat). I hope Bethesda include a suitable variation of it in their forthcoming Oblivion sequel.Character growth is also pretty satisfying, employing a system based on the earlier Fallout games but more streamlined. Oblivion's character growth system was completely counter-intuitive, but here everything is much more straightforward and it is easier to build the type of character you really want to be.There is a weakness in the game's structure, however. In Oblivion you could completely ignore the main quest if you wished, or get it out of the way (to close the annoying Oblivion Gates ASAP) and carry on with the side-quests. However, completing the main quest in Fallout 3 ends the game and you can't play on, which is annoying (and totally unnecessary: the main quest's ending doesn't actually make much logical sense). The main quest in Fallout 3 is also surprisingly short, perhaps 6-8 hours if you ignored everything else. For this reason, I heavily recommend interspersing the main quest missions in the game with the optional side-quests and also just random exploring. The total number of quests in the game is fairly low (certainly far lower than Oblivion's), so randomly wandering the wastes searching for new locations to explore does play a larger role in the game, as does the search for really good gear. A further problem with this is that the game is capped at Level 20, which isn't that hard to attain, so such random wanderings may be rather short-lived once the reward for them dries up. There's also a rather severe limit on what you can carry, again limiting the prospects for lengthy exploration.Fallout 3 is an excellent RPG, building on the many strengths of Oblivion and coming up with satisfying solutions to its problems. Wandering the burned-out ruins of one of DC's suburbs, or trying to sneak into the Capitol Building, can be extremely atmospheric and the depiction of a ruined, blasted landscape is second to none. The game employs some terrific influences within its mission design as well, with the movies Them!, Blade Runner, Pleasentville and Battle Royale all being directly referenced or parodied in the game. Character building and combat are both highly satisfying, although some issues with dialogue remain. There's also probably a bit too much mucking around in DC's subway system in the first half of the game as well which can get a bit old.Fallout 3 (****) is available now on the PC (UK, USA), X-Box 360 (UK, USA) and Playstation 3 (UK, USA). Downloadable missions will start appearing in January, allowing players to visit Alaska, the Pitt and follow up on the main quest as a member of the Brotherhood of Steel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2008"}

I'm still fascinated at every ray of light that comes down through the forests and trees.  Truely a marvel in gameplay.Sound is also another home run with a surround sound setup.  The sound will suck you in to the realm of the game and bring you that much closer to the ever blurring fine line of reality and dreamland.Fighting.  Well, lets put it this way.  If you are after a hack and slasher hero, then the game is set up pretty good for you.  Just hit the X button multiple times to increase your attack multiplier and then hit the B button for a flourish kill.  However, if you want to cast a spell somewhere in there, then things get a little interesting. It can be very difficult to keep an eye whats going on the screen while scrolling through your spells to figure out what you want to cast.Controller config is where the game has it's downfall.  The problem is that there is too much customization you can have going on.  Unlike many games, EVERY single button, trigger, joystic and pad is used during combat.  This becomes an absolute nightmare when you start to get attacked by more than 5 creatures at any given time.  What's even worse is trying to prioritize your victim in the melee is virtually impossible.  A very typical combat scenario turns into the floundering of the controller as you try to remember to hold in the right trigger and hit Y to scroll to the right spell setup.  All the while you are getting slashed.  So you want your spell to get the guy in the back of the crowd that is shooting at you?  Keep that right trigger in, now hold in the left trigger and continue to click to target different enemies; again, all the while getting slashed.  This doesn't even take into consideration trying to keep you health up and Will by using the D-pad somewhere in that battle.Don't get me wrong, the game is a definite purchase.  However, the developers have created so much here that it is overwhelming when it comes to the combat.But hey, I still can't put it down.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"All flash and barley any substance..","reviewText":"Gears of War pits you as Marcus Fenix - a soldier who was sentenced to jail time for deserting his position in order to save his father during a time of crisis - as he and the Delta Team attempt to find Alpha Team, their \"secret weapon\" that will apparently win the war, and take down an invading army of freaks known as the Locust.Its your basic third person shooter here meaning you get a bunch of weapons such as 2 types of machine guns, a shotgun, rocket launcher, etc. You can dive any direction you want, go toe-to-toe with the Locust in melee combat (in fact on the human machine gun there is a chainsaw that you can saw your enemies in half with), throw grenades, and so fourth. You'll be pressing buttons, kicking doors open, and commanding your team just like in Brute Force for the X-Box. Also, if you blow out your enemies legs then you can stomp on their head and watch it explode under your boot.... very fun.However, G.o.W relies HEAVILY on what games like kill.switch & Winback have done in the past: taking cover behind any object, popping off a few rounds at the Locust, and hiding behind your cover as the enemy returns fire. You'll be doing this throughout the entire game, and although it is fun its just like what happened with the previously mentioned titles - it gets repetitive.The Locust are an interesting bunch of freaks character design wise. There are these big guys named Boomers who have rocket launchers, there are these things called Wretches that run on their hands and feet, the basic grunt of the army called Grubs, and so on. They are well created and definitley worth checking out.What makes this game really shine, to me at least, is it's online play. You and a friend (or random person that may join) can play the entire campaign co-operatively which was definitely a good thing to include. There is also your typical online versus games like deathmatch, team deathmatch, and a game of \"kill the leader\" where if the leader of either the Gears or Locust dies then the opposing team earns a point. In the versus mode you can also choose your character such as Marcus, Baird, Cole, and Dom as well as some of the Locust characters. However the death match portion's fun is obliterated by EXTREMELY weak weapons, the levels are lame & predictable, and when you die you have to press A numerous times so you don't bleed out... thats so lame and its not even worth the aggravation,If your interested in those X-Box 360 achievement things then you'll be happy to know there are quite a list of things you can earn although alot of them are earned simply by playing the campaign.Moving forward with this review, the graphics are breathtaking. The enviroments are massive and extremley detailed with an authentic and realistic feel, though decently linear. It truley shows what the 360 can handle and is easily one of (if not the) best looking games ever created. What bothers me about the graphics is how massivley big & bulky each character looks and how there isn't a big variety of colors used (its mainly like black, grey, yellow and white). They are so ridiculous looking that its hard to connect with anyone on Delta, or really anyone for that matter.On the subject of big and bulky, your guys are so huge that lets say you wanna crouch behind a somewhat small boulder, you are most likley going to get hit because a piece of you will be sticking out. You get what I'm saying? And they literally THROW themselves against cover..its amusing.The music is alright, and the voice acting is pretty good but the sound effects are kind of cruddy. The freaks sound terrifying with their native tongue while the Delta squad have this rough-n-tough voices with some funny dialog thrown in for good measure. The guns are very weak and sound it too which is really a shame. The explosions, however, sound very satisfying and real.Sadly, you'll probably have Gears of War beat within maybe 5-6 hours and the ending isn't even worth it: Marcus & Dom kill General Ramm, Marcus sets off the Lightmass Bomb and hops onto a helicopter with Dom and the rest of the squad, Lightmass Bomb blows up Locust base. Thats it, and thats lame.To sum it up though, even though this game has been in development for like 2 years and delivers excellent graphics this game isn't worth $60. Quite possibly the easiest game to say \"rent it first\" to.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0050SZE2G","description":"","reviewerName":"Scott Peterson \"I.T. Sme\"","summary":"Better than \"Farcry2,\" the question is how much","reviewText":"I was a little disappointed that the original \"Farcry\" wasn't reprised in this one, and doesn't look like it ever will be.  Yes, that game was very stereotypical with it's sci-fi setting, sarcastic ex-military hero, a heroine nearly as tough as him, and a scientist helper, but the game was aware of that and played it up.  Farcry was fun, and was probably the first game to successfully create a jungle environment that worked.Farcry2 had in common only the name, being set in Africa among warring factions.  Mostly to anyone who played it the game seemed more like \"Grand Theft Auto: Africa\" and was a lot of driving to get anywhere.This one combines the two; from Farcry we have again a jungle environment with Japanese ruins from World War Two, even older ancient ruins (this time Chinese), hang gliders that do more than short hops, and boats.From Farcry2 we have the driving environment, radio towers, and a gradual buildup of skills and equipment.  At the 3/4 mark the game shifts to a smaller island with more advanced weapons and challenges. We also have competing factions again, this time the native Rakyat, pirates, and privateers, who are all color coded by blue, red, and yellow.New to the series is crafting medicines from plants and using animal skins to make carrying pouches and satchels.  You also use an arrow--but it never has a point where you have to completely use hand weapons aside from some dedicated hunting quests. Having a segment of the game where you had to entirely improvise weaponry would have been appealing.Changeups from Farcry2 is the radio towers are used to open up parts of the map, and a big improvement is each liberated fort can be used for instant \"rapid\" travel which is good, as the game is huge.Neither here nor there is the repetitiveness.  You have 18 towers and 34 forts.  Each tower has a supply drop mission and each fort has a couple of hunter/kill someone quests.  Unlike Farcry2 where, for example, the delivering medicine quest was always exactly the same thing each one of these is different, even the radio towers are a puzzle to climb them.  Still, there's only so many ways to take over a fort.The campaign--well, in Farcry Jack Carver was a jerk but he was a fun jerk.  Jason Brody is a dorky kid.  The game at times seems to edge into a psychological down the rabbit hole journey but never goes through.  I sorely missed the humor of the original Farcry, although \"Sam\" added some needed comic relief.  Still, in the end we had no sci-fi backdrop, just mercenary fighting, and no real development--that the character has really done much more than learn to fight real good.  All the psychological/spiritual elements just go \"poof\" and you have two choices at the end, the \"win\" choice that almost everyone will take and a \"lose\" choice.Overall just to do the campaign would probably be about 9 hours, to fully upgrade and liberate the islands about 16 hours, to complete all the quests who knows.  You get your money's worth, it's an enormous game with lots of challenges, but still feels disappointing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2012"}

With the help of Murfy, Rayman and Globox awake and must now help fight these nightmares and save the Teensies!","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"It's the game that keeps on giving - Lots of Lums and laughs!","reviewText":"+ PROS:+ Colorful levels jam packed with platforming gameplay and humor+ Hilarious fun for one or more players+ Unlockable levels, heroes, creatures and challenges- CONS:- Some levels/gameplay can be frustrating for younger gamersPLOT:Rayman (our cute little hero with no arms, legs or neck!) has been asleep for 100 years, along with his friend Globox and the Teensies. While they were sleeping, the Bubble Dreamer's nightmares got more powerful, and so did the magician (from Rayman Origins). Rayman and friends are woken up by Murfy who tells them about the Teensies and the 10 princesses getting captured by the nightmares and the 5 dark Teensies.  From here, Rayman and friends set out to defeat their foes and rescue their friends.GAMEPLAY:Rayman Legends combines elements of platform gaming and \"endless running\" platform gaming. Rayman can jump, use his ears as a helicopter to slow his falls, wind up and deliver a big punch/kick to his enemies, and even throw fireballs on some levels. There are several checkpoints within each level, so if you perish before reaching the end, you keep all the Lums and Teensies you collected...a sigh of relief to all the old-school platforming gamers.The goal of each level is for Rayman to rescue as many Teensies as possible, while also collecting Lums. Some of the Teensies are in plain sight, but you'll have to search around to find them all. At the end of each level, you receive a reward based on how many Lums you collected, and how many Teensies you saved. You can also earn scratch tickets, which give you a random reward such as 1000 extra Lums, a Teensie, a creature for your collection, or new Rayman Origins levels.The levels are either standard platforms, where you have to search around for the King and Queen Teensies and their 8 children, or there are shorter levels where you only have to gather 3 Teensies. Some of the levels allow you to take a relaxed pace, while others have a creeping wall of fire or rapidly sinking quicksand which require you to run as fast as you can to reach your goal. You'll also have Murfy show up from time to time to lend a hand with cutting ropes, moving objects, and even tickling enemies!Eventually you can unlock \"Invaded\" levels, where you have to rescue 3 Teensies as fast as you can, trying to reach the goal in under 40 seconds.There's a growing trend in Ubisoft games to have daily/weekly goal rewards for playing their games. We saw this in Splinter Cell: Blacklist (a decidedly different game), and it's also present in Rayman Legends. You can participate in daily and weekly game challenges. Instead of earning money to purchase weapon upgrades, we earn Lums to unlock new levels, new heroes, new creatures, and more.It's a fun little dynamic that keeps me playing each day to get my daily reward of Lums...after all, the last hero costs 1 million Lums to unlock, and every little bit helps!My descriptions may sound a little daunting, but I feel anyone who picks up a controller will fall in love with this quirky little character. Old school platform gamers (like me) and new school gamers will find challenges throughout each level.TROPHIES:It's an interesting mix of trophies for Rayman. If you just want to finish the game and defeat each boss, you'll end up earning about 15 to 20 trophies. However, there are roughly 30 more trophies to earn which will push your gaming skills to the limit. There's a trophy for collecting all 700 Teensies, collecting 1 million Lums, unlocking all 10 princesses, earning all the bronze/silver/gold cups, and even a few that require defeating your friends in some online challenges.PROS:I love the vibrancy of each and every single level in this game. Even if I'm getting killed by monsters, I find myself saying \"Aww, they're so darn CUTE!\" As soon as I picked one level to become my favorite, it wasn't long before another one took its place. I found myself laughing out loud at the pop culture references in Rayman Legends, such as:- The \"goodbye\" scene from Terminator 2- The \"laser field dance\" from Ocean's 12In all honesty, every boss level was hilarious. Each one is set to a musical number. If you know the song, it'll be that much simpler. From a castle onslaught to the tune of \"Black Betty\", to a Mariachi version of \"Eye of the Tiger\", to an underwater excursion to the tunes of \"Woo-Hoo\", I found myself dropping the controller during these levels because I was laughing so hard!My child loved going through the levels in two-player mode because if one of us screwed up, the other one just had to \"pop the bubble\" and we'd be back in the game. It really showed the benefits of teamwork.Collectibles? There are SO MANY in this game. Teensies, Lums, Scratch Tickets, Heroes, levels of Rayman Origins, Creatures...everything I find seems to unlock something else. It's the game that keeps on giving!CONS:I'll preface my \"con\" by saying this: Rayman Legends does a fantastic job introducing players to the gameplay. It's relatively simple to learn how to make Rayman jump and use his helicopter ears, and any good platform game requires its players to be able to judge distance and speed. You'll spend most of the game getting used to this, and might be lulled into a sense of the game being too easy.With that being said...By the time you reach the Olympus Maximus levels, you'll be hit with a few frustrating old-school platforming tricks, such as the infamous \"Up is down, right is left\" sections. You'll have to navigate screens with flipped screens, which are mercifully short, but take a while to navigate.The really fun/frustrating ones are the bonus \"Living Dead Party\" levels. These are the previous boss levels with the music converted to an 8-bit format, and so is the gameplay. This means the screen will fade in and out, pixilation will swell and shrink, and there are no checkpoints...you have to do the entire level in one perfect run.Old school gamers are used to \"flawless run\" requirements, but younger gamers might get frustrated after playing through most of the previous levels with checkpoints.WHAT WOULD I HAVE IMPROVED?The designers did such a great job with this game, I can't think of anything else I would have added. It's all here: personal accomplishments in single-player mode, help from family & friends with 1-4 player mode, online challenges, world rankings, it's all designed to strengthen our bond with Rayman, and I wouldn't change a thing.FINAL VERDICT:There's so much to enjoy here. Saving Teensies is especially fun, and the Lums accumulate as you get better and better and unlock more levels to explore and more heroes to battle evil with. There's a certain kind of joy that comes with hearing all the saved Teensies talking and laughing as you pass them by.I would definitely recommend this game for old school platform fans of games like Super Mario Bros. or Sonic the Hedgehog, and I also feel it's a great way to introduce younger gamers to the platform genre. Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001ASJISG","reviewerName":"Annihilatrix1138","summary":"Beautifully Annoying","reviewText":"The revamped PRINCE OF PERSIA series of the last console generation were among some of the best games of the time, especially SANDS OF TIME. It looked as though UbiSoft was ready to attempt the same feat with this generation (though this was a couple years ago), but the end result is a game that boasts some of the most gorgeous visuals in any title, and also succeeds in creating some of the most un-fun gameplay mechanics imaginable.The story is fairly basic: the Prince and a princess named Elika are tasked with the unfortunate job of imprisoning a dark god. That's about it. Not much of a head-scratcher. And as the Prince, you will be forced to jump, glide, slide, and spin across this \"open world\" to cleanse the royal city of shadows, not unlike Mario in SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE.It sounds basic because it is. Not to say it's not challenging at times, but everything about this game is simple. You cannot die, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think games are slowly moving away from life-based dramatics anyway. No matter what happens, your partner will be able to save you and take you back to the last bit of level ground you were standing on. Sometimes, this means undoing a lot of footwork, which can get annoying really quick.And \"annoying\" is the word of the day when it comes to this game. UbiSoft have pulled off the trick of creating a world that just reeks of beauty, and have managed to make you feel so disconnected from it. This entire \"open world\" is not so dissimilar to something like SUPER MARIO GALAXY (it's really easy to compare this game to Mario's antics), because the world feels like it was built entirely for acrobatics and doesn't really make much sense in terms of realism. You will have to free-run to get EVERYWHERE, and you will quickly grow tired of a mechanic that's very fun when you first start out.I was dreading free-running to the next area within the first hour of playing.And speaking of this \"open world\" itself: it is very beautiful, but, at the same time, it feels utterly dead. It's just you, the princess, and the two or three enemies you'll likely find along the way. That's right, UbiSoft has put so much emphasis on this free-running thing that they don't even want enemies to slow you down. You will be very lucky if you see even one other enemy besides the boss in each level. Just imagine the first ASSASSIN'S CREED with better visuals, no sidequests, and no enemies to fight and you'll have a good idea of how PRINCE OF PERSIA plays.I almost stopped playing the game not too long after I started, but there were a few saving graces that kept me going. For one: the visuals are beautiful, if I haven't said that enough. Secondly: though there are only two characters, yourself included, the Prince and Elika are very well-written. It seems almost a crime that UbiSoft would write such amazing characters and make it so that all of their dialogue together - their fights, their laughs, and their eventual flirting - is completely optional. You could go the entire game and not see them interact outside of the cutscenes.And thirdly: if you keep playing the game, you'll likely discover that if you think of it like an old school platformer, you'll like it a whole lot more. I stopped trying to find a good world to explore, a story, and people to fight, and eventually I just stopped caring and just took it for what it was: a 3D version of the original PoP. And that's fine! But I hope that UbiSoft decides to take a different route with the eventual sequel.But that seems to be UbiSoft's strength of late. They've managed to turn out some very good sequels recently that blew their predecessors out of the water, with ASSASSIN'S CREED II being a good example. I hope with PRINCE OF PERSIA 2, they do the same. Make the game more challenging. Make the world more interactive, and a place I'd actually want to explore. And don't be shy with the story next time around, put the characters at the forefront; the Persian Man-With-No-Name and the princess, Elika, really were all that saved PRINCE OF PERSIA from becoming a visually beautiful disaster of a game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00DC7G0GG","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A wonderfully designed game that has something special for every kind of Mario fan","reviewText":"Color me surprised. I thought there was no way Nintendo could possibly match theSuper Mario Galaxygames in terms of quality and creativity, and yet, somehow, they have with this gem. Super Mario 3D World has taken the stellar core premise ofSuper Mario 3D Land(it itself a fantastic Mario game and one of the best 3DS games) and launched it into the stratosphere with exceptional execution, staggering density of content, and breathtaking creativity. It's amazing to me how a game that is, at its core, centered around the simple joys of running, jumping, exploring, and playing, can be so full of brilliance and inspiration. If it's not already obvious, my wife and I both absolutely love this masterpiece. This is a *huge* game full of ideas and concepts both new and nostalgic, and while I will try to keep spoilers to a minimum, this will be a long, detailed review. It's the only way to do such a wonderful game justice. Either jump ship now or continue reading, you've been warned.The story in Super Mario 3D World is as simple as it is in any Mario game, but 3D World's story is noteworthy simply because Peach's kidnapping is not the plot device used to introduce the exquisite gameplay (it also shows Mario and Luigi actually fixing something as plumbers, something I cannot recall a main series Mario game showing before, so that's special :D).While going for an evening stroll, Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Blue Toad stumble across a clear pipe, out of which pops a unique pixie-like princess from the Sprixie kingdom. She then informs them that Bowser has attacked and taken over her kingdom and requests help when, all of a sudden, Bowser pops out of the pipe, kidnaps this new princess, and absconds back into the recently conquered Sprixie Kingdom. Our four heroes give chase into the pipe to help their new friend, like any good Samaritans would do, thus beginning 3D World's platforming euphoria. Interspersed throughout the adventure are very simple cutscenes that are enjoyable and appealing.The visuals in 3D World are exceptional. This is the first Mario outing in genuinely glorious HD, all at a smooth 60 fps, and it is beyond gorgeous. I've always loved the art design in Mario games. The focus on clean, imaginative style and vibrant color has always made Mario games stand out as some of the most beautiful releases on their platform, and 3D World is no exception. Impressive lighting effects and exceptionally well done textures make levels like Bowser's oceanside castle during a sunset, or sunny grasslands, or snowy wonderlands such beautiful, enchanting playgrounds to run and jump through. Character designs, whether friend or foe, are all very nostalgic and the new ones feel very fresh at the same time. Seeing classic enemies like Chargin Chuck from SMWorld is so nostalgic. The audio is equally charming, with many iconic sound effects returning. The real audio highlight, however, is the soundtrack. Anybody worried that this game would drop the beautiful orchestrations of the Galaxy games can rest easy. Whether the tracks are reminiscent of the symphonic majesty of the Galaxy soundtracks or more of the jazzy 3D Land variety, all songs in 3D World are super catchy and full of warm nostalgic magic, as befits a Mario game (even brand new songs immediately cultivated nostalgia in me). You'll be humming the tunes long after you turn off the game. From a visual and audio perspective, this game is a definite winner and a showcase for the Wii-U.I've always loved the core concept behind Super Mario 3D Land/World: Take nostalgic gameplay concepts and goals from the classicSuper Mario Bros. 1-3andSuper Mario World, and play through them from Mario's perspective in a 3-D game with all the refinements and conventions 3-D Mario games have introduced over the years. It's a perfect marriage of classic conventions and creative innovation, made so that fans of every style of Mario can enjoy themselves. For example, each level has you going for the end-pole as your goal, just like the 2-D Mario classics. However, each level features three green stars (first seen inGalaxy 2) that encourages 3-D Mario style exploration of the levels in order to collect them, and the levels are so well designed and massive, you'll enjoy every second you spend exploring them. It's a marriage of two different Mario styles that compliment each other very well and offer something to every Mario fan. That's great. The world map may seem to be styled after theNew Super Mario Bros.games at first glance, except that you're given free rein to run all over the whole thing like some sort of 3-D playground overworld, another example of 3-D and 2-D Mario combining into something new and special, appealing to everybody.The controls in this game have been refined to near perfection, to the point that characters on the screen feel like an extension of yourself. Like everything else in the game, they feel like a perfect marriage between classic and modern Mario styles. Like the classic 2-D Mario games, you can't double or triple jump, which is jarring at first but ultimately makes for unique, old-school gameplay that feels new for a 3-D Mario game. Using just the control stick has you move in a leisurely stroll pace. Holding down X/Y makes you run and if you keep running uninterrupted, the character breaks out into a fast sprint. The rolling spin and rolling long-jump (returning from 3D Land) are wonderful additions to Mario's acrobatic repertoire. Jumping and stomping on enemies has never felt more satisfying. What's awesome about all of this is that you get to choose between several equally well-designed characters to play as, and all offer unique abilities and traits. Mario is an all-around balanced character, Luigi's controls are more \"slippery\" and he jumps higher, Peach runs slower but can hover like in SMB2 which makes her good for beginners, and Blue Toad runs faster than the others but he drops faster after jumps. That's not all, as there is an unlockable character with their own unique abilities and gameplay style too! This is such a great aspect of 3D World. Having so many unique characters practically guarantees that gamers of any skill level or play style will get the most out of their experience with the game, and that's awesome. Bravo Nintendo! On the new side of things, you can knock shells off of Koopas and, in addition to throwing them as always, you can go inside and ride them as they slide along the floor. Talk about a blast! The new clear pipes introduce a ton of new gameplay possibilities that require good reflexes and strategy. So many new gameplay concepts, and all are super fun.The suits that return from 3D Land (Tanooki, Fire, Boomerang Bros., propeller box, etc) all play extremely well and are super satisfying to use. New suits/items, such as the already-iconic Cat Suit or the new canon box fit in with the rest very well. The Cat Suit is ridiculously fun. Others are bizarrely appealing, like the double cherry, which creates a new clone of your character each time you grab one. Imagine the hilarious chaos that results from 10-12 fire balls bouncing around hurled from 5-6 Marios with fire suits. Boss fights that incorporate the double cherry are super fun too. There are many new items you can grab and carry along with you, like a baseball to throw at enemies, or potted Piranha plants that can rapidly eat enemies and other obstacles. Of course, these are just a few examples, and the game features many more.The utterly brilliant level designs compliment the gameplay mechanics beautifully. There are so many new level ideas for a 3-D Mario game too, including but not limited to: riding a Loch Ness Yoshi monster named \"Plessie\" through a tropical paradise, a level exploring a Japanese-style castle, a light/shadow/silhouette themed sewer level that really messes with your perception of size and distance, a level based on the classic Super Mario Kart (complete with overwhelmingly nostalgic music), the Captain Toad puzzle levels, the mystery houses, the speed run levels, a golden express segment that makesNew Super Mario Bros. 2look conservative by comparison... I could go on forever. Although a bit on the easy side, boss fights in the game overall are better than they were in 3D Land, full of variety and new ideas, although I still prefer the Bowser fights from 3D Land (3D Land's Bowser battles are among my favorite in the entire series). Seriously, this game is bursting with creativity. New concepts are introduced at a breathtaking speed. Much like Galaxy 1 & 2, Super Mario 3D World feels like standing before a seemingly bottomless well of brilliant new ideas. If it doesn't top Galaxy 1 or 2 in that respect, 3D World at least matches them. That alone is impressive, especially since the overall focus of 3D World is more \"conventional\" in comparison to the mind-bending Galaxy games. The fact that it is easily as big as the first Galaxy game makes this even more amazing. Once you beat the main worlds, several more pop up, and the farther you get into the game, the more challenge there is to be had. This game has a fantastic density of content.Another aspect that makes Super Mario 3D World a milestone for the series is its excellent multiplayer. This is the first 3-D Mario game to implement multiplayer and it is incredible! I was worried this would have the lazy multiplayer of the NSMB games where all characters play the same and offer no real variety, but thankfully 3D World delivers the goods. Each player gets to control a unique character (no generic, recolored Toads for player 4, thankfully), and as I said earlier, each character controls uniquely as well, so everyone will have their own experience! It also never become frustrating like it does in the NSMB games, where other players too often become obstacles to your enjoyment rather than enhancing it. In 3D World, it's super fun and really hearkens back to the old days where playing video games with friends and loved ones on the couch was a bonding, joyful experience. Any game that my wife and I bond over always gets bonus points in my book, and 3D World is superb in that regard. The game is so well designed that you will get the most out of your time with the game, regardless of whether you're playing alone or with others. That's awesome. Bravo Nintendo!You might wonder how 3DW functions as a Wii-U exclusive and what features there are. Well, for starters, the touch screen and mic are used in several, unique ways that affect the levels you play through, adding complexity to the mix. The gyroscope can be used to get different angles in the levels, which is really helpful for finding collectibles. There are so many other things you can do using the gamepad, it's easy to lose count. Personally, I find the gamepad a lot more useful with more complex series, likeThe Legend of Zeldafor example, but it works surprisingly well in 3D World. Miiverse is also utilized in the same fun way it was in NSMBU, but has been deepened with collectible stamps hidden in the levels that adds spice to messages. I like the Miiverse system here, it's a nice novelty at the very least. Overall, the Wii-U exclusive features don't feel like gimmicks, thankfully, and the game works well because of them and not in spite of them, which is all I ask for.So, to all you who stuck around with this review, I really cannot emphasize it enough: this game is an absolute masterpiece. I really can't think of a single flaw or complaint to say about the game. Nintendo EAD has been on a roll for years with 3-D Mario releases, and with each new game, I always doubt and worry that they can't possibly top the game that came before it. With Super Mario 3D World, they have indeed continued their streak of top-tier quality. It may not have the brilliant gravity defying concept of the Galaxy games, but the sheer amount of creativity and innovation they poured into this game despite it being more \"conventional\" in its style just astounds me even more. The huge addition of well-executed multiplayer makes this a 3-D Mario milestone in yet another way. I bought this game at my local *cough cough* as soon as it opened and have been playing since then (alternating with The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, another masterpiece). In addition to its awesome creativity, this is one of the most celebratory Mario games I've ever played too, filled with salutes and homages that pretty much every Mario fan can appreciate and enjoy to the fullest. So do I recommend it? Oh yeah, you better believe I do. This is the undisputed Wii-U \"killer app\" and is an absolutely essential game for any Wii-U library. I'd even say the game is worth buying the system over. Seriously, it is such a masterwork in game design. Buy it immediately, enjoy the game either solo or with others, and experience another magical masterpiece with Nintendo's famous plumber hero.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

My problem was with the seemingly constant on screen prompts that come up right in the middle of the action; I also found some of the 'command' buttons to be a chore when you were under heavy fire.  I suppose you could eventually master them, but someone just picking the game up to play would have some difficulties. My major problem w/this game is that it's not always user friendly.  Perhaps a control scheme similar to the Tom Clancy games in terms of dealing w/your 'better half' would have been more suiting. Don't dumb it down, but make it a little more logical.  Very good graphics and controls well overall, but commanding your 'computer partner' can be a pain.

I enjoyed beating it, but the game had it's flaws. I picked Diablo II up a couple of months ago, because I finally found the Battlechest for a price I felt I could pay. I wish I wouldn't have been so cheap. This game is awesome. It blows the first one away and they hard to even compare.Diablo II is kind of like an RPG. You don't fight in the normal RPG way, but your goal is to complete missions and work your character up to a high enough level so you can slay the Dark Lord. In the original game there were only three character classes to chose from. That has changed in this one. You can now select from an Amazon, Necromancer, Sorceress, Paladin, Barbarian, and with the Expansion Set a Druid and Assasin.All the characters have special abilites that none of the others do. The abilities hold true to the idea behind the character. They had a new fun element to the game play. Magic is done a lot more realistic in this game than it was in the first one.The gameplay is pretty fun. I've beat Diablo, but haven't finished beating the Expansion set. I'm almost to Baal and I'm loving every second of it. Some of the quests I found to be quite fun. The guys did a good job writing the storyline. Some of them did get a little old and I was very happy once I completed them.The real thing that makes this game shine though is Battle.Net. You have to give Blizzard there props. Battle.Net should be prescribed with a warning label. Every Blizzard game I've ever owned has always been better on Battle.Net fighting with other people and this one holds true to that. It isn't as fun as Starcraft on the Net, but it's not to far from it.This game is addictive. You will lose all sense of time and place when you play it. You will want to beat it. You will want to beat it again. So don't be a cheap skate like I was and go pick this one up. You won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2004"}

Several years have passed since Kyle avenged his father's death and saved the Valley of the Jedi from Jerec and his band of Dark Jedi.

The game flattened the competition with its near total immersion in the Star Wars environment that had been sorely lacking, even in the original Dark Forces in 1995. For twenty levels you became Kyle, the quirky smart-mouthed mercenary aiding the fledgling New Republic on a mission against Jerec and his cabal of Dark Jedi bent on locating and consuming the power of the Valley of the Jedi. A thousand years ago a great battle between the forces of light and dark saw thousands of Jedi spirits trapped within the valley. As Kyle you progressed in your powers until eventually having to make a choice between Light and Dark. To stop Jerec in order to keep the valley safe or take the power for your own and rule the galaxy.Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast is set nine years after Jedi Knight, making it 14 years after the fall of the Empire at Endor, and Kyle has abandoned his Jedi heritage after nearly killing Mara Jade at the Sith temple on Dromund Kaas when he fell to the Dark Side. Still working for New Republic Intelligence, he and Jan stumble across an Imperial Remnant base that appears to be growing gem-like crystals- similar to the ones found in lightsabers. It turns out that a fallen Jedi and the Remnant are attempting create a Force-using army by combining the crystals and the Force. The first couple of levels are also painfully dull and the goals are often poorly defined. After encountering the fallen Jedi Desann, Jan is murdered by Desann's apprentice, Tavion. Secretly, Kyle flies to Rusaan- the secret location of the Valley of the Jedi. There is reasserts his connection to the Force. Reluctantly Kyle must reclaim that which he abandoned, traveling back to Yavin IV, he meets with Luke Skywalker in order to retrieve his lightsaber. At the Yavin academy, Kyle relearns his basic Force abilities in a test devised by Luke before traveling to Nar Shadda to begin his search Desann and the Reborn.Game play is much improved over Jedi Knight in many areas, not least of which is lightsaber combat, which is now handled almost exclusively in the third-person view. I had misgivings about this, but having tried it out, I see that it's much better- allowing for greater control and freedom of action during duels. Graphics are not through the roof 'awesome', but very clean and exceptionally well detailed. I have a ATI Radeon 9700 Pro video card, so I guess I expect all new games to be earth-shattering in their visual appeal. Raven did pay close attention to lightsaber duels from the Phantom Menace- giving the ones in the game a distinct cinematic feel, especially when view from a distance in multi-player. Mostly the game is fluid- the visuals flow nicely and Raven manages to overcome one of the Quake III: Arena engine's short comings by producing attractive vistas, whether indoors or out, everything has the right Star Wars-zy feel and look to it.Weapons range from Kyle's Bryar pistol, E-11 blaster rifle, Bowcaster and Repeater Rifle, plus new additions like the Tenloss disrupter, which can disintegrate distant targets in sniper mode, an EMP gun for dispatching droids and other electronic devices, a flechette cannon which is just a knock-off of the flack cannon from Unreal Tournament, plus a rocket launcher. Kyle also has access to munitions like thermal detonators, laser trip mines (a la Duke Nukem), and detpacks that can be blown by remote control. All three explosives and the rocket launcher do far more damage than their small, wimpy explosions would indicate. An additional weapon that Kyle carries that I really liked are the portable sentry gun- a cannister that once dropped deploys a blaster turret and begins shooting enemies within its range. Players also get macrobinoculars, bacta canisters for healing, and light amplification goggles. Plus you will find no end of shield and health power-ups through out the levels. One of the game's down sides is that it is difficult to tell when you're being shot- there are no accompanying green flashes or sizzling sound effects as your personal shields take a beatingThe game ships with 10 multi-player maps, customizable Force powers to fine-tune your character. You can even play games without the Force, though it tends to favor the dark side powers. Multi-player games include standard death matches, capture the flag, king of the hill where only one play has a lightsaber and Force powers and it's up to everyone else to deal with it, capture the ysalamiri (the Jedi Kryptonite creatures care of Mr. Zahn). One of the down sides in single-player missions is Raven split Kyle's Force powers between the Light and Dark side. He can throw lightning and choke someone, but no longer has Force Seeing and Protection- two powers that were, in my opinion, instrumental in the first game. I didn't like the addition of Dark Side powers that seemed to be there just to satisfy those players who think the Dark Side is 'kewl'. Raven also has the Outcast version of its Q3 Radiant level builder and other tools, like script managers etc. for creating single and multi-player levels.This is an o-kay game. It didn't completely suck me in like Jedi Knight did, but it is a worthy successor. It lacks the impact of Kyle's momentous decision between Light and Dark nor is the story as epic. And strangely, the feel is closer to that of the original Dark Forces than it is to Jedi Knight. Plus it suffers a little too much from console hell like Dino Crisis, where on some levels you must find the key to open the door in order to get to the next key to open the next door. It has some nice animated full-motion video, but nothing like the live action scenes that added so much to Jedi Knight. It is also a hard game- get used to not completing later maps on the first try even on easy 'Padawan' setting, plus some of the jumping can be a little frustrating. I waited a long time for this game and I'm glad I wasn't completely disappointed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2003"}

I'll start with the things this game gets correct.  Rubi is cool; quick-witted, agile, talented and extremely agitated.  This frustration leads to ruthlesssness; i.e. everybody dies.  There's one mode when Rubi gets upset and is by far the most fun to be had in the game.  The screen goes red, black and white and the enraged Rubi can make quick work of her foes.  There's also a few fun sequences such as jumping car to car in traffic (like the Matrix) and falling out of a plane and those are very well executed.  She moves fairly fluently and the slow motion shooting aspect is both fun and highly functional.  Simply put, it's fun to play as Rubi.....in spurts.This game is only good in spurts mostly because the story is flat out terrible.  The story is so convoluted, confusing and incoherent that it doesn't drive the story forward.  The only motivation to move forward is to finish the game.  The villains are forgettable, the side characters are more annoying than interesting and no character is developed...not even Rubi.  There's no back story on her as she's pretty much an assassin that lives in the desert.  Her personality nor motivation changes at all throughout the course of the game.  We are thrust right into a shooting arena and the game goes along in that manner for the entire duration.  Rubi doesn't have to learn any of the skills that carry throughout the game.  So pretty much from the jump...you're a bad a$$ and only you can stop yourself.  Rubi Malone seems like a character that can be developed a lot better than presente and some more formidable opponents should have been created.  I mean really....a guy with a gatling is your biggest competition????The graphics are below standard.  I'm reading that that is the overall style of this type of art style but still the graphics leave much to be desired.  The fire and water look absolutely terrible (especially after playing games like Assassins Creed, Uncharted, Enslaved, Heavenly Sword etc.)  THe buildings are murky and difficult to look at and distinguish from one another, the characters are blocky...and overall the game just looks bad.  Even the cutscenes look bad. It looks like a PS2 game.The level design is also very weak and the platforming is horrible and probably should have been left out.  The camera fails to swing around so often times you are just jumping on a prayer.  Simply put it isn't fun climbing along walls, jumping from pillar to pillar etc like it is in other games.  It's more like when is this going to be over so I can shoot some people type of experience.  The arena sequences are fun but sometimes, no a lot of times, it's tough to determine how to get to some of the bonuses and swings.  It's also tough to determine where and how many \"doors\" there are to close to complete.  That part was hit or miss....some arenas were a blast while others were just a chore.  And some of the enemies could take 5 minutes of gatling gun to the chest and not die...I felt that was strange....but nothing too deterring.Overall, the game is fun but is only worth one playthrough in my opinion.  I'd give the game a 2.5/5.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2011"}

I am not a fan of the 1st person shooters and have been looking forward to it for a while.I got the game about five days ago and have about 10hrs into it.The game is really fun you get to play a super cool female problem solver that can do acrobatics such as jumping, wall running, and sliding and when you do this time slows down and you can shoot.  One of your guns is targeted on the closest enemy and the other you manually target with the right stick.  The combat is really fun and can be quite challenging.  You get extra points to purchase upgraded acrobatic activities based on your combos while in combat and this also regenerates your life.The combat is so fun for me because it is not just shooting but sliding and shooting, jumping and shooting, wall running and shooting and is so cool and fun.The story is really cool with voices from Malcolm Mcdowell and Eliza Dushku (mis spelled) from Jay and Silent Bob strikes back.  The variety of locations is cool and the activities are pretty varied from combat and platforming.  To jumping off the tops of moving cars and shooting.  To doing timed trial events where you have to platform and shoot targets that only appear for seconds and finish a course in a certian amt of time.I am not real good at games so It always takes me a lot longer to finish games than other people, but I feel this game has a good playing length.  Also tons of playability since you will probably get a lot better at combos the more you play it an it would be fun to replay levels once you are an expert.  I think there are different difficulty levels.  Also there are some other modes than story mode, but I don't know anything about those, just been playing the story mode.The graphics are great and definantly as good as any other next gen game I have played up to date.The game has a great soundtrack of what I consider punk music that goes great with the game.The controls are great but took me a little to get used to but work well once you get the hang of it.  Most any problems I had with the game were me and not the games.The difficulty level is challenging but after a few trys I have been able to get through the areas so far.This is probably the coolest game I have every played.  It's like the coolest female hero taking on the mob mixed with a punker/apocalypse feel.  Sort of like the movie doomsday which I love mixed with a mob.This is based on only 10hrs of play, just though I would share my views, since I have purchased a lot of games based on other reviews here I wanted to let people know this game is fun!Kevin","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0038TT8QM","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian M. Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"","summary":"Civilization V--The Final Frontier","reviewText":"Update: 22 November 2010, 62 hours of play.*Sid Meier's Civilization* first bleeped and blooped its way across the VGA monitor of my 386 in 1995, after I pirated the floppy discs from a neighbor. After my Persian Gulf deployment, I bought a Compaq laptop at the base exchange, along with *Civilization II* on the Red Book wonders of CD-ROM. Years later, I defended America from terrorists and intoxicated sailors alike as a military policeman, and to unwind I frequently brought America to ruin in challenging campaigns of *Civilization III*. Not long after I left the service and began my battles through college and the job market, *Civilization IV* arrived with the glories of 3D (and DVD if you buy the Complete Edition).Today, Siddy brings you the ultimate Civilization (to date). Digitally distributed--and requiring Valve Software's Steam interface no matter what type you buy--it's been a long strange trip from the days of MS-DOS. After 50 hours of gameplay and winning the Space Race, what is my internal consensus? *Civ5* is a lot like *Civ3*, in that it takes away about as much as it adds.A lot of the character changes are... interesting. Abe Lincoln has been the default American leader since the original title. Now George Washington has finally been tapped as the true founder of our nation. Several other leaders are also departures from the celebrity focus of previous games. Classic civs like the Mongols have been moved to optional DLC, while notorious killers like Josef Stalin have been booted entire.Mostly, the redesign makes Civ a more sensible war game.No more Stacks of Doom! The limit of one combat unit per tile imposes choke points and flanking, while jams of unit columns can be hit by archers, artillery, or aircraft. Ranged and Indirect Fire modes replace the \"Bombardment\" mechanic of past games, allowing archers and artillery to batter the enemy without risking themselves to combat--though enemy cavalry can still rush them when your turn is over. Also, the stack limit means individual units have to be positioned, obscuring your map tiles and taking more player time and energy.Cities no longer require a garrison, and can pummel approaching units with their own limited range attack. City hit-points must be worn down before they can be captured, and a garrison or defensive structures boost those HP. However, cities still need field forces because besiegers get flank bonuses that rapidly add up.Finally, land units can \"embark\" into a water transport mode, as a slow and vulnerable ship that nevertheless makes water boundaries much less secure, and warships much more important. Advanced units are noticeably stronger against more primitive forces, with tanks smashing Bismarck's impudent Landsknecht in my test game.I was pleased to see that a bit of previous games were ported over, such as the Great People and more modern units such as the Rocket Artillery and Mobile SAM. Cottage spamming is replaced with trade posts, but the principle remains. Units aren't as anachronistic as *Civ4* with its Industrial Era SAM Trooper -- though the anti-tank gun can still be built before tanks are invented!Warfare is also waged through bolstered economic and diplomacy models. When rivals are mad at you, they really take you to the cleaners on deals. They also periodically comment on your behavior, such as when you buy choice real estate, settle close to their territory, or amass troops along their borders. Rivals will even reproach you for sponsoring the \"protection\" of city-states. Your responses determine future attitudes. On the downside, tech trading and map swaps have been deleted.All civs can now grab land, buying tiles up to three hexes away from each city. This adds a bizarre and satisfying dimension, whereby you politically encircle enemy territory and cut them off from strategic resources. Such resources now have capacity, forcing players to seek more in order to build larger forces. Certain buildings are also capped--you can only build as many factories as you have units of coal.Civics have been upgraded to \"Social Policies\", which branch into mini-trees. Some policy branches are mutually exclusive, but most of them stack. Policies are purchased with Culture, somewhat the same way that Great People are generated by GP points; the price threshold increasing every time. This gives an extra importance and utility to culture, even for militant or scientific civs. The downside is that civs can't switch to specialized footings on the fly like Civics. Golden Ages, likewise, are now triggered repeatedly by accumulated Happiness and have a potent productivity effect.But like *Civ3*, this installment also took a lot of stuff away from its predecessor. The Space Victory is once again instantaneous--no travel time to Alpha Centauri, during which a lagging rival could hope to catch up. No UN resolutions may be passed, and there are no more religions, espionage, or corporations, which I always felt gave some flavor to the world. I was surprised by the omission of vassals and \"culture-flipping\" cities (though Great Artists can still culture-bomb the country-side). There is no more health or unhealthiness to worry about--they've been streamlined into various \"Granary\" mechanics. I was also surprised by the removal of city happiness and rioting. I was especially disappointed that there is no longer any era-specific music; a decision for the mod community to correct.Some features, like vassals or space travel, were part of expansion packs; but being previously developed, I feel they should have been part of the current core title.And once again, the wonder and victory videos have been replaced with still pictures, though at least you get a cool quote recited by British actor Morgan Sheppard. Otherwise, I don't quite feel a sense of wonder or victory. Perhaps if Firaxis returned the Civ3-style ending, where your rivals humorously comment on the campaign, I'd feel better about spending 62 hours of my life. For that matter, I just realized the power charts and the history replay are also missing in action from the end-of-history.Overall, the watchword of revision was \"No Spam, No Munchkins\". Roads and railroads now have maintenance that can bankrupt your empire if you try to improve every tile. Buildings and wonders have restricted effects coupled with higher costs, so it is less efficient than ever to build everything in every city. If the stack and resource limitations weren't enough to discourage vast armies, units are more expensive, take longer to produce, and seldom killed in one round of combat. Unit maintenance costs are currently hidden to the player. The number of cities themselves are limited by increasing their work radius to three titles, and by imposing a cost increase to social policies.Despite streamlining, there are goofy mismatches in design. The empire sliders have been removed, so science, tax, and culture production can only be partially controlled by going into each bleeding city and reassigning the citizens. While city changes do have an empire-wide effect, it can be hard to quantify.The UI is also stylized in glossy metal and colored glass, reminding me of BHG's *Rise of Nations*. Indeed, mechanics like embarkation for land units seem inspired by that game. Ironic, because I was really mad at *RoN* for a while (see my review). With *Civ5*, I dislike the new screen position for unit orders; I prefer them to be at the center of the screen. The tool-tips are generally pretty handy, but they need to give unit details so I don't have to keep running to the Civilopedia. The 3D god's eye zoom has been replaced with a separate 2D strategic overlay.As expected, there are performance issues. The game noticably runs up my GPU processing, the fan whizzing away at top speed as temps jump to 85 degrees. There is noticeable frame stutter and delayed texture loading in the late game on DX11 mode, while running a Huge map at Standard speed with 12 civs (before the latest patch). Some of the recitations don't match the quotes. Otherwise, I suffered only two crashes in eight days of playing.The *Civilization* series has been with me my entire adult life. I noticed on my own that the odd entries tend to be more abrasive than the even, following the \"Star Trek movie\" effect. With years of fan mods and official DLC down the road, it is too early to say how this edition will turn out. I can say this game cannot use certain time-honored min-maxing strategies, offering a fresh challenge. Far from \"ruining\" the series, it is more compelling in certain ways.Check out the comments section for more thoughts.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2010"}

Its the small details that makes it better, the way the quests work now, the ability to trade instead of toss everything on the ground...the fact that drop in drop out and bluetooth just...works now :)That and all the characters are unique, the writing and characters are top notch, considering a lot of people just want to shoot everything n the face, which is perfectly fine for them to do too.  The humor is fantastic, I always describe it as intellectual humor kind of....mixed with toilet humor.This review is purely based off of my play through with my normal crew for a 4 player coop game...by itself i could see it being boring, but that isn't the point of Borderlands ....its meant to be played with your friends.* Update - 3/15/13 *Well I wrote this review over 6 months ago, game was released in September and here we are now, no level cap....so...my Siren has been capped out for almost 5 months now, and just twiddling my thumbs watching 3 sepereate DLC packs roll out without a single level cap increase.Really....can't believe how I can go from being so ecstatic about this game to it just sitting on my shelf and I just get more and more upset watching them talk about their 4th DLC pack without giving me any reason to play them with my main.You can make secondary characters, but...thats not what I enjoy, I enjoy my siren, and she is just sitting around tapping her fingers now.* Update - 5/04/13 *Level cap increase came out, so I am finally digging through the DLC campaigns, and having a lot of fun.  Torgue was hilarious, and the Scarlet's Booty was pretty good too....pretty chill, relaxing with your friends, going across the dunes, while Torgue is more action, arena based.  Just starting on Hammerlocks, but overall, feel like I'm playing for the first time.Funny thing how not getting experience changes your entire outlook on a game.

{"product_name":"B00IIHU44E","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Harley","summary":"I liked it a lot but I returned it. Here's why...","reviewText":"This is a truthful and honest review from someone who actually purchased both the Xbox One and PS4 systems this past week.  I'll preface by saying it's not an Amazon verified purchase because although I do the majority of my shopping at Amazon, I've read too many horror stories of rough shipping being the cause behind a lot of the issues experienced by both recent consoles.  Therefore, I opted to purchase from a local brick and mortar shop.  That's not a knock against Amazon but the shipping services.  Just last week I watched a delivery man literally drop a box labeled &#34;Fragile&#34; on the concrete in front of my door.  Ironically, it was an Amazon order. So I figured I'd play it safe and buy local instead of having it delivered.I bought the Xbox One because I was intrigued by Titanfall and heard it was casual gamer friendly.  I also purchased it because many of my peers among the older crowd seem to be more into the Xbox while the PS4 seems to be more popular among younger gamers.  Most of my friends and relatives who are my age own either the Xbox One or 360.  That gives me a better opportunity to game with people among my own age.  I'm also one of the types who actually wanted the additional media features the Xbox One offers other than gaming. For an older casual gamer like me, the Xbox One made the most sense.I loved the Xbox initially.  I had no problems setting it up and creating my Xbox live account.  I then downloaded all pending system updates, created my profile, added my friends and downloaded Titanfall.  The bundle comes with a QR download code for Titanfall that you scan with the Kinect instead of a physical game disk. Despite being a large download, Titanfall downloaded pretty quickly. I purchased a 13-month special Titanfall themed Xbox Live subscription card along with the system but thankfully, the bundle also included a one-month Xbox Live trial code.  I used the enclosed trial code first, figuring it would extend my Live membership to 14-months.  Had I used the card I purchased, I would have been out of $59 when I returned the system.After playing around with all of the cool features like voice and facial recognition, I settled down to play Titanfall for a few hours.  I first went through the training a couple times and then played several game modes.  My favorite was the new beta matching mode.  Despite admittedly being the lowest ranked player on most of my teams, I still had a blast.  It wasn't an exercise in futility where my character got killed every five seconds like I often encountered in other multiplayer FPS games like COD.  The game really is a ton of fun to play, even for newbies, and not too difficult to learn the mechanics. I then made the mistake of taking a break.  When I attempted to resume playing an hour later, the game froze on the loading screen.  I restarted the game several times and also tried restarting the Xbox One but I could not get the game to progress past the loading screen.  Now, before anyone says I have a bad Internet connection, I did a speed test and my download/upload speeds were 83.95/39.25 mbps respectively, and that was over wireless on my laptop.  My ping response from the Titanfall servers was an excellent 17ms.  I also connected the Xbox One directly to the router using an Ethernet cable in a 10/100/1000 port.  So neither Wi-Fi nor internal network issues were the culprit.  After unsuccessfully trying to connect over the next several hours, I decided to sleep on it and try again the next day.  I figured maybe there were network issues with Xbox Live servers.  I tried again the next day but I couldn't even get to the loading screen.  Clicking on Titanfall just resulted in a black screen and no further response. I waited a while longer and tried again with the same result.That was enough for me.  I packed everything up, returned to the store and exchanged it for a PS4.  I realize both new consoles have their respective initial growing pains and the PS4 isn't perfect either.  However, after an entire day of playing Infamous on the PS4, I have yet to experience a glitch whereas I only got three hours of gaming from the Xbox One before I was no longer able to play Titanfall again.  My brother-in-law, also an Xbox One owner, said I should have been a little more patient. Although he admitted to experiencing his own fair share of glitches now and then, he never encountered a problem as lengthy or irritating as mine.  He has not experienced any issues playing Titanfall.  I'm sorry, but after spending $510 + tax on a bundle and Live membership card, I didn't think it was asking too much of a system to simply play a game.  The Xbox One has the capability to be an awesome system and I may very likely buy it again down the road when they finally iron out all the kinks.  I really enjoyed it when it was working properly.  However, for the prices these systems are commanding, to be unable to play a game for two straight days is totally unacceptable. I just want a little more reliability for the amount of money spent.So that was my experience.  I won't slam the Xbox One with a low rating because I don't hate it nor do I think it's a terrible system.  I may have even gotten a faulty console.  I started to give it a three-star rating but I personally think the system is better than merely &#34;ok&#34;.  It's an awesome system that just needs some bugs resolved before it can be truly great.  Had I not encountered the issue with Titanfall, it would have been a five-star review without hesitation.  I also took into account that my brother-in-law has been playing Titanfall relatively problem-free.  However, The main point of my review was to share my personal experience.  I didn't want to risk exchanging and trying another Xbox right now.  My worst fear was activating more codes, possibly encountering more frustrating problems and eventually being told I couldn't return the system again. I was relieved when they exchanged everything, including the unused subscription card.  Most times, they are non-refundable.  Just another thought to keep in mind if you&#8217;re contemplating buying one. I was lucky but your retailer may not be as liberal with returns.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2014"}

{"product_name":"B006WQR3V0","description":"","reviewerName":"Yossarian","summary":"Do you enjoy reloading every 5 minutes forever?","reviewText":"Oh, Xcom.  How I want to love you.  I grew up on the original XCom and played it to death, and still consider it one of the best games of all time.  To say I was keyed up for this updated reinvention/sequel was to put it mildly.  Indeed, much of the game mechanics are the same, including various developments for your home base, research trees, character level and equipment upgrading, and even the UFO interceptor fights.  But what should have been the central strength of the game -- the turn based strategic combat -- is its most glaring weakness.In the original XCom, you could with some degree of effectiveness ensure that your characters were extremely unlikely to get shot, by strategic use of cover.  The ability to hide out of line of fire behind trees, rocks, or walls ensured that weapons fire would at a minimum have to penetrate that cover before it could hit you, or be fired blind with low hit probabilities.  In XCom:  Enemy Unknown, all that seems to matter is hit percentages.  In other words, hiding behind even huge rocks, vehicles, or other forms of obstruction simply reduces the chances of that character getting hit, but even then not significantly.  Do you enjoy watching an alien fire a plasma rifle through 2 walls and then the side of an 18 wheeler trailer in order to hit your otherwise invisible character?  Do you like the idea of a group of aliens being able, in a single unbroken turn, to sprint out into the open and unload their weapons halfway across the map at one of your characters who is hidden on the other side of an entire hill, and hit your player effortlessly every time?  Is your idea of fun reloading your game every 5 minutes for hours on end just so you can keep moving different characters in sequential order and hope that something gets shaken up in the game's random number generator such that for one additional precious turn nobody gets shot through a wall from halfway across the map?  Then XCom:  Enemy Unknown is for you.Contrary to other reports, XCom:  Enemy Unknown is not a hard game.  I've platinumed Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, I know what a hard game is.  XCom:  Enemy Unknown does not require you to learn new skills or tactics, learn from your mistakes, or overcome challenges.  Instead, all you are doing is fighting a random number generator that favors the home (alien) team, and reloading over and over and over until you finally get to go back and do the fun stuff like horsing around with your headquarters.  Strategy is actually a hindrance; no amount of covered movements and careful player positioning can change the fact that a random alien can just flat out shoot you right through a brick wall as if you're standing right next to them.  Honest to god, one of the best ways I've found to win missions is to literally have every single player but one stay in permanent \"overwatch\" right where they are standing when you load up the ground combat map, and have a single expendable rookie run around drawing fire so your troops can engage in counterbattery attacks.  Hiding doesn't matter.  Cover doesn't matter (and often is harmful, as vehicles can explode in a single turn if set on fire even by your own attacks through them).  All that matters is brute force firepower at the start of each turn, so you kill them through all the solid environmental \"cover\" before they do it to you.  That's it.It's a truly sad thing when you have all this fun designing and upgrading your base, researching and crafting your new gear, getting your satellites up, defending your planet, and then realize that oh god I have to do another one of these stupid ground missions where unless I reload each turn a dozen times all my Colonel level supersoldiers in robotic exosuits are still coming back in body bags.  How they screwed this up I'll never understand.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2012"}

There are close to 50 games, a bunch of characters, and lots of things to try.  Unfortunantly, the games have no real purpose, no real rules, and each uses such different controls...its hard to get into a flow.  Here's what I thought of Microsoft's Fuzion Frenzy:1) The Gameplay: Well, there are dozens of games to try, and u can play with up to 4 players.  The graphics are pretty good and the game is pretty fun.  The problem?  The gameplay is repetitive, the controls stink, and it seems like a game that tried to be 3 or 4 different games and in fact doesn't seem in any way it's own.You start out by picking a game type.  Multiplayer, single player, tournament, arcade, etc...  In Arcade for example, u can pick any game and play it over and over again...or pick another game.  You can do this with as many players as u want.Once u pick a game type, and how many people are playing, you pick a character.  The problem begins here.  The players seem to be different through color and gender, not through persounallity.  Each person just seems to be either a green guy or a pink girl.  They hardly ever talk, have no persounality or grudges or talents, and seem to just be there.  This was a major problem, as I never found anyone to be my \"favorite.\"  It's not like Mario Party, where each character is different and fun to try.  Here, everyone seems to be the same...and they are.  Another problem is no one seems to have a face.  Just eyes, a nose, a mouth.  They don't react, smile, talk.  No mustaches, long hair.  Each person is so similar, u won't care who u pick.  That's a MAJOR problem.The games, thankfully, are for the most part, fun.  There's 45 mini-games to try, each pretty fun.  There are games where you hop in Vehicles and do things.  For example, try not to hit each others tail, or knock the other off the sumo court (it continues to shrink, and you try to push the other 3 people's ball-shaped vehichles off...like SUMO).  You have games where u collect the most valuables, kill the most bugs, etc...  When u win a mini-game, in a tournament, u get points.  1st gets the most, followed by second, third, fourth, etc...  You add up points through about 10 mini-games.  The winner gets bragging rights.  Unfortunantly, 45 mini-games isn't that much to choose from, the characters aren't that interesting.  In the end, it gets very dull.  And not all of the games are good.Some are just boring and seem to be impossible, and can take 15-20 minutes just to understand.  That's no fun (especially at a sleepover or party (where this game is aimed at)).  The controls aren't very good, and with just 45 mini-games, all of them needed to be.  Not the case here, and may have killed this game's gameplay.2) Graphics: Decent, but nothing the PS2 or GC couldn't handle.  The water looks decent and plain, the characters have no real special affects.  The envirements are vibrant and colorful, but nothing great.  This was a launch game by Microsoft, where they boasted the best graphics in the world...yet these graphics were nothing new.  They get the job done, but don't in ANY way save the game.  The graphics were good...but any console now a' days can do good.  What we want is GREAT!3) Options: Several.  You can play all types of games in all types of modes, create how long your game is, how hard, etc...very good.  There are a lot of characters, a lot of games, and a lot of different things to try.  There are a lot of options...but it didn't save the game.Overall, if u have NO multiplayer games, u might want to pick this up (especially for it's price).  It is fun, it is pretty unique, but it needs a LOT of improvent.  I enjoyed playing it, it did have a lot of cool stuff, but it wasn't anything I'd brag about to my friends.  This is a good game that the whole family (girls...boys at any age), and if u find a good deal, u might want to pick it up.Just don't expect Mario Party here.  It's a good game, with decent graphics, but gets pretty old fairly quickly.Hope this helped,Thx!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2003"}

This charming direct sequel to 2011'sRayman Originsis the fifth major title in the Rayman series. Amazingly, it raises the bar again.Rayman Legends looks beautiful. At times, it looks like my sons are playing a cartoon and not a video game. Every level is memorable and the soundtrack is a character of its own.My sons tell me the approach to a side-scrolling platformer breaks down into two basic styles: reach the ending quickly or attempt to attain a perfect score, collecting every hidden item and completing every challenge.Kai aims for the perfect score but Kou likes running, jumping and climbing through levels. Both enjoy the online challenge mode.Kai (age 11): \"The multiplayer is more fun than the single-player mode.\"Kou (age 9): \"The screen moves around a lot with four players, so it's hard to keep an eye on your character.\"Kai: \"You just have to keep up.\"They agree that the game is most fun with two players, which taps the advantages of teamwork without slowing down the action. The replay value of Rayman Legends is off the chart; the latter levels take several tries to complete but the game play doesn't feel like a grind.In summary, my sons aren't old enough to appreciate the evolution of the Rayman series. Still, Rayman Legends is currently my sons' first pick when friends visit and want to play on the Xbox 360.Rating: Five stars","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2013"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Just plain awesome","reviewText":"Tecmo's classic franchise Ninja Gaiden makes its debut on the DS with fantastic results.  Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword continues the adventures of the heroic and deadly master ninja Ryu Hayabusa, as he takes on evil forces including all sorts of beasts and baddies.  What makes Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword on the DS so unique is the game's control scheme and presentation: holding the DS sideways (like with Hotel Dusk: Room 215 and Planet Puzzle League), you move Ryu with the stylus, and attack enemies by slashing across them with the stylus as well.  This allows for some great combo attack strings that are just plain cool.  Not to mention that this is one of the best looking and well animated games to hit the DS yet, especially from a third-party.  One thing the Ninja Gaiden series has always been known for is the challenge it provides, and while there is a bit to be found here, it isn't nearly as super difficult as past games in the series have been.  This can be good or bad depending on your own experience with the series, with the game's only other real flaw being that the touch screen controls aren't always as precise as they could be.  However, everything else about Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword is spectacular: from the cut-scenes to the storyline to the epic boss battles, this game is a blast.  All in all, Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword is one of the best recent third-party titles to hit the DS, and for fans of the series that own Nintendo's handheld, this is an essential pick up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2008"}

He is NOT a comic super hero (he does have comics, but that's not his origin) and second Arnold Schwarzenegger is plays the best Conan ever. The story is not exactly great, but it evolves around the Conan mythology where he seeks the four pieces of armor to defeat Graven who has put the Black Death upon the world. The game's story is nothing special or interesting, and the only thing that keeps you hooked is acquiring new abilities, and seeing the cool levels.The main focus of the game is the combat which is pretty satisfying and fun. You have heavy and light attacks, a grab, you can throw weapons, and use magic. You have different fighting styles by picking up different weapons such as double handed weapons, dual wield, sword and shield, or single sword. Each of these has it's own set of attacks you can acquire by upgrading. There are tons of attacks and you may not even acquire all of them by the end of the game. The combat, ironically, is also the most flawed part of the game because there is no counter attack button, enemies will wail on you and kill you without have some sort of shock wave type attack to knock them away, plus the heavy enemies can be really cheap. You try to attack them and they'll block but there is no block breaker attacks that are effective. You can grab small enemies and do as you wish with them such as take their weapon and slice them in half, take their shield etc.The magic system is only used when you're in dire need of help. You have four attacks over the course of the game yet they seem to use too much energy so you're left dry after a few attacks. You can increase your health and magic by finding three circles on the ground and stabbing them. These can sometimes be hard to find so hopefully you have enough health to survive through the course of the game. While the combat is fun it still has it's frustrations like I pointed out, but it's nothing you can't handle.Now that we have the core of the game put aside let's talk about visuals. The game has great graphics yet they look like plastic. The characters have low-res textures and everything just looks like it's made of plastic. The game has pre-set camera angles like in God of War so you don't have to worry about fighting the camera. The game has lots and lots of buckets of blood and guts and lots of...mammaries. Yes there are nude women in the game and these come in the form of helpless maidens. Conan must find them chained up in places and free them. They yell things like \"Crush me with your love!\", and \"I didn't my savior would be so...strong.\", and \"My clothes! Where are my clothes?\". While this may be corny it's still hot and you gotta love it.Speaking of God of War the game has a lot of similarities to that game such as a giant dragon fight inside a building (think of the first boss fight in Chains of Olympus (PSP), a giant squid on a boat (think of the Hydra in God of War (PS2), the fixed sweeping camera angles, lots of blood and guts, nude women, a buff overaggressive hero, a sexy heroine he has to save, wow the list just goes on and on. I think a certain developer tried making a God of War clone and it's written all over Conan's Neanderthalian face!No matter though the game is pretty fun and you'll appreciate these similarities. The achievements are easy to unlock and there is incentive to play through again thanks to those, but the game is extremely short with a playtime of 6-8 hours depending on how slow or fast you are. I highly recommend Conan if you can look past the many bugs (collision detection issues, invisible walls), combat flaws (no counter attack, wailing enemies), and nude women (well...I'm sure you can handle that :-) .

As the old saying goes: \"Good artists borrow, great artists steal.\" The Dead Space development team has shamelessly stolen from Doom 3, Resident Evil*, System Shock 2, Half Life 2... Those are all fantastic games to use as inspiration, and they did an incredible job. This game may not break much new ground, but it's still undeniably AAA quality, one of the most fully fleshed out and immersive games I've seen in a long time. They didn't re-invent the wheel, but that's OK... because everything about Dead Space is finely crafted and fine tuned, with a clear painstaking attention to detail that is only seen in true top shelf games. And it does include at least a few noteworthy innovations- The concept of foregoing a traditional HUD and instead conveying key data by putting it on your avatar's back and in real time holographic projections in the environment was an inspired idea, and most of the weapons are original... because most of them aren't weapons per se, they're futuristic mining tools. For many years I've thought of EA as a big greedy faceless slob of a company that thrives on unloading mediocre shovelware onto an unsuspecting public, but Dead Space demonstrates that they're dead serious about finally turning that around.*A lot of people are going to compare Dead Space to Resident Evil 4 because of the 3rd person camera angle/controls etc., and there is indeed an undeniable similarity. But to me, one of the great things about Dead Space is that in many ways it seems to stick closer to the traditions and spirit of the original 1996 Resident Evil (and of course the 2002 REmake) than RE4 did. Exploring and progressing through the Ishimura truly does harken back to making your way through the Umbrella mansion.

{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands.

Hardcore gamers live for great gameplay, great games, and overall, great gaming innovation. For the hardcore gamer everywhere, there is the game boy advance SP. A little side note is that the letter SP stand for absolutely nothing, said by the creater himself!The SP is pefect for your hardcore gamer on the go. The most noticable addition to this gameboy is its backlight feature. It is now possible to pla your gameboy in any lighting through light under the screen, which casts perfect light to every piece of the screen.As for battery life, it varies. The game boy SP runs on a lithium ion battery, and is rechargable (charger included), which means no more batteries! At the start of your SP's lifespan, it will play for 10 hours without the backlight, which can easily be switched on and off by one button press,and 8 hours with, slightly less. Since the SP runs on a lithium ion battery, the battery can hold progressively less as you recharge. The battery is good for about 500 charges before it is necasry to purchase a new one (about 5 to 15 dollars depending on size.)For all the newbies to the whole videogame scene, the SP is backward compatible. This means that you can play just about any game for any game boy that has ever been released, but the next style of cartidge that is released for the next gen handhelds will be incompatible with the SP. to put it quite simply, any new systems games will nto be playable on this system.another small edge that the SP has over the original GBA is its size. The original GBA is a bit large, and it is foolish to think you will fit anything else in your pocket if you GBA is already in there. The SP answers this problem with a sort of fold  it in half style. This way it takes up even less space in your pocket than the original GBA. This little feature also hides the screen and reduces kinicks and scratchs say from having keys in your pocket with your GBAin conclusion, SP is perfect for the hardcore gamer. Is it completely essential? no. The original gameboy advance can do everything the SP can short of the backlight and rechargeable battery. Is the SP much more user friendly, O YAH!P.S.i thought it may be useful info to all you who own the kirby tilt and tumble game out there that it will not work in the SP. since the cartidges are put in upside down, it basically flips all of the controls for the tilt and tumble game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2004"}

Mauricio","summary":"Stale piece of bread.","reviewText":"I seriously hope this is the last of the \"New\" line of Super Mario games. It's the same old rehash that Nintendo has been pulling, making this his worst launch game to date. With the Wii U struggling in sales and popularity, Nintendo failed to make a killer app to introduce its new console with the stupid name. The difficulty is a bit harder than the equally DULL New Super Mario Bros. 2 which is always a plus but I honestly can't find myself passing this game because it's just so formulaic and BORING! Some will say it's Metroid with Other M, but to me, Super Mario is currently the most mishandled Nintendo franchise. What happened Nintendo? You used to make these games special. My childhood was with the original trilogy on the original Famicom (NES for the rest of you). The hook here is that the game is in high definition which is a long time overdue. The tragedy of it all is that how stale and boring the series has become. I'm sorry but referencing Super Mario World with the game's dynamic over world map will not cut it. Please kill this series off, everything about this game is half assed, the graphics are just upscaled to HD, the music is still grating to the ears \"bah, bah\", and the gameplay is no longer fun. The Wii U is in major trouble, this is one of the reasons. A one out of five.The good:- Mario's finally in HD but. . .The bad:- Little in innovation, considering the pedigree of this franchise.- Awful recycled music.- Poor use of the tablet-like Wii U gamepad.- Horrible save system until you complete the main game.- BORING to play in general.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2013"}

I was not even planning on getting this game and could care less about it till release date. I saw some good reviews on it(Not from ign who accepts bribes) and I grabbed it not expecting much. Maybe that's why I really like it. I was not salivating over the game. I also am not a massive cod player so this review is probably best for people who play every once in a while. Today i had off from work and even though my normal play time for a video game is 1/2 hr tops i ended playing it all damn day! Yeah it is basically the same. Rum around shooting people and of course the campaign which is a story with you running around and shooting people. However something about this game felt better then a lot of the last ones. I love the color scheme of the environments. The maps looks awesome. They don't look they were slapped together in five minutes by throwing a building model on the ground and chucking some boxes in the middle of the floor for you to get stuck on. It looks like they spent time on these maps. It doesn't look all washed out like the first blops. I honestly didn't like the first one. I love this one though. It still uses the same engine but the graphics do look better just because of the colors used and the way the maps are laid out. It does have connection issues though. I also noticed that no matter how far you jump you won't even get hurt. I have many times jumped off of buildings and landed fine with no injury at all. That needs to be fixed.

I loved this game and as I just passed it the only problem it has are the LONG cut scenes, don't get me wrong the story is probably the best thing about this game but they are very long. The graphics won't wow you still they are good. The gameplay is topnotch using stealth and shotting is a good combination and it will probably keep you playing to the end of the game still with the long cut scenes. This game as a lot of people have said is like a movie, but I really got attached to the story and snake so as the game ended I felt kind of sad. The online is hard to get through the registration process at first, but the  online is not as good as the story mode, so if you buy games for the online only this game is not for you.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Mr. H. C. Orr","summary":"Triumph And Frustration","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid 4 is all the triumphs and shortcomings of the entire Metal Gear series writ large. The game is beautifully made, with the best cut-scenes ever made for a videogame, and breathtaking sound and level design, especially in the first stages of the game.  Hideo Kojima, the mastermind behind the series, couldn't care less about any criticisms: it is his baby, and to play the game to the end you have to accept the short game, long cut-scenes and occasionally unresponsive controls.As the Metal Gear series ostensibly ends with this instalment of Kojima's epic and often convoluted conspiracy series, there is a lot of explaining and tying up of loose ends to do before the final credits roll.  Kojima's avowed love of cinema has never been more evident than in MGS4: ultra-lengthy cut-scenes often mean the player can put the controller down for a good twenty minutes at a time.  The cut-scenes themselves are the best ever made for a game: character modelling and the hi-def rendering are amazingly detailed, with only some of the myriad plot twists letting the side down in spots.  The sheer amount and duration of these in no ways lessens their quality as the game progresses. Of course, critics of the games in the past will repeat what they have said in the past: games are to be played, not watched.  The occasional quick-time button pressing during these scenes (in order to trigger comic-book flashbacks)  and the ability to move around during the briefing scenes only emphasises the passivity that comes from these scenes, which take up roughly sixty percent of the entire game experience.  As one of these critics in the past, I would answer that the cut-scenes are of such quality and add so much to the Metal Gear universe that they largely mitigate the relative lack of gameplay in the MGS4 experience.Gameplay itself is very similar to previous iterations of Metal Gear Solid.  The responsiveness of the player character (an aged version of famous Snake Plissken) is generally good, but my gripes about his slowness to turn, stand after executing rolls, and lie down flat still stand.  The game engine -including enemy A.I.- is essentially the same as Snake and Raiden's debut on the PlayStation 2 in 2001.  The engine is ageing, like Snake himself, and this sometimes lets down the otherwise diamond polish of the graphical and sonic production.However, the central issue with gameplay is that there is simply not enough of it.  The first two acts, with their innovative Faction system, are probably the best in the game, with technically stunning chase sequences involving a bicycle and a Metal Gear mech later on too short-lived to really imprint themselves in the mind after the game is over.  Furthermore, an almost-wonderful stealth mission based on a foggy doppelganger of Prague is too on-rails to be truly satisfying.  The question remains, as it has since MGS2: does Kojima have enough confidence in the (now ageing) game engine of Metal Gear Solid to expose it more to scrutiny? Or is he just so in love with his self-made myth to switch off his cinema blinkers?A promising online game comes with MGS4, which will add hours to the overall Metal Gear milieu.  But replay value comes with the knowledge that the best the game has to offer comes early on, with sizable dialogue scenes coming to edge out the generally excellent stealth and shooting action.  Of course, lovers of Metal Gear Solid won't care, and detractors will find little to really switch them on to Kojima's baby this late on. MGS4's biggest recommendation is it is a Metal Gear game, par excellance; its biggest criticism is it is a Metal Gear game, par excellance.  Now go enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2008"}

I have played Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep, and i am about to beat it with Aqua, and yes i know you have to play with all 3 to get the main plot. In anycase let me say in general Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep could have EASILY been on the PS3, it's graphics are really amazing and as is the storyline. At first glance i was kind of mad about the voice acting for Aqua and Terra, but after awhile it seems like the voice actors make a great transition and you get a feel like they belong in the universe. For combat, i thought it would be complex with these new \"Battle mechanics\" but essentially it was very easy to get into after awhile because the controls are similiar to the PS2 controller except with a new SHOTLOCK system which is like a homing device for your character to get multiple attacks on the enemies.As for the bad, and my only two gripes with this game, was that the worlds were a little bit smaller, but i give this a pass because it is a PSP and the game designers can only do so much in one little disc. Also the boss fights can be REALLY difficult or the enemies, but that was most likely because they run a pattern, but it can be complex if you are underleveled. Overall this game is worth a buy and the full price if you ask me, because it is exactly a Kingdom Hearts style game, it has 3 different stories with 3 characters, some collectibles, new worlds which is definitely a huge upgrade over past Kingdom Hearts games and especially a hidden part of the game once you get all of Xehanorts diarys.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2010"}

Garrelts","summary":"The Prince Returns to his Roots","reviewText":"I've been a longtime fan of the Prince of Persia series ever since The Sands of Time was released on the last-gen consoles. The subsequent games in the series have progressively gotten further and further away from what made The Sands of Time so great. For example Warrior Within, though a good game, relied on a brash artistic style and heavy-metal music that never really felt quite right for the PoP series. The Two Thrones followed a similar route albeit with a weaker storyline. The last PoP outing on the PS3/X360 completely split off and featured a completely new storyline, art style and was probably my least favorite of the PoP games. After hearing that The Forgotten Sands would return to the roots established with The Sands of Time I was eagerly anticipating the game.First, there's a lot to like about The Forgotten Sands (TFS) and anyone who has played The Sands of Time will be right at home with the game. The graphics are what you would expect from a top-tier Ubisoft game - they're excellent in other words. The color palette is full of browns as you'd expect from a game set in a desert environment, however, that is contrasted by the diverse settings. Areas like hanging gardens, water/sewer systems, etc.The storyline is straightforward but interesting and keeps things moving forward at a good pace. The game begins with the young prince returning to his brothers kingdom after a prolonged absence. The kingdom is under siege by a powerful army and in desperation the Prince's brother calls forth the fabled army of King Soloman.Another notable positive in TFS is the excellent soundtrack and voice acting. The original voice actor from The Sands of Time - Yuri Lowenthal - is back to voicing the Prince and does a great job. I always felt a connection with Yuri's voicework over that of Nolan North in the PoP series. The game music, thankfully loses the heavy metal track that felt woefully out of place and returns to a more appropriate Arabic theme.The gameplay mechanics are similar to previous PoP games. The Prince retains the ability to recall time in short bursts though the use of the ability is limited. This adds a definite challenge to the game though there is also a strong sense of accomplishment once a particularly difficult area is traversed. That feeling of accomplishment was something that I felt was missing entirely from the previous PoP installment on the PS3. Throughout his adventure the Prince will receive upgrade points by slaughtering enemies or finding sarcophagus statues that he can smash. These points can be used on an upgrade grid for abilities ranging from increased damage to physical attacks to elemental spells based on ice, fire, & wind, and even a few defensive upgrades as well.There are a few areas where The Forgotten Sands falls a bit short and thus keeps me from rating the game higher. First of all, being a Ubisoft game virtually guarantees that TFS will have glitches and bugs. I can most definitely confirm that TFS does. Near the end of the game I ran into a massive glitch which basically prevented me from advancing further in the story. Initially I thought I'd have to start a new game - though luckily TFS does create a back-up save file (the game auto-saves & doesn't allow the user to create save files). Ultimately the glitch cost me about 2hrs of gameplay. Not great, but thankfully not totally devastating. I really  do think Ubisoft needs to do a better job testing their games. Problems like the one I encountered in TFS have plagued nearly every single Ubisoft game I've played.Second, the combat in the TFS leaves something to be desired. I couldn't help but feel that the combat felt somewhat sluggish the entire game. Contrast that with the Prince's fluid movements through the environment and it becomes even more apparent. Also, on the topic of combat - the game will throw hordes of enemies at the Prince but yet the game lacks any feeling of real danger. I think that I felt overpowered the entire game - even against the boss creatures.Lastly, probably one of the biggest complaints that will be fielded against TFS - it's short. Like 8hrs short and even less for veterans of the series. The game is satisfying but it follows a very predictable path with zero surprises or plot twists. I was tempted to give the game a lower rating based on this factor alone, but the game is solid enough. Just don't expect anything that you don't see coming from a mile away.Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands is definitely worth playing even if the adventure is a bit predictable and short-lived.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000085AHJ","description":"In the open-ended space action/adventure gameFreelanceryou play a ne'er-do-well with a lucky streak, one of two survivors of a space disaster. Penniless and shipless, you venture around a space dock until you find a ship and a job. You'll encounter a heady mix of canned missions that follow one main quest, and a million opportunities to make money or aggravate the various factions that co-exist in the universe. Like an online role-playing game, or Bethesda'sMorrowind, you determine who your enemies are and who your friends are by your own actions, and, in another nod to role-playing, you can customize your ship with guns, rockets, and equipment just as you would customize a RPG character with swords, bows, and magic items. Best of all, you can play cooperatively with friends or fight it out with enemies online.The backstory posits a future where various countries, divided by both nationality and, seemingly, race, have boarded massive colony ships and ventured into a wormhole that appeared within reach of our crude space technology. They found themselves in a galaxy far, far away and they got stuck there when the wormhole collapsed. They quickly colonized new home worlds and named everything with familiar locales that make navigation a breeze. In the American sectors you'll feel at home entering the New York system and landing at a spaceport called Manhattan, for example. While contrived, this device is used beautifully and it's far better than having to memorize a bunch of sci-fi names and remembering where they are, perfect for a massive universe such as this one.ThoughFreelanceris set in space, it is technically not a space simulation. The game was designed to be accessible to casual gamers. For example,Freelancermakes you use the mouse for ship control. This is quite a shift for a game genre normally known to require joystick control. But even old-schoolWing CommanderorX-Wingfans may find that the sacrifice of verisimilitude is made up for with gains in agility. The mouse controls your guns, while you use the keyboard to maneuver around the rich universe that developer Digital Anvil has constructed. Much like a first-person shooter, you can dodge and weave while precisely blasting your enemies.Despite the game's age, its graphics are spectacular, as is the sound and voice acting, and in that way, fighting and trading with friends or alone,Freelancerproves worth the wait. Just keep in mind that it is explicitly not a hardcore space simulation, and you'll have to leave your joystick on the shelf.--Andrew S.

Games such as Privateer have always carried a silent diehard following.  I know plenty of people that still rank those types of games as their favorite titles in gaming history. My gaming history is different though and I have never played any of these popular &quot;space-trade&quot; titles, so I started playing Freelancer without bias.  Based on that, I've got to admit, I loved the game!  I'm an RPG fan first and the story in Freelancer is one of the best sci-fi stories I've played through.  I would compare it to Starcraft. Flying through space is a heavy part of the game but space flight is easy enough with your mouse and keyboard.  If you'd rather have a game that requires you to use the latest flight stick with twenty buttons and switches, this is not the game for you. Freelancer is more about story and adventure than sophisticated space flight. My only complaint about the game is that it sometimes gets a little too repetitive and if you can't find creative ways to earn money through trading, you might become bored with the numerous private contract combat missions. The best missions are battles that are part of the game's story and some can be quite a challenge.

I played it so much that my dad broke the CD along with Warcraft 2 telling me that I can't play any games from now on. So I recently bought Starcraft Battle Chest Secretly (my dad doesn't know that I have this game) again. This game is so good because the system requirements are so low that I can turn off the game without turning off the whole computer. My dad leaves on the PC the whole time so I have to leave it on all the time. If I turn off the whole computer, he might suspect that I have been playing a computer game. I always play when he goes to some place until I hear a keychain or a footstep. I probably disconnect off the game more than any other players on the planet. This is not about the game but I just wanted to share it with you (every game that I own, my dad doesn't know that I have). Now, I'm going to talk about the game. The requirements are no problem unless you haven't bought a new computer since 1998. The gameplay is great and the graphics and sounds are good. The best part of all is the Battle.net. You can play 7 vs 1 comp stomp when you are in a hurry and play 4 vs 4 experts only when you have nothing to do. It is very addictive to play with others online and it it keep you entertained for hours everyday. If you want wins, play lots of comp stomp but it will not raise your skill as much as in expert games. I assure you that this game will keep you entertained. This is one my favorite RTS of all time and I highly recommend this game just as much as I recommen Warcraft 2 and 3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2004"}

It's pretty much accepted amongst serious RTS enthusiasts that Starcraft is the gold standard of the genre.  As many other reviewers have mentioned, this game is polished, incredibly well balanced, and a lot of fun to play.  Both the single-player and multi-player features are enjoyable (pretty amazing that you can still get games on battle.net, considering that this is product is ten years old), and Blizzard still provides patch support for the game.  The included strategy guides are rather small, unfortunately, and are difficult to read, but they aren't particularly good anyway, so it's no big loss to not read them.What makes this game so great?  This game doesn't have the flashy graphics of modern games, but that's not an issue, since the units are distinctive and possess clean, crisp animations.  The unit count for each faction is less than most RTSes - but every unit (this is no exaggeration) has a distinctive role at every phase of the game.  No unit is obsolete in the end-game, not even the lowly zergling.  As a result, this game makes you seriously think about what kind of army you want to field and how you use it in combat.  The mix between battle tactics (micro), base management (macro), and strategy is unlike that in any other game.Incidentally, this game is still incredibly popular in South Korea, with the top professional players earning hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.  It is primarily due to the enthusiasm of the Koreans that this game has had its amazing longevity.  Not only has their support kept this game on the international gaming stage, but has allowed professional players to develop new and innovative strategies.  As a result, it's impossible to ever master this game.  There's always something to improve on, and better players to compete with - which are both marks of a truly great game.  Even though casual players will never directly interact with the top professional players, the pros keep the game fresh and exciting for everyone.This really is a great time to buy Starcraft - the price is reasonable, there are still many people who play this game, and the community has been revitalized by the announcement of Starcraft 2.  Long story short, if you don't own Starcraft, and have even a passing interest in strategy games, you owe it to yourself to buy this product.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000056KDW","description":"After making a name for himself with horror classics such asThe  Damnation Gamenovel,The Books of Bloodshort-story collection, and  the feature filmsHellraiserandCandyman, Clive Barker has slowly  moved away from the horror genre toward more fantasy-centric work. Barker hasn't  completely forgotten about his first love, however, andClive Barker's  Undying, a first-person action game from Electronic Arts and DreamWorks  Interactive, beautifully captures the type of horrors that populated Barker's  earliest works. And not only is this game genuinely frightening, it's also a lot  of fun to play.Cast against the backdrop of Ireland in the year 1923,Undyingfollows  Patrick Galloway, an investigator of the paranormal. Galloway has been summoned  to Ireland by his old war buddy Jeremiah Covenant to put an end to the strange  occurrences at the Covenant family estate. What Galloway finds is a house of  horrors that is populated with Jeremiah's dead siblings (and other ghastly  creatures), all of whom want to snuff out Jeremiah so they can complete a spell  cast when they were children.Graphically,Undyingis first rate. TheUnreal Tournamentgraphics  engine has been used to great effect and the result is amazing character models  and environments. The haunted mansion is suitably dark, with wispy draperies and  macabre paintings. The estate's grounds are a mix of lush Irish countryside and  crumbling ruins, all set against vivid skies.Pretty pictures aside, the most impressive thing aboutUndyingis its  atmosphere--this game is flat-out scary. Every element of the game, be it the  gothic architecture, eerie story, great weather effects including rain and  lightning, or amazing sound effects, perfectly complement each other. The result  is a gameplay experience that rivals theResident Evilseries in terms of  generating sheer terror in the player.The great atmosphere isn'tUndying's only innovation--it also features a  very cool two-handed attack system. Most action games saddle the player with an  attack system where one hand controls all the weapons and the other hand does  nothing. InUndying, the left hand (and left mouse button) controls the  standard weapons, such as the pistol and shotgun, while the right hand (and  right mouse button) casts spells. This is a great gameplay device and ensures  the action stays at a frantic pace.Of all the spells in the game, the coolest is the Scrye spell. When cast, it  lets the player see and hear past events--some of which are quite  horrific--and  occasionally it shows you how to progress beyond a certain level. This help can  come in the form of highlighting certain objects or unveiling a portal, but  whatever the method it is a very well-designed gameplay element.The only real complaints withUndyinginvolve the long loading times  between levels and the system requirements, but even those aren't enough to  derail this excellent--and terrifying--action game.--Kilmic RobbinsPros:Very, very creepyAmazing sound effectsExcellent graphicsSlick controlsCons:Long loading timesStory is a little convoluted","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Great atmosphere is hampered by a slow pace","reviewText":"The Good: Lots of gore! Great story, cool weapons and spells, creepy atmosphereThe Bad: Extremely slow pace, flat, boring, and lifeless visuals, unforgiving difficultyI came into Undying with high expectations from what I've heard of the game and they were easily brought down fast. While the game creates a scary atmosphere and the story is original...it takes FOREVER for it to pick up and the shooting is the same thing over and over. You have plenty of neat weapons and magical powers but most of them are rendered useless. The story goes along the lines of a man named Patrick who has to help and old friend out who released a curse when he was a child. You have to investigate this curse and find out what was really released.While this is good and all the game takes forever to tell the story and makes you just want to stop playing for good. The graphics are bad for today's standards. Using the Unreal Engine 1.0 the game tries to create a creepy and scary atmosphere, which it pulls off, but in the end brought down due to its poor graphics. While there are older games that have good graphics even for today; Undying's are just lifeless, flat, and boring. The game is ultra gory with skeletons ripping your heart out and eating it, Howlers ripping your head off and eating it...it's a bloody sight indeed. Also, with the extreme difficulty it makes you want to hate this game even more. Ammo and health are scarce even on the easy setting.This was of course when EA had balls and released games such as Thrill Kill, American McGee's Alice, and this game. If you can stomach the poor graphics and slow pace then Undying is for you. If you played this game back in 2001 then it would have been wonderful.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYILE","description":"","reviewerName":"BillofGoods","summary":"GTA meets Midnight Club LA","reviewText":"Overall a good game ........ story mode is not as in depth as GTA4 which in my opinion was great.  The multiplayer on the other hand is a big improvement.  I have not finished either mode yet because I tend to to do a lot of exploring and sidequests. The graphics seem much better and the city feels alive.  Where I think the game really shines is in the activities available. I enjoy playing Golf, Tennis and even doing some deep sea diving for treasure. Rockstar was outstanding in these areas.Probably the biggest disappointment (maybe the only complaint) from me are the cops which are pretty awful. Rockstar games has failed miserably here ......  it was obvious to me that the police are either too difficult to get away from or they are extremely easy to beat. I have found some instances where I can be in an area and literally go on for hours with a 5 star wanted level because of constant &#34;respawning&#34;.  While Rockstar games advertised the police as relentless I think they failed to use the right term. I would classify them as &#34;ridiculous&#34;.  I prefer being chased as opposed to being &#34;outspawned&#34;. The funniest thing I discovered is that you can fly a helicoptor as high as you can go and the police can't reach you, YET they can fire at you and shoot you down while you are hovering far above them. I was thinking how can they fire perfectly straight up out of a helicoptor ? Thats some blade on that chopper !!  Try it and you'll see what I am talking about. I fear Rockstar copied the same AI from Midnight Club LA and failed to fine tune it. Its just a failure IMHO.If you've played Midnight Club LA this game will have a VERY familiar feel to it, in fact it feels more like MCLA than it does GTA. How do I know ? ..... I own MCLA and it is also a Rockstar game. If your a fan of the series its a must have but I feel a little let down considering they spent 5 years developing this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUO","description":"Players can add cool new features with the Card e-Reader or link up with friends for multiplayer adventures with the original Mario Bros. game.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"One of the best games ever, and it's over 15 years old","reviewText":"Very few games define classic. Many of the Marios can be classic(except I hate part 2 and only \"liked\" Sunshine), Mario 3 can definately be called a classic. Released waaaay back on the old NES system, many people were spellbound by the gameplay and the mechanics of having multiple suits and power-ups, expanding on the flower and mushroom power-ups.Story: Ha, you're expecting a story in a Mario game? It all boils down to one sentence: there's trouble in the Mushroom Kingdom and Mario must save the day. That's it. To do that, he must clear at least 90 stages and face many enemies.Graphics: It's NES so they're not exactly that great but in the end you just don't end up noticing. It's certainly an improvement from 2 and the different worlds are nicely detailed but face it, you don't play an old-school game for the graphics.Sound/Music: Back when Nintendo re-released Link to the Past on the GBA, they added some voice clips from the N64. Well same thing with Mario 3, when Mario gets a power-up he goes \"just what I needed\" and it's slightly annoying but since you're not gonna get power-ups one right after another it's not as troublesome.Gameplay: The most important aspect of a game and Mario 3 certainly delivered. Adding to the list of power-ups is the Leaf, giving Mario a tail and ears, allowing him to fly. Also added is the Hammer suit, capable of throwing hammers, the Tanooki suit which is similar to the Leaf but allows Mario to turn into a statue briefly, making enemies ignore him. Also is the frog suit which is more better suited at swimming and the oddly-popular shoe which allows safe passage over some terrain and stomping enemies.The world is separated into 8 sections and like many-a Mario game, it's got a theme. There's a desert area, a sky area, the favorite \"big world\" with large enemies, an ice world and so on. Also included is different special areas, such as a mix-and-match where you have to match a whole picture of a power-up, a memory based card game where you flip cards that have to match(2 tries? that's really stupid) and a game of picking 1 of 3 chests.By the way, this game can get incredibly frustrating. The first couple of levels are not that big of a deal but later levels will seriously drive you up the wall. World 6(ice world) and one stage on World 7(pipe/maze world) seriously made me yell in frustration.As an added bonus, the game comes with the original Super Mario Bros where you have to bump the ceiling of different floors and kick enemies. Simple yet effective. Then when you're done, you can go back to Mario 3.P.S Don't ask about the E-Reader stuff since I don't have one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2005"}

From all the prievews i saw and all the hype i figured it was just another over rated fps and the grahpics and enemies looked lame. But now that i rented this game and gave it a shot im very happy with it, they improved the grahpics and they are very good and also the enemies look uniqe and scary. This also has a very good story line with  a fresh feel.The story is prety simple but good , you are an outlaw cowboy who robs trains in the west and you are very good at it until you make one big mistake and jack the wrong train,you end up releasing the original vampire and the most powerfull of them all he can resurect the dead and control them all. The only thing that saved humanity from the undead was the dark whatch for years but when Jericho releases lazarus from a train caried by dark whatch he unleashes hell on earth and he also becomes half vampire after being biten by lazarus himself.SO its your job to save the world and kill lazarus which will bring down all the other undead with him. But you will need the help of the dark whatch and also become an agent for them which is when the fun realy starts and you realy look like a bad ass. A very fun feature was the choice of good and evil for some things such as saving souls and drinking human blood, i chose mostly all the evil ways because it was funner and the evil side has beter powers to unlock through the game. SO this is just no average fps its very fun unique and has many good features and game play and also very fun online play which was a surprize. This game is not perfect tho it tends to get a litle boring at times when wave after wave of vampires come but it makes up for it later .Think of this game as a mix of red dead revolver and blade.This game is great and one of the best games to come out in a while seeing how this is a very bad time for games . So my advice rent it and have fun i wouldnt say its worth the 50 big bucks so rent it or wait a lil while till its cheaper but try it out soon because its very fun and something difrent instead of the same old fps's .

Back then I thought it was amazing as it was my first taste of the PS3s possible processing power, however, I was wrong. Pretty as it looked, like most beautiful people in the world, they tend to lack any sort of substance or personality that makes you want more and after a few races, I was left wanting a change of scenery. Apart from the beautiful surroundings and realistic driving tracks and environment interraction, there simply wasn't much to this game to keep me playing or want to download its further content. One thing I will say about the first game to sum it up for you is, the light's on, the pretty lady's looking at herself in the mirror, but there's nothing going on upstairs.Going from that I can tell you about my experience with the sequel, and let me tell you it's a very, very good one. It's a rarity of today, but Pacific Rift is the pretty lady once again, yet she's gone back to school and gotten herself an education, and now she has much more to keep me amused than just a pretty face. There's so much more to Pacific Rift I don't know where to begin or how to approach my beginning. I can only really split this review into three informative parts that give you an all round view of the game and what it has to offer.The Gameplay: One thing that I really hated about the original Motorstorm is the overall controls and racing aspects. The controls were stiff and at times I felt myself really forcing the controller button down to turn a corner as my vehicle wouldn't seem to react. I understand that different vehicles handle differently in alternate terrains, but the way the original handled was simply ridiculous. This has been totally revamped for the new installment and now the vehicle controls seem a lot more responsive, even with the different terrain handlings.The Effects: Well what can I say about the effects? The only thing I can really say is they're just as good, if not better than the first. That pretty idiot you once knew hasn't only gone back to school, but she's also gotten herself a face lift. She's prettier, easier and more enjoyable to play with as a whole which makes me want more and more. I'll admit that when playing the game, I'll have about 2 races and turn it off, but I'll always go back as I can't get enough. The Island terrain presents beautiful beaches, detailed jungles and frighteningly aggressive volcanic areas but you need to watch that you don't fall in. The interraction of your vehicles with the terrain is also something brilliant and must be witnessed. Depending on the size of your vehicle will depend on how you interract with the plants and other such jungle items. Say if you're in a Monster Truck, you can plow through the larger bushes and even knock down some trees to make your way to the finish. However, if you're on an ATV and you drive into the same bush plowed by a monster truck, you're going to find yourself in the water.The Features: The different vehicles are aplenty in this installment as it contains all 7 original vehicle classes along with a new class of monster trucks. Now, one thing I need to tell you is that although this essentially contains 8 vehicle classes it basically contains just 8 vehicles. The only difference between your monster truck and the guys you're playing against is the look of them. You can choose what your vehicle looks like on the outside, but depending on its class, they're all the same underneath. I suppose to some this could present a more challenging experience when in a race featuring all of the same vehicle, yet I would have appreciated if you had ATVs with different handling specs. Say if they had different companies developing different ATVs which could have allowed for a performance tune up feature.This also contains the classic festival where you engage in a number of different races with different challenges, such as wreck limits or completion times. There doesn't seem to be that many tracks which is a little disappointing, however the detail in the tracks is immense and something that makes the game worth it in of itself. The trophies system recently implemented through the PSN allows for a higher replay value as you want to achieve all trophies to obtain the coveted platinum trophy.This is a wonderful game which everyone will enjoy. It's likely that if you liked the first, you will like the sequel and it's also likely that if you didn't like the original, you will still like this installment. Buy it or rent it, either way you must have this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I092MM","description":"Past Mario games have let the blue-suspendered hero roam around fully rendered 3D landscapes. Now, for the first time, players can see true depth of their environment without the need for special glasses. Super Mario is a 3D evolution of classic Mario platforming featuring new level designs and challenges.","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A strange yet amazing compilation of Mario's history, plus 3-D","reviewText":"It's pretty amazing how successful Mario has been for the 25+ years he has been stomping Bowzer and his army of koopas in order to save Peach. Each Mario release is hailed as a veritable masterwork in the platforming genre, both in 2-D and in 3-D. The reason I say it's amazing because Mario games have all essentially boiled down to the joy of two simple things, running and jumping. Sure there has been a lot of additions to this formula over the years, additions like suits, triple jumps, long jumps, and other things, but it's all on the backbone of traversing the magical Mushroom Kingdom through running and jumping. Super Mario 3D Land does not change this, it never needed to, *but* it does provide quite a few changes to what you'd expect from a Mario platformer. Prior to release, it had a lot of pressure on its shoulders to be the premier \"killer app\" that would prove the 3DS' worth as a game developed specifically for the system. Let me just say right now, Super Mario 3D Land definitely succeeds in that endeavor, but honestly, this is a fantastic Mario platformer, period.Do I really need to cover the story here? With some very rare, unusualexceptionsand the Mario RPG games, Mario games have always been about the Italian plumber embarking on a quest to free his Princess Peach from the evil clutches of the Koopa King Bowzer. Nothing is different here. The only thing that stands out is the fact that a tree full of Tanooki leaves releases them into the wind and now Bowzer and his minions will, for the first time, utilize power-ups for their own nefarious use as well as Mario. The story is virtually non-existent here, but that's ok. \"Stories\" in Mario games have always fulfilled their purpose of giving context to the gameplay and then letting that take over, and it does so here.The gameplay in 3D Land is both a jam-packed package of nostalgic concepts from Mario's history, most notably his 2-D outings from the NES and SNES days, and a game where he seems to continue his momentum of reaching ever forward, as seen in the stellarSuper Mario Galaxy 2. Of course, Mario's masterfully intuitive, excellently implemented platforming controls are here. You'll be running, jumping, wall jumping, etc. You won't be triple jumping, however, which was jarring at first. The suit system makes a return, and so does the Tanooki suit fromSuper Mario Bros. 3. New suits, like the Boomerang Bros. suit, the helicopter block, as well as the 3D iteration of the Tanooki suit, all feel so good to use, and in the form of the hovering jump of the Tanooki suit, can really make the game easier, which is nice. Old returns like the fire suit are also implemented well in this new 3D environment. The level design is exceptional and the journey to the end pole is so fun and satisfying!Playing this game really feels so nostalgic. In fact, almost everything in the game is really reminiscent of the classic 2-D masterpieces,Super Mario Bros. 3in particular. It's hard to explain, but imagine your favorite, most masterfully designed Mario Bros. 3 levels, but from Mario's perspective and made into a full 3-D environment. Toss in familiar Tanooki and Fire suits. Remember the classic songs and art design, and re-imagine them with a Super Mario Galaxy 2 quality makeover. Also toss in the linear, flagpole objective from the originalSuper Mario Bros.game, as well as the type of Bowzer fights that classic offered. Add all of these classic ideas to the more modern 3-D platforming mechanics and that's a pretty good idea of the sort of experience this game offers. Personally, I adore it all. Sure, we've seen many of these ideas before, but never in such a weird, Frankenstein-esque combination. Despite all the familiar ideas, this game felt strikingly fresh playing through, and that is high praise indeed. It's quite large too. I played through the main quest, about 8 worlds, but after beating it, another 8 worlds open up, as well as a new quest to save Luigi from Bowzer's grasp. This latter half of the game is a lot more challenging than the first half. A lot of value here.The art design here is what you'd expect from a Mario game. It seems to take to the style first seen inSuper Mario Galaxyand continued in its sequel. The implementation of this imaginative, aesthetically pleasing design is absolutely incredible. This game looks really, REALLY good. Imagine a portable GameCube (which is essentially the type of power the 3DS has) utilizing that sort of art design, with 3-D added in, and you get a fantastic game. Speaking of 3-D, this is some of the best I've seen on the system yet. This is the first truly great game where the 3-D is actually quite essential to successfully traversing the world and clearing trials, and the way that is put into effect is both clever and a delight to behold. I'm very impressed here. Sure,Ocarina of Time 3DandStar Fox 64 3Dhad fantastic 3-D effects, but not to the point where it was absolutely essential to enjoy the experience to the fullest. This game really pulls through on fulfilling the 3DS' third-dimensional promises.The sound and art design is, much like the rest of the game, full of nostalgia. Some of the original effects from the old NES classics appear with no changes whatsoever. Others are reimagined using more modern sounds. Same can be said for the music. I've recognized several OLD classic Mario tunes (especially Mario Bros. 3) that really sent me back in time and that was truly a joy for me personally. You just can't beat the classics. :)All-in-all, Super Mario 3D Land is a triumph, not only for the 3DS, but for Mario in general. It not only lives up to the tremendous expectations put upon it to be the \"killer app\" of the 3DS, it greatly exceeds it. Made by the same champion Nintendo EAD team that created the masterpieceSuper Mario Galaxy 2, this game continues in their momentous trend of putting out mind-blowingly stellar games. I love Mario as a series, I expect the highest value from its games, and yet this entry actually surprised me in its exceptional quality. So if you have a 3DS and your library is lacking, get this game immediately. If you are a moderate-big-huge fan of Mario (Personally, I fall under the \"huge fan\" category) and want a great new Mario experience, get this game. If you're a fan of extremely fun video games, period, get this game! You won't regret it. Buy it, run and jump through it, and enjoy its incredible combination of nostalgia and industry trailblazing!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2011"}

Do you want to go in with guns blazing? Sneak in from the rooftop and catch everyone by surprise? How about the sewers? There might be a secret entrance down there. Walking in through the front door's another option, but the reception might not be so welcoming. Talking your way inside might help matters, as well.These are just some of the decisions that you'll be faced with during one mission out of many. And there are many. And each decision is not some throwaway thing; they'll have consequences, some good and some unfortunate. In a sense, this game's about digging your own grave, and whether or not you lie in it or chuck someone else down there in your stead.The game follows Adam Jensen, the chief of security for a multi-billion dollar corporation that specializes in making artificial limbs and enhancements (called \"augments\") for the world at large. After an attack by cyborg terrorists, Jensen is left for dead, but his employers decide to make him the near-future equivalent of the Six Million Dollar Man. It's back to work as usual, though over the course of the story, details concerning a conspiracy arise, leading Jensen to try his hand all sorts of things (player's choice) including corporate espionage to find the truth.His quest will send him running across two major quest hubs, Detroit and Shanghai (and several minor hubs, but they'd probably spoil things), and both are very well realized. They're huge, detailed, and allow for a more-than-decent amount of exploration. They're also completely gorgeous and immersive.Without having played the original DEUS EX, the only game I can really compare DE:HR to is Obsidian'sALPHA PROTOCOL, with its emphasis on choice and a very dynamic storyline. Unlike the MASS EFFECT series, the entire story will play out very differently depending on your choices, some of them as inconsequential as just talking to someone. I was surprised by how many things came back around to bite me, and all but forced me to treat every decision seriously. Because of this, entire sidequests opened and closed, and there were many parts of the game that I never even saw (not for lack of trying). DE:HR absolutely demands to be played more than once.And this is something that it can hold over ALPHA PROTOCOL (though I do love that game), it's very fun to play. Combat is as dynamic as you want it to be. Lethal, non-lethal, melee, stealth, and you can even hack turrets and robots to do the fighting for you. There are very few times when your preferred method of combat (or pacifism) will not be accommodated. It would be difficult, but I'd wager that there's a way to get through the game (excluding the boss fights) without even firing your weapon. (Probably wrong on that, but still, I'd still take that bet.)However, I do have one major criticism: the boss fights. Yes, there are actual boss fights in this game, which was completely shocking. And it's not like the FALLOUT series, where you can usually talk your way out of them or use your skills to get around them somehow. Nope, you'll be tossing aside whatever role-playing strategies you've been adhering to so you can gun down some bosses. I wouldn't be so opposed to them if they actually had some character (even the receptionist at the police station had more depth than these guys), but they're just a band of stereotypical brutes. Which is so odd, because the rest of the game is most definitely not cliche. They just stick out very plainly in comparison to the rest of the game. (Especially to those who chose to augment into stealth and hacking!)I have other criticisms like the handful of NPC animations and iffy lip-synching. It reminds me ofALAN WAKE, a game with so much dialogue and poor lip-synching. Thankfully, they don't get in the way of the overall experience; after a bit, I didn't even notice them. In between the amazing story and worldbuilding, the combat (the sneaking, in my case), and the stop-and-think decisions, animations were the last thing on my mind. Though, it would be nice if those were fixed in future games.Basically, this is the game that western RPG enthusiasts have been waiting for. MASS EFFECT and FALLOUT fans will definitely find something to like here - since it's sort of a happy medium - with its emphasis on role-playing as much as possible, in as many ways as you can think of. It's not only a great RPG, but it's also a worthy meditation on the future of human \"advancement.\" There's just a lot going on here!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2011"}

You have an awesome beam katana that you can hack and slash people with but hitting the A button and locking (and blocking) with the Z button. when your opponent's life is all the way down an arrow pops up on-screen telling you which way to swing the Wiimote and either slicing his head off with tons of blood spewing or even slicing him in half.

Then after you do a job you can play in assassination missions to earn even more money. There are also customization options such as dressing Travis up to making new weapons.

Not In My Opinion.","reviewText":"PGR 3 is a game that will not overwhelm you in terms of features. There are only 80 cars and many of them are widely unknown. That said, the graphics are definitely next gen. Shading and light are magnificently combined with sharp, crisp lines and an overall very realistic game. In fact, if you look in the mirrors of the cars you can actually see the real background going past. With five distinct camera viewpoints one will definitely suit you. Physics are sort of realistic, but seem rather simple; most likely based on weight and power. Something that impressed me was the engine sounds; they were considerably different from car to car, but still need some work on the V8 vehicles. You start out with 85,000 credits and have the choice of some ten to fifteen cars at first.It is clearly an arcade style game and I hate to compare it to the Gran Turismo series, but to me it is a standard which pretty much every other racing game is held to. It falls well short. A kudos system is still used as was in the first and second PGR, which is a thing that when you do powerslides and other crazy driving you get kudos points which I'm not really sure what they do. The only thing I can gather is some of the races involve getting a large amount of kudos in order to finish. I think that is ludicrous-it is a racing game not tokyo street drift. There is an online mode where you can watch other people race or race them yourself. I do not subscribe to xbox live, but I imagine this adds another valuable dimension to the game. In the solo career mode you start with a couple of cities and different challenges are afforded to you-speed camera, cone challenge, street race. There are five game difficulties: hardcore, hard, medium, easy, beginner. For each successive difficulty you gain more credits for completing the challenges.What I have a problem with is the fact that a car that costs 50,000 credits drives faster and manuvers better than the 300,000 credit Ferrari. The second thing I see wrong with the game is the actual cars. Makers of PGR3 only put cars on the game that have a top speed of 170 mph. That is good and all but you feel kind of like basically Ferrari and Lamborghini are using the game as an advertisement. I would say 25% or more of all the cars on the game are just these. Of course they are amazing race cars but I want to see some more cars that I have heard of. There are plenty of amazing cars electronically limited which I'm sure could easily top out and 170 mph or better. Maybe it is just because I'm used to simulation games where you have fifty car makers are able to customize everything from the air filter to the muffler for more power. What was done most poorly on PGR3 was the illusion of speed, everything seems slower than it should. In the end the game is fun but falls short of what I expected. What I would do to improve the game is add more car makers, better known cars and at least the ability to upgrade the engine. Overall I would give it a 7 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2006"}

I remember the first time it came out, how it's graphics, music and gameplay really amazed me. Sadly, very few games came after it to give much competition. To this day, it still remains one of the best N64 games out there. The sheer scope of the game is enough to pick it up. It's made up of 20+ levels that can be played in a semi-non linear order. The graphics are bright and clear, and the animations are creative for each character. Gameplay is pretty deep, but extremely intuitive and becomes second nature after playing for a short time. The real plus in this game is the music, some of the most catchiest to be written for a game to date. Pick this one up for both its historical value and for the fact that its a great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2001"}

Morales","summary":"The BEST Screen Protector, BUT WATCH A VIDEO INSTRUCTIONAL FIRST!!","reviewText":"This screen protector is without a doubt the best available for ANY electronic handheld device. EVERY handheld electrical, from the 3DS, to the Kindle, to the Nook, to the PS Vita NEEDS to incorporate the exact same application instructions and layout of this system. The application setup is very unique and is designed in such a way to ensure the absolute best seal, lint-free and alignment possible. The biggest problem is that upon first glance, the application directions are both intimidating and can be confusing to those who have never place a screen protector on before. This is not as simple as \"peel off backing and stick to surface.\" No, this one uses tabs on 2 edges used to hold down the protector, then has two seals, one on each side of the actual protector, each peeled off separately and SLOWLY, thus ensuring that not only does this thing fit on well, but also does it with little to no lint or dust whatsoever.It is the most annoying thing in the world to spend however amount of money on a screen protector, only to apply it wrong and not only have it still contain air bubbles, but also for it to have accidently trapped lint or dust in between the protector and the screen. The stuff will stick out like a sore thumb. The HORI protector as a method whose priority is to make dust or lint virtually near impossible to do.The basic application works the same for both 3DS screens. Remove yellow tabs to reveals two pertruding sticky surfaces that are supposed to be used to hold down the protector for the next step. Once the protector is properly aligned, a right tab is pulled and peels the BOTTOM of the protector (the one touching the screen) and the sticky surface of the protector can then adhere to the screen. You keep your finger along the protector as the thing is being peeled off, so that every millimeter that now touches the screen can adhere properly. Then once that is done, you smooth out any bubbles and another tab is on the right as well that peels off the top layer that is also covering the screen protector. This top layer exists so that when you stick the bottom portion on the screen, you can smooth out the bubbles with a card or whatever and not risk smudging the screen. A brilliant idea by the way. Anyway, so when the top portion is peeled off, you simply now have the screen protector on there itself.It is a difficult thing to explain in text, so do yourself a GIGANTIC favor and go to Youtube, and search \"HORI 3DS screen protector,\" and there are a couple of videos which slowly show how EXACTLY the thing works. I would do myself a big favor and not even worry about the packed in instructions in case of an emergency, or clear up anything you might be thinking of. But please, watch a video first, as you do need to see somebody affixing this in order for you to do it properly. Me? I did NOT watch a video first, so the top screen protector actually came out badly aligned and with 2 air bubbles that I could not smooth out. I took it off (keep in mind the removal of these protectors leaves NO marks or smudges of any kind, thank God), and now I had to order a second HORI set in order to get another shot at this again. Now that I know exactly how this functions, I know I will have a better chance of doing it right the second time.But big kudos for HORI for creating the best screen protector application system of ANY screen protectors on the market. Like I said, this system NEEDS to be used as a standard for all screen protectors for any device out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00309U0M6","description":"","reviewerName":"andrew806","summary":"Astonishing","reviewText":"Isaac Clarke, the unluckiest space engineer of the 26th century, is more unfortunate than ever in Dead Space 2. 2008's superb Dead Space took the style of survival horror shooter action exemplified by games like Resident Evil 4 and meshed it with an atmospheric deep-space setting and some terrific, distinctly sci-fi gameplay elements, creating something that felt simultaneously familiar and unique. Dead Space 2, on the other hand, will feel thoroughly familiar to those who have played the original; its few improvements over Dead Space are minor tweaks rather than game changers. But blasting the limbs off of hideous necromorphs remains tremendously satisfying, and although the pacing lags a bit during the game's middle portions, this second outing packs more than enough scares and surprises to make stepping back into Isaac Clarke's suit extremely worthwhile. In addition, a new multiplayer component successfully translates Dead Space's particular breed of dismemberment-focused combat into a pulse-pounding team-based experience that casts you as both humans and as the foul necromorphs. And, at least at the time of release, the PlayStation 3 version includes a hefty bonus: the great on-rails shooter Dead Space Extraction (previously a Wii exclusive), at no additional cost. As long as you've got the stomach for it, Dead Space 2 is one sci-fi horror thrill ride you definitely want to take.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}

You can't even play it.  You need a high-speed, always on connection in order to play this title (unless you want to wait for 4 hours on dial-up).  The heck with that trash, I spent $55 on this title - and I need Steam's permission each time I want to play it? Where was that on the box? Also not on the box is the fact that you have to wait in line for your turn to get permission - yes, this from the same company that had its source code hacked, so you can just imagine how reliable their servers are.  Apparently there is a way to play the game offline, but it doesn't work for everyone, and some people are being told by Steam/Valve that they have to disable their LAN's - no way!Note to anyone that hasn't opened the box - DON'T.  Unopened you can return it easily.  You open it and returning it is an entirely different ball game.So tell everyone that you can to stay away from this game, maybe when the dust settles they will release a patch that revokes the necessary Steam membership.

I just got done with Medieval II playing the Spanish Grand Campaign and...well, wow.Rome was a definate step-up in terms of the fun factor and graphics, but there was always those elements of the original Medieval that I missed - Namely, the diplomatic features and perhaps the era itself. The map is reminiscent of Rome: Total War, but it is broken up to reflect the medieval period.  Starting off you can only choose five factions - England, France, Spain, The Holy Roman Empire and ummm...Milan I think. However, when you beat the game it unlocks all the playable factions which is around 15ish.I won't really go into what is better over Medieval I to Medieval 2, because there is a large technological leap. It is better to make a comparison to Rome.  The graphics, by and large, remain the same with minor tweaks like making the trees sway on the campaign map, and the terrain will actually change as you farm and irrigate the land in your provinces.The most notable difference to me was it is harder than Rome. No matter what faction you play, it is going to be a challenge.  Any catholic faction you play puts you into contention with the Pope. Most of the popes don't like catholic countries fighting each other, so when I was at war with Portugal in the beginning I had them on their last province with my armies approaching and here comes his Popeness, \"Ahem...Spain, you need to stop. You are doing too well and might have an increased economy as well as hegemony over the Iberian pennisula. Sooo, stop or i'll excommunicate the lot of you!\" You can ignore his Popeness, but you recieve a severe penalty to the morale of your cities, you can have a crusade called against you (REALLY not fun) and generally upset every other catholic nation. This might not be such a big deal in the later stages of the game, but if you do it when you are starting out then you get a bunch of nutty crusaders at your doorstep (Thank you Saved Games).The time period is static. That is to say, you start in the 12th century and ends with the conquest of the New World. So, if you want to play with the later muskets, cannons and all sorts of goodies you need to play a very long game to get to the time period where the \"trigger\" comes into play of discovering gunpowder and its practical application to firearms.All of the playable factions are distinct, with their pluses and minuses. Each playable faction has a equal shot at conquering Europe, Asia and America. It really depends on your play style. If you like whittling away the enemy with arrow fire then England is a good choice. If you like slow, powerful calvary then France is a good choice and so on, and so on.It does have some minor flaws; some techinical hiccups here and there, but nothing game killing. I have a 3.2ghz Pentium IV, 1 gig of ram and a 6800 GT Nvidia graphics card.  No major problems.The AI is improved over Rome, but there is a few things to improve on such as the computer not charging you if he lacks missile troops. For example, I have 6 units of archers and 4 units of infantry and he has 8 units of infantry and no archers.  I hammer him until he has barely 100 guys and i'm out of arrows before he will make a move on me. Now, this is good for me because I win, but I really think the computer should say to itself, \"Hey, I have no missile troops. I'm going to charge him now!\"To wrap it up, let me just say one final note. I...Love...Cannons. This game is worth it to buy just to watch a row of cannons go off, the ground shake and men get thrown around like rag dolls at your volleys. It is most choice...Pros:- Solid Graphics- Fun Gameplay- Great tutorial (Just like Rome)- Distinct and varied voice-acting.- Lots and lots of replayability.Cons:- Minor AI tweaks needed","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2006"}

It has been nearly fifty years since Simon Belmont rescued the land from the curse of Dracula. Now it's Juste Belmont's turn as he must acquire the relics of Dracula left behind from the past in order to unravel the mysterious disappearance of his friend Lydie Erlanger. With a trusty whip at their side, players explore Dracula's castle under the cover of night collecting relics and learning powerful magic spells in their journey to find and rescue Lydie.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"The sequel to Circle of the Moon lands on the GBA","reviewText":"A year after the good, but flawed, Castlevania: Circle of the Moon was released on the Game Boy Advance, Konami went back to work and released its sequel (Harmony of Dissonance) in 2002. Fans of the Castlevania series quickly picked this up and hailed it as an excellent follow up to the first game. Harmony of Dissonance is a great game and deserves to be in everyone's GBA game collection.This time around you control Juste Belmont, a descendent of the famous Simon Belmont in his quest to collect Dracula's relics in order to save a friend of yours trapped in Dracula's castle. Just like the last game, you explore a brand new castle, filled with traps and enemies. Armed with your whip, you can acquire weapons and items to help you find your way while you level up, RPG style to become stronger. This game does away with the cards you collected from CotM and instead uses a \"Spell Fusion\" system: spells you now can collect around the castle and use them in conjunction with any weapon you possess for new ways to attack your enemies. Save your progress from using any of the save rooms in the castle or use the new quick save option to temporarily save your settings until the next time you play. The game gives you 3 separate save slots so you and your friends can save each one's progress.The PROS: HoD blows Circle of the Moon out of the water!!! Outside of the \"Spell Fusion\" system and quick save option, HoD plays similar to the awesome PS1/Saturn title, Symphony of the Night. That's right; the overall presentation, graphics, sound effects and animation are excellent and easily trumps the likes of CotM. Controls are of course spot on and for those who dread waiting to save until they reach a save room will welcome the quick save option with open arms. The \"Spell Fusion\" system adds more depth to the game play, making it cool to see what happens when you combine Juste's weapons with the spells you find. When you're done exploring the castle, you unlock another one so beating this game will take you awhile. Only by beating both castles will you be able to access the bonus modes.The CONS: The music. Castlevania games always excelled in this area as it is responsible for having one of the best game soundtracks in the history of gaming. It's not that the music doesn't follow in the same tradition because it's pretty good. The problems lies in that it sounds like you are playing one of the classic 8-bit Castlevania games. MIDI sounding tracks have replaced the orchestral and electronic/guitar riff combo tracks that are common place since Symphony of the Night. They really feel out of place here and you wonder if Konami intentionally did this or not. Those looking to hear what Konami did for the music will be somewhat disappointed by the results.Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance is easily better than Circle of the Moon. Playing and looking similar to Symphony of the Night, Konami has made another quality game that bears the Castlevania name with pride. While the music isn't up to par with the other games in the series, it still sounds good and doesn't drag down the overall quality of the game. For those who missed out on playing this game, be prepared to pay top dollar to get it new so you're better off buying it used if you can find it. It's a perfect game to play on the GBA so look for this one if you plan on expanding your game collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"This is how you do a remake!","reviewText":"Metroid: Zero Mission was released in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance and was one of the finest games ever made. It is a remake of the original NES classic, Metroid. For those of you who remembered playing the original all the way until you faced off against Mother Brain, this is the same game with 16-bit \"Super Metroid\" graphics and extra content that fleshes out the story for a complete adventure that could only come from Nintendo. This game debuted to critical praise and quickly sold like hotcakes. Now, it's time to see why this remake rocks.You control Samus Aran, a bounty hunter tasked with infiltrating planet Zebes and defeating Mother Brain, leader of the Space Pirates who threatens to take over space entirely. You must explore the different areas, collect various weapons and items, take out all the enemies and make your way to Mother Brain. Because it's a big game, Metroid: ZM features save rooms, map rooms, Chozo statues (to restock your missiles, bombs and point you in the right direction) and 3 save slots to record your progress. The weapons and items featured now come from virtually every Metroid game in the series so you will really be packing some serious power compared to the original Metroid game. And the story doesn't end with you defeating Mother Brain and escaping from the exploding planet (a brand new area has been added for you to explore and face off with an old but worthy adversary.)The PROS: Metroid: ZM has been given the upgrade treatment. It looks, plays and feels like Super Metroid but of course with the storyline of the first Metroid game. From the graphics to the weapons to the remixed background music, it fits well and the controls feel just right. Tons of visual and audio clues help you along the way so you know where to go next and the cut scenes, while basic, enhance the story as you play along. And now you don't need passwords to continue your progress; just head to a save room and then come back to the game when you take a break. Overall, it's a great experience.The CONS: There is one small issue that I must address and that is the difficulty. The original Metroid was challenging not only because of the length of the game but because it didn't have save rooms, maps or a reliable save system. You had to figure out which way to go and remember how to get to where you need to go solely by memorization; the remake helps you out in so many ways, it cuts down the challenge. Veteran gamers who grew up playing the classic Metroid will blow through this in a few hours while newcomers may take a little longer. It's not a major flaw by any means but it won't make you sweat when it comes to figuring out where to go and progressing into the game.The bottom line is, Metroid: Zero Mission is a great game and a great addition to the Metroid series. Fans of the classic NES title will enjoy passing their time with this game locked into their GBA while players who don't or haven't played Metroid games will find this is a great re-introduction to the franchise that is known worldwide nowadays. This is how you do a remake and Nintendo couldn't have chosen a better candidate. By any means, if you come across a copy of this game, pick it up immediately. *****HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*****","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2011"}

Romano \"Avid Gamer\"","summary":"Brother In Arms: Hell's Highway is a Great Game.","reviewText":"I have been waiting a long time for Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway to come out.  There have been numerous delays and the game was supposed to come out sometime last year.  Well it finally came out and I picked up the game yesterday from my local Game Retailer.The game follows up the first two Brothers in Arms games that came out earlier.  You play the role of Sergeant Matt Baker who leads squads of men through Holland during Operation Market Garden in September 1944 during World War II.  Operation Market Garden was the last German victory in Europe during the war.I think the game has a great story line.  The game in my opinion is very well done and acted out. It really shows what I think every soldier has to endure and go through during wartime.  It is very emotional and gripping.  You find out that soldiers have to make life or death decisions that can effect them the rest of their lives.  This game shows not only soldiers struggling through this conflict, but also Dutch civilians who were caught in the crossfire between the Allies and the Germans.If you are looking for a game where you make tactical decisions about how to fight battles during Operation Market Garden, this is it.  Your decisions can decide the life's of your soldiers under your command.The AI is very good in this game.  I read some game reviews from other gaming websites where the game reviewers were complaining about German Soldiers who were just standing around when you shoot at them.  First of all, you can now sneak up on German Soldiers to plan an attack without them knowing your there.  In other words, you can set up an ambush. You set up you and your squads where you want them to fight the Germans.  Of course the Germans are going to stand around if they don't know that you are there hiding.  Second you can now set up you and your men where the Germans are caught in a cross fire when you fire at them with your weapons.  The Germans get confused because there is no where to run and hide. So of course a lot of them are going to stand around because of the crossfire.  That happens in real life too.The graphics are real good in this game.  I understand the developers of this game went to actual locations around Holland and took thousands of pictures to make the game looked like Holland during World War II. That is very impressive.I think the game has a lot of replay value to it because the Germans react differently every time you play the game again.  Each time you try to figure out how you will fight different battles throughout the game. I recommend buying this game especially if you like playing World War II games like me.October 5, 2008UPDATE: I just finished playing Brothers in Arms: Hells Highway and I noticed a couple of things I wanted to update about this game. I'm a true gamer who likes to give honest opinions about the games I play. The above opinions were given when I was only half way through the game. Here are the updates.1. The graphics are great at the beginning of the game and toward the middle, but not at the end. It seems like the game developer got into a big hurry to finish this game and just threw in graphics from the \"Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood\" game into the end of this game. The trees and buildings at the end of game just look dull and not very detailed like at the beginning and the middle of the game. The game was already a year behind schedule and I'm sure the game developer got pressured into finishing the game as soon as possible. I was wondering why I never saw any game trailers that show any missions that were at the end of this game. Now I know why.2. None of the mission maps you play through are very big throughout the game. You play a little way through a mission and then you get a cut scene. That scenario plays over and over again throughout the game. Too many cut scenes and not enough playing time. If you want a comparison in map sizes, try playing Battlefield: Bad Company and you'll see what I'm talking about as far as map sizes go. Battlefield: Bad Company maps are a lot bigger with less cut scenes.3. Operation Market Garden was all about the Allies taking and holding major road bridges along Hell's Highway throughout Holland during World War II before the Germans could blow up any of the bridges. Well in the game I didn't see one major bridge shown in any missions. There is one small bridge in the game that goes over a small canal but I don't count that. I'm talking about big huge bridges over major rivers. I didn't see any at all. I was really disappointed. Why were there no major road bridges shown in the game? That is what Operation Market Garden was all about.4. There were lots of different vehicles used during Operation Market Garden by both the Allies and the Germans. In the game, I only saw one kind of Allied tank (Sherman Firefly) used in the game and one kind of German tank (Panzer IV) used. I didn't see any German Panther tanks, Tiger tanks, German Halftracks, German Volkswagen Kubelwagen, etc. I also didn't see any other American tanks or any British tanks of any kind. What is up with that?5. Not every mission in this game has you play with squads of men. In fact in some of the missions, you fight alone against the Germans. And in some missions you don't fight at all. Running through a building that is on fire is one of them. There is no shooting at all. I thought in every mission I would control squads of men.This game reminds me a lot of Medal of Honor: Airborne. That game could of been awesome too if it had of been done right. I remember that game went through a lot of delays just like Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway did and it came out about a year later than it was suppose to. Medal of Honor: Airborne was great the first few missions and then it went downhill the last couple of missions. This game is the same way. After playing the game, I'll have to change my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars. Sorry. I just feel this game could of been made better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2008"}

Launch titles usually are just a handful of games that kind of give us a taste of what the new console is capable of and nothing more. Kameo was just one of those games with beautiful graphics (for its time even) fun game play, and well that's about it. Kameo fails to develop a really good story and characters to be in that story, but what there works and it's enough to keep you hooked for the 5-6 hours you spend playing this.Kameo is an elf (they can fly now?) whose sister betrayed their kingdom and woke an evil troll named Thorn. The whole game is about you setting elementals free and using them to work your way to Thorn. There are 10 elementals all together and each of them are well designed and very unique in their own rights. Kameo is a platformer developed by Rare so you kind of know what to expect here. Surprisingly (for a Rare game) Kameo is fairly easy and the only frustrating moments are bugs or design flaws more than mechanical issues with controls or cameras. The game is peppered with collision detection issues and just overall errors. These don't hinder the play, but tend to make you more frustrated than you should be. Anyways, most of the game consists of you switching between these elemental creatures and using them to kill enemies and solve (simple) puzzles. For example the first elemental you'll get is Pummelweed; he is a plant who can go under ground and uppercut, and do jabs. You may need him to get under low hanging doors or walls or use him against specific enemies. A second creature you get is Ash; he is a dragon that came shoot balls of fire and you can use him as a flamethrower.Some enemies are more weak against him than others so there is strategy that comes into play here. Elementals can be changed on the fly via the four face buttons and attacks are done with the triggers. You can go into your Wotnot (book) and assign different creatures to your buttons. Of course you have to catch these creatures by finding shadow trolls and defeating them in a manner of throwing light trolls at it. Once the troll is defeated you absorb your elemental (and get an achievement!) Your main goal is to rescue your family members and this is down with epic boss fights (that can be TOO tough). At the end of each level you get to fight a huge boss that involves using certain elementals (usually the ones you've most recently captured).Now you can upgrade your creatures powers by finding fruits around the world or buying them with coins. These powers are needed to become more powerful and help you through the entire game. Of course finding all these fruits is nonsense knowing Rare so just finding the ones you come across is sufficient. The game also sports a co-op mode so you and a buddy can have at the baddies in this game, or you can do a time trial mode or a \"level-by-level\" mode where enemies get increasingly harder. I find all these modes uninteresting since once you beat the main game you'll be pretty sick of this game to begin with anyways. The game is very repetitive even though there are multiple creatures to play as they all end up being the same in the end.The only really awesome part is mowing down thousands of trolls with a charging horse in the Badlands (between levels you do this to save shield generators) which really showed off how many enemies can be shown on-screen at the same time. I have to admit though the enemy AI is pretty decent so don't get the game wrong there. There are some downloadable costumes for Kameo, but for some reason the game never recognized these I have no idea why. If you skipped out on this launch title I suggest you go pick it up for less than $10 pretty much anymore.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

At first, I found the missions kind of boring to watch, but after a few chapters, I found myself telling yelling at the screen (or Mike)! \"Don't go there.....You forgot to heal.....Use the sniper!!!\" Sometimes the battles could be frustrating, and when they took more than two tries, I'd get bored and leave the room to do something else.The characters are charming and compelling and the animation is beautiful.

{"product_name":"B002I0JAJ2","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Not worth the 12 year wait, but a fun romp nonetheless","reviewText":"The Good: Sexy, funny, and violent, interactive objects are unique, feels good to shoot everything, Duke's personality is intactThe Bad: Dated design, visuals, and overall feel, may be too offensive for some, hideously long load timesWell here we are. Duke and I staring at each other face to face after 12 years of development hell. How did he stand up? For starters the game isn't nearly as bad as everyone is saying. It's just not as good as everyone hoped. The game won't knock you off your feet or make you think differently about FPS games, but it does feel like classic Duke and that's what counts in the end. The story is the same as always: Pigcops and the evil Cycloid Emperor are stealing our chicks to make alien babies. Pretty cheesy? That's the entire point so don't come into this game thinking its just bad ass. The entire game is coated in thick gooey cheese and if you don't like it go away right now.The action is just like classic Duke in the sense that you run around shooting anything that moves with the biggest gun you can find. Its a recall of the heydays of FPS games from the early 90's and it feels good to play one that's actually good. The game even starts out with a slap in the face by having Duke pee in a urinal and you controls the flow. This is Duke for you and if this stuff offends stop playing there because it gets worse as the game goes on. My favorite part about Forever are the interactive objects which add to your Ego which is your health bar. Finding certain things in the game will boost this and there are dozens of them some funny, sexy, or just weird like picking up a turd out of a toilet.Duke is also infamous for his cheesy one liners and they are spewed left and right through the whole game. Things like \"Hail to the King baby!\", \"How many pork chops can I make out of you?\", \"Come get some!\" are just a few. Duke's personality is something you will either love or hate, but its classic and that makes me love it. The game is also infused with a lot of sex such as one whole level that is just a strip club you walk around in called Duke Nukem's Titty City. You have to do a treasure hunt for a stripper for a lap dance that consists of finding popcorn, a vibrator, and a condom. Just walk into the bathroom and Duke can enjoy the glory hole in the stall. Yes its very gratuitous and goes over the top, but that's what's great about this game. Not only this but it sticks it to a lot of pop culture of today such as an EDF soldier asking Duke if he needs power armor (it's Master Chief's armor in the ship) and Duke says \"Power armor is for pussies!\"Of course it all comes down to playing the game and the action is varied with driving sections, and even Duke getting shrunk down which is very fun to do especially when listening to his high pitched voice. A lot of classic Duke weapons are here such as the Devastator (with 69 bullets as a pun), Ripper, and RPG. The guns even look the same which brings back memories. Quick time events were added during boss fights (which are really fun) and during other parts of the game so it has a bit of cinematic juice in it.The worst part about the game? The looks. Sure it uses the Unreal Engine 3 but the level design and overall feel is really dated. Mountains don't have that nice distant real look to them. Instead you can drive right up there side like you're playing Motocross Madness 2 or something. The textures aren't low res but not very detailed like everything just got converted from 2005. The game actually looks that old, but not enough to distract you too much. The physics are wonky like you're playing a Nintendo 64 game, but you can't really blame the game itself.Overall Duke Nukem Forever is a fun game to play. It may not have been worth 12 years for this it still feels good to play as the King again. If you can surpass the dated visuals and overall design of the game you are going to experience something that will probably never happen again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it.

Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels.

For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall.

To that group, this review and the criticisms offered do not apply to you.  Move on to the next approving rave.  To the rest of you, some of which may, from time to time, enjoy single-player (maybe to train, maybe to relax...) but regard software gaming and broadband networks as a match made in heaven, read on...This game claims to be multi-player enabled, and technically it is, but it just plain sucks.  It drags on my (and many of my friends comparable systems) 3.2Ghz w/ 2Gigs of RAM 3MB Cable connection and the latest GeForce card.  Even if it didn't, the game supports no more than a half a dozen players at a time!  Calm down, I know that with the kind of rendering and interactivity with the environment this game offers, it would be impossible to offer silky smooth gameplay like, well, like YOU COULD GET ON ID GAMES MADE 10 YEARS AGO!  C'mon, ID, what were you thinking?I bet I know.  I think they thought they were a good game maker.  They never were, they've always been the best game engine makers; engines that had the ability to network large groups of people in stable and stunning (for whatever period in time they were released) environments.I think this is an example of ego stepping on an appreciation for core competency.  And what a shame.  I was at an E3 conference where I had the privilege of meeting John Carmack and hearing him speak about first person gaming.  I saw some evidence then that his glory days (at least w/ regard to game creation) were behind him.  He spoke dispassionately about game design, and about the future of it.  It was as though the huge leaps he helped spawn were no longer possible.  I (and many much more qualified than me to opine) disagree.  We are still not rendering photo-realism, nor do our games have destructable and relational environments.  I wish he were spending more time working on that than competing for the X Prize with his Armadillo Aerospace Company.But that's just the selfish gamer in me talking.Doom 3 gets us a major step closer to both photo-realism and destructable environments, for that, I'm appreciative.  However, rather than focusing on making the engine networkable, and selling to those who can focus on the actual game, they fished out a sacred title and spent way to much time trying to build a game that ends up selling more on hype and nostalgia than fun and replayability.Christian HunterSanta Barbara, California","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2004"}

I actually think this game is really fun. I didn't pick it up at first as I thought it was more a tactical RPG--and although I like that type I have become burned out on them and am holding off playing for a while.The graphics and music are very good. I love Anime type RPG. The controls work exceptionally well which is another plus. The turn based gameplay is quite fun. Enemy encounters are random sometimes--which I never mind in an RPG. They aren't as frequent as something like Final Fantasy I but you will encounter enough to level you up. You can use an \"auto\" fight feature which I found superb for regular enemies--and it cuts the amount of time choosing what you want your party to do. I would not call this title (I'm still fairly early in the game though) extremely difficult. This may change later but for now its fine.The menu in game is only so-so. I found it hard to purchase equipment and really tell if I should or not. It is kind of difficult to know whether you should when you don't know when a Party Member is going to leave. I'm not finding it too complicated in terms of figuring out where to go and what to do--and the map works fine.I actually like the story--its interesting. Now, for the voice acting. I would have to agree that this may be the worst VA I've ever heard. Actually it would be fair to say I've never heard anything like it. These actors talked so fast I seriously believe they paid them to have all the VA done in like an hour or something. It is unavoidably annoying and pulls this game down in rating for me. Although I didn't feel as strongly as some of the other reviewers the VA alone makes me consider removing one star. It is THAT BAD. Like nails on a chalkboard. Seriously.Overall though fans of more traditional turn based RPG will like this game. I have never played any other Suikoden titles so I can't relate it to the series (but others already have done that for you anyway). As far as RPG's go I'd probably give it 4.5 stars--but I really like the graphics, music, and gameplay so in the end I don't feel justified to subtract one star for the terrible rushed voice acting which does detract enough to matter but did not ruin the title for me in any way. I am still thoroughly enjoying it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2009"}

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Hard work but rewarding","reviewText":"I was almost put off buying this game due to all the available reviews saying how difficult it was. I eventually gave it a go when I picked up the special edition with the strategy guide and soundtrack, and I am very glad I did. But the reviews are fairly accurate.Demons Souls is an action RPG, which sees you as a warrior/knight/mage etc (you choose your starting type) trapped in limbo because the world has been overtaken by demons. Your job is to fight the monsters inhabiting various areas, kill bosses and earn experience. If you're considering playing it, let me explain why it's so difficult:The enemies are tough and clever. Even at the start, you'll realise that even the most feeble demon attacker can bash your brains out if you don't do something clever or move quickly. I spent a good while playing the very first area multiple times - by which I mean the large flight of stairs at the very start - before I dared go any further into the level, just to make sure I knew how to handle the controls. That's how cautious I was! Seriously, 2 or three hits can kill you in this game, and if they come close together there's no time to use any healing items. So you can drop dead at any moment if you don't take your timeThe most brutal aspect of all this is that you can't gain any experience unless you complete a whole level without dying. All the experience gained is in the form of \"souls\" released by monsters you slay, and just picking them up is not enough, you have to carry them with you through to the end of level and beat the boss before you can spend them on increasing your stats. That's a pretty tough rule....if you die at any point, you drop the lot and are returned to the start of the level again - with nothing.There is some comfort in the fact that if on your next attempt you make it to the area where you died, the pile of souls will be sitting on the floor waiting to be picked up again. So you can recover them...but only once. If you die before reaching that point, you lose them permanently. The idea seems to be that you practice, practice and practice again to ensure that you can get through a whole level in one go (the enemies always re-appear every time, and everything is always in the same place. So you really can go through many \"rehearsal\" runs before making a full trip - as long as you make it further each time.If that sounds too harsh, here are some factors that make things bearable: As you move through stages killing things, enemies do not re-spawn behind you. So if you work methodically, you can always retreat safely to the areas you have cleared out. Next, items picked up do not get lost if you die. So any hard to reach weapons and items are safe - it's just those all important souls that you lose. There's more: some extra dangerous enemies dotted around in a few levels only have to be killed once and they are gone for the whole game. That's a relief. And in my favourite gameplay element, some levels are circular, so you can often go a long way in and then open a shortcut that takes you right back to the start point. These shortcuts are also permanent, so next time you re-start, you can often bypass loads of misery and get to the end of level boss pretty fast. The very first level is the best for this, the gateway to the boss is right by the entry point, although it's only opened after a very long route around to reach a switch. What a relief that was, sadly later levels are not quite so generous, but to be honest nearly all of them have something similar.Of course, the other exceptional thing about Demons Souls is that apart from being freakin' difficult, it's also very addictive. The worlds you explore look stunning, filled with detail, both architecture and enemies, secret areas, breakable scenery etc etc. There are so many types of weapons, armour and magic skills that you can build your character up any way you like. Be fast and nimble and fight with ranged attacks, or wear strong armour (which makes you slower), and whack enemies close up with big swords. Or a bit of both.There is a story here but not much. You won't really care though, you'll probably be concentrating on how to make it from point A to point B alive. Some of the levels are more fun that others, my favourites are those set in the elaborate structures like the castle or a rather grim prison. The ones I have problems with are the levels that have way too many perilous walkways suspended very high up, where you can fall off to an instant death, which strikes me as a very cheap way to make the level more difficult to finish, because you can't attack (or be attacked) on them without risking slipping off the edge.The bosses in the game are suitably tough, although not actually the hardest parts of the game to get through. Some barely put up a fight, however a couple are way worse than anything else in the game (Flamelurker - I hate you). The best strategy to gaining levels seems to be replaying levels that you have finished and just stocking up on souls safely. There's no point in trying to make your first trip through a new level count towards stat building, in fact you might find you just scrape through and then revisit it multiple times after it's completed because all of the levels stay playable after being completed, they just don't have the boss any more.So this is a game for the player who takes things seriously. You simply can't breeze through this one, you have to allow time to consider levels, and sometimes you'll be moving very slowly. But the sense of achievement when you beat a boss is immense, and the levels all have secrets to uncover so you won't mind going through them several times. Be brave and give it a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2012"}

Young","summary":"I really like this one a lot!!!","reviewText":"Okay, I'm going to say it again...I really like this model a lot! I'd like to say first that I was very loyal to my 360 Pro (20GB) from '05. Then in the winter of '09 I replaced my hardrive with a 120GB HDD. I can say that the 360 console has been wonderful to me over the last 5 plus years. When the 360 S model was annouced back last year I began to itch to get it. I decide after talking with a few people who owned the 360 S models to just keep what I already had unless I really needed a new system, and that is exactly what I did. Now, lets fast forward to this fall...just 2 weeks ago I said I am going to get the MW3 Special Edition bundle with the 320 GB HDD. Well that did not happen, almost in the same instant my old loyal \"original white 360\" had the \"red ring of death\". The one thing I never had in the last 5 years...I wasn't upset at all, I just went out and purchased the newer model same day, a brand new 360 S model with a 250GB HDD.Now, what I can say is that I love this new console, I like the fact that it is much smaller than the older original model and looks more stylish and up-to-date than the original white one. I had no problems transfering my data over with a data transfer cable or recovering my gamertag and I like the quietness as well. As far as anything else it's all the same, just a newer pretty looking console with MORE HDD space. Like many of the other reviews have stated, unless you just have to have it...it can whait until you old one dies out. I think I like this one so much because I actually waited and remained loyal to my other one. It makes me feel better that I didn't just abandon my white console...lolHopefully this review can help others decide if they REALLY need a new 360 S model. I really think you will enjoy this more if you wait, UNLESS you do not already own one and then I saiy GO GET HER ASAP!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2011"}

Unfortunately lack of competition does mean that EA will not try as hard as they should, bringing us new features every year and every year the game does feel a bit recycled, but hey sometimes if it ain't broke--don't fix it.  If you been supporting the franchise for years, you will certainly enjoy it again.  For those who hated every Madden game since 1988, I can say with confidence that you will probably still hate it though.Franchise Mode is more fun than ever.  Even though I hate the fact that they removed the mini-games from pre-season, the free agent bidding is fun.  You get auction style listings with limited time for every free agent, which makes your eyes spin as everything happens so fast and makes you scramble for the players you want.  Rookie evaluation and scouting is also very strategic where you learn little by little on what your rookie's hidden stats with each game.  Preseason also including cut-lists, where you have to decide who gets cut and who stays.New dynamic play makes game more realistic than ever.  If your player is on a hot streak, they will continue doing well.  If for example, your player fumbles, they confidence plummets for a while and they are not as effective(They tend to cover up the ball as they are afraid to fumble again.)  This also insures that you get a unique playing experience pretty much every game.\"Be a Pro\" mode looks fun, but it feels very cheap as you easily get skill points which means your player will have 99 speed/acceleration in no time and the rest is history.  New Madden players will find this mode very attractive as it wouldn't be too hard for them.Madden Ultimate Team:  If you played this last year, you will enjoy it this year.  Trading (1 for 1) is now possible where you can trade with complete strangers.  Making a trade is just as easy as putting up your player on the auction block.  Just indicate who you want in return and receive potential offers as you decide whether to accept or reject an offer.Online play is still laggy to some degree.  Also as of the time of this review, whenever you start up a game against someone, it may take 30-60 seconds for the roster file to update, which breaks up the flow of the game.  This is backed up by the fact that it may take a minute from the PRESS START screen to the actually game menu.Once again Madden is the king of football games for 2012, but even the king has some issues.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0086V5V8G","description":"","reviewerName":"Shawn Bird","summary":"My Splinter Cell: Blacklist review","reviewText":"The Splinter Cell series has always been fun, but unfortunately more fun than good. The stealth game play even has the Metal Gear Solid games paling in comparison, but the stories and characters have always been forgettable as they were wrapped up in mostly political jargon. However Splinter Cell: Convictions and now with Splinter Cell: Blacklist not only does the characters stand out more, but we get a good story as well.A new terrorist organization reveals themselves after destroys an Air Force base on the island of Guam. This terrorist group calling themselves The Engineers demands that the U.S. withdraw all troops stationed within foreign countries. If America does not comply with the demands of The Engineers then they will perform a series of devastating attacks on United States soil. This is where Splinter Cell's protagonist Sam Fisher comes in. He is put in charge of a counter-terrorist team known as Four Echelon and is tasked with taken down The Engineers and stopping their terrorist activities.Splinter Cell: Blacklist has probably the best story in the series history. With some interesting plot twists and some well done character moments, actually make you care about both the story and the characters this time around and hardly making them forgettable. The mission types although on the outside are mostly the same of getting through the level completing objectives, keep the game play fresh. Breaking into Guantanamo Bay to interrogate a prisoner and sneaking back out, defending your plain while it is grounded as waves of enemies attack or going into danger zones to extract characters. The missions and objectives never feel repetitive or boring.The Splinter Cell series has always been about stealth game play at its heart and although that stealth game play returns in Blacklist, Ubisoft has done a great job of opening the game up to other forms of play style. There is the Ghost style, which fans of the series will love. It is the stealth, sneak past as many baddies as possible and kill no one style. Then there is the panther style which is stealthy still, but you kill anyone that gets in your way and hide their bodies and try not to be seen. Lastly is the Assault game play style, which is just as the name says, it is all about run and gun basically taking everyone out without trying to sneak around. Each of these game play styles works good and fits most of the levels, although some levels toward the end can be complicated for someone like me trying to use the Ghost style, but still is doable. This way even those that want to play Blacklist like it was call of Duty can do so.Depending on how you play of these three styles or even using all three in a level you get points for your game play and that adds up to getting money from the United States Government to fund anything Sam Fisher needs for catching the terrorists. There is a good amount of gear, gadgets, guns and even different additions to Sam's iconic goggles that players can unlock with the money made. You don't only have to play the main story missions to earn money for upgrades; there are a number of different side missions to do. Each of your team mates has special side missions for you to do, each team mates set of missions are different from the others. One is defeating waves of enemies; another is seeking in and hacking some computers or trying to take down every hostile in an area without alerting their reinforcements. Most of these can be done by way of single player or co-op (online or split-screen) and there is one set of missions that is only co-op.As if that wasn't enough, the online multiplayer Spies vs. Mercs has been brought back. Although I never played the online before in Splinter Cell, I was curious to try it now and needed to for writing this. In Spies vs. Mercs you have a team of Mercs that are trying to protect a series of terminals from the other team which are the spies that are trying to infiltrate the area and hack into the terminals. The one thing here that really bothered me is that Mercs play in first-person and Spies are in third-person. I don't understand the need to have both and really the major problem here is I do not care for FPS games all that often. Third-person is clearly better and so it makes it feel like the Mercs are at a disadvantage from the start. Either way Spies vs. Mercs is a refreshing change of pace from the standard team death match that you usually get from games with multiplayer shooters.Splinter Cell: Blacklist has tons of range for gamers of all shooter genres and never gets repetitive. You also get a great story that you don't just forget about as you are playing the game and a team of characters that actually are useful making them standout and interesting. Whether you want to sneak in and back out again, silently kill the enemies or want to run in guns blazing this game will be for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2013"}

I simply said \"let's wait and see\". Mainly because NSMB was a fun diversion, but didn't quiet feel like the \"comeback\" I was expecting for 2D Mario games. Probably it was the flat level design and overall \"emptyness\" feel. I don't know.But as the release of New Super Mario Bros. Wii came closer, the hype grew bigger as we saw more of it... harder difficulty, new items, and... Co-op gameplay??For the first time ever you get to play a side-scrolling Mario game simultaneously with your buddies, not that turn based stuff they used to do back then. Due to this levels have been designed for the most part to be able to fit in all 4 players at once. The main player always must control Mario, but the partners can choose between Luigi and 2 Toads. You'd ask why not the princess like in SMB2? Well, to be honest the princess could fly and I'm sure that they didn't want people taking advantage of that now so they could keep the difficulty up.Things get really chaotic when 2 to 4 people are playing for several reasons. People bouncing off each other, taking items that could have been useful for someone else, \"accidently\" killing someone... anything can happen. This is what makes co-op Mario an intense party experience. Expect people getting angry, and being jerks too.But even if no friends are around NSMBW is still a solid platformer in single player mode. There are 8 map worlds as usual and you have to jump your way from World 1 fighting all sort of enemies on the way, including the Koopalings from SMB3 and SMW.The game brings back many elements from older Mario games such as airship stages, mini-game houses, red and blue coins, infinite 1up tricks, Yoshi riding and so on. The game feels pretty though in difficulty but not impossible, and as an added challenge there's 3 hidden Star Coins in each level to find... some which are hidden in rather though ways.If I was to point out the few things I don't like about this game, I could say that at some places 'tilting the wii remote' was implemented to move/tilt platforms. This is pretty cool but also uncomfortable if you aren't playing in a normal sitting position. Also I was a bit dissapointed to know that Yoshis only appear in limited stages and cannot be taken to other ones even if you finish the level with them.NSMBW is a must own for your Wii library, and with its pretentiously colored red disc case, its clear that Nintendo wants it to stand out. And so it does.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2009"}

In desperation, the Soviets created a time-travel device that they've used to assassinate Albert Einstein before he is able to develop the weapon technology the Allies later use to defeat the Soviets. Upon returning, they notice a new world, and there is a world war taking place between three groups for control of the world.Play As Three Different Factions for Varied game playIn Red Alert 3, you have the choice to play as the Allies, the Soviets, or the Empire of the Rising Sun. Each faction has its own story-line and distinct units with advantages and disadvantages that you have to master in order to win. The new faction to the series is the Empire of the Rising Sun, derived from Imperial Japan, with an all-new cast of units and characters.The three factions have many differences, exemplified by their wildly different types of units. The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas. As they've done with the series, EA injects humor into the game when possible, keeping a smile on your face as you wage war.Fight on Land, in the Air, and on SeaRed Alert 3 has land units, air units, and naval units, all integral parts of the game. Unlike most strategy games that don't bother with naval warfare, Red Alert 3 makes controlling the seas an essential part of the game. Controlling resources in the seas and mounting attacks from all directions are strategies that must be employed to achieve victory.Cooperative Mode Lets You Team Up with Your FriendsRed Alert 3 has a fully co-operative campaign mode where you and a friend can play together to achieve victory. This means that you have to develop a strategy together, as well as execute it in synch in order to win. If your friends aren't online, you can also choose one of several AI commanders as your teammate.Play Against Your Friends in MultiplayerWith the different units and play mechanics of each faction, you and your friends will have a great time playing against each other, perfecting different strategies to best suit the units you have and the maps you play on. And thanks to the balanced game play, no one will have an unfair advantage.For previous fans of Command and Conquer, Red Alert 3 will provide the same light-hearted game play, but with more units, more strategies, and more fun.

Playing Red Alert 2 is still great, acting, gameplay, missions, everything was about building a big force and crushing the enemy with power.This game however....is a bit different....At first it was enjoyable as I enjoyed the humor with the tutorial, and the beginning cinematic was quite interesting.Even the graphics were pretty well made, although I may see why people wouldn't like the vibrant colors, and the small selection of units which does make the game feel \"childish\"The acting...is not great...definitely not anything compared to Red Alert 2, characters don't fit with the story, and the story is very odd. It begins with going back in time, killing Einstein, then coming back to the future and facing the \"Empire of the Rising Sun\" and the Allies...not only this, a heavy influence is put on every female model by showing their cleavage...I think this is in reference to Tanya in Red Alert 2, but she definitely did not look like a porn star (like some of these actors)The maps...are strange...the second mission you are fighting at a carnival...why? what? war? at a carnival? You even see soldiers playing games, and you release the \"bears\" from the cages...so oddThe biggest point however is the gameplay...1) A huge influence was put on building both land and sea...I'm not sure why...and most units can \"transform\" between navel and land or be on transports.-In my opinion it makes the game very slow, and difficult to get troops \"into\" the battle.2) Instead of building up an army you are instead supposed to build a small amount of various types, and use the strategy in their \"abilities\" and your \"special powers\" to complete the objective. Makes the game very slow paced, and often you feel like all the units are just weak.3) Harvesting Ore has returned, but this time all you do is build 1 or two, and your done...basically taking the whole concept of resource collection, and throwing it out...4) What really ruins the game for me is this \"co-commander\" business. They seemed to have made each mission \"co-op\" so you can play together with a friend online. HOWEVER, is you choose solo you get an AI to take their place, and this AI typically does everything for you....even in the second mission, they give the AI the \"super unit\" while you are stuck with some spider bots....sort of silly...5) Very unbalanced...there's this huge gap in units....sometimes randomly a larger unit will appear and just wipe your entire army out, and you won't have much to defend, or....to kill it, you'll have to sacrifice your entire army.Overall...even though I've only played about 4 missions + the tutorial...it's sad. By the time  you reach the 4th mission there will be like 4 different colored units on the screen, and you'll be in a base completely in the water, and it's sooooo difficult to get on land, because the enemies will keep attacking, and you always have low income because you only get two harvesters in like every mission which can't be expanded. (YES YOU CAN NOT EXPAND YOUR RESOURCE COLLECTION) Why? I have no idea....even in starcraft...resource collecting was a main strategy, now it's lost.It \"Seems\" like the makers of this game wanted you to use strategy with units instead of building up your base/army, but it's very slow paced, and lacking in so many ways from Red Alert 2...making it boring...uninteresting...and childish. (Perhaps it \"was\" made for a younger audience) I'm not entirely sure...but it's definitely not anything special. if you look my youtube channel you'll see like the difference between the beginning of Red Alert 2, and Red Alert 3 (made videos of both).  Sure Red Alert 3 has nicer graphics...(a bit too vibrant/cartoon looking), but Red Alert 2 gives you so much more freedom, and actually challenges you in a fast paced environment a lot more like Starcraft.Rating: &#9733;&#9733; / &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; (Not Great...but is a bit of fun for ~$5) (I paid $17 for the complete C&C; collection for Windows 7, so basically $5 or less..haha)","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2013"}

You're jumping down holes, climbing up ladders, and navigating mazes of course. But the main task of Kirby-land is to figure out what items are available to eat - and then to combine together multiple items to come up with cool new techniques.The activation sequence is a bit tricky - you have to spin your finger around the four directions of the D pad to turn things on - but it's well worth it. The cool combinations you can come up with are great fun!You're allowed to store items in \"bubbles\" in Kirby's stomach, which is what the bottom half of your DS screen is dedicated to. This lets you choose what item to use in a certain situation, or to combine them together if you wish.Even more fun, as you go you unlock color options for Kirby himself. Interested in a blue kirby, or a citrus-colored Kirby? You can do it! Of course, many traditionalists will insist that Kirby only comes in one color, that is Pepto-Bismol Pink.The game is well done, in that it's both simple enough for younger players and entertaining enough for older players as well. It's relatively short, so that you can use it to pass the time while waiting in line at the supermarket or taking a bus ride without worrying about memorizing arcane combinations of keys or memorizing a rule book of negotiation tactics.  You have just as much fun replaying it, aiming to unlock every chest you find and to get through as quickly as possible.I admit that I still adore the days of The Crystal Shards and hope that these styles of games will come out on the Wii in the future.

Having no wires is great because there is no tripping or tangling going on.Btw, I should add that I am very picky about my controllers. I have had several bad controllers in the past (e.g. buttons that stick, buttons that you have to press really hard to get a response, controllers that die within a week of use, etc.). Thankfully, this controller has given me no problems. I actually got it used and it works just fine. I highly recommend this product.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2013"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end? Discover their fate inBorderlands.GameplayAs in a traditional RPG,Borderlandsis built around the continual leveling of characters as they delve into quests.

{"product_name":"B001COV1CY","reviewerName":"Christopher Deweese","summary":"Sufficient","reviewText":"MAG joins Warhawk as the other \"online only\" multiplayer shooter for the PS3.  Its claim to fame is the ability to support up to 256 players in a match at once.  This is unprecedented for a gaming console and really shows the power of the PS3.  The question is \"does that really matter?\"  Is the game fun?  Does it work well?  Pretty much.If my review is sounding luke warm it's because my initial experience with MAG was not very good.  I bought it the day it was released, went home, and fired it up.  Much to my dismay, I was greeted with the wonderful task of having to download over 100mb of updates only to find out that the servers were down.  I could not get into a match.  The only thing I was able to do was the initial training mission.  Not a very auspicious beginning.  I put down the controller and proceeded to play another game that released that day (Mass Effect 2).Thank goodness two days later everything was working for MAG.  Getting in a match was easy, no lag whatsoever, and most of the players were pleasant.  Graphics looked pretty good considering how many players can join and the shear size of the map.  Audio was really good (gunshots echoed in the distance, ricochets sounded realistic).  I got a definite \"Killzone 2\" feel with the controls (I liked the controls).  Playing the game was pretty enjoyable.It seems as though some enemies require way too many hits to bring them down.  Even headshots don't always result in an instant death.  The early missions do not have 256 players, but rather are training missions within your faction that have up to 64 players.  You have to level up before you can join the all out war (I think it's level 8).  The early training missions are nothing more than simple team deathmatches.I would say the pros outweigh the cons.  If you really enjoy online multiplayer, you will find plenty to be happy with regarding MAG.  I can't say that it's really that much different from Killzone 2, the Call of Duty games, or even Resistance 2.  However, time will tell as I level up and experience the 256 player battles.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2010"}

On PS3?!?","reviewText":"This game had quite a bit of potential, but for a few reasons, is quite the letdown.First off, the graphics are absolutely horrible... disgusting even. I understand that with so many players in a game, they have to make some changes to the core game to allow that many players, but I mean... really? They're so bad, if I didn't know any better, I'd say they're nothing but HD PS2 graphics... absolutely unforgiving. Its not even if you're a graphics hound, you NEED atleast decent graphics for the game to work, with all the players and vehicles and objectives on the battlefield. Just ugh...Now, the gameplay is atleast... solid. 256 players at the most for some game modes, battling it out across the whole map... Nothing amazing, but surely nothing too bad. With the addition of the Move support, this game has atleast some replay value to it. I don't know about you, but playing a shooter, especially one like this, is infinitely more rewarding when you're actually doing well, while playing using the Move. So there's that...The game is multiplayer only however... which is a problem with the horribly limited amount of game types. How many? 4. And guess what? The best mode, has to be BOUGHT. So, sorry, 5. On top of the fact that you can only have 1 character slot for free, while there are 3 factions, one of which, Valor, is HORRIBLY overpowered and has too many players. You can have 2 more slots, but they have to be BOUGHT! What is with buying things that should already be in the game, especially when the game doesn't have much to start with? It's very frustrating!The concept of the game is pretty intriguing, but horribly executed. I'm very nervous to see the results if they try this again... STAY AWAY!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00009WNZA","reviewerName":"&#308;&#308;","summary":"The Sims 2 is one of the best games ever!","reviewText":"The Sims franchise is a gaming series in which you run the life of your virtual character(s).  You can cook, shop, eat, fall in love, make friends, get a job, go to school, use the bathroom, die, and much more.  It has so much versatility that it is a great game!Story-One of the great things is that there is no story!  You can do whatever you want to with your life.  You do, however, have \"wants\" that are based on your aspiration.  \"Wants\" are kind of like life dreams, they are what you want to accomplish in your lifetime.  For instance the Wealthy aspiration might have you wanting to earn $100,000 or buy a $1,000 painting.  Meanwhile the Family aspiration will have you wanting to have a kid or get married.  If you don't fulfill want's you can go crazy (literally), but that is as much of a story as you have.Graphics-The graphics are really good.  The \"sims\" don't look like real people, but their movements are really good, I think.  There are 3 speeds that you can do: regular, double, and triple.  Regular looks the best, but double is good, too.  Triple is crazy and I only use it to pass the time while I'm at work or sleeping.  Also just a note to younger players, when you use the bathroom or take a shower it is blurred out 100% so don't even worry about that.Sound-There isn't much voice acting, but what there is of it is good.  The music is really nice.  There are various genres from Pop to Hip-Hop to Shopping.  There are probably about 10 songs per station, but they are sung in Simlish, the language sims use.Gameplay-Okay, obviously this game is third person, and I would even call it point-and-click.  You point at the object you want to use and click on it.  There might be various options, but you just choose the one you want.  A thing to mention is that there are \"needs\".  \"Needs\" are things that you need to do such as eat, sleep, use the bathroom, take a shower, things like that.  Some, such as eating, will cause you to die if you don't do them.  \"Skills\" are another thing in this game.  You can build your skills in Cooking, Mechanical, Body, and more by doing things that will help you get better at that skill.  For instance, playing chess increases your intellect.  Painting increases your creativity.  You also need to get a job and earn money in the game.  The money isn't dollars but rather Simoleons, the system of money with sims.  The jobs you can get are everything from sports to culinary to business, and you can get promotions by making friends and increasing skill levels.  Anytime you feel cooped up in your home you can leave to go shopping at a store by calling a taxi.  Your fridge sometimes runs out of food, so you need to buy food regularly, but you can order it via phone.  Also, you can buy clothes in the game and change into it via a wardrobe.  You can change your hairstyle by using a mirror.  In this game, there are various life stages.  There are baby, toddler, child, teen, adult, and elder.  You can also grow older by growing from stage to stage.  Then you can die.Fun-This game is a blast!  I love everything about it, and to keep myself from getting bored, I buy the expansion packs one at a time to get something new.  The expansion packs are little additions to the sim's world such as a college or downtown.Length-Well, you can play one of two ways.  You can play until you die, and then control your kids and so on or you can press CONTROL, SHIFT, C (hold them all down) and enter AGING OFF to play constantly without growing older.  That's how I like to play.  So, it can be endless if you so choose, or you can eventually die, but this game gives HOURS of playing time!Overall, this is an awesome game that is a break from adventure or shooting games.  You can just live life to its fullest on a computer.  I definitely recommend that you buy it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2009"}

The graphics were groundbreaking when it was new in 2007 and are still maybe the most beautifully detailed I've ever seen (I didn't even try to run it until I built a gaming rig in 2011). If you have the computing power, they're really just gorgeous.The beginning, where you infiltrate an island overrun by PRNK troops to rescue scientists, is a lot of fun. The gunplay is good and the suit powers are cool if awkward to activate (I wish you could do it with your voice). The gorgeous scenery is a pleasure, especially in winter when it'd be nice to see some sun and green IRL.Not to give spoilers, but once you reach a certain point the game turns dramatically more science fiction, and from there it kind of lost me. The new enemies aren't as much fun for me, the vehicle episodes are frustrating, and suddenly my system starts crashing frequently. (I don't think it's a specs problem because I have pretty high end hardware that had no trouble rendering the lush jungles at max settings but I experience crashes at high and medium late in the game, including on menu screens).

Being forced to replay levels isn't fun in any game and Rayman is no exception.The best part of this game BY FAR, are the challenge levels.

{"product_name":"B000TUZCQI","reviewerName":"Zachary Koenig \"K-Dawg\"","summary":"Perhaps The Only Perfect Video Game Ever Created","reviewText":"After receiving my first Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991, I instantly became hooked on one game in particular: Super Mario Brothers. It's relatively new style of play (side-scrolling) in combination with an original story and the perfect difficulty arc (anyone can beat the beginning levels, but it takes a true pro to complete the game) made it the game that I played over and over again. Whether it was screaming in frustration due to the Hammer Brothers, hearing in disbelief that the Princess \"was in another castle\", or the sheer joy of beating that next castle, I played the game over and over again. Of course, being such a young child, I was never quite talented enough to complete the complicated jump moves or decipher the complex mazes (towards the end) well enough to actually beat the game. Yet, I still had a heck of a time trying!Flash forward (LOST-style) 10-12 years later: Having been introduced to the NES at such a young age, I continued by brand loyalty to Nintendo by playing the Super Nintendo, Nintendo '64, Gamecube, and Wii. I had a lot of good times with those machines, but one day I got the urge to fire up the old NES again, for old times sake. Within moments (well, not exactly moments, as it took some blowing on the connectors and jiggling the game up and down) I was instantly transformed back into that excited six year old kid who couldn't wait to come home from school and play Mario. This time around, with a little practice, I was able to conquer even the final Bowser.While playing the game at that older age, though, I was amazed at the purity of it. It was original (which can't be said about most SNES games), it was straight-forward (not like Donkey Kong '64, for example), it's difficulty arc progresses in a logical fashion (not like GCN, where in many games you have to be a master gamer to step right in), and the game's internal bugs are cute and looked forward too, not annoying and troublesome as is sometimes the case on the Wii.Thus, taking all those things into consideration, Super Mario Brothers for the NES is, at least in my opinion, perhaps the closest thing to a \"perfect video game\" as has ever been created. Not only did it practically save the entire gaming industry, but it also gave hours of entertainment to people across the world. To me, only The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (for the '64) can challenge Mario Bros. in terms of overall game quality.So, if you are a nostalgic video gamer (like myself) who is a bit frazzled by the current obsessions and skill levels, I would highly recommend dusting of the old NES box and popping in Super Mario Brothers (it often comes on the same cartridge as Duck Hunt). After a few moments of dickering, a few tries to re-master the old skill-sets, you will NOT be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2009"}

Releasing a game each year is a daunting task, and to do it 4 years in a row (game is confirmed for next year) and with a production coming from 6 studios worldwide, this game is certainly impressive. Where it fails, much like all yearly releases, is innovation. This game offers nothing new in terms of gameplay mechanics. Tower defense? We've seen that a million times before, and executed better. The hook blade? In terms of combat it offers some flashy, yet shallow moves, and in terms of transportation, zip-lines aren't exactly revolutionary either(The saboteur comes to mind, and that game rocks). Bomb crafting, seriously? Touting grenades as new and innovative? Give me a break.I'm not saying I need something as mind blowing as the original, but something at least as cool as calling in fellow assassins from brotherhood would suffice(although that level up minigame was a time wasting pain)It's hard to say this is a rental, because the game will last you a good 12-18 hours, but it's hard to recommend it as a purchase, because you are paying 60$ for what honestly feels like one giant expansion pack.

While my experience has been flawless, I've heard several experiences that are the opposite. Basically, your Xbox is already capable of playing DVD's, you only need to purchase the Playback Kit which consists of two parts:  1) a receiver that you plug into one of your Xbox Controller ports, and 2) a remote control that you use to direct the DVD player.  The remote comes with the usual assortment of DVD options but as others have pointed out, two annoying omissions are a power button and an eject button. A power button would be especially useful considering the Xbox hardware is practically a desktop computer and needs a little rest every now and then. I know friends that have had problems running some DVD's but the worst news I've heard about the Xbox DVD player is that Microsoft employs different vendors to manufacture its disc drives and some models are not as dependable as others.  Therefore, you could be limiting your Xbox console's lifespan by using it as a DVD player as well as a video game system. The DVD Playback Kit is recommended for anyone that doesn't own a DVD player as its a cheaper alternative and provides quality picture and sound but if you already own a DVD player, I would keep it and stick with video games for the Xbox.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2003"}

But too much of a good thing, perhaps","reviewText":"First the good news - this is a fantastic game in many ways.  All the things you'd hope for in a 3rd person adventure are duly accounted for:  Good, grab it and go controls without any annoying button combinations, gorgeous graphics with great variety and occasional outright beauty, good character movement that isn't spoiled by the need for complicated button work, and lots of interesting puzzles to solve.It also has one of the best save systems I've ever seen, something so many games get so wrong.  You pass checkpoints constantly, and can save at each one.  When you return to the game later, even after turning off the console, you have the choice to resume (start at the most recent saved checkpoint) or load (start back at the beginning of the current level).  Beautiful.  You don't lose progress, and if you find out you missed something important, you can always start the level over to get it.So what's the bad news?  Well, it all gets to be a bit much, frankly.  I like \"platforming\" games a lot, but to me it seems there's just too much platforming and not enough of anything else.  I'm about 80% through, and every area has been basically the same:  Walk in and get ambushed by a critter or two, then spend the next couple of hours wall climbing, jumping, pole-swinging, crevice crawling and wall running.  That was fun for about the first 50%, but now it's just repetitious and quickly becoming tedious.I understand that this is an old-school platformer and the game's focus is right for that, but I just can't help getting bored with it now that I'm most of the way through.  The infrequent bosses have been a nice diversion (they take some effort but aren't ridiculously hard), and again, the environments are really cool.  I love all those ancient ruins with their mechanizations, puzzles and traps.  But now I'm bored and just plugging on to get it over with.  Once you've had a look around at the wonderful scenery and get down to work, it's just the same old thing over and over.I want to love this game for all it's talents, but the gameplay is wearing thin.  Hardcore platformers will probably love every moment, but I'm not quite -that- hardcore.The good:Scenery and graphicsControlsCharacter movementCool ancient environmentsPerfect save systemVery well-behaved cameraThe bad:Endless platforming gets tedious, not much else happensSo that's not much bad compared to the good.  This review might have seemed a bit too negative up to this point, but I'd like to stress it's benefits here and now.  It's a nearly flawless example of the platforming breed.  I highly recommend it for serious platformers.  If you'd like a little more variety to go along with all your creeping, crawling, jumping and swinging, you might want to consider something with a little more action mixed in.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2007"}

While obviously there's going to be some major difference between the overall control gameplay between the 2000 Hitman: Codename 47 and this newest release the more basic controls like stealth/attack/camouflage have been kept throughout the game series apparently. While you can do mini-jobs throughout the game which is appreciated you have the one major storyplot mission which is interwoven with 47 past and current life and another person who could sadly be trapped in the same dark gritty profession of 47.  The graphics are very good and might bring some people to feel a little deja vu as the design is a little similar to Batman Arkham Asylum/City.The game mostly relies on stealth and cunning, while you can outright attack it's usually preferred to try the former rather then the later.  The voice cast are actually pretty decent while there are one or two that should have been recast for their character roles overall it's nothing major. So for an entertaining somewhat provoking game here's one to check out for your gaming library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004S5TDL0","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Schmidt \"TotalHavoc\"","summary":"Finally, a game that really teaches you to play guitar!","reviewText":"I think there are several aspects to this game that make it so successful.  First, the notes to play keep scrolling across the screen so you can't look at your fingers.  This forces you to learn to do the fingering real time.  Finding the right string, right fret, and moving between frets starts to become second nature.  Second, there are a number of mini challenge games that focus on a particular guitar skill through repetition, such as sliding up and down the frets.  Third, the game will reccommend what you should do next so it acts as a guide to your development.  And finally, you can play it with any electric guitar so you are learning on your own guitar.  Other games have a plastic thing with 5 colored buttons on it, a special guitar with buttons at all the frets which is still not like holding down a string, or force you to buy a specific model guitar.I personally am not that enthralled with the song selection, but that it just my personal taste.  I don't dislike the music enough to take away from the 5 star rating.Another aspect of the game that is nice is that it helps you tune the guitar with a built in tone recognition algorithm.  So you strum a string and then raise or lower the pitch based on feedback given to you through prompts.  It will then let you know when you are spot on.  And it really does an excellent job.It is a challenging game, but one you will love to work through to meet the ends of learning to play the guitar.  Based on what it actually delivers in terms of teaching you a musical instrument, it is well worth double the price.  That is how impressed I am with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2012"}

The downfall is that you can only play in single player mode unless you want to do/are set up for online play.In single player Campaign mode, you're a first person shooter (soldier) on the frontlines, and primarily you're playing two separate, interlacing missions as two different characters. You also play a cool, flashback side story as a sniper in a ghillie suit (camouflage clothing). But mostly you play in current times with a team of characters that are truly your band of AI brothers; the help you might get from your team is based on the difficulty setting you've chosen.You arrive in boot camp just like inCall of Duty 3, and you get a brief tutorial on how to maneuver around, shoot your weapon & throw grenades (you'll be using smoke, stun and explosive). Then you're immediately strewn into various battles.You fight your way through some intense chapters. The weapons are much more sophisticated than the ones in WWII era CoD3. It's the present in CoD4, and you're mostly shooting whichever modern-day weapon you happen to have picked up (mostly from dead soldiers on the ground) along your objective route. Your objectives that guide you along are updated regularly as you complete each task throughout each chapter. And some of those tasks are brutal.Perhaps the best feature of the campaign mode is the frequent checkpoints. I think I remember even reaching new checkpoints without firing a single shot in CoD4. Contrarily, inResistance: Fall Of Man, sometimes I'd be playing for like 20 minutes only to get killed and respawn back before what seemed to take an eternity to complete. Not an issue in CoD4.There are some areas where the AI won't let you clear an area of enemies no matter how hard or well you fight; the AI will keep sending enemies at you until you get to a checkpoint. That was a bit confusing until the realization dawned on me that my AI brothers and me were just not going to take down everyone in some areas.No matter which chapter you're in you are mostly using your primary weapon (some kind of machine gun) that on some models has an effective grenade launcher attached. You'll also need to engage in some exhilarating hand to hand combat (with dogs!), you'll need to guide air support, attach and arm explosives to enemy stuff, use night-vision goggles, and man other stationary weapons. There was no driving necessary in CoD4 (unlike CoD3).All of the chapters are really fun. Some of the chapters are really difficult, and some like I said earlier feel like I did nothing in order to succeed. I think that the easy chapters are designed more to challenge you to correctly navigate yourself and your team to the correct objective, but that doesn't require a lot of effort if you just follow the on-screen compass.On-line play is a different world. No AI brothers here...just your fellow gamers. You'd better have your FPS skills honed if you think that you'll beat some of the CoD4 online players. Man, I stink so bad I'm getting meleed to death by these guys before I even fire a shot. But online play is truly addicting. The more you play, the higher you rank allowing you to unlock more (fine tuned) weapons....Just wait 'til I get my hands on some of those, all you online vets!So all in all Call of Duty 4 is major fun, but like I said earlier, the biggest drawback to this awesome game is that multiplayer mode is only available with online play. (No story co-op...not even on-line). Co-op worked terrific in Resistance: Fall of Man....Why I wonder couldn't it for Call of Duty 4? Hence, that is the only reason why I've deducted a star from the overall rating, but by no means do I suggest that anyone with a PS3 miss out on this super-fun game.Add it to your cart, soldier!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2007"}

MW2 was my favorite so far. I received the product at a Gamestop's midnight release. I was happy to find that I could jump online and start playing with people right away. I haven't played the campaign mode, or zombies, so my review will be limited to what I have seen in multiplayer.Connection to games seems a little faster, and more fluid. The actual gameplay had little to no lag. The graphics are a big improvement over World at War (Treyarch's last call of duty). Compared to MW2 the graphics in black ops are cartoonish. The graphics are still amazing, it's just a different feel from MW2. There are some new things added to the gameplay. One is a monetary system that you can use to buy weapon unlocks, perks, and even equipment. Certain levels still have to be attained for weapons (same as MW2), but everything else can be unlocked as you get the money. For example, I was able to unlock the claymore as soon as I had 5,000 points (which happened pretty fast). There is a lot more customization in black ops. Apparently you can change your camo, and even face paint (I haven't leveled up that far yet). The weapons are of the cold war era, but a lot of weapons are showing up again (Famas, M16, MP5, etc.).  The perks are are pretty much the same as well (ghost=cold blooded, second chance=last stand). The kill-streak rewards are also pretty much the same (chopper gunner, bombings, spy plane, care packages). I haven't unlocked it yet, but there is a kill-streak that lets you fly a helicopter, and not just gun. Oh, the pesky dogs are back, and yes they still suck (one bite=dead). The knife is still all powerful (stabbing through hail of gunfire).The multiplayer does seem a lot fresher even though there isn't that much new stuff. It seems quicker, and more fluid. The maps are absolutely astonishing! A lot bigger than MW2, and a lot more detailed. One map has a missile launching in the background. The same game modes are here, but there is one new mode that I noticed. One called wager, where you can wage your points that you earned against others. Whoever wins gets to keep the pot. I have yet to play this game mode, but it seems like a cool idea.Overall I am very happy that I purchased the new Call of Duty. I didn't really like World at War, and in general didn't like the Treyarch versions of Call of Duty. This version is a worthy successor, but I wish there was a little more originality, and new features. At least Zombies has returned for round two, and apparently there is some kind of coop mode, but I am unsure of this.Definitely should be in your library.Update: 11/10/10So I played the campaign for a few hours today; two words: freaking awesome! The storyline is really immerses you, and I'm glad that this storyline is about the cold war. This theme has been remotely explored by some P.C. games, and even fewer console games. The graphics are stunning! I'm ready to put my \"Gamerfide\" stamp on it.This is the best Call of Duty ever! (MW1 will always be in my heart though)Stop reading; just go out and get it. You won't be sorry.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}
