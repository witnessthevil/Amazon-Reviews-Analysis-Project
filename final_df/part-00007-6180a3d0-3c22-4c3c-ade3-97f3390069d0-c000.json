The question a friend asked is whether or not it's worth getting the PS4/Xbox One version?Honestly unless you're a hardcore fan of the series I'd say no.While you'll obviously get the better graphics and such the game still looks and plays great on the PS3 and Xbox 360.  The controls work well and respond well in the game so there's no lagging when you have to throw a grenade or are targeting an enemy for a sniper shot or sometimes running for cover. The A.I. is pretty decent too throughout the game though there were one or two areas that seemed faulty when fighting against enemies.  So for FPS or BF fans here's another addition to add to the gaming library until hopefully we get BF:Bad Company 3.Update 03-12-2014I sadly had to lower my rating for the game because of either a glitch or faulty A.I. hard to say which but since it kept happening after my third mission on the game it became too much.  The major problem is with your squad, as you're going through the level half the time for whatever reason during or sometimes after a firefight they see an enemy soldier but for whatever reason start shooting on the ground or at the walls and there's no way to advance or make them stop.  It got tedious having to restart from a checkpoint half the time so I've stopped playing the game at this time until hopefully there's patch that fixes this problem.  Don't get me wrong it's still a fun game but this glitch really takes away about 70% of that feeling.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2014"}

This game brings back the 2D Sonic from the good ole Genesis days. Looking for rings, multiple 360-degree loops in a row, and Dr. Robotnik? You got 'em. They're all here. If you could do it in the Genesis Sonic games you could do all that, plus a lot more in this game.There are 6 levels and 14 stages (but to see get to the 14th stage you must beat the game as everyone and collect all 7 emeralds). The stages in each level are very fun to play. As you go on each level gets harder and harder. There are also 2 Special Stages which you get to by collecting warp springs instead of coins.The graphics for this game aren't as good as the original games, but the characters are upgraded. Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy look just like they do in the Dreamcast games. The thing that makes the graphics suffer some, is that the GBA isn't back-lit, some levels are very hard to see without good lighting. Overall the graphics are good, with amazing backgrounds and animations.The sound effects for this game are amazing. They fit perfectly with each level and stage. The  speakers of the GBA are not strong enough to play the music in very high quality, but with headphones the music is solid and smooth. You can even use music from older games as well, but you need to find them.The two reasons why I didn't give this game a perfect score is because the game is way too short. All you'll find in this game is 6 levels and 14 stages. Also, it is very hard to get to the Special Stages and they are very difficult. They are pretty much like the Special Stages in Sonic 2.Another addition to this game is a mini Chao Garden, for which you can connect your GBA to a GameCube and transfer data and do other things.

Unless a handful of heroes can protect the remaining crystals, the world will fall into ruin. Set off on a grand adventure in the finest version of Final Fantasy V ever released!","reviewerName":"Stephen J. White \"Dragnilar\"","summary":"The wonderful and amusing translation makes FFV Advance the best release of FFV to date","reviewText":"In keeping with their tradition of re-releasing their SNES Final Fantasy games on the GBA, Nintendo has repackaged Final Fantasy V. The result is nothing short of spectacular, as Final Fantasy V Advance turns out to be the best version of FFV to date. The main reason being that the game has been re-translated and augmented so that the script is now very tongue in cheek and full of humor. Pop culture references are abounding, and game makes fun of its rather simplistic and clich&eacute; storyline. The result is a fresh and witty take on what was originally a simplistic and unoriginal story.For players unfamiliar with the rest of Final Fantasy V, it can be quickly summarized as follows: The emphasis of the game is not on story, but on fighting. The game requires the player to spend more time leveling up and building up abilities than it does the player reading text and figuring out puzzles. As a result, the game is actually somewhat easy, since the player will most likely \"over level\" their party in order to have a team of characters to their liking. Beyond the emphasis on leveling, anyone can see why the game originally had a rather unoriginal and overall boring story. Thankfully, the aforementioned \"script update\" has helped remedy this issue greatly.As for the game's combat, Square has added 4 new jobs that the player can acquire, but three are only accessible towards the end of the game (and the last after the game is beaten). Still, the new jobs do add some variety to game play as well as replay value. The jobs themselves are not \"overly powered\" as some players might be lead to think, and in comparison, the original 15 jobs can be more powerful than the new 4 if used properly. Still, the new jobs do make life easier when it comes to leveling up thanks to the abilities that they introduce to the game. Ultimately, the new jobs add some needed additions for players who have already beaten FFV in the past.As for other additions to the game, the most noticeable are that the game has more colorful and better-drawn graphics. The soundtrack has been remixed, and is now far superior to the original SNES game. The game also has an optional 30-room dungeon and a boss survival mode for players seeking more action after the game is over. Suffice to say, the additional content easily plays on the game's emphasis on combat and not on story telling. Other additions to the game include a bestiary, so that players can look up the stats of the monsters that have been defeated. In addition, the game has a music player mode for those who enjoy the music of Final Fantasy V.The only drawback on Final Fantasy V Advance is that some players will find the new content to be \"not enough\". Where as the original Final Fantasy V could be completed at about level 36-50, the additional content can be beaten at 50-60, depending on how much time the player has invested into the job system (and how much outside assistance they utilize.) Still, with the new translation, FFV Advance is a worthwhile experience, even for players who have already played FFV in the past.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2007"}

FFVI first appeared on the SNES, but was known as Final Fantasy III at the time (it was the third Final Fantasy to make it to America, but the sixth overall in Japan).  Final Fantasy V was only released in Japan and Anthology makes the American debut of the game.  I&#65533;ve been a long time fan of the Final Fantasy series, so I was extremely happy that I was now able to play these games on the Playstation.  It was nice to have all of my Final Fantasy on the same system.  There have been complaints about the loading time between battles and menu screens, and while the loading times are not great (or even good), they did not distract me at all while playing the games.  These were just minor complaints for me.Final Fantasy V:As I stated above, this is the first time that Final Fantasy V was playable in the United States.  Graphically, the game is similar to Final Fantasy IV (the one with Cecil and Golbez), but there is a significant difference.  The difference is that there is a job based leveling system now.  This predates Final Fantasy Tactics, but it is similar (less refined, perhaps).  As you progress through the game, your abilities in battle depend on what job class you have chosen to be, and mastering multiple job classes is key to beating the game.  The story is somewhat of a let down after Final Fantasy IV.  I feel this is one of the weaker games in the series, but it is still fun.Final Fantasy VI:This is my favorite Final Fantasy game of all time.  While I have loved most of the games, and enjoyed the rest, this one stands first in my heart for the Final Fantasy series.  This game has good graphics for the SNES era, and a long, involved story dealing with magical creatures called Espers and the greed of some humans to steal that magical power.  The story does not center directly on any one character, but a case could be made for Terra, Celes, Locke, and perhaps Edgar as the fourth lead.  The absence of a true lead character adds to the development of the story since it doesn&#65533;t follow one character but follows a plotline where character move in and out of the story arc.  I found this game to be incredibly fun to play and was by far my favorite of the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Paul Arellano \"Last Days on Earth\"","summary":"Why You Should Never Play During Launch Date","reviewText":"In a word, Diablo 3 is a great game. I've played Diablo 1 when it first launched, then Diablo 2, now Diablo  3. I bought D3 four days after launch date. I never had any problems logging in. I never had an error message. I never got disconnected. Do you know why? Because I began playing the game about four days after launch date. By this time, Blizz already fixed the servers, it even loaded tons of update setup files during installation.  Yes the game suffers a few lags due to online always policy from Blizz, but they are few and far between. A lot of complaints seem to come from the first day launch players. I don't have a fast gaming rig and I've never experienced poor performance playing D3. In fact, my gaming rig is something that I just put together; ATI Radeon 6XXX series, AMD Quad Core 3.6, 12gb of RAM, two 5400 rpm WD, a cheap ASUS mobo, and I even have a cheap Belkin USB wireless antenna and an old beatup Linksys router that I bought in 2003. Guess what? I am running it on MAX SETTINGS and D3 plays smoothly...so smoothly.What gets me really is that there are quite a number of \"gamers\" ( more like whiners)who didn't do any research whatsover how D3 was going to handle single player campaign. Yes Blizz mentioned several times over and over and over, even Game Informer did a massive pre-release review about the game being an ALWAYS ONLINE setup. So now these complainers start blaming Blizz about DRM etc etc. A few also complained about how their PCs were below system requirements! They're complaining because their system couldn't handle D3 so they're blaming Blizz? One even complained that he only had a mobile broadband connectivity so he was getting poor performance.You have got to be kidding me.  Blame your poor system, blame yourself for not doing your homework about D3's DRM (word to the wise: never ever use E-Machine to play games, or anything that says \"Integrated Graphics chip\"). Be accountable for your mistake. That's why Blizz isn't even paying any attention to these whiners because... \"YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!\"Oh and by the way, DRM is here to stay. Anybody who says they will never ever buy a game that has DRM is lying to himself/herself. Anybody who says they will never ever buy another BLizz game is full of it. Because you know when the new MMO from Blizz comes out, these same whiners will be the first in line to get it, and they'll be the first to post a poor review because of the DRM. DRM is here to stay. It will never go away. Unless you love playing DOS games through Windows 98 games for the rest of your life, you'll just have to live with the fact that DRM is part of the digital age now. And no I do not work for Blizz. I don't even like their kindergarten MMO called...WoW. Played it once and uninstalled it. WoW was too easy for me.I'm going to keep my review straight and to the point, no gimmicks, nothing. If my grammar is horrible, go ahead and have fun ripping it apart. I'm here to write a review not a sonnet that would rival Shakespeare's.GRAPHICS: Graphics are cartoonish. It's not an improvement to D1 or D2. It's just a different take on the art. It's like asking Da Vinci to paint Mona Lisa, and then asking  Monet to paint Mona Lisa as well. Both will surely come out as masterpieces but completely different in style and approach. If you've played Torchlight, that's how D3 looks but the lines are sharper. It's not Skyrim so please don't expect it to be one. Another game I could compare the graphics style to is Kingdoms of Amalur.SOUND: Blizz did reuse some of the old D2 sound effects like when an item drops out of a mob or off your pack, it does that swish-swoosh sound similar to D2. Also, the sound effects you hear when you turn over a corpse and gold drops off it's body, yup it's the same exact sound file from D2. So yes, the sound effects were rehashed version. To be honest, I didn't like it. Blizz got lazy with the sound effects. Naughty naughty naughty Mr. Blizz.MUSIC: Yep again, Blizz rehashed some of the music. Remember D2's acoustic guitar music while you're in town. Yup Blizz reused the same old \"Hotel California\" style music, but probably with a different chord progression. So yes, Blizz got horribly lazy in the sound and music department.GAMEPLAY: Mouse mouse click click. But hey this is Diablo. Why expect to see anything innovative after 12 years? You got what you were asking for. Now unless there's a new PC peripheral to replace the mouse and the keyboard, I suggest you just be happy that Diablo didn't do anything fancy that could've made the UI a living hell. If you've played D2, you can easily drop into this game without difficulty. Yes the CTRL key to hold your toon in place while attacking is still here. Killing mobs is just like the way it was 12 years ago. You click on a mob and spam click it to death and move to the next mob.You are given a chance to recruit HIRELINGS to help you through the game. They're not stupid but they're not overpowered at the same time. You can hire and fire HIRELINGS. They're more of a novelty thing than something that you could rely on when overwhelmed with tons of mobs. What you can kill with one swing, the hireling will take about 20 swings to kill it, no matter what gear you equip the hireling with. Yes the hireling can level up and you are given a choice which skill to assign to your hireling. Overall, it's something that I can do without. It's just another NPC that keeps my left eye occupied while checking his/her health.Skill Trees? Sorry no more skill trees. Everytime you level up, you are given a skill to either use it or not. If you don't use it, it gets stored in your skill list. Skills are assigned to your left and right mouse buttons, and the 1-5 keys. Is it a step back from previous Diablo games? Yes and no. Yes because the skill system isn't as deep as the previous Diablos. No it's not a step back because it makes the decision making part of what skills to use tremendously easy. If you make a mistake, you can always pull another skill from your skill list and tack it on your mouse buttons or 1-5 keys.  Yes it's a step back because the game is so easy now compared to the previous games. Looks like Blizz made Diablo a bit more casual just like the way they  they made MMO a casual experience in the form of WoW, to bring in more people into the band wagon. Is it a good thing? Probably not, because now you end up with more trolls than intelligent players.CONCLUSION: Get the game. Don't miss out on this game because of the DRM or because whiners keep getting disconnected. Be patient and the game will stabilize as less and less people login all at the same time to the game. It should take another week or so before the logins plateau to a steady line. DRM is here to stay whether you like it or not, but it shouldn't stop you from enjoying your games. If you are a true fan of action rpg, then go for it. There's nothing intrusive or sinister about Diablo's DRM. It's just their way of getting rid of hackers and cheaters that plagued the previous versions. D3 was worth the wait for me. You can check my D2 review I wrote 12 years ago. I gave it a failing mark I believe. This time, I am giving it a good rating because quite frankly it's an enjoyable game. If you have $60 dollars and you want to enjoy your hard earned money, then go for D3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2012"}

I must say this game was more than I expected it to be. You get shooting, racing, fighting, building scaling, swimming, nudity, profanity, and a great story all in one game. The open world environment is beautiful and lively. I've run over so many people while being chased! The acting is pretty good as well. I've enjoyed playing this more than any GTA game. Other than the story, it's fun to sneak around and blow stuff up. This game also has a few mini games that you can choose to play or not. By the way, the nudity portion of the game has to be downloaded and you can choose to turn it on or off so I dont see why some people complain about the nudity. This game does have a couple of glitches, but if you have a brain that works you can work your way around them. This game did not get the recognition that it deserved because of \"Fan Boys\" and big name titles. Too bad because this was a really well made enjoyable game. Listen up fan boys, \"try playing something else for a change\"! There's more to life than MW, Battlefield and Halo, and this game proves it! Also this game is in no way, shape or form, short.

There's more, much more to the story than that, but for the sake of spoiling the fun, all that I'll say is that Psychonauts features some of the most imaginitive and inventive level design to be seen in a platformer in quite some time, and because it's from Tim Schafer, there is a twisted and wicked sense of humor throughout.  Even on the PS2 the game looks good (the XBox version is superior, but there's nothing wrong here) and the voice acting is some of the best you'll hear in a game.

{"product_name":"B00000I1BR","description":"Let me go on record and say that I was never a fan of the original Crash Bandicoot. Even though Crash was disarmingly cute and fuzzy, and even though the game's graphics were just about as good as they got in those days, the frustrating design of the game made playing it such a painful experience that I still have flashbacks when I see small marsupials on the Discovery Channel. But just one short year after his debut, Crash is back in a sequel that is so far superior to the original that I'm willing to forget the mistakes of the past.The new storyline is simple: A very gullible Crash is corralled into collecting crystals for the evil Dr. Cortex and gems for the terrible N. Brio. There are 25 levels in all; each level contains an easy-to-find crystal and hard-to-earn gems. Instead of being forced to approach the game in a strictly linear fashion, you progress through a series of five warp rooms. Each warp room contains five levels, which you are free to tackle in any order. After you have found the crystals in each level, you can progress to the next warp room. This system of warp rooms is a great innovation; it's clear how to progress in the game, and yet you have the option of moving to a different level if you're hopelessly frustrated with one area. Best of all, you can save your game in the warp room at any time (a big improvement over the original game's horrific save system).A lot of variety is packed inside this game. You'll navigate through simple run-and-jump areas, try to outrun a very mad polar bear, work your way through sewer systems, and even fly around with a jet pack. Within each level, the basic gameplay is similar to the original Crash: Running, jumping, and spinning are still the order of the day. Even though most levels are set in a semi-3D environment, Crash Bandicoot 2 is a platform game, plain and simple. The graphics are in a league of their own among PlayStation games, and the music couldn't be better. Unlike the original, Crash 2 is rarely frustrating enough to make you want to throw your controller at the TV. In fact, some expert gamers might find Crash to be a little on the easy side.There are only two real problems with Crash Bandicoot 2. First, the semi-3D setup is sometimes hard to navigate, and you'll find yourself missing jumps because you're unable to judge distances properly. Secondly, the game is just plain cheap at times; in some areas you must sacrifice many lives until you memorize a level's layout.In any event, these problems are balanced out by the game's excellent gameplay and intelligent design. Crash Bandicoot 2 is a topnotch platform game. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. -- John Broady--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime.

With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"B.

Some cars can take a bigger beating than others, so choose carefully for races (esp. online).The most fun I had was unlocking and trying out the new cars. And then trying to get the \"Burnout\" versions of each. Two of my faves are definitely the police cruiser and the car I received with the unlock code (GT Steel Wheels), which basically looks like a mix between the proposed new Camaro and the new Shelby.Driving around the city is a blast, you can roam wherever you want to, just picking and choosing what events you want to do. And you can find events easily thanks to the map.***The CRASH system is still in the game despite what you may have heard. And it's not even hidden. Just press R1 and L1 at the same time to start \"Showtime\" on ANY road.***Half the fun of the game is just driving around exploring the city. I was able to find all the \"Crash\" gates, still working on finding all the Billboards (which you crash through of course), and I'm almost done finding all the \"Super Jumps.\"Much like the last Burnout, they've continued with different classes of cars. \"Stunt\" class earn boost quicker with tricks/jumps, etc. \"Speed\" class has the burnout boost (can only use when full). A good number of cars in this category are VERY fast, but also very weak structurally and it's a good chance it won't survive a hit. \"Aggressor\" class earns boost quicker by taking out enemies (And not only that but the bar increases in size!)._The Bad_Sometimes when you're online it can get frustrating if someone has a better car and continually crashes into you while you're trying to complete challenges, or worse, when you crash into them to take them out, it gives them the takedown because their car is more robust. Also sometimes you'll be driving along and think that you're going to miss a curb, only to have your car completely taken out by it. Which is a shame considering you're probably boosting at the time._The Ugly_Certain challenges can become VERY difficult if not frustrating. Especially the \"Stunt Events\" which require a certain number of points. Some of the races can also be difficult if you take a wrong turn along the way. I will say that when a turn is coming up your car will turn on it's blinker and every upcoming intersection is shown on the top of the screen so you know what roads are coming up. Which is a GREAT feature.Think you can handle the highway? Try driving the wrong way and into oncoming traffic and see how long you can last.------ ------- ------ -------You'll need a certain number of completed events to unlock a car, but unlocking a car isn't done until you've hunted down the driver that owns it. You have to have patience and just drive around until you see him in your rearview or he passes you on the road. Then the fun begins as you chase and run him down.Online: this is fun once you have enough cars to play around with. The races can be tough and if you take someone out, you'll get their \"card\" with a snapshot of them. If they have a webcam or the PS3 Eye hooked up, it'll take a snapshot WHEN you hit them. Heh, nice feature (just watch out for some of the gestures!).**Also another little tidbit of info: If you're in a challenge or race offline and mess up, just stop. This will stop whatever challenge you're doing and you can drive back to the start to try again. This will save you a LOT of time.Overall: A lot of fun and hours of gameplay to keep you occupied. Definitely would recommend this for Burnout fans or just someone that wants to drive around exploring, doing tricks, etc. Try visting the rock quarry, or drive around the old dirt racing track (this is a lot of fun with friends online).Also if you don't like the current track of music, just skip it with a push of a button. And if you REALLY don't like that song, go into the options and customize which ones will pop up and when. If you have a particular song you want during races, go ahead and set it up that way.Update (Sept 26th): Trophies have been added, and for those who have completed most of it, unforunately they're not retroactive. You'll have to start a new game and go from there. Good luck and have fun earning your trophies!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2008"}

Bradford \"scottfbradford\"","summary":"Best game on the 360 so far","reviewText":"I thought Call of Duty 2 was amazing, but this game is even better!  First of all, it has great graphics, sound, and smooth framerates.  Those are must-haves for a great game, but don't guarantee it.  What pushes this game over the top is that it has an interesting and deep single player campaign and great multiplayer options.  The campaign requires lots of thinking (weapon choices, attack routes, etc.) and stealth.  It reminded verymuch of another great game-Far Cry Instincts.  The controls are a bit complex since at times you have command of a 3 man squad, or a group of tanks/Bradley's, or an unmanned aerial vehicle.  But it is easy to get up to speed.  In multiplayer, you can play deathmatches against others or team up with them and go against the computer.  There is even a multiplayer campaign option-many more options than in Call of Duty 2.  All of this adds up to hours of gameplay and replay value.  Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000TT4GBG","reviewerName":"Cale E. Reneau \"Mound of Wires\"","summary":"The Dream Becomes a Reality!","reviewText":"The Good: It is the ultimate party game. It's fun to play every instrument (except maybe for bass). Cool visual style.The Bad: $170 price tag. Guitar peripheral a mixed-bag. Unfulfilling single player mode.For the uninitiated, let's play a quick round of catch-up. Harmonix, the game developer responsible for the massively popular (and rightly so) music rhythm series, Guitar Hero, has taken that idea to the next level. This time around, instead of just rocking a sweet axe, a drum kit and microphone are included in the package. The idea is to offer up the ultimate multiplayer music experience, that of being in a real live Rock Band! Does it succeed?In places, yes. Let's start off with the guitar, shall we? Any person familiar with the Guitar Hero series should have no problem jumping into Rock Band on the guitar. It plays identically to it's spiritual predecessor. In the past, however, official guitar peripherals have been designed and manufactured by Red Octane. Now they're developed without the help of of that great name. The result is an aesthetically pleasing design, paired with a concoction of smart moves and missteps. The peripheral (which resembles a Fender Stratocaster) has fret buttons that are flush with the neck of the guitar (both at the end and closer to the body). This makes it more difficult to keep track of where your fingers are located than it would on a Red Octane guitar, but after a few practice songs it hardly matters.The largest problem with the guitar is the strum bar which, even though it is entirely silent when strummed (finally), feels too spongey for it's own good. In a fast song like The Ramones' \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" where you're required to strum quickly, it can become difficult to lose track of where you are in the song. The old Red Octane guitars had a definite \"stop\" to it that you could feel (and hear). These do not. Overall, it's a somewhat decent peripheral (even if the failure rate is remarkably high). Still, I won't be throwing out my Red Octane guitars anytime soon.The microphone peripheral is, well, a microphone. There's no getting around this one. Even if you can't play guitar, you can still shred the stuff at Guitar Hero (I'm proof of that). But if you can't sing, you may want to do your friends and family a favor and pass the mic to someone who can. Accordingly, the gameplay is fairly straightforward. Getting a high rating on your vocal performance will require you to sing the song well. Like the other instruments on the game, \"notes\" will scroll across the screen and it is your job to not only hit the right notes, but to begin and end the notes at the correct time. An arrow to the right of the screen will tell you if you need to shift your voice to match the correct pitch, just in case you couldn't tell on your own. As you increase the difficulty of the game, you'll have to be more accurate in your notes as well as your hits and releases. Things can get pretty unforgiving at higher difficulties.But like all songs, there are times when you're not going to be singing, just standing around. Harmonix has smartly added in a nice gimmick to keep you busy. During these times, small dots will appear on the screen and you'll have to tap the microphone in time to simulate shaking a tambourine or clapping your hands. It's not the most enthralling gameplay ever, but it keeps you from getting bored while your buddy is wailing away on the guitar. The worst part about singing is trying to tackle a song that you're unfamiliar with. Fortunately, Harmonix has done it's best to get a wide variety of songs in to make sure that most people know a few songs beforehand.Ahh, but most people aren't going to be buying Rock Band for the guitar or the microphone. They already own games like that. No, the big draw for Rock Band is the new drum peripheral. And it's great! I had my doubts the first time I hopped behind a demo kit, but now that I've had substantial time with the drum peripheral, it's safe to say that this is what people will be fighting over at the inevitable Rock Band parties. The build quality of this peripheral is phenominal. It feels solid, and unless you're taking out your aggression on the bass pedal with cement shoes, you should have a hard time breaking it. Real wooden sticks are included in the package, and though the pads don't have as much bounce as a real kit would, the experience of sitting behind the kit and rocking out is awesome!The gameplay is very similar to the guitars. Notes will scroll vertically from the top of the screen, and you must hit the correct colors in rhythm. When a long orange line appears, you must step on the bass pedal. It's all pretty straightforward and self-explanatory for anyone familiar with Harmonix's other games. In addition to that, there are also \"fill sections\" where you're free to bang around on the drums at your leisure and hitting the crash cymbal at the end of the section will trigger \"overdrive\" (Rock Band's \"Star Power\"). The fill sections can be a curse too, however. While a real-life drummer could knock out a fill without hesitation, someone who absolutely sucks at playing real drums (myself) will find themselves struggling to keep rhythm when they're not spoon-fed scrolling notes. It really breaks-up the gameplay. When you add in the fact that these fill sections will become more prominent until you activate your overdrive, it can get kind of annoying. Also annoying is when you're playing guitar while someone else comes across a fill section and butchers it, screwing you up in the process. It's a cool idea, but poorly implemented.And now on to the game, itself. Single player is set up almost exactly like the Guitar Hero series. There is a career mode, where you play through the game's entire soundtrack, and there is quickplay. Career mode is the game's biggest failure. It's an absolute chore to complete this mode by yourself when all you want to do is jam with friends. And you have to complete it if you want to unlock all of the game's songs too (a huge, huge misstep). Unlike Guitar Hero, there are no encore songs, and therefore no surprises. It's just a straightforward play-through mode with little to no reward for completing it.Multiplayer is where it's at. And unlike most Xbox 360 games, local multiplayer severely trumps online play. When you're in a room with 3 other people in your virtual band, it can get pretty fun. You just don't get that same feeling when you're going online against people you don't know and can't interact with. The biggest attraction in multiplayer mode is the Band World Tour mode (no Xbox Live functionality here), where you and your friends can start a virtual band and tour the world. The better you perform, the more fans you attain. Likewise, if you fail a song, you lose fans. You can also unlock vans, busses, and other rock gear to help you on your tour across the globe. The whole idea of this mode is to realistically mimic the real-life journey of a real-life band. For real. Harmonix has also added in some choices to the gameplay that will keep things interesting (i.e. Will you sell out or not? Will you play this large venue and risk losing more fans or stick to the small one?). It all makes for a surprisingly fun, and engrossing multiplayer mode.The standard multiplayer modes are here as well, including \"Tug of War\" and \"Score Duel\" (similar to Guitar Hero's \"Face-Off\" and \"Pro Face-Off,\" respectively). Unfortunately, these only work if you have two of the same instrument lying around. Unless you're unfathomably wealthy, that means you'll likely be dueling on guitars only for the time being.The game has a pretty cool visual style, with heavy distortion and filters applied to almost all in-game character animations. It gives it a very raw feel, which fits the game's rock-theme perfectly. There is a pretty deep character customization system too, where you can create a digital version of yourself or your idealized self. Tattoos, piercings, and fauxhawks are all available for you to play around with, and you can even unlock more through the game's career mode. Load times can be a bit grueling (at least on my early-model Xbox 360), and the lack of any wireless peripherals is an absolute joke! Expect plenty of tangles, especially from that 20-foot mic cable. The game also comes with a USB splitter to allow you to connect all peripherals, but unfortunately it requires it's own power supply.In the end though, there are very few things to complain about when it comes to Rock Band. Harmonix's dream game has finally made it's way onto store shelves, and if you're lucky and rich enough to snag a copy (the game currently retails for $170), you will have an absolutely amazing time rocking out with friends. If you don't have any friends though (or at least any that would be interested in playing Rock Band), you may want to spend your money elesewhere. Rock Band's single player experience is fun for a short time, but you'll find yourself longing to play with real live human beings before too long. And if all you're interested in is the drums, you can always just wait until early 2008 to pick up a copy of the game with the drums only (for much cheaper). Anyways, the point is that Rock Band is one of the finest music rhythm games ever made and quite possibly the greatest party game ever to come into existence. If Guitar Hero was your thing, and you have plenty of friends to play with (and, of course, the money), buy Rock Band! You will not be disappointed.9 out of 10 Stars","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2007"}

The reason I say this is because fundamentally these things I mention will probably not change along the lines, they are the core of the game and will probably remain the same.Combat and Gameplay are wonky. I always feel like I am fighting against the controls to get my character to respond the way I want, or do the stuff I want.Camera angle goes a bit crazy. When talking to people in town an interacting with them. That camera likes to hide behind a wall sometimes. Frustrating.The game has a cartoonish look.Upgrade system is a bit cheap. Rather than being able to just upgrade weapons the good ol fashioned way, you know a blacksmith or something, you have to go on this magical road with these magical gems and chest to get em up to power.. Okay? Its annoying.The world is restricting. Your set on these little trails that you gotta follow from point 'a' to 'b'.. no freedom.Graphics are okay. But nothing great.The game isn't fun, its just tedious.. even accessing quest is annoying. Instead of being able to just accept a quest from someone who needs help. You first have to \"interact\" with them.. stimulate them a bit, to get them to say \"Hey I need help\" and then you gotta hold down the button.. why I don't know?  to use up more time? to accept the quest.Changing outfits, is overly complicated..Checking out stats, checking on weapons.. its all tedious. Its not simple, or straight forward. Its not like you can just go into a menu highlight said item and check it.. noooooooooooooooooooo! you gotta go to your \"sanctuary\".I got this game for free through xbox lives event. And honestly free is about what its worth.I know this game has a lot of rave reviews, and people are really enjoying it. But I'm giving my honest perspective on the game. Its really a sloppy kiddish mess. I don't know how dancing, or belching or whatever is really innovation as far as a game goes. Maybe its all the underlying code of the game that really is the advancement, not the graphics.. in this case Lionhead studios needs to team up with another company and offer consultation services.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2013"}

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Good Morning America","summary":"This game sucks","reviewText":"Basically, if you're a big fan of 1 shot deaths, , annoying quicktime events, infinitely respawning enemies, and just grinding through gorgeous levels that you're to busy and too frustrated to admire, then this game has to top your list. I hate, HATE, grinding through lame cookie cutter enemies with a sub par combat mechanic. This game could have been great but is just brought to it's needs by long, frustratingly protracted combat encounters that are neither fun, nor require any actual skill to get through. There is even a point where you'll be swarmed with snipers, thugs, super thugs(that take like 20 shots to kill), grenades, et all and you'll make it to the end and die and not realize why, until it hits you, the chick died. As if the encounter didn't suck enough, the developers made it an escort mission. I ended up thinking, I hate this game too often. Sadly, like the first game in this series, all the good is obliterated by the bad, and you'll find yourself playing JUST to finish, to get through the game; instead of actually enjoying it and admiring the technical marvel that it is. Sad.Uncharted 1: HorribleUncharted 2: BrilliantUncharted 3: Somewhere between 1 and 2Story: OK, not as good as the second one, but a little more interesting than the first one.Graphics: Fantastic, on par with Uncharted 2Game play: Sigh - this is where it gets ugly. Many encounters are fine, but unfortunately there are far too many where you'll find yourself SWARMED with enemies and fighting with the controls. You often take cover behind things you don't want to, and find your self uncovered at the weirdest times. This is an issue persistent through the game. Naughty Dog LOVES this Gears of War battle mechanic, and much to their detriment they rely solely on it. What makes matters worse, is that they are just terrible at implementing it. You'll find yourself far too often dieing over and over until you luck past the endless sea of enemies. Die and you get to slog through the tedious grind all over. This isn't fun and ruins large portions of the game. One of the worst parts is that the enemies constantly respawn, they are often endless and just sucking  whatever fun you may be having right out of the game. You just want them to stop so you can explore a little bit, but nope you're just grinding, grinding, grinding away to the end. The controls just aren't nailed down and feel slow, sluggish and altogether wonky.The game is good enough to push through and complete, unfortunately what could have been a great game is just boiled down to a sub par shooter with stunning visuals and a pretty fun story. When you're not being gang-raped by enemies, the game is actually pretty cool and can be challenging, but there are portions, one in particular where you're swimming through an old ship grave yard where I almost quit. What should have been a jaw droppingly gorgeous encounter, one of the best in the game turned into the worst portion of the game. I played the Last of Us and that is indeed Naughty Dog's masterpiece, but even that was slightly marred with some tedious grinding. Like I said, Uncharted 1 was a total grind, 2 was great, everything was fixed, Uncharted 3 was a huge step backward. It wasn't as bad as Uncharted 1, but no where near as good as Uncharted 2. I hope they stop making these games until they figure out how to balance the number of enemies, and stop relying on overlong battles to pad the play time, and to nail down the controls and cover system. if you played the other 2, yes, you have to play this, I just wish the combat could be refined and balanced better.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2013"}

I've played thousands of video games (no exaggeration, seriously) and this is one of my least favorite levels ever, I don't know why I have such great distaste for it. It feels rushed, objectiveness, boring and depressing. Anyways the game is fun, a lot of the game has a good sense of adventure to it, light puzzle solving elements, stock firefights, expected plot twists and witty PG13 dialogue. On paper it sounds generic but it has its own charm, It impressed me enough to pick up the first two.

The first few minutes were filled with a bit of shock as I attempted to grasp the concept of not using a controller. However, after I settled in I was anything but amazed.Months have passed now and Microsoft has promised improvements. The final product is actually a bit worse than what was shown earlier in the year as Microsoft cut corners to lower costs and raise profitability. The most noticeable problem is the delay with the device. All inputs have 240-360 millisecond delay which translates into frustration as you try to input commands in a similar fashion to the long-lived controller. Even after trying two games, it was apparent that the lag is just a product of the device. With that said, myself and many just can't see Kinect working with any AAA core games without some form of controller input.The biggest problem with Kinect is the environmental requirement. For one, you need an astronomical amount of space to make Kinect work to its proper potential. Microsoft suggests 8 feet, but playing with full movement or a second player requires upward of 10 feet of space. Most living rooms, including mine, simply don't have this kind of space. Secondly, the environment of your room has to be proper specifications to work properly. Wearing skirts, having vivid colors behind you, and sitting down all leads to a lack of response from the device. This creates a huge point of contention when you don't have what Microsoft considers an ideal living room.In addition, the library is simply awful. There are 15 games, and only two of them aren't frustrating. Even then, they both are low production value games that lack replay value.When you add these things up and mix them in a pot with the $150 price tag, you have a device that Microsoft has put all of its marbles in but didn't execute. The Xbox 360 is known for hardcore games such as Halo and Gears of War but its spending billions of dollars on arguably the most casual peripheral on the market.To conclude, Kinect is a frustrating device that I can't recommend to anybody. The technology is cool, but was done years ago for less cost. Being able to navigate menus with gestures sounds cool, but is annoying and arduous. Stay away from this device and spend your money on something that will actually deliver entertainment.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2010"}

A two-player game? 14 feet MINIMUM. To paraphrase Jaws, \"We're gonna need a bigger room.\"When I lugged my 360 & my Kinect down to my basement arcade, I admit I had semi-fun with the system (being semi-intoxicated may have helped). It isn't nearly as accurate as the Playstation Move, but it is more innovative. It's just that, I can't keep my 50\" plasma, my surround sound system and my 360 down in the basement. Which makes it useless. Unless I want to devote 100% of my entertainment time to Microsoft's latest gimmick.Unless Microsoft introduces a controller with buttons (which I suspect they'll do within the next half year), the Kinect is for casual gamers and casual gamers ONLY. The casual games, as far as casual games go, aren't bad. They're actually pretty fun. Not as enjoyable as Wii Sports Resort and not close to the accuracy or entertainment of Sony Move's Sports Champions. Still, there's a NOVELTY to these games that neither the Nintendo Wii or the Sony Move can provide.So, if you can afford it -- and if your house is at least the size of a bowling alley -- this may be worth your while. Especially if you don't mind sitting 77 feet away from the HDTV you invested so much into sitting close to to get the full benefit of 1080p.But if you're not super-rich, and if facial recognition isn't more important to you than quality gaming, the Kinect's not your thing. Unfortunately, MS took a high-end concept and ran with it. They didn't care about their devoted fans. They didn't care about gamers. But hey, they're currently bragging about personalizing advertisements on the console based on facial recognition.That counts for something right? Right?!? Either way, the Kinect is amusing for about 37 minutes. Hope that's enough for you to get your money's worth. If not, I guess you could argue with it by saying, \"Kinect, I am not pleased.\" But it wouldn't understand you, which is typical.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2010"}

I haven't played any other FF games except for FFVII.  I put 6-8 hr into game and wished I could return it and wait till the price drop to 30-40 bucks, since it is not a great game at all.Gameplay, exploration, battle strategies.What this game is sorely lacking is game play, exploration and battle strategies.  The game play is linear it is like they are trying to push you through the game and you can't really go back and explore, once you finish a chapter you are done, there is no world map to go back and forth from.  The old FF7 is 3rd person perspective or overview where you can explore more.  This game is wonderfully design but the level is also linear in design and gameplay.  You basically running through a tunnel, bridge or a valley most of the game, once in a while you stop and look around.  The third person perspective is behind the back like Dragon Age but with tunnel vision.  Battle mechanic is changed for the worst, haven't play X, XII.., but in 7 you are able to control all characters in a turn base.  Here you control one person the other just do whatever they want.  Square added this paradigm shift which is a joke, where other can be a medic, commando, whatever.  Back then (FF7) you don't need this since any characters can block, heal, attack, cast spell, revival, summon etc.  They have simplified the battle mechanic to be so simple that you just hit the \"X\" button, kind of like Heavy Rain, but not as fun.  The rpg element isn't that deep or advance in this series.  Even Diablo copied FF7 to add orb or mana into weapon, there is none here.  You don't really pick much items in this game either.Graphic/ mechanicAt first, I couldn't believe it looks so good at 1080p on my LCD.  It just claims the best looking console game over Heavy Rain.  The environment is great looking, detail and deep.  The lack of interaction is quite sad.  You walk up to it and press \"x\", could of use some RE interaction/ physic, but it is a FF game.  There is no frame rate drop at all.  I guess the 360 version is compressed, but there is none here.  The game load quite fast compare to Dragon Age.  There are cut-scenes like every third battle, I am guessing they are loading the environment in the background.  This game shockingly have little load screen and didn't install any file on my PS3(not taking about save file just install file).StorySo far the bread and butter of FF series, the story, just isn't that great in this game.  I really don't care for the characters too much.  Some are annoying, other are punks.  Most of the characters are like teenagers or younger dealing with world issues.  There is sense of FF7 soldier bad government in the plot.  The music and soundtrack just isn't that magical either.FF7 was so good that it left a lasting impression in my mind that after all these years to play FF again, I felt it fail quite miserably.  As a rpg it fail to have depth like today games: Dragon Age or even Sacred II.  The linear storyline is similar to Heavy Rain, but is just not that engaging or tense.  I just want you to same your money and pick it up when the price drop.  We don't pay developers for just production value, we pay for game play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2010"}

Each gang have their own style and different weaponry.You fight against all these gangs one at a time by, random shootouts, missions, and taking over gang houses. Aside from the missions, you have sidequests and some of the activities/diverisions make a return from SR2; escort, trafficking, trailblazing and a few others. Though I was disappionted with several activities and diversions that were CUT from this sequel. I still had tons of fun!Your character's melee abilites are much better as you can pull off fancy fight moves that can kill NPCs and enemy characters. You also have finishing moves whenever you fight some of the bosses or stronger enemies. Your weapons can be upgraded to hold more ammo, shoot other ammo, and increase their firepower. Your character's many abilities can be improved as well, such as sprinting, resistance to bullets and much much more. All of this is done through leveling up and and buying them with cash you earn from the mayhem and destruction you cause!Lots of new toys to play with including a drone, incinderary bullets and explosive bullets, electro grenade and... how about having cars, tanks, or chopper on delivery?! Are you getting outnumbered by enemies? Call your homies by phone and watch them come combat by your side. Though this game lacks the realism of GTA, its way more fun!

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

It is very original. The game has some strong(ish) language later on in it, though, so it shouldn't really be for kids. It's also a little easy, but since they are coming out with like nine more sequels it's ok.  A very awesome game though.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2000"}

I played a few multiplayer matches but just to see what it was like. This review is based on everything about this game EXCEPT the multiplayer aspect.Story: 5 starsStory was great. It starts right where brood wars left off. It introduces new characters (mostly all good...the scientist nerd guy annoyed me. He seemed out of place). I really have no complaints here. You play as Jim Raynor as he flies around the Universe stealing artifacts from the extremist protoss, fighting zerg, and trying to be a thorn in Emperor Mengsk's side whenever possible.Gameplay: 4 starsGameplay was also great. They kept the same units and added some new ones which were great. (Might I say I loved the Thors and Vikings. Vikings=best new unit. Voice acting for the Thor's. YES!! Arnold Schwarzeneggers drive these things. \"I am heeer. CLICK ME!!\" haha yes). The upgrades that you could do in the Armory were also a nice touch. I also loved the mercenary aspect that you could hire special units to come fight with you. Wish you could have hired more than one merc battlecruiser though. The only complaint I only have 2 complaints about the gameplay really. 1) It seemed like it took me forever to get battlecruisers/thors. Now the thors were part of the story so I can understand that but the battlecruisers took a ridiculously long time to acquire. 2) The game just seemed short to me. I don't know why but it did. Maybe the memories of me playing starcraft and broodwars back to back affected my opinion but it just seemed like after watching ******Spoilers***************** Raynor walk of into the sunset ********End spoilers************* that I should be loading up the zerg/protoss campaigns. I did love having the mini protoss campaign though. Definitely a good thing there. But overall...4 starsEverything Else: 3 starsThis was a minor annoyance but enough of one for me to complain about it. Why do I have to sign up for battlenet and stay registered just so I can play the darn campaign? Now if I don't sign into the game for 30 days I have to re-register. Or I can register as a guest...on my own computer...with the game that I bought. Ridiculous. But like I said a minor annoyance.Overall I give this game 4 stars. I loved what they did with the characters and the story. That by far was the best part of the game. Overall the gameplay was awesome as well. It is a little short and can take some time to get the weapons you want but overall the gameplay is just as good or maybe even better (from a campaign perspective) than the first games. It is annoying that you have to register yourself online to play the singleplayer campaign..or sign in as a guest on your own system but it is something that is definitely worth doing to play this awesome game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy. If  only it were a bit longer.--David Jenkins. --Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Corey Turner \"The Musician\"","summary":"Mario or Not, Still a Superb Title","reviewText":"Luigi's Mansion was released at the launch of the Nintendo Game Cubes cycle.Dating back to 2001, this title still kicks. A bit off the beaten path of former Mario style games, Luigi's Mansion was a mixed bag for some.The graphics are dated, but the gameplay is still thorough enough to be worth playing. Many modern games strive on powerful graphics, when dated you realize many of the flaws. The game is mysterious, mild paced, overall good fun. The game itself can be completed rather quickly, but the first play through is highly memorable.Controls are a little stiff, and there are no technical levels. Mario games emphasized level based objectives. While Luigi's Mansion still has objectives they are unlocked by further progression. The objectives are to rid a mansion of ghouls. To do so you are given a vacuum, designed specifically for absorbing such ghosts. The variety in ghost is nice, the scenery is plot specific, but changes when prompted. Mario has disappeared, Luigi gained a mansion, coincidence?I found few last generation titles to still hold a candle to modern titles, the timeless ones are now proving themselves. This game is fairly unique and offers a different style of gameplay. Out of the gamecube titles track some other good ones that are rather cheap now.

The songs, dances, graphics, how it rates your score, is superb.  I love being able to download a bunch of games from the Wii (via internet on the Wii) too. When my granddaughters (ages 4, 5, 8 & 9) danced to this game (all at the same time) I thought it was cute.  I only knew a couple disco songs on it & never heard of the others but I liked the songs being upbeat.  I decided I needed to try this game out for myself so when one of the girls got tired, I joined in.  Fell in love with this game immediately.  It's like having a dance workout video except it's cartoon-ish, colorful & it rates your ability to follow the dancer.  It also has words on the bottom of the screen for those who just want to sing along while waiting for their turn to dance & I love the icons that appear to give you a hint of the next dance move.  The song plays, the cartoonish dancers dance, & there's no one yelling over the music giving instructions (like in a workout video).  There's lots of giggling that happens with the girls have a sleepover & play this game together.  Some of my granddaughters friends liked to play alone to practice before having a competition with the others.  Personally, when everyone's gone, I like to dance exercise alone the best but I have to admit it is funny to watch the girls singing along & dancing.  They drink up ice water, say they're exhausted, rest, & then go back to dancing.  Just Dance 2 is definitely the favorite but to my surprise, I often see the Just Dance 1 being played with the girls dancing along.  I highly recommend this game for ages 3 - 54.  Mostly girls play it, although I have seen boys & men play it to prove they can get a higher score than their family members.  This is always fun to watch.  I never thought I'd see my husband (54) dance to \"Hot Stuff\" with me!  Note: Everytime I try to sneak out my camera to tape the others, I usually don't do well enough to capture the spontaneous fun since everyone gets suddenly camera shy.  Oh well... still lots of fun & well worth getting.  About downloading the extra dance songs: this costs some extra money \"Wii Bucks\" which is explained better on the Wii site.  Basically, I paid $20 for downloading a bunch of songs I wanted & ignored the rest.  These are saved on my Wii machine & on an SD card that is in my Wii machine.  I'm not using the right terminology, but hopefully you'll all understand.  I ended up downloading \"It's Not Unusual\", \"Mambo #5\", \"Born to Be Wild\", \"American Girl\", & other extra songs.  I'm the only one I know who has done this.  Everyone else is content with the songs & dances on the original Just Dance 2.  So when they come over they have those songs they know plus the ones I downloaded (which I know better) :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00D41GCVS","description":"Sonic moves like never before. Vault over obstacles, free run up and along walls and sky dive between islands at lightning speed. Plus the Spin Dash is back.","reviewerName":"Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"Deadly for the wrong reasons","reviewText":"For months now, I've owned theNintendo 3DS version of Sonic's latest outing(If you'd like, you can see my review on that - I gave it a 4). Ever since I've been a newly proud owner of the Wii U, though, things seemed to be looking bright for the console edition, as that was one game I eyed. Now that I finally got the game, picked it up and put it down numerous times, I can't help but feel that this is one unstable game. Whenever I wanted to really relish its atmosphere, it decides to throw me off in various ways instead.When you first get into the game, it plays like a winner. The first couple worlds of the game offer splendid level design that cooks up multiple pathways as you run, jump, Spin Dash, and use the signature Homing Attack on classic-era enemies. However, no longer is there any Boosting a laSonic GenerationsorColors. Instead, we can actually move Sonic around the place smoothly, and he can run up walls via the new parkour play mechanic.Sonic is surrounded by scenic environments (With the game being at 60 frames-per-second, no less!), and the music is outright awesome and diverse!As great as the game sounds so far, it slowly becomes worse until you hit the fourth world, Frozen Factory, in which the title's flaws really thrive by then. Initially, the only worries are that the parkour isn't easy to control when running on sides of walls, and that the Wisp power-ups have no reason or explanation of being in the game. They aren't as fun to use, if not worthy to play with (and you have to press A to resume the game after using one). Oh, and there's the briefcase for whenever you want to use items.Why can't we just find the item capsules in the actual level? It's not convenient to tap the briefcase on the Wii U's GamePad to get one! Same goes for hints (?s)! Plus, why does Sonic have to pop a truckload of animal capsules to progress on to certain points in the game? Not only does it force you to backtrack, but the numbers required are excessive, regardless of whether or not you use circus tents to play bonus games to earn animals.And I didn't even mention the later problems.Enter the bosses, which are disappointments compared to how they were in previous installments in the series. The Deadly Six are one-dimensional beings who are there just to be this game's group of baddies, featuring the most generic cartoon tropes ever for each one. And they put up no fight....until deep into the game. Normally, they only take 4 hits (2 if you charge your Homing Attack each time), and their attacks are uninteresting.Then as Desert Ruins hits the scene, that's when you come across changes in gameplay....a LOT. Not too badly here, though, as there's just one level where Sonic runs automatically. When Tropical Coast comes in, it forces you to guide moving fruit into blenders in one level. And then as Frozen Factory arrives, each level becomes its own thing. Sonic will have to try and deal with the stupidly slippery ice physics, and also turn into a snowball and behave like the marble inMarble Madness. There's so many levels that change up the entirety of the gameplay often that it never feels consistent.When there are levels that stay with the 3D/2D platforming formula, though, the game decides to throw in surprisingly difficult pieces of enemy layout and level design at you. Unfortunately, the game handles these parts as well as its overall structure. The game feels rushed, as there are portions of levels that don't allow for freedom in how the level is played. They are overly precise and rely a lot on trial-and-error. Lava Mountain, the final world, is appropriately DEMONIC for containing all of these troubles in design in every frickin' corner!More particularly, Lava Mountain Act 2 (Which has aquatic scenery - Because lack of consistency), where Sonic uses grind rails the entire time. He also has to avoid INSTANT-DEATH MINE CART BOMBS (Yes, even Super Sonic can't survive them) placed in the worst possible positions while also needing to jump precisely to grind rails spread sporadically or else he'll fall into the bottomless pit below. This stage sums up this entire game in one level.So...Why does this game get a 3 instead of a 2 or 1-star rating? Because the game still has the potential to be fun. There really are levels that are a joy to play through. Not every bit of my experience in the game was miserable. However, the game floods itself with disappointment, and considering that Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations were great titles, it's a shame they are followed up by this.If you ask me if you should get this or the 3DS version, I say definitely go for the latter. The handheld counterpart not only features one gameplay style (The 3D/2D formula, albeit with a few level-specific gimmicks that don't change the gameplay drastically), has no backtracking involved, but the control is SO much better and more reliable (especially with parkour mechanics - I was able to parkour like a pro!), and the challenge is very well fairer (there are numerous opportunities for extra lives, and there's a lot less trial-and-error/other annoyances). I'm not saying the game doesn't have its own flaws, but it still provides a better experience than this console version.Or if you didn't already play them, you could just buy Sonic Colors or Sonic Generations instead.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2014"}

The power button is now back on the inside of the case though moved to a more better position so you don't accidentally turn off your system mid game like with the original DS. The  power button is more reformed now, being only a circle instead of a rectangle like the original DS was or a slider like the lite was (I feel Nintendo tried to copy Sony's power slider. The volume button has also been changed and moved instead of it being a slider its now a button (very welcomed changed IMHO) and is moved to the left top side.The outer casing is what made me buy a DSi, its finish is like the original DS in that it is hard to scratch or chip,but instead of being glossy colors its now just matte. One thing I HATED about the DS lite was that the finish was very easy to scratch/damage if you weren't extremely careful at all times (although just like the 1st gen PS3 the finish will scratch itself over time). Overall the DSi has a more, dare I say mature look whereas the original looked like a Gameboy Advance SP with wings,and was very bulky and had an overall kiddy look, and the Lites looked almost like a fancy makeup box. With the DSi I don't feel weird playing it in public because it doesn't have the strange looks of the older systems. The DSi is also lacking a GBA port,but I never play GBA games and I feel with the port gone it gives the DSi a very sleek look. But to soften the blow for some people a SD card slot was added to store various things (has HCSD compatibility)When you turn on the DSi you will notice a major overhaul of the interface,no longer do you have to turn off the system after you make changes in the settings,and you can 'hot swap' games (you don't have to turn off the DSi to change games). The interface is very similar to the Wii. One thing I like is that the DSi has a built in web browser (no more $30 add-on!). As well as that there is also a music player (AAC files only ;.;) DSi shop (similar to the Wii shop) voice recorder and camera software and a few other misc options.Thats right the DSi has 2 cameras now one in the middle of the hinge,and the other on the outside of the top lid. They are both .3 megapixel cameras that take decent pictures (don't expect them to be pretty blown up) That look good only on the DSi screens.Another thing I really like is that the DSi has upgradable firmware to possibly add .MP3 compatibly to the music player and a longer duration voice recording (10 seconds is mediocre at best) It should be noted that the DSi has more ram (for internet use)and a slightly faster CPU as well as 1 extra screen brightness)So,should you upgrade?Well in short,yes. If you have an original DS do not upgrade to a lite,spend the extra money and go for a DSi,with the extra ram and faster CPU DS games with soon start putting those extras to good use..leaving the DS&DS; lite in the dust. I also recommend you get a case protector (one that stays on your DS all the time) and some screen protectors to protect your investment from unwanted bumps and bruises) Of course with all these new features the price has been tacked up a wee bit instead of being $130 the DSi is now $170. Overall though the extra cost is justifiable.To Summarize:Pros:+New,improved button layout+MUCH better finish+bigger screens+more sleek and mature+SD card slot added+Interface overhaul+Upgradable firmware+Faster CPU and more Ram+Case is slightly longer but looks a better IMO+Slimmer+Nice blue power light replacing the green one=/= GBA slot removedCons:-Reduced battery life (with more features comes more batt. drainage)-Smaller battery (the DSi is slimmer)-Web browser still slow=/= GBA slot removedAs you can see, the Pros outweigh the cons by a large margin.

{"product_name":"B001T8S62Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Raqel Redfox","summary":"Love this Handheld...","reviewText":"There are so many things to say about this version of the DS. It does everything you expected it to do and more...PROS:1)The camera! There's one camera on the inside of the DSi and one on the outside. You can switch the cameras with a touch of your stylus. You can take a bunch of pictures (I think 300) while the quality isn't even bad. Here's what you can do with the pictures:-Use the graffiti tool to draw on the pictures or put stickers on them.-Use the frame tool to put creative frames around your pictures.-Use the morph tool to morph to faces into one and see what they look like.-Use the expression tool to make a face look like it has a different expression.-Use the distortion tool to distort the picture by pulling on the screen with the stylus.-Use the kaleidoscope tool to make the picture look like you're looking through a kaleidoscope.-Use the color changer tool to change the colors of your picture.There are many more tools but I'm not going to name all of them.2) DSiWare! You can download many different games and tools by purchasing DSi points. You start off with 1000 points as a gift, but you have to buy the rest. So far, I own Bird and Beans, WarioWare Snapped!, and Paper Airplane. In WarioWare Snapped! you use the camera to play the mini-games. Bird and Beans is a Gameboy game that also comes with the sequel, Bird and Beans 2. Paper Airplane is a game where the characters from WarioWare appear in windows to tell you your flight time--you have to keep flying a paper airplane and not bump into any walls. There's also things like Animal Crossing/Mario calculators and other tools. I think the next game I'm going to buy is Dr. Mario...3) Music/Voice Changer! I don't use this tool, but it's still cool. If you have an SD card, then you can put music on your DSi. You can also record something and then you can distort it to maybe make it higher/lower or faster/slower.4) A Menu! This allows you to display a photo(s) by putting a symbol on it (clover, star, etc.) in the album. You also don't have to completely turn off the DS when you want to exit a game. You just press the power button once and you're at the menu. Very innovative.There are probably more pros that I'm missing, but now I'll start with the cons.CONS:1) No Gameboy Slot! This isn't a problem for me because I already own an SP but I know some people that are upset about this. Nope, there's no Gameboy slot, unlike the Lite.I think I got all the downsides...Overall, it's a great hand-held. I was supposed to get my DSi for $169.99 but GameStop let me trade in my DS Lite for $70 off my DSi. If you can find a good deal, it would be well-worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2009"}

Taking cover and moving while in it can get you killed too easily.  The camera sometimes gets in your way when you take aim or try to pull off a slowed-down multi-shot special move with your instinct.  You get a wall or piece of cover in your face instead of a clear view of your enemies.  Otherwise the gameplay is very much like Blood Money, only more fluid and intuitive.  It is definitely an improvement, yet not too different.  Which is good, I suppose.There are way too many cut scenes to suffer through as the game tries to tell its story.  Yet, I cannot see how you can avoid them your first time through.The A.I. is better.  Instinct is a neat addition that helps you get your bearings in each board.  The boards are detailed and pretty, so often it is hard to tell what can be interacted with and what is simply scenery.  Instinct helps point out everything you need to be aware of.If you like Hitman, you will get a solid Hitman game here.  If you are new to the series, you will probably be blown away by this game.  It is a solid action game that allows you to run and gun, sneak, stealth kill, or strike and hide.  The kill animations are great.The boards are not as big as the game leads you to believe.  They are split into sections.  Unlike Blood Money.  So that is a flaw, in my opinion.  They should have given us a GTA-type open world for each level.Anyway, it is a fun game with lots of weapons and stealth options.  It is NOT worth the price stores are asking right now.  I bought mine because I got half off.  Wait until the price drops to 25 bucks.  Especially if you are a Hitman fan.  You will feel like you got ripped off for a prettier version of Blood Money.

Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories is the perfect game for the PSP.Let me say again - this is a MATURE game. There is sex, there is swearing, there is a LOT of violence. Anybody who buys this game for their 8 year old is making a grave mistake. It really bothers me a lot when people buy adult games for kids and say \"Oh I didn't know\". It clearly says right on the box. There are a TON of adult gamers out there, and we like mature games, just like we like R rated movies. These games aren't meant for kids. They are made exactly the way us adults like them - full of adult situations.That being taken care of, this is an *incredible* game. Let's start with the gameplay. It's hard to even imagine, looking at say a DS or GameBoy game, that any handheld could produce gameplay like this. You have a fully detailed, fully laid out cityscape. You can drive down any road, walk around amongst the people, watch the rain and sun and fog roll in. The storyline is great. The missions are great. Heck, even the sidegames are great. There are hidden packages to find, rankings to achieve, races to run, you name it. You could play this for months.The graphics are spellbindingly beautiful. It's hard to believe this is a handheld game. You get rain falling down around your car as it careens past easily identifiable stores on a road, while pedestrians stroll down the sidewalks. From shooting tasks, to driving races, to handling a number of other situations, the graphics draw you into this world.Let's talk about audio. There is a great selection of \"radio stations\" to listen to as you drive around. The voice acting really draws you into the story, to relate to the various characters involved. I've always loved the audio on the GTA games, and this is no exception.Yes, this game requires a 2.0 update to run. The update is INCLUDED ON THE DISK. Anybody who has trouble finding it must be missing some basic computer skills. It's right on the main disk menu when you put the disk into the system. It's free, it's included, it's easy.I can't say enough good things about this game. Let me try to figure out some down sides. Hmmm, well it's on a small screen. Heck, that's the whole point, that it's on a portable system. When I go on trips, I can bring it along with me. I think that's fantastic, to have a GTA system to bring on the plane or bus. I *did* find the storyline in general to be on the annoying side, truth be told. I really liked the original GTA3 storyline where you were a valued employee moving up in the ranks due to your skill. I found it frustrating in this one to play in essence an \"uppity jerk\" who is constantly put down either by his own mob buddies or his mom or other people. It didn't make the game nearly as enjoyable for me. This is my leisure time after all, to endulge in fun dreams. My fun dream isn't of being berated and harassed.  That being said, the mom in the Sopranos always drove me completely insane too. You have to give a writer the leeway to write his own story, and if that's what he wants to write, you go with it.This is a must-own game. It's a game for ADULTS. But it's a game with epic scope, great graphics, and great gameplay. Highly, highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2005"}

It takes the spy game genre to an entirely new level!I'm a big spy-game fan in general, and we have all 3 major platforms, so I went into Splinter Cell curious about all the hype. It's gotten incredible ratings from several magazines. I have to say, after having played it, those ratings were well deserved.First, the graphics. The amount of work that went into graphics on this game is just phenomonal. Your character goes through smoke and fire, through darkness and bright neon light, under shaded lattices, through light coming through venetian blinds, through hazy curtains, through punch-hole metalwork. It is just STUNNING. You really begin to believe that this is a movie and you're controlling the outcome.The other senses aren't neglected. Sound is KEY and you are constantly aware of how much noise you're making while you're sneaking around. The speed at which you move, your crouching, your stance, all affect how well people notice you. Unlike other games which blast you with rock music, in this one you're so attuned that you hear the little movements of your own feet as you creep, or the movements of guards walking down the hallway.The animation on the character is fantastic. Press up against a wall. Climb a fence and roll over the top. Slide down a wire. Go hand-over-hand across a pipe, and pull up your feet to get more traction. Slide down a ladder, jump up a wall and do a split to stay there, unseen. The way the character moves is just amazing. Some serious work was put into this effort, and it pays off.The gameplay missions are logical and draw you along into the story. It's not exactly a ring-through-the-nose drag like other games. You are given objectives - &quot;Get object X which is in building Y&quot; but you aren't handed a map to follow. Instead, you're put into real-world situations and have to figure out for yourself the best way to accomplish that goal. You could try a frontal assault, you could try the sneaky back way. It's up to you, and your success depends on your ability to think through a situation and then implement your path.The game even encourages you not to be violent. It points out that your aim is stealth, and that you should try to stay unseen and sneak by whenever possible. In most missions you can get through without killing anyone, if you use your head.Highly recommended for any first-person-shooter fan!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2002"}

I loved this game SO much, I ended up having to sell the version I got so I could buy the Collector's Edition. I have a very strong feeling that most people who play this game will feel the same way I did. I'm not a survival horror game fan and this game was an impulse buy based on reviews and friends recommendations. I'm SO happy I took the chance and bought it. The game is an all around insanely solid title. Every part of what makes a game great, they made great. The graphics are some of Xbox's best. The sound is haunting and perfectly balanced- especially with headphones. The gameplay is SPOT ON. It knows how to create tension and suspense and it plays you more than you play it. Amazingly well done. The replay is even VERY high- even if you know the story, you'll play it again because it's FUN to play. Do yourself a favor though- your first time through, play it at night, alone in the room, and with a quality sound set up (headphones if you have them). I did it this way and, as I said, not a horror game fan, I had a GREAT time. The story is so solid, you'll forget the horror/scary factor and JUST be interested in \"What happens next?!\".","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2011"}

It took me about 75 painful hours to complete but couldve easily been reduced to 40 or so.The reason is that you have to visit almost every single town, cave, maze, and dungeon twice! Going through every area 2-3 times is NOT fun and is repetitive beyond belief.And yet another fabled aspect of this game is its huge assortment of playable job classes... yet they fail to mention that its broken.There are dozens of classes that are worthless yet a couple that pretty much make the game a cakewalk, thus 'breaking' the game.

I have played every single one of these games,  I have to have them as soon as they come out I love the games,  but this one is so lack luster.  I can go through the things that have put me off from the game, and then finish up with a little closing.1.  this game is TINY,  they may have 1'000's of cars but who cares if you only nine categories of races per challenge level,  and some only have one race.  Case in point, I think gt4 had 16 endurance races,  prologue for this game had four sections c,b,a, and s with 10 races per section I have not gotten all the way through but this game has around 20 races per section and 5 sections, so it has around 100 races for the gt mode, compared to the 110 races in gran turismo 4 witch was on the ps2, with much less disk space.  I thought that game was short, but this game took four times as long to come out, it should give more to the customers, then the prologue it gave us years ago.2.  NO CARRY OVER,  part of the reason I eventually got the prologue was because it said that it would give a head start of gt5,  I spent a lot of time getting cars and money to transfer over to gt5 to save time later on, only to find out that the company changed their mind and took out this feature.3.  B-spec is a joke this time around,  they tried to change it and made it stupid and worse then it was in GT4,  the drivers are stupid,  all the races are the same, so you get to watch an AI do a race you just mopped the floor with lose in slow motion,  I have great cars, and I cream the other cars, then I switch over to B-spec and watch my driver lose with the exact same car,  the leveling up is slow for the AI, driver, so you have to do the low level races a lot just to get the driver able to shift out of fourth gear,  I watched one of my drivers on a straight away and he never shifted out of fourth no matter what Command I gave him.  B-Spec drivers are super lame,  and it take to long to get them experience, and then when they have it, they still suck.4.  I out the 8GB of information on my hard drive, and the load times are still very long for every race,  once the race is started however you can restart inside of the race as many times as you like, with out load times, so if you want to save time, restart if you feel bad about a race after the first or second lap.5.  Physics is a bitch in this game, so often in the licenses and tests I would try and steer the car around a corner only to lose control,  If the point of the physics in this game is frustrate the hell of of players well then they are spot on.6.  they added other cars to some of the challenges in the licenses section,  witch drives me crazy if a car hits you, you are disqualified,  and they hit you a lot.7.  the license is different then in the last games,  I see no point to them any more,  you gain points through game play, that gives you levels, but as long as you drive a lot it does not seem like you need to pass the licenses,  I did not get much experience from passing the licenses, I have all of the except for the super which I am waiting to see if I need to get it in order to play the extreme races,  but it seems to be for casual games who may not be very good at the licensee portion of the game which was tougher in gt4.  This game should have changed it so you could choose how you want to advance through the game, licensee, points or what they had a combination of the two,  so that games could have control over how they play the game, instead of being shoe horned.8.  Cars are good, but the races are centered around cars, I cold care less about, why have a raced centered around a little crap car I would never buy, it seems obvious that car companies got better treatment based on certain factors.So, in conclusion, this is Gran Turismo 5,  we have been waiting a long time for it,  I think you might want to wait until it hits the greatest hits or drops in price, or pick up a used copy, because this game is going to have a lot of dlc,  I paid 30 bucks for this game, and feel like I overpaid for the amount and quality of the races,  Really disappointed in the lack of endurance races so far, you can not even look at what the future races are until you level up,  I have every licensee but the super, and I can not see the final group of races.  I am curious how gran turismo will justify new races to be downloaded after sticking people with a 60 dollar price tag for the game, as well as the lack of a bridge between, this game and the called prologue.Edit: Have been playing the game more, and they have made some major screws loose,  I played forever to save up to get a f1 race car, and after I saved up 10,000,000.00 credits, and spent it all, it turns out that car can not be used in the regular races,  but their was no warning before I spent the credits, so a couple of days of saving up and selling other cars was a complete waste,  thats BS they should warn you,  also I can not even figure out where the race is for this car.  And on top of it, they do not warn you that the car can not be sold, that is such a stupid waste, other games WARN you before they have you buy things that can not be sold, or changed after you buy them,  this is SO LAME.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2010"}

Since I have been a big fan of Wolverine since the early 1980's and heard of the positive reviews of this game (PS3 Version) I of course picked it up and glad I did.While the story of the game is based on the movie, the games plot itself uses just the basic framework of XMEN Origins: Wolverine and adds lots of its own extended variation by barrowing allot of the XMEN's own comic book material from the marvel universe to either add to the existing story line or just plain add new additional story material (I.E. the \"Sentinels\" and their creator Bolivar Trask along with a modified \"Days of Future Past\" storyline as book ends to the beginning and ending of the game.The game play itself is nothing short of spectacular, The game gives you the look and feel of wolverine. On top of the wolverines usual trademark abilities (Claws, fast healing factor, and heightened senses) you can earn additional abilities that either increase your current powers or give you new additional ones that you already have. The Graphics and detail are par none. Best of all they did a great job on the likenesses and were able to use the actual voices of Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, and Will.I.Am as Wolverine, Sabertooth, and John Wraith respectively.Please NOTE that this game did get a \"M\" rating for a good reason. As I stated in my review title there is allot of \"Guilty pleasure\" in playing this game due to the realism of what happens when Logan's (Wolverine) Claws make contact with his adversaries which deal with lots of realistic consequences which include Blood, Gore, Flying Body parts (Arms, Legs, and so forth), Bodies split in half, and so on. While for me this made the game a hell of a lot more fun this is not a game that should be played around or even played by young children to include even young teens. Parents are advised of this before purchasing.My only slight negative is I felt there was a little excessive \"Problem solving\" challenges that was redundant and unnecessary. The designers should have just kept the focus on the games action.Overall, for all you Wolverine fans I would heavily recommend this game and enjoy the \"Guilty Pleasure\" as much as I did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2012"}

Famously, at E3 when they were still introducing the gamecube, Nintendo showed charts displaying how game sequels were just perpetuating old ideas, like anyone minds. The big N's idea for the GC Mario Kart was to give them two riders. The difficulty on 50cc is pathetic, you'll never see another kart for the length of the laps. 150cc is challenging but the placement is random determined by whether you get hit by a spiked shell in 1st or not on the last race. Multi-player is bland, no one is going to hook up two tvs, two gamecubes and two mario kart discs. The multi-maps are simple and limited to one level.I would have enjoyed seeing some obstacle courses where you dodge bananas, etc. all through the lap. Also, many other tracks are too plain.

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

In Shadow Hearts 3, none of these were back and it just turned the series into a blend and sometimes annoying game.The main characters are not likable right from the beginning. Johnny, a sixteen year old private detective who happens to be for God's sake amnesia. The character design is exacltly the same as the character in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and Final Fantasy XII. Shania just lack the death of Kirin in Covenant and not to mention all the other characters who joined the team randomly. The story is scattered all over the place to fit into the world of randomness of the characters. Seriously the most interesting characters in the game are Lady and Killer. The giant cat Mao is annoying, the Ninja is easily the most hateable character competing with Hilda the vampire. The seriously lack of depth for the characters already killed half of the game, not to mention the lack of substance in the story. In Covenant, the side quests naturally blends into the story as they were mentioned here and there even before they were opened up for you to tackle them. In 3, they were just there for the sake of being there. Nothing interesting and nothing exciting, and Johnny's sidequest is just damn annoying, comparable to Kurando's sidequest in Covenant.The battle system is greatly improved in a way that you need to be more strategic than just go all out and whack. But when your enemies also took advantage of the system, it could leave you breaking the controller into two with tears, and prepare for that in Johnny's sidequest. The battle system is very interesting and strategic with customisable rings, double-attack, combos etc. There are more gauges and stats you need to pay attention to during the battle. It could definitely satisfy players who want to have more interactive and intuitively strategic battle system. However, Shania has less fusion forms compared to Yuri and her fusion for most of the time look like porns - from tatoos on various parts of her body, including all the private parts. These tatoos light up and there will be a close up on them. It is very disappointing that From the New World needs to use that kind of tactic to attract players. For all other characters, most of their moves are mediocre though Hilda the vampire's certain moves could be lifesaving in important and difficult battles.In all Shadow Hearts 3 is a game that you can play if you are free and once finished, there is nothing interesting to revisit it in the future. Unlike Covenant, it is not a game that you can get yourself addicted to and replay it again and again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2006"}

Talk. Talk. Choose one of four responses. Flounder about with awkward controls. Sit idle for lengthy cut-scenes.

The victims here will be fans ofThe Walking Dead, looking for a fix now that Season 3 is finished and faced with a seven-month gap until Season 4 begins.The game centers around Lee Everett, a former professor and convicted murderer, and an eight-year old girl named Clementine (I'd describe her plight more but, frankly, it is unoriginal).Lee is almost unaccountably dumb, a character as shallow as Scooby Doo. The comparisons have merit as early in the first episode Lee inexplicably slips in a pool of blood and clips his head on a kitchen counter, making what should be a mundane exit from a house into a life-and-death struggle with a zombie babysitter.Yeah, your read that correctly, the protagonist can't handle an undead teenage girl.Ruh roh.The shallowness of Lee's character is such that it makes him nearly as soulless as the titular zombies he's fighting. At each moral dilemma, I was presented with four responses from which to choose. These choices can often be categorized as honest, dishonest, abrasive and evasive. This simplistic gameplay evoked memories ofThe Cave of Time (Choose Your Own Adventure #1), described by Wikipedia as \"...a series of children's gamebooks where each story is written from a second-person point of view, with the reader assuming the role of the protagonist and making choices that determine the main character's actions and the plot's outcome.\"My attention span waning, I stuck with it for another 20 minutes as Lee met more thick-headed characters (each I quickly rooted against), embracing zombie attacks as a release from the wooden dialogue. After retrieving the disc, I searched out other reviews of this game to see how my experience compared. Clearly, I was more severe than most and much less forgiving of the writing. My patience with the AMC show is also fading, so my lack of enthusiasm for the video game may be a casualty of zombie saturation.Rating: Two stars.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00CRL9TU2","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"GT6:  Becoming the \"Madden\" of racing games","reviewText":"Usually the release of a Gran Turismo game comes with the anticipation it will take the \"quantum leap\" jump.  GT has long been known as the \"king of simulator\" racing games, with GT3 A-Spec considered one of the best of all time.GT5 sold well north of 10 million copies, and well it is unfortunate to see that GT6 did not stray far from that formula.  They have made a couple of tweaks (one of the most welcomed is the elimination of the rotating used car list, so no more praying that after running a few racers or restarting/reloading the game that the car you need for an event will appear) and added some more cars (250) but some of this is padded.  Some cars are exactly the same except for a paint changed, yet counted as 2.  Some cars have only the convertable being the difference, and those are counted as 2.  So if you're thinking 250 cars=250 unique cars, you're going to be disappointed.  There are a few new tracks in the game that weren't in previous editions but again, that's only going to be a plus for die-hards, it won't make a difference to most.  The graphics are pretty much pushing the PS3 limits, however it's hard to play Need for Speed Rivals, see what the PS4 can do, and then come back down to the PS3 level of detail (the interiors are the best in the series, for what that is worth).Thankfully they've also eliminated the arcane EXP system; anyone who tried to play through the \"B-Spec\" only to throw their controllers in frustration when their driver couldn't make simply passes or got mad and drove off the track all-together probably won't be crying any tears over that revelation.You're still going to be grinding for money in the game...unless you have a fat wallet.  That's right, microtransactions make their first appearance in the series.  For the most expensive car, you'll need $140.  In real money.  For the love of all things sacred, PLEASE do not spend $140 on a virtual car.  I can see why GT6 offers this, as not everyone has time, but it stands to upset the series as you can imagine the guy who put the time into the game going online and now everyone has thes same car they worked 40 hours to achieve enough credits to buy.  It's good business for Polyphony Digital; bad business IMHO for the series as a whole.And one of the \"hype\" things was having a Moon Rover in the game.  Remember the whole Top Gear sets of missions in GT5 when you were racing VW buses, and how ridiculous that was?  Multiply that by 10...that's the Moon Rover.  Just say no.Finally, you still can't do a lot of the \"tuning\" that you would ultimately like to do in the game, especially with a lot of the special cars.  You're stuck with the defaults for the vehicle.  If this truly is the best simulator game, you should be able to tune all aspects of all vehicles.  Sadly, those options are still mostly absent.In closing, this seems like a cash-in type of game while they are working GT7 for the PS4, much like what was done for Madden 25 for the PS4 (i.e. graphical and animation tweaks).  If you pay $60 for this game you have to be the die-hard GT fan who has to have the game at release like Madden (and yes, they'll be a couple million of those).For everyone else, hang onto your money until this game is down to a more reasonable $20-30 dollars.  The game is definitely worth a purchase at that price point.  Or, wait until GT7 comes out on the PS4 so the series will make a true leap in quality, performance, controls and the like.UPDATE #1 (12/6/2013)Of course the first comment mentioned I didn't say anything about how the cars handle.  If you played GT5 and liked how they handled, it's no better or worse then it was in the game.  If some cars handled better then they should have, or if some cars were completely undriveable, neither of these issues have been addressed in GT6.  It's a simulation, not an arcade racer, and no, unlike in games like Grid, damage is nothing more than superficial (offline) and has no impact whatsoever on your handling or performance, other then the time you lose on the racetrack.UPDATE #2 (12/12/2013)I thought it was important to advise on two other areas:#1:  In all the other GT games, you had to obtain the license through the license tests before you could race in those events.  Now, you have to race in the events to unlock the license tests.  Seems a little backwards doesn't it?  That being said, the license tests are MUCH easier then in past versions, so if that was a deal-breaker for you in previous GT games, it shouldn't be this time.  Either way, it's a very curious design choice.#2:  you cannot even PLAY ONLINE until you get the 5th of 6th licenses!!!  There is no other racing game (major release) off the top of my head that has this kind of restriction.  So be prepared to sink upwards of 8-12 hours into the game before you can play online multiplayer.  While I understand they don't want a bunch of ramming rookies doing that, locking away that part of the game in 2013 is simply unacceptable.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2013"}

Their previous 2 releases, Bayonetta and Vanquish, are among the absolute best in their respective genres, and while Metal Gear Rising doesn't quite reach the heights of those games, it's still a must-play for any fan of action games of this type.In Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, you take control of the cyborg ninja Raiden, star of Metal Gear Solid 2, and the scene-stealer from Metal Gear Solid 4. The plot in this game, like in all of Platinum's games, is pretty absurd and and the developers seem to know it. There are some Metal Gear-esque moments in the plot here, but don't expect anything remotely close to the brilliance on display in Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear Solid games. This game is all about the gameplay, and in that regard MGR delivers.Metal Gear Rising's combat reminded me of Bayonetta's to a degree. While it doesn't quite nail that silky smoothness that Bayonetta did, Metal Gear Rising's combat is still incredibly fast, deep, and exciting. Raiden is an extremely capable fighter in the hands of a gamer who takes the time to learn how Raiden works. There's a learning curve here, but once you get past it, Raiden will feel like an extension of the player, slicing and dicing enemies to shreds. One thing that will take some getting used to is the Parry command, which takes the place of the traditional dodge move that most action games of this type utilize. It's rough at first, but once you learn how it works, you'll appreciate how it leaves enemies vulnerable to counterattacks. You'll be scored after each battle on how well you performed, encouraging replayability. The core battle mechanic centers around a \"blade mode\" where everything moves into slow motion and Raiden can use the right analog stick to slice enemies into pieces from any angle, including the ability to hit vital organs which refuel Raiden's energy. It's a brilliant mechanic that never gets old throughout the entire campaign.The game performs extremely well, too. The game runs at a smooth 60 frames per second, which makes all the combat and crazy happenings all around Raiden look even better. Aside from some really bad music during certain battles, the game sounds great as well. The game's major weakness is the camera, which seems to sit a bit too close behind Raiden, and can get really wonky at times.Overall, Metal Gear Rising is an easy recommendation to action gamers who like depth to their combat and are willing to put in some time to learn how the game works. Like Bayonetta and Vanquish, this is a game that rewards patient gamers who work to build their skill and aren't expecting a game with pick-up-and-play combat like Darksiders or God of War. Very fun and fast-paced game! I had a great time with it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2013"}

First off, this game is amazing!  But it does have some faults, which may really impact your experience.1. Random enemy spawn.  Enemies follow set paths for the most part, and if you are going to play the game by knocking people out and sneaking around, this is very useful.  However, if you are detected, enemies will appear out of thin air to attack.  This is very annoying if you want to hit one target and then sneak into the shadows, as the room you ensured was clear may suddenly be populated with a guard or two.  It really breaks the experience of checking corners and trying to play undetected.2. The textures, at least on the Xbox 360 version, are pretty bad.  I've seen other games review this game (IGN comes to mind) where the description is \"muddy.\"  The lighting effects and general wall textures (even after a disk install, which greatly increased performance in Oblivion and other Bethesda Games) are pretty bad, and actually laughable at times.  It tends to break the realism in the exciting world Bethesta has created.I don't hate this game - I love it. I just wish some extra polish was added, as it does take me out of the experience more than it should.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2012"}

First of all, you'll have to run this under XP.  As of June 2009, there's no reliable way to get it running under Vista, although if you scour the Internet you can find people here and there who claim to have gotten it to work.  But it wouldn't work for me -- and many others, I see.  (Not even if you \"run in compatibility mode,\" disable DEP, etc.)  The defunct Eidos will of course issue no patch, and there is no utility I'm aware of that can solve this problem.2.  I cheat like a mother on video games.  I'm the kind of guy who'll play a video game for about 5 minutes before searching the net for cheat codes or trainers.  But this has to be the first video game I've ever played where I wasn't tempted to cheat until I was at least halfway through. The whole point of it is how well can you sneak around and get the job done (steal the candelabra or whatever) without being detected.  It's very immersing.  I consider this a high compliment.  Certainly the first first-person shooter I've ever really liked.3.  The most disappointing aspect of this game, for me, was the City (presumably based on Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar).  I wish it had been the way it was in Baldur's Gate:  Dark Alliance, or Diablo, where the city was a place you got information, went shopping, got healed, etc.  But in this game, since the Town Watch and various other groups are after you even in the City, you can't relax even there.  I found this very immeasurably disappointing.  It would have been cool if you could have explored the city and gone around pickpocketing at your leisure.  As it is, you can't walk 20 feet without running for your life.  Not fun.  Oh, come on!  You're telling me the entire Town Watch not only knows what you look like, but where you live as well?  Folks, by the time you've gotten to the point where you can't go shopping for some groceries without getting hacked at, it's high time to relocate to another town!  Sheesh.  Why don't the authorities just wait for me at my apartment after there's been a mugging or robbery?  Ridiculous.4.  Many, many crashes to desktop, even with the 1.1 patch.  Especially when loading a new area.5.  The way the game starts off, it's like you're in a medieval city.  But as the game progresses, you start to notice light bulbs, steam engines, Tesla coils, etc.  Meanwhile, the town watch is still carrying swords and shooting at you with bows and arrows?  This incongruous and often laughable mixture of a Dungeons-and-Dragons-type atmosphere along with post 1900-era technology hamstrung the believability of the game at every step.6.  As of my writing, there isn't a serviceable trainer or set of cheat codes available for the 1.1 English version, so if you find this game infuriating, there's no easy solution I'm aware of other than sticking it out.  It's true, you can alter one of the game's INI files to monkey with certain key values in the game, but your tinkering will only have an effect during the actual missions, not during the City component.  And situations and settings that count as \"City\" easily make up the lion's share of the game.7.  The maps are a complete joke.  This for me was the single most frustrating element of this game.  You think most of your time is going to be spent creeping around behind some guard so you can steal some candlesticks?  Not hardly.  Most of your time will be spent running around the city trying to find various doors or portals.  Perhaps the programmers intended you to struggle so, but isn't Garrett supposed to know the city like the back of his hand?  If they couldn't have a floating arrow indicating the direction of your destination, why couldn't they at least have put a \"YOU ARE HERE\" marker on the map?  Those maps are so simplified as to be nearly useless!8.  There was something else that was a complete loser in this game:  reading.  Be prepared to do lots of it.  If you want to follow everything that is happening carefully, you're going to spend hours (not exaggerating) reading books, diaries, notes, etc.  One or two would have been reasonable, but this is completely out of hand.  I think this is something that must have flown well during the scripting stages of the game, but when you're actually running from hostile foes, you're hardly in the mood to calmly read several pages of text.  And is it just me, or what's with the penchant of this City's denizens for penning tell-all journals and keep these scribblings in plain, public view?9.  Have you noticed that most first-person shooter-type games tend to become essentially zombie-fighting games where you more or less have to fight Satan in the end?  While this game may start off literate, it degenerates into this by the end.10.  I found this game kind of haunting, in the sense that after I had finished it, for days I couldn't stop thinking of how much better it could have been.  It fell short of being a truly immortal game.  When I say that, I'm thinking chiefly about the writing.  Seemed like the writers shoehorned elements of magic and wizardry into it that seemed out of place and didn't add much.  A straight medieval or Renaissance city would have been much, much more interesting if they had been willing to do some research.11.  Maybe it's just my computer, but it seems like the saved games take an intolerably long time to load.  Nothing like reflecting on how you're wasting your life as that little blue bar fills from left to right.12.  The prices of this game are completely illogical.  At one point, for example, we learn that a certain widow requires 500 gold pieces to survive the death of her husband.  Yet at the same time an unremarkable arrow costs 100 gold pieces?  Hope that widow doesn't mind eating grass!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2009"}

Republic Commando doesn't have any Jedi force powers or anything that you would expect from a Star Wars game, instead you have a squad based tactical shooter set in the story between EP2 and EP3. Back in the day when I first got this game I was huge into the Ghost Recon and R6 games for Xbox and this game basically rips bits off from both of them but it has the added bonus of being set in the star wars universe. Your clones are faceless and never take off their helmets, the armor is huge and bulky and color coded so they all kinda look like gun totting power rangers on steroids but the gameplay is solid, more than solid, your troops obey you and don't do stupid stuff like charging into a room full of baddies only to get themselves snuffed. In this day and age there are better games, but if you like Star Wars, and wanted to know what it was like for the clones instead of the jedi during the clone wars then this would be the game for you.PS graphically this game still looks quite nice.

All the enemies have the same basic approach and become more of a nuisance than a challenge after a while. The story isn't that great either and is way too short. I like games that take more than a couple of days to complete. I also like replay value of a game, which this has none. Once you beat the game, that's pretty much it. Nothing special to unlock but artwork and maybe a video or 2, no extra levels, nothing. I see where this is compared to God of War a lot... this doesn't come close.

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"dark54555 \"dark54555\"","summary":"Resident Evil Re-Invented, Improved...Possible GOTY 2005","reviewText":"Prior to this game, if someone said to me \"Resident Evil,\" I'd think \"I hate that series.\"  Why?  The controls.  The story was good, the remakes had excellent graphics...but the controls were, in my opinion, awful.  They were in fact so bad that I never finished any of the previous games.Resident Evil 4 is a new beginning for the series, one of the best games on the GameCube, and possibly the Game of the Year for 2005 (I'm reserving judgement until the new Zelda comes out, but that's beside the point).  The biggest change is the controls.  Gone is that \"you control from the perspective of the character\" idea.  It has been replaced with a 3rd person over the shoulder persepctive, and this will probably be the new standard in survival horror.  Why?  The angle still allows things to sneak up on you, but is user friendly enough to bring back a lot of people who put down the first Resident Evils because of their controls.  I'm sure you're thinking, \"doesn't that make the game way too easy?\"  No, it doesn't.  In order to aim and fire, you have to hold R and use the thumbstick you normally use to move.  Hence, though the enemies are slow, your inability to aim and shoot while moving makes the game challenging.The graphics are hands down the most impressive of anything that have been released on any current console.  Yes, better than Halo 2's graphics.  The use of lighting and particle effects creates an unparalleled atmosphere.  The people, guns, and items have an amazing amount of detail.The story is pretty good.  It's no RPG, but it does hold together and keeps some people guessing till the very end (IMO it became predictable, but it was still good).Oddly enough, for a game that seems to warrant 1 playthrough, I've wanted to keep playing it well after beating the game once.  The extras, Assignment Ada and Mercenaries, are both very entertaining.  The unlockables make the main story worth playing through a second, third, fourth, or even fifth time.All in all, if you own a GameCube, you must own this game.  And for those of you waiting for the PS2 version, consider getting a GameCube instead.  The graphics required to make this game what it is are not even close to available on the PS2 (specifically particle and lighting effects).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2005"}

Over all it is a pretty ordinary shooter with one or two twists.  The first twist is the underutilized \"Geo Mod\" engine.  The Geo Mod engine The purpose is to make blowing stuff up more meaningful by letting craters and holes form from explosions.  The idea is that you can blast through walls, or around locked doors.  It's a good selling point, but there is hardly any use for it in the game.  Once you get past the first mission, you never use it.  All of the doors are basically unlocked for you anyways, so what's the point?  The other twist is the use of some really cool vehicles.  This was my favorite part of the game.  Flying around or driving around in an armored vehicle and mowing down bad guys with a heavy machine gun is good mindless shooter fun.  There are also a couple of points in the game where you pilot a submarine or an aircraft.There is a good variety of weapons and ammo in the game, all of which are useful at some point.  Red Faction does a better job than most games of getting all of the weapons into the game.  Enemy AI is tough, but still at the right level.Other than that, the game is pretty \"blah\".  The environments are as repetitive as you can get.  You are on Mars - everything is either an underground installation or a rust-colored cave.  The graphics are decent, but not great.  The storyline is an unoriginal mix between \"Deus Ex\" and \"Total Recall\".  Add to that, it's somewhat poorly done.  Also, for some reason, THQ decided to include a couple of contrived, bad stealth missions in this game.  They are more annoying than anything.  The game gets extremely hard about halfway through, and towards the end of the game, you will find yourself wearing out the quick save and quick load keys.  This is due mostly to one annoying and overpowered weapon that allows enemies to shoot you through walls.Red Faction isn't a bad game.  I found it in the bargain bin and I don't regret buying it.  It gives you one fun play through, and that's probably it.  The game probably won't knock you out of your chair though.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience. Plug into one of the finest strategy RPG experiences ever created withFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance.","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"Finaly the return of Square!","reviewText":"I must confess that I am far from finished with this game, I'm about half way into it, but I have played enough to get to know how I feel about it. Over all this highly anticipated title is great, and I'm grateful to see a Square (Now called Square Enix) game back on a Nintendo console. Although Square's support has been Sony exclusive for the last two generations Square is finally moving away from that bringing at least three titles to a Nintendo system in some form or another. Naturally if these games do well its a safe assumption that there will be more, and considering that many of the older Final Fantasy fans are Nintendo fans to begin with this is a guaranteed success.FFTA is the sequel to the massively popular Final Fantasy Tactics on Playstation. The original took concepts of the Ogre Battle Series and merged them with the world of Final Fantasy to create what has been heralded by many as the greatest Final Fantasy game of all time, even if it is not a part of the main series. Tactics 2 is just as immersive, just as deep, and just as fun, but a lot more light hearted, a lot less dark, and a game that some could argue would be geared toward a younger audience. The story is far from unenjoyable, but it's not as dark, or thought provoking as its predecessor, or the latest entry in the Tactics Ogre series either. However, if you enjoy deep children's classic epics, along the lines of The Never-ending Story, Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal, etc then you will find this game very highly enjoyable, and frankly I am still a huge fan of the aforementioned films from which the game obviously draws its inspiration.  Game play wise, however there is one massively annoying flaw. The game features judges who impose laws on you that restrict your battle options. Many of the laws will completely hinder your progress unless you have the appropriate anti-law card with you and sometimes its hard to get just the right anti-law card for just the right occasion. It gets annoying to forget you're not supposed to use a sword in battle and suddenly the game is over because you strike a monster with one. The game would have still been very deep game play wise without the laws. The laws are an annoyance, but do not stop the game from being enjoyable. I merely hope that future installments of the series will abandon the law system. Square, it's nice to have you back, welcome home! I look forward to your next two games, Sword of Manna for GBA, and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles for GameCube. Of course for you Playstation owners out there (which includes me too, I have all three systems) there's Final Fantasy X-2 and XI right around the corner.

Bakehorn","summary":"Nintendogs shows all sorts of new tricks","reviewText":"Nintendo is well known for childish or child-friendly titles, and lately it seems that they are trying to find a spot in the \"weird\" niche. With their latest \"game,\" Nintendogs, I think they've found a perfect little spot in that niche and they've successfully made the best pet simulator on the market in any shape or form.Next to a real dog, you can't get anything more realistic than this game. Nintendogs is, flat-out, a dog simulator. It's not even really fair to call it a game, in fact. Anyway, the game starts you off at a kennel where you can pick between one of six dogs. The six dogs shown in the kennel vary depending on the version of Nintendogs you picked up. In total, there are eighteen little puppies to buy and train. The real perk to Nintendogs, as I said, is the realism. Not only does each puppy look just like a real-life puppy (in polygon form), but it will also act like one.Of course, this means that raising and training a puppy can be difficult but ultimately a fun experience. Nintendogs avoids all of the trouble of real puppies (after all, there are no hair-shedding or peeing functions on the DS) and gives you the full experience in a digital form. Using the touch screen, you can pet your puppy, give it physical commands, and play with it using various objects. Nintendogs also makes the best use of the DS's microphone and allows you to use it to give verbal commands and the like. Your puppies can learn tricks and you can set certain words to trigger these tricks. For instance, you can teach a puppy to sit, and if you wish to tell the dog \"sit,\" it will sit.Overall I think Nintendogs uses the DS's hardware to the fullest extent but it isn't enough of a \"game,\" really. This doesn't keep it from being an easy recommendation--this is a game for kids, teens, adults, boys, girls, anyone. If you're a dog lover and you own a DS (or hell, even your child), then buy this game. You won't be disappointed with what you get.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2005"}

Graphics are amazing, there were a few times when the game went to a cut scene and when it went back to Lara Croft it took me a minute to realize that the cut scene was over and I was back to playing! The player has the choice of whether they want to be stealthy or go for a full on assault or something in between. Personally, there is nothing better than sneaking up on unsuspecting enemies!The online play is terrible, I would definitely not get this game for that! You have to wait forever for the game to find enough people for a match and once you manage to make it into a match if people drop out it just shuts you down and says that there are not enough people for the match. I don't think I was ever able to finish a match! Personally I don't care about online play which is why this did not affect my rating at all, I just know that there are a lot of people who do enjoy online play so I thought I would mention it.My only real complaint (and it is a small one) was the voice audio. Sometimes I could not hear the voices at all and had I not had the subtitles on I never would have knew there was dialogue happening. This is a small problem because it is easily fixed by turning subtitles on. I loved this game and would recommend it to any fan of the adventure genre! I can't wait for the next Tomb Raider game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}

Rhodes","summary":"A Legend All On It's Own","reviewText":"When Rayman Origins hit store shelves it was quickly a well received platformer.  Garnering lots of acclaim and critical praise all around it was actually quite surprising to see the game itself didn't take off right away.  Through fantastic word of mouth, a hefty price drop and long lasting gameplay, however, Rayman Origins became a huge sleeper hit.  In particular many were impressed with the level designs and it's gorgeous looking art style.  Here Rayman Legends takes everything great about Rayman Origins and makes it all better.  Simply put, if you liked Rayman Origins... you need to play this game.Like before there isn't much of a story to Rayman.  You will mostly find yourself in a man hub where you can jump into various paintings to take on the challenges in a level.  In each level you'll collect Lumas like before and be able to earn trophies and completion bonuses in levels for doing so.  But you'll also have to rescues Teensies.  This one is actually important.  The more Teensies you rescue, the more levels and challenges open up and the more partners you get to rescue.  There is no real difference in playing as one of Rayman's allies, though.  All of their moves are essentially the same.  Unlike in Origins, however, a lot of moves you don't have to unlock.  You'll be able to hover right off the bat for instance.  Rayman Legends pretty much lets you jump right into things immediately.There is a small segment of the gaming population that seems to think 2D platforming has been done to death.  These people have never played Rayman Legends.  Each level is sprawling.  Usually divided into three parts.  There are ten teensies in all to save.  Two of whom are hidden in bonus rooms and others who are usually in plain sight, obscured slightly or held by enemies.  For the most part they aren't hard to find.  It's obtaining them that's hard.  The bonus rooms, for instance, are obstacle courses designed to challenge you.  Other times the design of the levels themselves might make it difficult.The levels here are some of the most original and well crafted I've ever experienced in a 2D platformer.  Nearly every level is wholly unique in some way.  You'll rarely feel like you're doing the same thing twice.  One moment I was nearly dodging flames.  The next I was running across platforms keeping up to the beat of a song.  There's so much variety in each and every level.  Most of them are straightforward but you'll definitely find a lot of great stages that you'll probably come back to over and over again.  Rayman Legends is also not a short game by any stretch of the imagination.  It's huge.  There are tons of collectibles and levels to keep you busy for hours on end.  The fact that it has a good replay value doesn't hurt either.There is another new addition to the gameplay.  Murphy.  He's basically a sidekick that shows up at scripted moments.  And with the press of a button you can command him to do certain things such as move platforms, cut ropes or rotate wheels which will also manipulate platforms.  He can also distract some enemies by tickling them.  The actual interface works rather well.  Those wondering about Murphy seeming like he'd be tacked on can rest assured he isn't.  In every instance he's shows up he is necessary.  You won't be able to get through many a challenge without him and the levels are designed with his need in mind.  The action also never slows down as a result.  In one level I had to dash to keep from being burned alive by a wall of fire all the while using Murphy to manipulate walls or be roasted.  The ways in which Rayman Legends mix and matches all its gameplay elements and stage designs means that you'll find yourself constantly surprised.  Just when you think you've experienced enough the game is always willing to throw something new at you.Rayman Origins wasn't a particularly easy game.  Rayman Legends is no different.  Though it is certainly easier to obtain the bonuses for collecting Lumas this time around, the levels in Rayman Legends will really test your mettle.  Luckily, the stages are quite generous with checkpoints.  Should the worst happen you'll usually continue not too far off from where you perished.  There are no lives in Rayman so you are allowed to screw up as many times as you want to.  And you'll probably end up doing so a lot.  Rayman Legends is not unfairly challenging, however.  The levels will surprise you, but the threat is usually pronounced.Multiplayer also returns.  You and a few friends can get together and play.  Though like the first game you might find yourselves having more fun at the expense of each other than actually completely the level.  On the other hand, cooperation is much more strongly encouraged.  Getting certain bonuses or getting through certain areas is just easier.  If one player perishes then they can usually be saved by the remaining players.  There are times, however, when having too many players around at one time may make some levels feel more challenging.  Particularly those in which it is very important to dash.Graphically there are actually few games that look as good as as Rayman Legends.  Certainly a lot of games have photorealism today, but what they often lack is a pleasing aesthetic to compliment their raw power.  Playing through Rayman Legends is like watching a painting come to life.  It's vibrant and colorful, with a unique design to the sprites and the environments.  Certainly Rayman Legends isn't a powerful game.  But what it lacks in power it more than makes up for in raw artistic design.  It stands apart from all other games because no game really looks like it.  There's more style here than anything.  That style is what helps Rayman Legends stand out so strongly.  Like Origins, it may not have a lot of POWER behind it, but it certainly has a lot of artistic flair that is unmatched by many games today.  It's a gorgeous looking game.  The music is just as rewarding.  Having so many different tunes that perfectly illustrate and characterize the levels and dangers you'll experience.  Simply put, Rayman Legends is purely amazing from a presentation standpoint.There really aren't too many things that keep Rayman Legends down. It's artistic style and level design make sure that you're constantly wowed, while it's handful of levels and bonuses make sure that you always have something to do, even when it feels like you're done.  Rayman Legends, like its predecessor, is a phenomenal game.  Those who have grown up with 2D side scrollers such as Mario and Sonic will definitely want to try this out.  It's just an all around fun game that can (and will) keep you busy for a long time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2013"}

Weir","summary":"Fun game, but shame on Activision and Infinity Ward","reviewText":"I actually bought this game even though it will be the last Infinity Ward game I support by purchasing. I've been a huge fan of said developer since Call of Duty 1, a PC exclusive, since day one. I've purchased every single Call of  Duty game developed by Infinity Ward over the years (including the expansion for CoD1 which wasn't developed by them). I never had a problem purchasing their products. Until now. This is the first time I've ever felt like a total tool and a moron for purchasing their \"PC game\".The game IS phenomenal. The graphics are noticeably improved over Modern Warfare 1, despite using the same graphics engine.  The overhaul is there, but a lot of current gen games have better visuals.  Sound design is great as always. There's a lot of recycled sounds and some new ones. Multiplayer is more of the same which isn't a bad thing, and the new co-op mode, from what I've played so far, seems fun. That's where my positive review ends. So basically you get more of the same, with slightly upgraded graphics.Here's where things turn bad.  For starters, Activision is charging $60 for this game, a move that completely goes against the grain of PC game pricing trends. Why? Because they can.  It's a business move, yes, but it's completely immoral and greedy. Corporate greed rears its ugly head.  Activision are the new EA.  You would think for $10 you would get, oh I don't know, a longer than average single player campaign right?  Well you don't.  If you thought Modern Warfare's campaign was short prepare to get slapped in the face with a campaign that can easily be completed in one session.  Bigger price, smaller experience.But most people are probably buying it for multiplayer anyway, so let's discuss that. Basically it's all been said before. This is a console port, right down to being limited to 9v9.  Want to get your clan together for some 32 vs. 32?  Nope.  16 vs 16?  Nope.  Oh come on then....at least give me some 12 v 12.  Sorry Charlie.  You get 9v9, just like the console. And just like the console you can't sort servers and pick where you want to play, you can't tweak game parameters via a developer console (another PC industry standard that Infinity Ward think's it's too good to implement), and, OH, no dedicated server support.Frankly, I'm surprised the PC port even allowed me to play with a mouse and keyboard....It's painfully obvious that Infinity Ward prefer console development at this point (particularly the 360, which gets exclusive content before anybody else for the second game in row now), and it's even clearer that Activsion are greedy jerks.It was a good run, Infinity Ward, but just like real life I won't associate with conceited, big-headed people. You won't get any more of my money.  MW2 gets one star for actually being a fun game, but insulting PC gamers by lying about features that never made it to the game (dedicated servers, more people per server than the console versions, etc), and the fact that your publisher is price gouging, keeps it from scoring higher.** APPENDED MULTIPLAYER INFO **Okay so I've put in a few hours of multiplayer over the last few days and my worst fears were confirmed consistently.  Horrible latency just ruins the experience.  The game measures latency by a 4 bar system, similar to a mobile phone's signal strength.  So rather than seeing what your latency is as measured by miliseconds, you will see 1-4 bars.  Usually 3. Very rarely in my time playing MP did I ever have 4 bars, unless I was hosting the game.  I kept a close eye on other player's latencys(using the TAB button) and probably 70% of the players had 3 bars as well, with usually just 1 or 2 people having 4 bars - one of which was the player hosting the game - and a couple unfortunate fools who were somehow getting by with 2 bars or less. The person who hosts a game enjoys a SIGNIFICANT advantage over even those with 3 bars. The killcam proves it. Time after time after time I would get killed and, through the eyes of my opponent thanks to killcam, notice that there was about a half second difference between what I saw and what actually happened. Then I'd hit the TAB button and sure enough, that guy has 4 bars and I only have 3. Ridiculous. I have a fast enough internet connection (2 MB up), and don't notice these latency disadvantages with other shooters, so I have to put the blame solely on IWNET.It's really unfortunate and it's just the way it is which is sad as the multiplayer seems really fun and the levels are well thought out. The reality is if you want to play Multiplayer you're going to have to put up with a LOT of frustrating deaths, even if you get the drop on somebody, because he is enjoying a significant latency advantage.The matchmaking is also broken.  It's supposed to match you based on latency (therefore location) and skill, so why was I constantly in matches with people with 1-2 bars of latency, versus lieutenants and generals when I was only a lowly specialist?Bottom line is if you have either console and a PC, just get the console version because that's all you're getting on the PC. The PC version has no right disgracing the other games on your hard drive by pretending to be a PC game itself.  This game fails utterly. I would rate it half a star if I could.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2009"}

Gann \"Video game junkie\"","summary":"One of PS3's accomplishments","reviewText":"Ratchet and Clank is perhaps the single greatest, point here and blow the !@#$ out of that enemy game I have ever played. The PS2 instalments were and are staples to the PS2 which keep the system alive. When Tools of Destruction hit the PS3, I bought the system when I graduated high school a couple of years after launch and I had to fill the hole in the floor my jaw made. There is no doubt that this is worth buying a PS3 for. Dont get me wrong. Everyone who is a die hard gamer who wants to know what else is there for PS3, get the Uncharted trilogy, God of War III, and The Resistance games. I will break down the game in 4 parts; Graphics, Environments, Gameplay, and Story.Graphics: This is what made the aforementioned jaw drop four feet from my Paramount gaming chair. At the time I saw this, it was the most beautifully designed game ever made. I DO MEAN EVER. I spent two minutes of the first level looking at the environment, Ratchet, and even his weapons. They were so lush and vivid in color and detail that I could not believe that the PS3 had this much graphical quality. (Still not worth the $600 launch price tag though) As I played through the game, I was in constant AWE of what I was looking at. This game single handley blew out all of the other R&C; games on the PS2. If any soul loves looking at art or admiring landscape, this game is for you (Granted you have to blow the crap out most enemies by the time you get to a new place but still...) (5/5)Environments: Lets face it. This is just a continuation of the graphics section, except here I talk about the worlds themselves. The worlds are vast differences from each other in so many ways that it is just amazing that someone thought these up. The many buildings of Metropolis, the rain soaked 'amusement' park with the coliseum, and the ice comet you chase pirates to are just beyond phenomenal. I really cannot describe how beautiful these places are. Disbelieving? Go see for yourself and you will know what I mean. (5/5)Gameplay: If graphics were not number one, its game play. There is so much you can do in this game its not even close to funny. The weapons alone had me jumping for joy. My favorite is the RYNO. Come on, how awesome are the RYNO weapons? Makes the last fight in the game look like a pillow fight in a marshmallow factory. However the one thing that irked me was the tornado weapon. It required you to use the Sixaxis ability to control its movement, and it was just not comfortable (Personally) so I turned it off. The platforming is also a great staple that is improved upon here. Where to find Zoni, Raritanium, and how to get through the levels offers a great way to experience what its like to be head butt kicker. The ingenuity is perhaps second to none and is what keeps me coming back time after time (5/5)Story: Here is probably the smallest of tiny cracks in the armor this game has. As Ratchet and Clank, you go from world to world to thwart the plans of the evil Emperor Percival Tachyon of the Cragmites. While its compelling in some areas, its a typical R&C; adventure: Go Here, Get This, and blow !@#$ up along the way. All I'm saying is that, with just a shade more depth, this could possibly be in the top three PS3 games out there (4/5)Pros:+ Beautiful. Everything is just Gorgeous+ Weapons are AWESOME!+ Pretty funny throughoutCon:- Story could use a boost every so oftenIn summary: If your a fan of R&C; and you dont have it, what in god's great name are you waiting for? If your looking for something that is actually a good family experience, buy it. If you just wanna blow the &%@# out of any thing that moves, BUY IT IMMEDIATELY!!!!!

Sega had not only used the game to show off the tremendous possibilities of the then-new hardware, but they had reinvigorated the platform-style arcade adventure genre with massive, intricate levels, gleefully distracting minigames, and even a new kind of virtual pet, called a Chao, that could be combined with other pets, traded with friends, and even exchanged over the Internet.Sonic Adventure 2ups the ante of its predecessor with all-new puzzles and levels, and even faster action reminiscent of the early Genesis-era games. Knuckles and Tails are back, as are the Chao pets (who can now talk!).","reviewerName":"\"neomurtle\"","summary":"Sonic Adventure 2: One of the last great games for Dreamcast","reviewText":"Gameplay-wise, Sonic Adventure 2 is a hyper, less exploration/all action version of Sonic Adventure. This latest installment to the series is more like the older Sonic games, in that there are only action stages and no &quot;Adventure Fields&quot; as in the first Sonic Adventure. Also a new feature for a Sonic game, you can now choose whether you want to control the heroes or the villians.  This is a great idea, and it does add variety as far as the story goes, but the villians (Robotnik, Shadow, and Rouge) play very similar to the heroes (Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles).  The graphics have also improved, and the game almost always runs at a smooth, steady rate.  The only faults in Sonic Adventure 2 are the horrible script/voice acting and the glitchy camera.  You can use the side triggers to circle around your character and view the area, but you can't actually change the view, and that leads to a lot of deaths due to blind jumps.  It's also very easy to build up speed in Sonic's/Shadows' stages and slip off the edge of the track. Aside from that, Sonic Adventure 2 is a rather solid game.  There are also lots of mini-games to keep you busy, such as Chao raising, Kart racing, ect.  If you own a Dreamcast, pick up Sonic Adventure 2...it's one the Dreamcast's last great games.

But, as opposed to most people, I really don't think this detracts from the experience.  If I want to play a Civ IV style game, I'll play Civ IV.  If I want to play something like Civ V, I'll play Civ V.Anyway, some of the major changes are the hex system, lack of religion, lack of espionage, and the creation of social policies.  There are also various other tweaks.  I'll admit, the hex system takes getting used to, but it encourages new strategic thinking.  Cities are also more important in this version of the game.  All in all, I'd say the game is definitly different, but in a good way.  I've spent countless hours playing.  Also, the graphics are top notch and the UI is very clean.  It's easy to build units, structures, research, and move around the screen.The only downside is the AI.  It's apparent that it doesn't really understand how to use the hex system or conduct diplomacy.

Oddly enough, the Assassin persona is always illegal(it might be Ubisoft's way of making the game more realistic as in: guards these days are more alert than at the time of Altair or Ezio(the whole: Assassin walking past civilians scenario)--so you're always in the spotlight)--pretty much like having a red shirt with the words 'I hate bulls' written on it inside a bullfight arena. The guards are always aggressive.The multiplayer is odd (think of any non-animated Facebook game).....you can't lose in multiplayer fights, you just keep on fighting, as long as you've got the will power to go on with the 'actionless' fights.Overall, the game is okay. previous reviews have mentioned that it crashed a lot; I bought it after a patch came out and i've been okay so far. I don't hate it, and I intend to finish and acquire all trophies for it.*Edit: Game crashed today actually(same night as the morning I typed this review)--is this irony or bad karma lol","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2013"}

We got it to replace a Wii that we sold, that was also sitting idle.I talked him in to letting me move it into my media room so that it might get some play--in Hi Def, no less.  So he did.Resistance has always been a game that looked interesting.  I'd played the demo and didn't quite get it, but at $29.00 I couldn't pass it up.I will say it's a fun game.  Lots of guns, fast paced action.  Lots of enemies on screen at one time.  The look has been criticized for being too \"sepia toned\" but I thought it was OK.  It is NOT a showcase for the graphical power of the PS3--thing more Call of Duty 2 on the 360, which was also a launch title.  This does not leave the same impression that, say Gears of War did with me.  But Gears wasn't a launch title.I haven't played multiplayer yet but the single player is lengthy and I must say I'm moderately interested in the story.  Nathan Hale--is he going to turn?  I can't wait to find out.I don't think game is worth 60 bucks--not at this point.  But it is a solid buyat $30 bucks--and it's available only for the PS3, which, in my estimation, is sorely lacking in quality shooter exclusives. So this ranks as a \"must buy\" at 30 bucks for PS3 owners.  And it's enough to make me think Resistance 2 will be insane.This franchise--and not the cut-scene heavy Metal Gear Solid, is what the PS3 needs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0001ADAME","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyableReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"C. Conard \"ExtremeAvalanche\"","summary":"One of Rockstar's Best Games...","reviewText":"...but it does not come without flaws. For those of you who don't know, Red Dead Revolver is Rockstar's first attempt at a western-themed game. The game has a great presentation, terrific sound, and amazing gameplay. However, in many cases, its flaws outweigh its good spots.Of course, you can't notice it at first, but this game is brutally short. If you are familiar with this genre, you can breeze through it in about 5 or 6 hours. And I thought Max Payne 2 was short! Once you finish the game, you will be very disappointed, because it is a very fun game to play, and it captures the feel of the west perfectly. You will run across ghost towns, menacing cowboys, and colorful environments.There is no shortage of weapons in the game, and every weapon feels authentic. Also, the gameplay is great, with smooth controls and good AI.Basically, if you have any interest in the west, this is a good investment for a game. It just may not be interesting to some people, and you may even just want a rental. I know I should have rented it instead of bought it, because I beat it in six hours, and I was bored after a few days. The multiplayer games improve the value, but still you will tire of them after a few hours.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2004"}

In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly.

HAVE YOU HERD OF SUCH A THING??? well, now you have. don't be fooled, it's a good game though. the day stages are THAT fun, seriously, they are. and since the day stages are the thing that you'll spend the most time replaying, i recomend the wii version. it is missing 2 levels, but it's still a great game. if you don't own a wii, don't be afraid of getting the 360 version. it's a good game, just not as good as the wii version. it's not that it sucks to the wii version, it's just not as thought out. now my final words are... SEGA, GET A STUPID DOG CATCHER AND TAKE THE WEREHOG TO THE POUND PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2008"}

Most of the time, as is the case with Fatal Frame or Silent Hill, the games are great to watch but not as fun to play. Originally the Resident Evil series was like that for me but for some reason the stories (as B-movie as they are) and the characters appealed to me way more than the others in the genre. Released way back when, the original game was an alright play but it wasn't as scary as some would say but now with the power of the Gamecube and a near overhaul of much of the gameplay, the remake is quite the scarefest and a good game.Story: The S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team was sent in to the Arklay Mountains outside of Raccoon City to investigate strange murders with evidence of cannibalism. But contact was lost and the Alpha team, which features members Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, find their downed helicopter. But no sooner do they arrive are they attacked by ravenous dogs and have to escape into a nearby mansion but turns out the mansion has its own dangers as well.Graphics: The old Playstation games looked jaggy and almost looked flat as far as atmospherics goes. The Gamecube makes it more ambient and creepy with minimal lighting except from candlelight, lightning flashes or a few lightbulbs. Not only that but characters are way more detailed and look quite photorealistic and while movements still look occasionally stiff, the animation has vastly improved.Sound/Music: Anyone who's played any and all Resident Evil games knows the voice acting leaves a lot to be desired. Changing some of the lines (while still rewording some of the more \"classic\" lines) and awkward conversation, the remake isn't quite perfect but it's a step-up. The actors have a more serious tone now and while occasionally campy, it's not as awful as before. The music as well adds to the atmosphere which has creepy ambiance and more serene music, such as the Save Room music, while other times the music will drop completely.Gameplay: Along with its voice acting, the other notable complaint has been its control scheme. To put it simply: regardless of where your character is facing, push Up to move them forward, Down to back them up and Left and Right to turn. It only took about 15 minutes for me to get used to it and while at times characters might reclimb a set of stairs or zigzag across the room, you'll eventually get used to it although you might wish something akin to 3D controls were used. And anyone wondering about its puzzles, they're still here; as non-sensical as they are vague at times. Who'd really put strange keys and oddball ways of opening doors in a mansion you're going to be in constantly? But luckily, the puzzles can be solved by just exploring and in many cases, you'll find yourself locked out of a room and while at first unsure, eventually you'll go \"hey wait, isn't there that one room I didn't explore yet?\"As far as the difficulty, the game is just as trying as the series has been, if not more so, with normal zombies requiring near half a clip to bring them down while others require more firepower. Ammo conservation is the key here like all the series but then again, you have enemies like the full-gallop Crimson Heads (zombies who reanimate if you don't decapitate them or burn them using flamethrowers, flame rounds or a fuel canteen/lighter combo) and with sharp claws, these guys can be a pain. Plus with big creatures like the leaping Hunters, giant spiders, annoying bugs and birds in addition to the huge bosses, this trip through the mansion won't be an easy one.But something strange happens when you play: you just want to keep playing. Even though it can get frustrating when you die and re-try all the time (Devil May Cry 3, I'm definately pointing at you), the mansion and all its wonders and horrors almost call to you and there's something almost addicting and with the series staples of having speed runs and new modes such as Invisible Enemy mode as well as the option to play as either Chris, who hangs out with Wesker and Rebecca Chambers who starred in Resident Evil Zero and Jill who hangs out with Barry, the originator of the \"Jill Sandwich\" line (that only gets improved a little bit, in other words, he still says the word \"sandwich\") there's a lot to get through.While the original had more a stillness then creep factor, this game amps up the tension and is quite fun and spooky to play and is one of the best of the series as well as the Gamecube.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2007"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs.

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7I","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"A fitting homage to director Tony Scott (campaign review)","reviewText":"Dark, gritty, and incredibly violent, \"Max Payne 3\" was clearly inspired by the works of the late, great Tony Scott. Spoken words of dialogue sporadically popping up on the screen as white text... color distortions and filters... multiple frames split with bold lines... a muted color palette... all of these elements of style summoned Scott's films to mind, while playing MP3. More than anything else, however, it was the gritty storytelling and the darkness of character that reminded me of Scott. The first thing that popped into my mind when I began playing MP3 was \"Man on Fire\", the great Denzel Washington revenge movie. And at its core, that's exactly what MP3 is: an interactive revenge movie.I can't think of another game I've played that's as atmospheric as MP3. You can feel the suffering of this man, and all his many follies. The other characters are also richly drawn, and the settings of Brazil (both the impoverished areas and the wealthy ones) are created effectively and convincingly. The various chapters are oftentimes brilliant, with some of the standouts being an enormous soccer stadium, a river traversed by speedboat, and a siege upon a luxury yacht in the Panama Canal. The story, voice acting, and cut scenes are all surprisingly good, and they paint a story that at first seems generic, but slowly becomes a riveting force that propels you forward through the campaign, eager to see the next chapter.I feel like Rockstar Studios would have been better served by creating a new IP for this game, because it's so much more advanced and sophisticated than the other two titles in the series... but that's far more of a compliment than a complaint.I took off one star for some issues: Foremost, the violence. I understand this is a violent story, and a mature title designed for adults, just like an R rated film. But some of the violence is simply gratuitous, particularly the slow motion, close up kills that signify the clearing of enemies in a room- and to make matters worse, this is hardly a new \"trick\". \"Stranglehold\" was doing this way back in 2006.Second, the mechanics are a tad dated, and not quite as smooth as the best of the competition. Rockstar insists on mapping their aim and trigger inputs to the bumper buttons for some reason (just like in \"Red Dead Redemption\"), as opposed to the trigger buttons. This is fundamentally inconvenient for a couple of reasons... it defies the industry standards, and makes it difficult for gamers who are hardwired for conventional controls (alternate button mapping is possible, but you can't use the triggers for triggers, no matter what you choose). There is a very good reason why the trigger buttons on your controller are called trigger buttons... it's because they replicate triggers!The slow motion trick (otherwise known as \"bullet time\") has not aged particularly well. The combat of this game is at its best when it relies upon the stop and pop, cover based shooting. Diving around in slow motion feels forced, and is not very fun. I only used slow motion when I was absolutely forced to, because there was no cover around.These shortcomings, however, cannot undo what is a fantastic game, a credit to Rockstar Studios, and a fitting homage to Tony Scott.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2012"}

Players will achieve soaring levels of power, explore Northrend (the vast icy continent of the Lich King), and battle high-level heroes to determine the ultimate fate of Azeroth. As you face the dangers of the frigid, harsh north, prepare to master the dark necromantic powers of the Death Night -- World of Warcraft's first Hero class. No longer servants of the Lich King, the Death Knights begin their new calling as experienced, formidable adversaries. Each is heavily armed, armored, and in possession of a deadly arsenal of forbidden magic.If you have a World of Warcraft account with a character of at least level 55, you will be able to create a new level-55 Death Knight of any race (if on a PvP realm, the Death Knight must be the same faction as your existing character). And upon entering the new world, your Death Knight will begin to quest to level 80, gaining potent new abilities and talents along the way. This expansion allows for only one Death Knight per realm, per account.New Environments in Northrend AwaitJourney through the remote, diverse lands of Northrend and explore Dragonblight, Grizzly Hills, Borean Tundra, and Howling Fjord. Named for bones of perished dragons and majestic shrines to the fallen creatures, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.Not everything is frozen in Northrend. The lush mountains of Grizzly Hills are the ancestral home to the furbolgs, who have grown accustomed to relative peace. Although their tranquility is being challenged by trappers, goblins, and ice trolls, Grizzly Hills remains a vast and dangerous wilderness.The southwestern tip of Northrend is home to the sprawling Borean Tundra. The Horde has established a dominant presence in this icy portion of the continent and has formed a bond with the tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman. Magical energy is afoot in the region, and it has caused increased tension.High above the Great Sea at the southeastern tip of Northrend lies the Howling Fjord. Ancient mythology holds that a race of half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land, founding a prosperous civilization. They mysteriously vanished, leaving deserted villages and abandoned temples. In present times, the Alliance and the Horde have come to Howling Fjord to confront the Lich King. Strangely, this has prompted the return of the vrykul, who are attacking the Alliance and Horde settlements. Howling Fjord presents a difficult challenge on two fronts: withstanding the vrykul's onslaught and battling the evil Lich King.A Multitude of MonstersStrange and terrifying creatures inhabit the frozen continent of Northrend, such as Nerubian Viziniers, Plague Eruptors, Shoveltusks and Flesh Giants, to name just a few. Half-spider, half-humanoid, the viziniers utilize sorcery and high intelligence to emerge as the rulers of Nerubians' underground kingdom. The Plague Eruptors are walking corpses created by the Lich King's evil experiments to spread horror and chaos across the living world.Massive curved antlers make it easy to identify the Shoveltusks. These grumpy beasts are very dangerous, territorial, and best left alone. The Flesh Giants are nothing short of nightmarish abominations. Cobbled together from the pieces of giant body parts, the Flesh Giants employ tremendous strength to carry out the Lich King's wishes.The World of Warcraft: Wrath of King Lich expansion pack allows you to engage in epic siege warfare. The pack presents the first Hero class and allows you to transform your Death Knight's look with character customization that even include hairstyles and dances. You'll enjoy exploring the Northrend and all its environments and dungeons, filled with some of the deadliest creatures -- and greatest treasures -- on all of Azeroth.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemPC: Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista (with latest Service Packs)Mac: Mac OS X 10.4.11 or newerCPUPC: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlong XP 1500+Mac: PowerPC G5 1.6 GHz or Intel Core Duo processorPC: Dual-core processor, such as Intel Pentium D or AmD Athlong 64 X2Mac: Intel 1.8 GHz processor or betterGraphics HardwarePC: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transfor and Lighting with 32 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon 7200 or NVIDIA GeForce2 class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transform and Lighting with 64 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon 9600 or NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4600 class card or betterPC: 3D Graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capabilities with 128 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA 7600 class card or better.MemoryPC: 512 MB (1 GB for Vista)Mac: 1 GBPC: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)Mac: 2 GBHard Drive Space15 GB of free spaceAll Platform RequirementsKeyboard and mouse, required for controls.

They've created massive buildings in many of the towns, and if you go upstairs or look around, there's literally nothing in half of them.  They're totally empty.  No chairs, no couches, no fires, no nothing.  Floors, walls, and stairs, that's it.  It makes the world feel so much less alive.  In one town in particular they made huge buildings, and it's like they forgot to put things in them.  I sent upstairs in one and there was literally about four giant floors to this building and outside of the first floor there was nothing on any of the other floors.  Not an NPC, not a chair, not a fire, not a picture.  Nothing.2. In Burning Crusade I was changing out lvl 60 purples for new lvl 61 greens.  Meaning, my rare gear was being made worthless by common items at lvl 61.  That bugged me, but what bugs me more is that from level 70 to level 79 I had only replaced 2 pieces of my level 70 epic items.  They went from one extreme to the next, and going through a long leveling process without the fun of upgrading gear made the game a lot less fun for me.  I hit level 80 and upgraded all of my gear with auction house rare items, and finally got that upgrade, but it was pretty much one big upgrade, and not a process.  Again, not fun.  Next time, hopefully the split the difference between BC and LK.3. No recipes to search for and buy in the world.  It seems they did away with having rare recipes be given by various NPC's in the environment.  Everything is trainable now, and the reasons for checking all of the NPC's are gone.  If you need to sell something or get a repair, it's your only reason to talk to an NPC merchant.  This relates again to point one, the world feels dead.  Those little hidden items that only certain merchants would sell added something to the game that made it seem a bit more alive and interesting.  No longer could I go into a town excited to see what I might find for sale there, because there's nothing to find of interest anymore.So those may seem like minor gripes to some, but it made the entire leveling process, which is long, a boring chore.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2009"}

He is trapped by his past.  He trapped by the future that he wants to have. He is trapped by the ending of the old west and the coming of the new. He is trapped by a goverment that will use any means necessary to eliminate people like the man he used to be.  His only way out of this trap is to take down the members of his old gang so that the goverment will release his family.All John Marston wants is his family back so that he can retire back to his farm with his wife and raise his son.  To do this he will deal with tricksters, mad men, revolutionaries, legends, and law men.  All in order to capture the former members of his own gang so that they can be brought to justice in the name of progress.John's long journey for redemption begins when he steps off the train to begin his hunt.  Will he find that he is redeemed when his task is done or will he find that scales of fate are not so easily tipped?======I really liked playing this game.  It really reminded me of bio shock and mass effect story wise.  The story in this game made me want to keep playing in order to see what happened next and find out how John's quest to reunite with his family turned out.  John Marston is also a very likable character.  It's easy to forget that no matter what he is trying to be, he has still killed hundereds of people for profit.He doesn't try to make many excuses about his past, only that he saw himself more as a robin hood character than a highway bandit that murdered people in cold blood.  Apparently it took a botched robbery job, during which he was left for dead, for him to figure out that he may not have been on the right path in life.This is the central conflict in the games story really.  Can someone just walk away from everything they have done and expect to be left alone, even if they try to make amends?There are several characters in this game that come and go as the games goes on.  Just about everyone of them is memorable and well written. For the most part they are not one dimensonal and kept me interested enogh that I actually wanted to see what kind of crazy scheme I was going to get dragged into on the next mission.  That being said, most of them disappear after you move onto the next section of the game and you don't hear anything else about them unless you read the ingame news papers that pop up every once in awhile.There are also a ton of side quests, mini games, and collectiosn quests to keep completists happy.  There is also a online componet that I cannot comment on since I did not play it.In closing this is a westren themed game worth playing.  The story is interesting and the gameplay is fun. On a side note, this game does end in a sense. The ending of the game is a little off, but it is how westrens tend to end. It also lets you go back and do any side missions that you may have missed.  It did actually make me think a little bit about the interactions between Marston and the goverment agents that were holding his family. Ross may have been ruthless and willing to do whatever it took to get the job done, but he does give Marston his reward; even if it is short lived.I would recommend this to any one that likes sandbox games, games that have stories that make you think a little bit and those whol like the old west setting. m.a.c","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2010"}

BADER \"Q8  AL BADER\"","summary":"Demon's Souls - The Most Boring Game of the Year","reviewText":"Overrated and Overhyped ,To me, Demon's Souls is not a true RPG like many would think it is. Demon's Souls is an action game, period. Problem is there are no quests except destroying demons. At least, there is a cooperative multiplayer option which is the best way to play the game, but the modalities are so complex it becomes frustrating quite fast. Some compared Demon's Souls to Sacred 2 before release and they can't be more wrong. First, Demon's Souls is not an open world game and there are no quests.Well, maybe many of you will find me harsh with my comments, but the game Demon's Souls remind me most is Atlus' \"dying\" game \"Baroque\", where death is the only issue at winning the game... . \"Baroque\" was mediocre at best, and I feel almost the same with Demon's Souls. The exception is graphics and controls.Demon's Souls might take place in a kind of hell, but it's so beautiful you almost forget you're in a demon-filled world. Animation is really realistic. Audio is great too.I do not say Demon's Souls is a terrible game. I know some people who will like it, but it's pretty \"Hit or Miss\". It doesn't deserve a 9.0, as these games normally appeal to a general public, and DS is far from being a player-friendly game. Not everyone will like it, and it's dedicated to a certain type of gamer decided to spend countless hours in the same place and being rewarded for completing a very hard game. DS is not a story based game either, so if you like action-RPGs with a great story and fun quests, don't spend your money on Demon's Souls, you'll regret it. Wait for a few weeks at the release of DragonAge Origins. I'm certain this game will please you.For me, Demon's Souls is a big deception, maybe because I was expecting something else. By the way, it has a great feel and good controls. You'll probably like it, but it's not a game for everyone, so don't be surprised if you feel it's not your kind of game...soo......I can't recommend Demon's Souls at all.

Your mission isn't terribly new (infiltrate a terrorist base and blow everything up), but the gameplay is: your numerous enemies are watching for you, and you are encouraged to sneak rather than simply charge in. Every level brings new challenges. You fight snipers, invisible ninjas, psychic warriors, and even an M-1 tank! As the father of the modern spy game genre, this game is an instant classic.Your allies and superiors speak to you via a cool, implanted radio,  monitoring your progress, offering  tips--but failing to give you the full story. The combination of a mysterious and engaging plot and high in-game tension makes this a thrilling ride. Campy humor also abounds as you rescue beautiful women, verbally spar with your allies, and blow up enemies in the bathroom. A user-friendly control interface allows for sniping, hiding, crawling, and running, and the graphics leave nothing to be desired.

Despite the fact it's not really my area of interest (I'm a Resident Evil type guy) I bought the game (heck, it was 20 bucks, why not?).  This was last year.  I never finished it, and finally sold it.  Why?  Good question.  I finally decided that, ultimately, I wasn't involved at all with any of the characters or story events.  I didn't care what happened.  Do I think MGS is overrated?  Well, sort of.  Granted, the graphics, controls, and audio are as perfect as perfect can get, and there is no doubt that there are innovative elements (especially the sneaking about and the enemy soldier AI) but I found the characters and story as cold and sterile as the Arctic location in which most of the game is set.  It has no SOUL.  For this type of game, I feel this kind of personal involvement is VITAL. I wasn't swept up in the events like in Parasite Eve or Vagrant Story.  Metal Gear left me with the feeling I was performing a chore rather than embarking on a world-changing adventure.  The story felt scripted and unnatural, the characters flat and lifeless.  I think Metal Gear affected me the same way as this year's Shenmue for Dreamcast:  an undisputed technical masterpiece that felt devoid of humanity.  In any case, any gamer with a pulse should play through it (for the Sniper Wolf bits if nothing else), but be prepared for Snake and Co. to keep a distance from your heart.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2001"}

Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done.

The two-player battles are fun, the singe player missions are fun, caring for chao is fun, everything is fun except for one thing. Tails is stuck in a stupid machine like Eggman while everyone else roams around freely and quickly. I can't believe Tails has to lug around a giant machine, unlike in Sonic Adventure, where Tails could fly around and walk. Tails' missions have to be the worst and the most boring, especially how he has to use a bazooka/cannon rather than using combat. It just makes Tails look as lazy as Eggman. Other then that, the game is fun. The car missions are also fun and challenging. Two player races are also fun, my favorite character being Metal Sonic. His shield is intimidating, threatening, and just plain awesome, even though he doesn't have any speed-up/freezing/attack moves, the shield makes up for it. Collecting emblems and rings isn't bad either, and it's very cool how you get to care for your own chao, similar to Sonic Adventure. The chao races are EXTREMELY challenging, though, and, since I don't think the prizes are very valuable and worthy since only one of my chao gets to play with them, I don't enter my chao into those much.

Almost 3 decades has come and gone and shooters have remained the same. Woow these guys did get away with it, and they have come out with amazing results. This is the power of creativity.We have played shooters with zombies in them, horror sci-fi games, different permutations and combinations. All have few different monsters as enemies. Either you shoot them in the head or it is some kind of quick press events to kill the bosses. Here you have to understand what every enemy is, remember how to kill when you see them again. As you walk through the levels, you see clues written in blood on what to do with each enemy.The game continuously throws new surprises. You have to explore every level to find items to upgrade your weapons. When you first step into ZeroG... the fights gets crazy. Enemies will come from every direction, the map is a big globe. The level design is fantastic. Every single detail from hospital rooms, kitchens what ever that will be required in a big space ship is there. It is not like the super tidy carpeted Trek space ship. It is supposed to be some thing like a dirty mining rig, and you surely get the feel of it.There is lot of creativity that has gone in.. which I didn't expect from a big publisher like EA. You don't find any M16, AK46, turret gun here. All the weapons are mining equipment. Our future mining equipments are lot more interesting than what we have today. As the main character is a engineer lot of things he does very cohesive with the gameplay. When you actually fix a lever and move things around it feels lot more natural.I do have to say one thing about this game. It is truly meant for mature audience. Please don't buy this game for very young children. There are few sections where you have to kick and stomp baby zombies. It gets too violent and scary. But as a horror/survival/thriller you need creepy enemies. Also they do give you a reason to keep searching and not quit half way around. The theme may be slightly similar to DMC4 girl friend search... but executed very well.One gripe I have with this game as with DMC4 is backtracking. The game is quite long by today's standard. The space ship feels much better because you are visiting some of the same areas while backtracking. It is not horrible, but it is there. I wish they hadn't done that.To give developers credit, they have done enough to avoid the regular backtracking nightmares like lost routes. You can always use your analog stick to show the dotted green walk line.Previously I thought this one will be like Silent hill, this one is more closer to Resident Evil. Falls more in the creepy, scary game than survival horror game.Technically, I don't have to say much. Any one who has seen videos of the game already know this game looks stunning. Fantastic way to start the holiday season. Brand new IP, silky smooth game play, really well done game. Go treat yourself.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2008"}

It's visually nice, despite the occasional utterly bad camera placements (What is this, 1999?).  It's pretty much a hack n' slash with some RPG elements thrown in.  Tracking all your items, your armor, all the gems or ingredients or what-not is a chore; so much so that the game gets tiring after only a half-hour or so.  It's kind of fun, but the dialogue with NPCs is just draining, so tedious.  I got this for cheap, so it's OK by me, but I wouldn't recommend it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8LY","description":"As stranded, miniature spaceperson Olimar, you must find the missing 30  parts your spaceship needs to get you back home. The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"Madisen","summary":"Great fun, but challenging.","reviewText":"The first thing I would like to say is that if you plan to buy this, you should get the accompanying strategy guide. If you don't, you'll find this frustrating. With the help of a guide, though, the game becomes charming and challenging.First, the game is gorgeous for being released so early in the GameCube's life cycle. Sparkling lakes, peaceful meadows, and charred fire-pits all have a realistic, but still \"painted\" look to them. The music fits the environments perfectly, too; it makes you feel happy and sunny at times, cautious and aware at others.The controls work very well, and generally you won't have trouble controlling your Pikmin (if you're not familiar with the concept here, it's that you have to control your Pikmin so that they can gather items for you within a time limit). You can separate them, clump them together, or throw them individually at the touch of a button. Most everything--unrolling bridges, attacking enemies, carrying items, etc.--can be done with a few simple commands.Nintendo is indeed the master of the sense of accomplishment, and every time you grab an item, you'll feel proud of yourself, even if you used a guide like I did. You collect spaceship parts, and with every one you get, the spaceship will change in appearance. It starts out looking like a piece of junk, but as you proceed, it transforms into a top-of-the-line machine. You really feel like you're getting somewhere. The parts themselves are all interesting, from the practical (the geiger counter), to the whimsical (a giant piggy bank).Enemies are simultaneously scary and silly. They're funny-looking, and include giant ladybug-like things and huge frogs; but the second you hear your Pikmin scream and see hundreds of little Pikmin ghosts rise into the air, you'll fear them. Not only do you need lots of Pikmin if you want to complete the game (and harvesting more takes precious time), but you get emotionally attached to them, making every battle tense.Overall, this game is great fun. Grabbing the spaceship parts, defeating the enemies, and doing all the other necessary things to complete the game (harvesting more Pikmin, blowing up walls, walking through fire plumes, and such), is an engrossing challenge, and makes you feel \"smart\". It has something for everyone; tough strategy, intense action, and beautiful, whimsical environments to explore. I would reccomend it for anyone. This, people, is the Nintendo difference.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2005"}

I started to gain hope for this game after I heard they were focusing only on the single player campaign and  completely ignoring multiplayer. When I found out the original story creator was working on the game again (Wasn't around for the second game and it showed), I knew it would be a day one purchase.Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt. Words that fuel your exploration into the world of Columbia. When you are first thrown into the world  via the lighthouse you would expect to start fighting right away like most shooters. This is where the game is unlike others and completely threw me off the normal pacing I'm used to. You are welcomed into the city and able to explore a pretty big area getting a grasp what this world is like compared to the bottom.Right away you can tell the type of atmosphere these people live in and what type of propaganda Comstock has fed them. I was really surprised the lengths they went to and the risks they took to portray the lengths people will go to for a \"perfect society\" for themselves. Even all the audio logs you can find randomly around are really interesting and tells you the whole overarching story and the consequences of some actions that have been taken along the way.The best story motivator is Elizabeth. This the best companion I have had in any video I've played. The way she grows up along the way and her reaction to the events that have impacts to the story is huge feat of storytelling. If you spend the time allowing her to explore (IF you run ahead she will follow you instead of exploring), the time spent to her dialogue and first exposure outside of her room is so wonderfully created that it wowed me throughout the game. The story has a great ending and it doesn't leave on a cliffhanger or anything that seems like it was cut out for the DLC season pass.No matter which version you choose to play, the world looks amazing and actually outshines the immersible rapture.  When you first see the city from the sky its a breath taking sight and really sets the tone they are trying to set. The houses, towns, balloon platforms, people, and even the random trash lying around has detail added to them and is really nice to see. The game still has that look of bioshock on top of it as well, Like the weapons, Vigors (plasmids in Bio 1) and pretty much everything else has that bioshock polish added to them.The facial animations on the people really surprised me on this one, Especially Elizabeth. You can tell what they are feeling and be able to understand their pain, happiness or whatever they are feeling at the time. Speaking of Elizabeth, her character design and animations she pulls off are wonderfully crafted and really pulls you into the type of character she is.Even though this takes place on a giant sky city, the level design keeps you on your toes with different areas as you progress through the game. While there is some minor backtracking, there are changes enough to the point it doesn't really have you feeling like your wasting time going back and forth.The combat focuses on two weapons that you can switch out at any time and the mixtures with them and the vigors makes combat less of a chore and more of a fun experiment on how to completely destroy your enemies in crazy ways. Like for example you can throw an enemy into the air with Bucking Bronco, push him away with Undertow into an electric trap, while shooting at them the entire time. Only a few time the enemies get annoying but it never really bothered me, just slowed down my progress.This is I feel, will be the best game of 2013. The game has such an amazing story if you pay attention and find all the audio tapes. It merges itself seamlessly with the franchise and the ending makes it feel like a total conclusion on what has happened in the Infinite saga.~ Vaultnishi, 08-13Buy, Sale or Pass:Buy it, than buy the season pass since the game is amazing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2013"}

I've been using it as a full on media and gaming system for the past two months and feel that I have had enough experience with it to give a good idea about the product.Games:Off the bat Xbox One provided a decent amount of games for launch. You can get your usual Call Of Duty & Forza, but what I enjoyed the most was Assassins Creed and Battlefield 4. The games aren't going to be that much different from the Xbox 360 versions because developers are not using the full extent of the Xbox One right away. Those games are coming soon though!Operating System:First off, yes I am an Apple person. I work off Apple product ands use them in my everyday life. Xbox is really the only Microsoft product I use and having loved the Xbox 360, I was really hoping for a easy to navigate operating system. I hate to say that the home screen can get confusing when you need to make adjustments and the current friends list is way more complicated then it needs to be. As for party chats, it will take a little time to figure it out, and it's not the best way of doing it but from the looks of it the community is speaking out and we can only hope that Microsoft will provide a update.Kinect + Voice:The Kinect system that comes with every Xbox One is just as powerful as Microsoft claims it to be. The device can sign you into your account through facial recognition and can pick up the smallest of movements. That being said, the new TV guide system that is built into the Xbox One works flawlessly with my current cable provider and actually makes it a lot easier to find channels and programs that I enjoy watching. You can use your voice to control what you watch and even to scroll through the guide. No need for the controller!Overall I have no regrets with the purchase of the Xbox One. I am hoping for more updates to the operating system and a few minor changes to Xbox Live, but overall the new additions to the Xbox line and the future is looking good for the games that are coming out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVUA","description":"","reviewerName":"Patrick H. Nguyen","summary":"great follow-up to the 360","reviewText":"If you had a great time with the 360, you'll have an even better time with the One.  Hardware.  It's a little bigger than the original 360 console.  It's much quieter than the 360.  Bluray movies look and sound great on the One's BluRay drive which is slot-loading.  The hard drive is now internal like with the 360 S console.  Currently, it comes with a 500 GB internal hard drive but will soon have external hard drive support which allows you to install games and other things.  This is a good setup because it means you can keep adding hard drives for more storage.  Better than replacing the internal hard drive which means you are losing 500GB by swapping drives (i.e., with the swapping method, if you buy a 2 GB drive and replace the internal 500 GB drive, you are paying for a 2 GB drive but you're only gaining 1.5 GB of space).Software-wise, the new OS is great with some early adopter rough edges.  The OS is much faster than the 360 OS.  You can actually run multiple apps at once.  So if you want to watch a Twitch stream on the side while playing a game, you can.  Or if you want to watch a football game on the side while playing a game, you can too.  The system supports standby now at both the system level and the game level.  So if you're in the middle of a story campaign for a game, you can go back to the dashboard and turn off the console.  Then when you go back to play, it'll quickly load to the exact spot that you stopped.  It's like waking up from sleep, it's that fast.  Which means the need for checkpoints is less and games launch much faster.  Note that if you swap between games a lot, you lose the quickloading.  The quickloading is for the last game you played.  when you load a different game, you have to load that new game since it's not in cache.In the beginning, there are a lot of updates.  I own the Day One console so there were a lot of big updates (gigabytes).  The later consoles will presumably have less updates since they will already be installed (the updates weren't ready back in November).  Now the Xbox One fully downloads updates to games and apps while your Xbox is in sleep/standby mode.  This is different than the 360 where you had to launch the program to update it.  On the 360, you could queue multiple downloads and the 360 would turn off when they're done.  With the One, it can update and you'll never know it except for a notification when you turn on your Xbox saying that the app/game is ready.  This is one of the reasons why you want to enable sleep mode (though it does use more electricity than when completely off).  Then again, my TV in sleep mode uses about the same amount of electricity.The games have been great so far.  Forza Motorsport 5 is awesome.  Best racing game out there with incredible graphics and a ton of fun.  Also have Dead Rising 3 which is zombie-killing fun.  Ryse is like playing a movie.  The graphics are amazing and the story is good.  They used a movie director/storywriter to write the story and it shows.  Also have Peggle 2, Max: The Curse of Brotherhood (must own!!!), and Powerstar Gold which are fun downloadable games.  Call of Duty: Ghosts is a lot of fun and much better than the 360 version (I bought the $70 360/One pack to get both copies).  Can't wait for Titanfall and other games coming down the pipe.I have my Xbox One connected to the Mediasonic HomeWorX HW150PVR which allows me to get OTA television since I'm a cable cutter.  Works great with the Kinect controls.  I just say, \"what's on Fox?\" and I see a TV guide that shows some description.  I say, \"watch CW\" and it goes to the CW channel.  Or if you see a show on the screen, you can say it.  Like I said, \"watch magnum P.I.\" and it tuned to that show!  It just knows what to do which is pretty amazing.  Here's me using my Xbox TV with my voice:  [...]If you like chatting, voice or video, the One is great.  The Skype audio/video is amazing.  full-screen 1080p.  The chat is a huge step up for parties.  If the 360 chat is like AM radio, the One chat is like CD quality.  When my friend first heard my voice over the One, she was shocked how different it sounded, like I was a new person.  It's just so much clearer.  Even better than cell phone quality.There's so much to the new Xbox that I'm constantly learning new things every day.

Resonance of Fate is a Tri-Ace offering, so if you know what that means, you know what to expect. If not, that's OK - what it means is that you generally have an interesting and original battle system, a compelling story concept, slow but (usually) methodical development, and a ton of grinding. In fact, this game's battle system is actually incredible, but the story development pays for it, as it is woeful. Also, grinding has been mostly cut back this time around (at least by Tri-Ace standards). If that's your cup of tea, you're in the right place. If not, well, look elsewhere.I won't even bother explaining the story - your best bet is to watch the opening movies (BOTH of them - another appears after the title screen), and then wait until around chapter 14 (out of 16 chapters) to see what's going on. By then, you probably won't care.THE GOOD:BATTLE MECHANICS: I have to confess, it took me three separate tries and almost a year and a half before I finally got into this game, but when you get it, it's great. Basically, battles are as follows: you have machine guns and handguns. Machine guns do what is called \"scratch damage,\" which is temporary damage. Hand guns do permanent damage, and convert \"scratch damage\" into permanent damage as well. The (obvious) catch: machine guns do a ton more damage than hand guns, but scratch damage heals over time (sometimes very quickly).[Author's Note: I realize it is absurd to think of a world where machine guns do essentially fake damage, but if realism is your thing, you might want to leave now. We have only scratched the surface of the absurdity.]There are also throwing weapons, such as grenades, but the majority of the time, this is your set-up. Enemies also do damage to you, but always in the form of scratch damage. However, when your life bar is completely depleted, you lose gems known as \"bezels\". Lose all of your bezels, and all damage becomes permanent damage. The (not-so-obvious) catch: bezels are also the currency to fire off your so-called \"hero actions,\" which is the ticket to multiple attacks and massive damage, since you can \"charge\" your weapon without fear of reprisal. And of course, there is the \"tri-attack,\" which must be charged, also costs bezels, but allows all three members of your party to attack simultaneously.Sounds confusing? Well, it is. Thankfully, there is a tutorial inside of the arena. Not so thankfully, the arena is outside the town, which means that if you get caught in an attack, you will probably have no clue what is going on. Even when you get to the tutorial, the explanations are often so vague that you will find yourself going online to see what they're really talking about (the \"smackdown\" attack, which is mostly useless, was hell on me). However, once you get it, it's a joy to behold. While I will stop short of saying that battle is strategic, it certainly requires thought, and you will die more than once (probably in the first chapter, no less). But Tri-Ace has never disappointed me with a battle system, and this is no exception. However, not unlike Star Ocean, it is a real pain to switch characters.CUSTOMIZATION: This game has a ton of customization options. First (and definitely of lesser importance), you can dress your characters up in a wide variety of ways. You can dye their hair, give them glasses, give them a casual look or a work look, etc. Moreover, your choices will be reflected in the cutscenes. If I have one gripe, it's that these costumes are noting more than aesthetic - there are no changes to character parameters. So, e.g., although a pair of boots might say that it protects you from monsters, it doesn't.More important is the customization of the gun. Again, the game does a poor job of explaining the system, but once you get it, you can have many customization options at your fingertips. In fact, this has an added bonus: different guns can customize in different ways, so you can actually get a lot of use out of early guns even when later guns appear. Of course, the actual customization is absurd. Why put one sight on your gun when you can have...10 sights? (I am not kidding, BTW - you can easily have 10 sights on your gun.) When affixing barrels to guns, you might actually hook them to...a handgrip? And why would you affix handgrips in multiple locations, anyway? It doesn't make a lick of sense, but if you can get over that, it's a ton of fun. Of course, some parts require rare elements which must be won (randomly) in battle, while others require many, MANY wins in the Arena.If I have one gripe regarding curstomization, it's the lack of a \"try before you buy\" option. Sometimes, affixing a part to your gun is a confusing process, requiring perfect alignment of 2 or even three separate fixtures. However, you can't actually see your gun when you buy or create parts, so you will either go back and forth between shop and menu to determine the best fit, or else just guess at it, and hope it works.OVERWORLD MECHANICS: A lot of people don't like the overworld in Resonance of Fate. I am not one of them. The idea is as follows: everyone lives on a giant tower, which requires energy for activation. In order to activate the tower, you place different \"hexes\" on the overworld, which will energize them. The world is completely made up of these hexes, and the hexes you use to activate the world have different shapes and sizes. If your hex doesn't fit on the world, you can't use it. Also, sometimes you will need colored hexes to activate cities (once again, absurdity rules. Are these cities completely inactive before you energize them? But then...why are there people living there?) I'm making this sound more confusing than it is - it's actually a pretty simple system, although there is one major confusion (more later). Sometimes when you activate a part of the overworld, you will get a treasure chest. This can range from a first aid item (easily the most useless thing in the game - if you are using first aid items, you're in trouble), to special grenades or rounds for your gun (very useful) to Bezel shards (obviously the most useful of all).There are also objects called \"terminals\" in the overworld. By using colored hexes, you can unlock these, and later, activate them. This is actually confusing, though - sometimes you'll try to place a colored hex, only to be told that it's impossible. That's because you need to create a colored energy station. I can't tell you how long that took me to figure out. However, once you get it, you can link terminals together to produce devastating effects. For example, I was able to link terminals to the Arena, and would get 3x experience, 6x item drop rate, and 4x rare item drop rate in every battle I fought!THE BAD:STORY: As I mentioned before, Tri-Ace is known for glacial development in story, although the concepts are often good. Here, they fail on both sides. I thought the concept looked promising after the opening movies (particularly the second one). A church that rules the world, but hides a secret that could destroy it? Sounds like a winner to me. Unfortunately, that's not exactly how things go. In fact, I am at the last boss in the game (only because I am doing a lot of grinding for the plat), and I still can't really tell you the main focus here. And a major part of that problem is that the developers do NOTHING to explain this story. The game itself consists of 16 chapters + 1 prologue. These chapters consist of some of the most mundane tasks imaginable. You might bring a rock to a cardinal. You might find a statue in a forest. You might take another statue into another forest. Even as late as chapter 13(!), you are doing silly things (a Christmas party, in which you shoot kids with presents as they run up to you and stun you). It's just so...stupid. Thankfully, you probably won't care because of the battle system (while the tasks are idiotic, the bosses keeping you from these tasks are anything but, and often provide incredible challenge), but come on. We can do better.RANDOM ENCOUNTERS: I love the battle system, but it has one flaw - it takes time. That's fine when I'm in a dungeon - I'm meeting new enemies and developing ways to deal with them. But in the overworld? It gets old. Fast. Often, you'll find yourself fighting the same enemies you fought in the initial chapters (the \"Closed Road\" hexes are a different story, as the enemies actually level up sensibly). Sometimes, you can end a battle fast by attacking the leader. However, often, you'll have to defeat every enemy on the screen. Remember that after almost every tun, each enemy will get to attack you. Often, they have separate animations, which really makes battle drag.So anyway, it's basically a Tri-Ace game. You've got your great battle system. You've got your crazy difficulty spikes. You've got your story that goes nowhere for hours (actually, this is worse than usual). It really depends on what you want from a game. I love it, though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2012"}

It has been a while since trick racing has been around.  The first couple hours are a blast.  I would have liked to see more options for customizing the quads.  You do build them from the ground up, but there's just not enough different parts.  Class D is where you begin. It's not that hard once you get the hang of the controls, to place first in every race.  Just make sure you stay on the trails, you do not get rewarded for improvising and tryng to take massive shortcuts.  When you go where the game does'nt want you to go, it merely throws you off of your bike.  There are some sneaky shortcuts, but these are too far and between.Racing is a pain at times-Here's the three most frustrating:1. Even if you place first in all the races, you will always start a race in last (you start every race at the back of the pack).2. Whenever you use your turbo (in campaign mode) the computer uses his too.  I find it funny that the computer always knows when your going to use your turbo and matches you exactly.3. Taking the right routes on the track is a must.  Even if it's your first time racing a track-if you take the wrong route, you better bet the computer knows the right one-(ex. you will be in first, and because you take the right fork instead of the left, you will be fourteent after the fork).Freesty;e mode is however a Blast!-This is where you compete for points by doing massive tricks.Hopefully they come up with updates or patches to fix these issues.  Especially in later stages, it becomes nearly impossible to score in the top three, let alone win the race.It does have some great music, and overall is not a bad game.

All class and characters have their own strengths and weaknesses but, they are all well balanced.You can transform from robot to vehicle form or vehicle to robot form at anytime during the game. You can transform during combat in the heat of battle and even if you jump in mid-air! The transformation is fluid and fast just like the gameplay! Combat is fast and fierce and has a lot of moments that made me go \"damn!\".Tranformers War for Cybertron is without a doubt fantastic! And it is also the most underappreciated game based on on the Transformers universe. Many gamers have become jaded with these types of the games because the previous ones were no good. But this title in particular is not from any movie adaptation, so it is not the crapfest usually associated movie tied in games. Instead what the developers from High Moon Studios did is put together the best elements from other shooters into this amazing and unique experience.Even though the camera is from the third person, it plays and controls very similar to first-person-shooters (FPS), so anyone that has played FPS in the past will immediately feel comfortable with this game's controls. There is no other game currently out that give you the ability to transform and feel powerful at the same time. Does the game have flaws? Of course it does, but these flaws are so minor that they do not hinder the gameplay.Transformers War for Cybertron passes with flying colors. This is the Transfomers game we've all been waiting for!PROS:+excellent weapons+excellent cut scenes+excellent levels+excellent transformations+excellent multiplayer+four player co-op+excellent story+excellent graphics+excellent controls+excellent sound effects+excellent music+voice acting+melee combatCons:-A.I. in campaign is dumb as a doorknob-robots don't look like the cartoon series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2010"}

To start with the graphics are very basic, it looks more like it could be a Nintendo game (not SNES), and the plotline is simplistic going to different areas to defeat a big boss and get an item that lets you go to the next area. Simple isn't it? But then the real worthwhile part about this game is its originality, you can jump in the game, you can cut down trees with your axe, blow up walls with your bombs and climb walls with your claws. Another interesting part is that you can see the enemies as characters on the overhead map! So you can run into them and fight them, but then rather than fighting them like Zelda, it takes you to a battle screen like a true RPG. Something else is that rather than a real overhead map of the world where you explore, you start at an area which gives you four choices of where to go, up down left and right. You select the path and the hero will take that path automatically, no monsters or anything! The monsters are all inside of the areas, towns, caves and caverns.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00CMC6HCY","description":"","reviewerName":"Shawn Bird","summary":"My WWE 2K14 Review","reviewText":"WE 2K14 is the first time a WWE game has released under a different publisher. 2K Sports picked up the franchise following the bankruptcy of THQ, the series former publisher. The hope for wrestling fans is that this new partnership will result in better produced games because under THQ it seemed the series was simply coasting along each year. This game adds to everything that was already there, making it better and the new &#8220;30 Years of WrestleMania&#8221; mode is a major addition. By and large, WWE 2K14 is the best in the series.Outside of the addition of a few new game modes and features, WWE 2K14 hasn&#8217;t brought too much new to the series. Now those features are great and add new levels of entertainment, but a lot of what this year&#8217;s entry offers isn&#8217;t much different than the previous ones. There are additional moves, &#8220;OMG! Moment&#8221; special moves (introduced last year) and new &#8220;catch finishers,&#8221; but this is only skin deep. There really isn&#8217;t much more to mechanics or new moves to get used to. Even after a few months of not playing WWE 13, it was easy to jump right back into this year&#8217;s entry and start beating down every opponent that dared enter the ring.The WWE series has always had its share of glitches and bugs, but for me they have never been anything game breaking or even really annoying. It was typical for an opponent AI to do weird stuff like going out of the ring and start tearing apart the announcing table and then coming back into the ring, or in ladder matches, having the opponent taking the ladder down just to put it back up.It seems in WWE 2K14 many of those bugs have been fixed, but the game brings its own set of new glitches, but it&#8217;s usually only a pain in the story mode when having to do things like grapple the AI out by the steps, and they will repeatedly leave the ring and climb back in. This can make it hard to do what the game requires these objectives to unlock different things from matches. With that being said, for the most part though this game does put up better fights than previous games.The gameplay, while nothing groundbreaking, remains the solid formula of punches, kicks, high jumps, and finishers. What really matters in this game is, once again, the story mode. Last year was the first time for it and it had gamers playing through a retelling of the &#8220;Attitude Era&#8221; of the WWE. This allowed players to experience many of the most memorable matches during one of the most exciting times of the WWE. Now under the banner of 2K, developers have taken that same template used for the industry&#8217;s biggest event, WrestleMania.Titled &#8220;30 Years of WrestleMania,&#8221; this mode covers each of the 29 previous WrestleMania shows over the course of a little more than 45 bouts. There are five eras in this mode, &#8220;Hulkamania Runs Wild,&#8221; &#8220;The New Generation,&#8221; &#8220;The Attitude Era,&#8221; &#8220;Ruthless Aggression&#8221; and finally, &#8220;Universe Era.&#8221; This means that 2K Sports got to add in many old school wrestlers, some that have never been in a game from this franchise before like Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant and Ultimate Warrior. They are, of course, joined by many of the regular wrestlers in WWE today.With the addition of these legends, this roster of wrestlers this year is easily the best the series has ever had. 2K also uses this roster very well in the &#8220;30 Years of WrestleMania.&#8221; You have great classic matches: like Ricky Steamboat vs. Macho Man at WrestleMania III, Ultimate Warrior vs. Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania VI and Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon at WrestleMania X. I do have to say, as an Ultimate Warrior fan, I was upset to not see the career ending match between Ultimate Warrior and Macho Man from WrestleMania VII in the game though.All the matches are recreated incredibly with great attention to detail. This mode is not just about taking part in reliving the matches, but each match also has a set of objectives players must complete to unlock different in game things. It is in these objectives that the glitches I spoke of earlier come into play. The objectives performed are usually specific slate of moves at particular times during a match or positioning an opponent into a particular spot to set up a big moment. The details in these objectives do a good job at tugging at the heart strings and give a nice feeling of nostalgia for most of the matches. One objective type is referred to as &#8220;WrestleMania Moments&#8221; which are QTE&#8217;s used to trigger key moments that actually happened during whichever match you are taking part in. However, a good amount of these do add up to just pushing a button to see the opponent come up behind you and miss hitting you and hitting the referee instead.Unfortunately, as the &#8220;30 years of WrestleMania goes on,&#8221; the matches start to drag a bit, and in the later years there are more and more of the objectives. The problem with the objectives is even though they can take you back as you travel down memory lane, most of the time they add up, and sometimes players don&#8217;t control the situation. As more of these are happening, the matches become more about spectating than participating.Once you get into &#8220;Ruthless Aggression&#8221; era and into the current &#8220;Universe Era&#8221;, the matches become much less memorable and frankly, annoying. It&#8217;s irritating and ultimately exhaustive as the mode gets into more three-way and four-way matches, and harder to pull off historical objectives. It also doesn&#8217;t help some of the later matches end up feeling more repetitive than nostalgic. There was no need to have all three Stone Cold vs. The Rock matches from three different WrestleMania events in here and it didn&#8217;t need both John Cena vs. The Rock matches in it either.Of course it could be said that some of the newer matches haven&#8217;t aged long enough to even build the same reputation as many of the older matches have. Outside of those few faults, the &#8220;30 Years of WrestleMania&#8221; is, by far, the best mode this series has to offer and it will be interesting what they do next year to top it. Maybe they&#8217;ll pull from another long running Pay-Per-View such as Summer Slam and we can relive amazing matches like Hulk Hogan vs. Zeus which took place after the movie No Holds Barred.There is also a side mode, if you will, that is part of the &#8220;30 years of WrestleMania&#8221; called &#8220;The Streak&#8221;. As most fans know The Undertaker is 21-0 at WrestleMania and in this mini-game players can either try their best to take down a super hard version of Undertaker, or play as the deadman and take on wrestlers one after another hanging on as long as possible. There isn&#8217;t really anything deep here, just 2K Sports trying to do something special for WrestleMania by throwing in a little bonus for the one wrestler that is still undefeated at WrestleMania, and it turned out pretty nicely.Once you step outside of WrestlemMania-land, the lack of changes become apparent. There are a few changes to the &#8220;Universe&#8221; mode. You still run week-to-week shows, set up matches and play through the monthly pay-Per-View. The &#8220;King of the Ring&#8221; has been added as an option for a event, which is something that was added after it debuted in the game last year, but this year, they left it out of Universe Mode. There is also a new rivalry system where you can have one-on-one or tag-teams fight it out over a course of time that you set up. Rivalries can be four weeks, eight weeks, or twelve weeks long and can be for championships as well. It is nothing too grand, but does make Universe Mode that much more entertaining.  Players can set up other tournaments as well, including gold rush tournaments for different championship belts, and even user-created belts, which admittedly, come off looking cheap and made of plastic.The creation section is largely untouched and really offers nothing new, except gamers can recreate a handful of existing wrestlers. You can not do this for all wrestlers however; just a few hand picked ones such as John Cena. This option is here assuming you&#8217;ll create different outfits for these wrestlers. I guess if you want John Cena in tights and not &#8220;jorts&#8221; for a change, you can now do that, although it seems quite pointless. Also doing this does not add to the already existing wrestler. You have to use a created wrestler slot for doing this, which, by now, is strange. I am sure in WWE 2K15 that will finally change, even though it is long over due. I remember being able to change anyone&#8217;s attire way back in WrestleMania 2000 on the N64. Also there is still the same old stuff of creating move sets, rings, finishers and so on, but what I have dabbled in is unchanged.WWE 2K14 is by far the best game in the WWE series thanks the great roster of old school wrestlers, and the &#8220;30 Years of WrestleMania.&#8221; It does seem with this game that we might be seeing the start of something more freshly than the same old mindless brawler Yuke&#8217;s has been turning out for the last several years. It would be nice if 2K Sports keeps them putting real effort into the making of this annualized franchise. There is also the fact that new consoles are coming out soon, and hopefully with that we will see something totally new with the next installment in this series. No matter though, this game is a blast and was well worth the wait. Even with the problems there are and the lack of big changes, the next game certainly has big shoes to fill.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2013"}

Washington \"CogsnWheels\"","summary":"Give it a chance- It grows on you","reviewText":"I held off on doing a review on this game because I wasn&#8217;t really sure if I would like it, and I didn&#8217;t want to do like many and give a bad review because I didn&#8217;t understand or get into it deep enough.This game is awesome&#8230; Plain and simple.It&#8217;s not perfect because like many games, when they get so complex and detailed, sometimes the control mechanics can be cumbersome and takes some adapting to use the controls. I have seen where people are saying it&#8217;s a combination of Grand Theft Auto and Assassins Creed.  I can see why this comparison is made, but this game is much BETTER than both for a few reasons. The first reason is that it is not a sequel series.I am a firm believer that game sequels have a tendency to go stale unless they are online multiplayer formats. The whole hacking genre of this game is pretty sick. Like I said, it took a few missions to really get into it, but I am getting addicted to it quickly.The free roam capability that is comparable to GTA is much more advanced. I think the next generation development has allowed the game to literally allow the player to go where they want. The interactive environments are really awesome. You knock trash cans over when you are running through alleys, you can drive through chain link fences when eluding police, etc. That&#8217;s another thing, The police pursuits are exciting! The cops aren&#8217;t as easy to outrun like they are in GTA. The AI is far superior.  You have to rely on the expanding free roam environment and hacking into traffic systems to get away.  Which brings up the issue of controlling vehicles. The vehicle driving mechanics could be better, and I find myself losing perspective when hitting high speed turns because the camera angle puts you in blind spots. When you make vehicles crash behind you, the slow motion camera capture of the crash is cool to watch, but the down side when the perspective returns to you, you can sometimes crash yourself because the view returns you to a bad spot. But I can live with this because the game has so many strengths that outweigh this. My solution is to use the available motorcycles. They are smaller and more nimble and easier to get through traffic . Not to mention, its easier to ride a motorcycle between barriers that you trigger during police pursuits.The hacking puzzles are top notch, and makes the hacking theme seem more realistic. And people need to realize that Watch Dogs is not some boring hacking puzzle game. It is packed with high paced shootouts which are reminiscent of Max Payne on PS3, but with next gen detail. The graphics are amazing. The roads and sidewalks have cracks and stains and the leaves on the trees, the rain drops and the appearance of the roads when they are wet.  You can definitely tell this is a game on a next gen console.This is a game that grows on you the more that you play it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2014"}

{"product_name":"B002I0GZ5Y","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"This will do for now","reviewText":"While original Kingdom Hearts games on PS2 had very childish stories, I loved them because of their unique combat system and fun RPG gameplay. Therefore I had to give Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep (KH:BBS) a shot. I after finishing the story twice with two different characters, here is what I thought.****************PROS.********************THREE PLAYABLE CHARACTERS AND THREE SIDES TO THE STORY: KH:BBS is a unique game in the sense that you have three playable characters in this game. You get to choose which character you want to play as in very beginning of the game. Each character will visit different parts of the given worlds, will grow in a different way and experience a different facet of the main story. Thus, to experience complete story, you will have to finish the story with all three different characters.BATTLE SYSTEM: Like KH1 and 2, the battle system is the strongest aspect of KH:BBS. While this game is on PSP, it is amazing the number of different physical and magical combos you will find yourself pulling off on enemies. Throughout the game you get many different magic and attacks and you can combine these different magic and attacks to create stronger, more stunning and vary unique moves. In addition to attacks, you will also have different finishing moves. As you use different types of attack you will develop different finishing moves and different combos. It is very difficult to explain in words, but once you play, you will have an idea about the depth of battle system in this game. I personally loved it. Furthermore, different characters starts out with different moves so the variety of attacks you will have at your disposal are simply ridiculous.GRAPHICS, ART AND ANIMATION; The game looks as gorgeous as KH on PS2. Just like KH1 and 2, different Disney and Square-Enix characters are aesthetically animated and assuming you watched those cartoons and played square games, you will go through many nostalgic moments. Loved it!OPEN WORLD GAMEPLAY: Throughout the games you will visit different Disney worlds and game at most times gives you freedom to choose which worlds you want to visit. You are also allowed to revisit worlds to collect treasure that you may have missed or were unable to collect on your first visit. This is one of the features I loved in original KH games and am happy they have kept it here.RPG ELEMENT: Just like previous KH games, as you defeat more enemies, your character will level up and his or her strength, magic, health and other stats will increase. Also, as described above, in addition to your character you can also upgrade different magic, attacks, moves and finishing moves. The advantage of this system is say if you are finding a boss or enemies in certain area difficult to finish, then you can always level up and have another shot at them. RPG element is one of the biggest reasons I have been a big fan of KH games.ENEMIES AND BOSSES: Again just like previous games, very nicely designed. Different enemies and bosses will require different strategy to beat them (especially on harder modes). Buttonmashing will only get you so far. I won't spoil much, but I loved the fight where you fight human opponents.MINIGAMES: In addition to main gameplay, you will also find yourself playing couple of minigames, such as racing and dice games. Fortunately most of these are optional so if you like them, play your heart out, if not, not a big necessity. Great way to kill some more time though. Also, your performance in these minigames may help you upgrade your skills in the main gameplay.CO-OP GAMEPLAY: KH:BBS has an arena mode where you can either by yourself or with your friends fight hordes and hordes of enemies, race against each other or play dice game. While not necessary, it is an great addition to this game. I personally loved this mode. More you play, tougher arena modes you unlock (i.e. tougher horde fights etc.)REPLAYABILITY: As stated above, you will be finishing the story at least 3 times to explore all the areas and all the aspects of the story. And at least from what I have played, you won't get tired anytime soon.SECRET ENDING: No spoilers. The game itself tells you that if you want to unlock secret ending, play on harder modes. To unlock it, you will have to collect certain reports. So if you are completionist like me, you will be playing this game for quite a while to unlock this.***************CONS.************************REMOVAL OF SOME FEATURES FROM ORIGINAL KH GAMES: Since this game is may be taking place on PSP, they removed some good things from original KH games. You no longer have any partners. In many ways this makes things easier, but I kind of miss them.*************CONCLUSION*******************I have personally loved this game. Unfortunately, it will take a long while for KH 3 to come out, but meanwhile this is definitely a great game to pass some time and get ready for KH3. I personally loved the gameplay and also the story in this game. Hopefully they connect this game with KH 3. I would give this 9/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00309XHD0","description":"","reviewerName":"Anja Rebekka Schultze","summary":"Isaac Clarke is being chewed on by necromorphs again!","reviewText":"Dead Space 2 is an amazing game. Again you take control over Isaac Clarke the main character from the first game. This time Isaac finds himself in a hospital at a huge space station located at the moon Titan. Again Necromorhps break loose and Isaac have to fight to survive. Now first let me say that for a modern action game this is rather sizable, you will not play through Dead Space 2 in three hours like in some games. I estimate you will get a good 10 hours, perhaps more, out of this which is really good. The story of Dead Space 2 is involving and the game manges to have just the right balance between story and cut scenes and action, so that neither do the game turn into one long shoot fest with just some story elements thrown in to give a reason why the main character is shooting everything in sight, and neither is in ever ending cut scenes so the whole thing is more a movie than a game. Dead Space 2 find the sweet spot between those two extremes.The control in Dead Space 2 is spot on and the game play is fun. However it bear mentioning that hardly anything is new compared to the previous game, this is the same game all over again with a new story. This will delight those that just wanted more Dead Space but might disappoint those who wanted something new. Yes there are a few new weapons but really they work the same way, and the game play is the same, you run around trying to get things to work on the station so that you can get to where you need to be to try to stop the marker and that is about it, over the game you meet other characters who help or hinder you, and most send you running though necromorph infested corridors to fix a computer or open a door or some such task. The game play works wonderfully, but I do miss a bit of variation at times as the game can get a little bit repetitive.One thing I do not like is that in Dead Space 1 there are several breath taking bosses. Boss fights break up the game play a little and they also give you a chance to be amazed by the monster design, there are few bosses in Dead Space 2 and those that are there is not that impressive, they are just slightly larger versions of the necromorphs you usually fight. However this is all knit picking, Dead Space 2 is a good game, I do not agree that it is better than the original, but it is definitely a worthy successor.The Graphics in Dead Space 2 is beautiful, the environments just pop off the screen at you. The sound effects are crisp and clear, the music is good and the voice action is amazing. I have nothing but praise for sound and graphics. Be aware however that this game is gory and if you are a parent wondering if you should allow your child to play this even if they are not old enough, then I would hold off until they get a little older, there is allot of dismemberment, flying body part and the game is both gruesome and bloody. Dead Space 2 is a horror game in the true sense of the word and as such it focuses on creating an uneasy atmosphere and do this very well. Unless you have nerves of steel you will jump from this game.Now as you are sure to know this game is a sequel, so can it be played without playing Dead Space 1 first? I would say no. Yes there is a previously on Dead Space function at the start of the game where you get the key points, but that is more useful for players who have payed the original, but need a bit of a refresher. I would recommend picking up and playing Dead Space 1 first as this game is a direct continuation of the story in the first game and really you will enjoy it more if you are familiar with the fist game I think.Dead Space is a beautiful game, it has it all, a great story, great graphics, great controls, great sound and great atmosphere. The lack of good bosses and that there is nothing new pull the game a little bit down for me, but all in all this is an amazing game and one I will gladly recommend to anyone who like horror games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

I have the 'cube and the xbox, don't have any interest in the PS2 since it doesn't have 5.1 in-game surround sound, and the graphics are mediocre.If you are looking to buy a console, look no further.Pros:1. Small form factor, doesn't take up alot of space, the xbox is HUGE and is fragile.2. Excellent games, yes there are fewer choices, but do you want a bunch of games that suck or a few that are \"off the hook\"?  Try out some of these games -- Resident Evil 4, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Metroid Prime 1 & 2.  No xbox or ps2 game even comes close.  And the new Legend of Zelda is coming out soon!  xbox games that are rated high are rated high for the xbox, games like halo and halo 2 would rate very low on the GameCube because of their low quality.3. Excellent controllers:  The best game machine controller by far, if you've ever played xbox or ps2, you know what I mean.  Cube controllers have different sized buttons and you always know what button you are pushing, try that on the xbox!  But if you really want to step it up, get the Wavebird Wirless, it ROCKS!4. 5.1 Dolby in-game surround sound, 'nuf said.5. Lightning fast load times, some games like RE4 basically have a no-load time.  If you've played xbox or ps2 your green with envy right now...6. Graphics, Graphics, Graphics:  yes these are the best graphics on any system, xbox may have technically better equipment to render graphics, but that's where the hype ends.  Game designers are not designing games to utilize that equipment, maybe its because they are porting those games to ps2 and it just wouldn't be possible if the game used top of the line graphics... I don't know, but the only game that looks as good as RE4 or Metroid Prime on xbox is DOA Ultimate.  One game with good graphics vs. the Cube's excellent graphics on most of the games -- you make the call.7. Portable; yes with gamecube you can carry it to a friends house without having to rent a UHaul trailer to carry it.8. Better color options;  xbox comes in black or green, unless you modify it, but that voids the crappy-to-begin-with warranty (90 days).  ps2 comes in black or that wierd blue-ish color.  GameCube comes in platinum, which matches modern tv's & surround sound systems, black, purple, blue... others? I'm not 100% but I think there are other colors.9. Warranty; Cube: 1 year, xbox: 90 days, ps2: 90 days.  You do the math.  Although the Cube rarely fails, unlike the other consoles.10. Game compatabillity, yes, you wouldn't think of that from the start.  Nintendo's console will play every single game made for it.  xbox and ps2 will not play every game made for them, well that reduces the number of games available for those consoles, doesn't it?  Also it reduces the number of dollars in your pocket, becuase most companies including Wal-mart will not take back software that has been opened, by the time you find out your box will not play the game you are stuck with a $50.00 game you cannot play- that sucks.My xbox is just collecting dust since RE4 came out, I regret having bought it, it was a waste of my hard earned money!

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or fighting the good fight solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesSpecial Controller Included- Designed with input from the Capcom development team, the Wii Classic Controller Pro is included in this bundle.Hunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone. Hunt together with up to 4 players online or take on arena quests with 2-player split-screen action. In single player mode, you even have the ability to hunt with AI-controlled characters named ChaCha.Communicate Online- Because communication is key in coordinated huntsMonster Hunter Trisupports Wii Speak and text chat.Monsters with Unique Abilities and Attacks- Monsters have unique and dynamic personalities, abilities and defenses, increasing in complexity as the player progresses. They camouflage themselves to ambush hunters, but will flee or call for help if outmatched.Immense Living, Breathing World with Ecosystem- Monsters interact amongst each other in a living breathing ecosystem, complete with food chain. Monsters have stamina, migrate and even attack one another, the strong feeding on the weak.New Underwater Maps- For the first time ever in anyMonster Huntergame, you will be able explore land and sea and hunt monsters of the deep.Fully Customizable Equipment- With ten weapon categories &ndash; including the all-new Switch Axe &ndash; and new armor and weaponry created from the remains of slain monsters, there are almost limitless opportunities for equipment customization.Choice of Controls- Play with either the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, with the Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.Take Your Character with You- The ability to save your character to your Wii Remote lets you engage in multiplayer hunts anytime on a friend's console.","reviewerName":"Jason Necros \"Now stimulating N-methyl-D-aspa...","summary":"very solid game","reviewText":"I have no experience with the monster hunter series, so this review is from a fairly non-biased perspective.I have put in about 10 hours so far, and stayed up very late after the game arrived on my doorstep in the early evening.The most striking initial impression I have is the depth of gameplay, mainly the nearly overwhelming amount of items that can be gathered and combined together to make useful trinkets. The environment is detailed and sensible, monsters react to each other, natural resources and to the player in a logical and semi-realistic way.Combat takes some getting use to, and there are no character levels, so essentially besides gear upgrades, the player his or herself virtually 'levels up' by getting better at controlling the character.Unfortunately, the Wii is not HD capable, in fact with my widescreen HD the game actually looks much worse, more grainy, than screen shots taken from non-HD screens.The classic controller is not the highest quality, and ranged attacks in zoomed in mode, basically like a first-person shooter mode, are not as fluid as it would be  with a xbox360 or a ps3 controller.The story is light, so it is not a typical RPG in that sense, but there is so much to do and experience, to include a wealth of quests, so much so that any player will always find some rewarding enterprise to undertake.I certainly recommend this purchase highly, and will likely invest hundreds of hours in the game myself. I have  yet to try online play because I feel like I need to practice in single player first, but I can see how playing with a party can be very rewarding, possibly even necessary.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2010"}

Those who side with good will get to follow Frodo's journey through Middle-Earth, playing in battles inspired by both the books and the movies. Or join evil to find out what may have happened if Frodo had failed to destroy the One Ring, as you fight your way with Sauron back across the map in an attempt to destroy Rivendell, the Shire, and all that is good in the world.You can play as a warrior, scout, mage or archer.View larger.The online multiplayer mode allows for massive battles with up to 16 of your friends.View larger.Building off the model Pandemic used with Star Wars: Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest provides you with a first and/or third person shooter style of game that not only lets you command strategy, but also lets you control the players in the center of the action. Participate in the Battle of Isengard as an Ent or fight Saruman at Orthanc as Gandalf himself. Take on the Nazgul as Aragorn while still protecting Frodo, or battle at Pelennor as a Rohirrim cavalry soldier. And that is just for the good guys!In Conquest you will have to play many different characters in order to win. And it isn't always such a balanced match, as you will find yourself destroying towering siege engines and taking on hulking oliphaunts with your companions. You can choose to play all the heroes you love, or fight as a Nazgul tasked with killing Frodo and stretch your powerful wings as the Balrog himself in your battle for Moria.Pick Your Own Style of PlayIn the game, you'll be able to play as one of four different character classes. Choose the melee-based Warrior or Scout for up-close action, or pick the Archer or Mage to perform devastating ranged attacks. There is also talk of a 'special' class called the Guardian to give gamers a third choice. But don't worry about getting locked in, as you can actually change which character class you're playing on the fly, in the middle of the game's various objective-based missions.Each class of characters has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique special abilities. Playable units range from grunt soldiers, which are the weakest, to captains, which are the strongest AI units in the game other than the heroes. You also get to order in air strikes using either eagles or fellbeasts. Even better, players will be able to mount the occasional horse, unless they've chosen evil, in which case they will have to master the skill of riding a fearsome warg.Multiple Modes for Endless FunAs in Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest has enormous competitive multiplayer modes, including Conquest, Capture the Flag, and Hero Deathmatch. In addition to these classics, Conquest adds a Ring Bearer mode, in which one player tries to stay alive as Frodo against a host of ringwraiths, and Stronghold in which you fight on various maps in a Risk-style battle for territories. Fortunately, you won't be limited to roaming around with only your teammates, however, as battles occur in large scale with non-player combatants joining in the fray.Conquest allows online play with up to 16 players for massive battles with all your friends, or in two-player cooperative mode. Players can also play locally with up to four players competitively, or two-player co-op on a split screen. When in the game itself, fans will get the thrill of hearing Howard Shore's score for the films accompanying the action, and both good and evil campaigns are narrated by Hugo Weaving, who played Elrond in the movies.You can choose to play either good or evil, each with different endings.","reviewerName":"Joey Joe Joe Jr S. \"high flyer\"","summary":"Review: LOTR Conquest","reviewText":"Lord of the Rings Conquest is a mediocre Dynasty Warriors rip off set in the LOTR universe.  The classes of characters (Warrior, Archer, Scout, & Mage) are unbalanced, bland and frankly boring to play. The graphics in this game look slightly better than ps2. When you actually do win it is more a result of luck than skill as the combo chains are sloppy and not designed with precision targeting in mind. Few of the combo chains finalize in an attack that \"sweeps\" aside a large number of foes which is essential in this kind of game. Also the final attacks in most combo chains are lengthy in their animation time and even when you hit your target you usually end up getting hit by another enemy. You also get \"juggled\" often by enemies and will find yourself going from full life to death by a medium difficulty foe. Granted the character models/soundtrack/atmosphere do evoke the atmosphere of the films, though the game play is far to one dimensional and poorly executed compared to the genre from which it plagiarizes (Dynasty Warriors). If you are a die hard LOTR fan, or enjoy the Dynasty Warriors titles you may be somewhat satisfied with this game.

{"product_name":"B00009WAUO","description":"Players can add cool new features with the Card e-Reader or link up with friends for multiplayer adventures with the original Mario Bros. game.","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"A great port of Mario 3, and then some.","reviewText":"Do I even need to give this game an introduction? When Super Mario Bros. 3 came out, it blew everyone away. The first two Mario games were great, but Mario 3 did everything those games did, and took it to another level. World maps, bonus stages, hidden areas, the ability to fly(!), and much more. I remember being a little kid when it came out and wondering how any game could top it. All these years later, I got this GBA version for my daughter, who's already into the Mario games at just 3 years old. What's funny is that, eventhough I got to replay the game on the SNES with Super Mario All-Stars, and  played it until I sold my SNES a few years ago, playing this version really took me back to the good ol' days of the early 90s. I won't be biased in this review- I try to be fair on everything, and point out flaws when they're there. But really, Super Mario Bros. 3 barely has anything wrong with it, and this GBA port just might be the best iteration of the game so far.Basic Mario premise- you play as Mario (or Luigi) and save the princess from Bowser, traveling through a wide range of worlds in the process. You'll run, jump, fireball and tail smack your way through the stages while collecting coins and taking out the bad guys. Located on the world map are mushroom houses that let you take a quick break from the action and get a random power up. Where the first Super Mario Bros. only had the mushroom, fire flower and star, you get much more here. Those original 3 are back, as well as a leaf that gives you raccoon ears and a tail (allowing you to fly and smack enemies with a spin attack), a tanuki suit (a souped up raccoon costume that also lets you turn into a statue for a few seconds, giving you invincibility), a frog suit to maneuver in the water easier, and a Hammer Bros. costume, which protects you from fireballs (on your back) and lets you throw hammers that take out damn-near any enemy. And yet, there's more. One level gives you a giant green boot to hop around in, and you can also get cool power ups for the map, like a hammer that can take out rocks that block shortcuts, and a cloud that lets you skip a level. You can store a lot of these in a menu on the map screen, and select which one you want to use going into a level or right then and there if it's the cloud/hammer.Fortunately, after 20 years since the original version, I can enjoy Super Mario Bros. 3. I was surprised by the number of times I'd die in certain stages, thinking that everything would be a piece of cake since I played it so many times over the years. Nope! I felt like a kid again when a couple of quick enemies would be coming right for me, while I panicked looking for a power up so I wouldn't die with one hit. And trying to remember how to get the special flying ship levels without looking it up online was a fun challenge. Trust me when I say that I'm not a Nintendo fanboy (far from it), but I can't think of anyone who's hated this game. It's a fun platformer for everyone, and tons of people still try to set world records for speed runs and maxing out the score. Did Nintendo create a timeless classic with this? I think so.But what about the GBA additions? Well, it's not as bad as the additions to the Super Mario World port, but I still could've done without them. The graphics are enhanced a little bit from the Super Mario All-Stars version. I noticed some new background effects here and there. There are also some added in sound effects, like one when Mario slides down a hill. These are cool, but my problem lies with the added voices. Yep, Mario now says things like \"Lucky!\" and \"oh-ah no!\". Thanks a lot Nintendo. Then there's the change they made to Luigi once again. Yeah, he does his weird jump, and lands faster than Mario for some reason. Somehow, Nintendo didn't make the jump as good as it was in Mario Bros. 2, so playing as him is more of a challenge than anything this time. But I can't give them too much of a hard time since the music and sound effects sound perfect. No fuzziness like Super Mario World got- everything here sounds perfectly clear. They also included the original Mario Bros. arcade game, yet again, making this the 4th time it's appeared on the GBA.What are you waiting for? Anyone who wants to play a classic should pick this up immediately. And if you were disappointed with New Super Mario Bros. for the DS, go on and relive the days when you didn't get 5 1-ups in a level for barely doing anything. This is old school platforming at its finest.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"Joshua Eyre \"LinePlaneVolume\"","summary":"The tides have turned","reviewText":"I actually held back on writing anything about Battlefield 3 until I had some more time with it. While Modern Warfare 3 forced me, out of frustration, to feel the need to set it aside, so far since the first few days it was out, and immediately set my disappointment down in words, I just soaked up Battlefield 3. It's not like Modern Warfare 3 and, for some people, that appears to make it not worth any real examination.Why? Well, Battlefield 3 is not obvious. You aren't locked into a tiny map, particularly looking at Modern Warfare 3 in this case, that's basically a tarted up paintball arena, where you are expected to stack up lag amplified no scope kills 'til your \"team\" gets to 50. That's pretty straight-forward... a \"no-brainer\" as they say in creatively bankrupt boardroom meetings the country over. Now, while it used to be lots of fun to do that, the maps in Modern Warfare 3 have certain, ummmmmm, design competency issues when compared to Call of Duty 4 and Modern Warfare 2. To put it plainly, the maps suck. So, if the maps suck, and it's no longer fun to rinse and repeat Activision style, what do you do?I didn't start out with Dice's games until Battlefield: Bad Company. While the single player campaign was enjoyable enough, the multiplayer was a bit overwhelming for me at the time. The maps were pretty big and it was total chaos. There were vehicles blowing stuff up all over the place and it was hard to get your bearings. At that time I was probably playing Call of Duty 4, quite a bit, and didn't really care to deal with the learning curve of Bad Company's multiplayer.Then, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 came out and I enjoyed the single player campaign even more. While it was lacking the grandeur of Modern Warfare 2, it had a more intimate feel... You and a group of guys, against everybody, so that really warmed me more to the game. The mechanics felt a little better than before, and I was ready to extend the experience. At this point I really dipped my toe in the multiplayer waters. I probably played Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer more, but not by much. I was starting to get annoyed with some of the consistent lag deaths, where you are a good deal under cover, but still die, seeing you hanging out in the open in the opponent's kill-cam. But, the maps were good, and I still had fun. Now, with Bad Company 2 multiplayer, I started to get the difference. Team Deathmatch wasn't the strength of Bad Company 2. It was the objective based games that felt good. Rush seemed to be the focus, where you sequentially attack or defend stations. It takes a lot of coordination and can be tough to not get frustrated when you're just getting started and figuring out the way you can best play it. But, the Conquest game, where you try to take, and hold, different points on the map, felt like the sweet spot to me. It was easier to ease into the play-style, and still make a noticable impact. Now, I got it. This was a really great multiplayer experience.So, what exactly is great about it? I'll explain as it pertains to Battlefield 3. In Dice's style of console multiplayer, you are placed in a squad of up to 4, on a team of 12. You have 4 distinct classes that impact the game in different ways. Each one has their place and may appeal to different types of players. The Assault Class gives players the ability to heal and revive other players (armed with assault rifles). The Engineer Class gives players the ability to effectively attack armor & aircraft, with rockets & mines, and a repair tool to fix damaged equipment (armed with carbines - theoretically meant for close to mid range combat). The Support Class gives players heavy weapons, the ability to resupply ammo, and plantable explosives (armed with light machine guns). Finally, the Recon Class offers sniper rifles, spotting equipment, and deployable spawn points. Each class' specialties contribute to the success of the squad and greater team. Where Modern Warfare is more focused on individual kill-counts, at least in the mode most people play, Battlefield is focused on the objective, and doing what it takes to hold them the longest. You always get points for kills, but you also get points for healing, reviving, resupplying, repairing, spotting, destroying, disabling, capturing, and defending. There are a lot of different ways to be successful at this game. The points are what really shows your effectiveness. In addition, the players may also commandeer tanks, jets, helicoptes, troop transports, and various types of jeeps and buggies.All of this adds up to a big experience. The maps are large. The approaches are varied. The scale feels epic. Anything can happen in Battlefield 3. It's not just a variation of gun/grenade/knife kills, it's...> Jumping from a roof and dropping a tank busting charge of C4 on the back of a Russian T-90.> Bailing out of your flaming jet to land on an occupied capture point to retake it for your team.> Shooting down a helicopter packed with an opposing team with an unguided RPG.> Luring a tank onto 2 carefully placed land mines.> Sneaking up behind a camping sniper who is griefing your team, several hundred yards into the outer edge of a map.> Collapsing a building onto several players from the other team, crushing them in the wreckage.The list goes on and on. This is what makes Battlefield so much fun... the pure variety. It always feels different, and \"wow\" moments happen all the time, and you'll think back, often, to cool things that happened in the recent games you played.To top it all off, the sound is remarkable. It's so intense to hear a jet streak by overhead, and the \"braaaaap\" of the chain gun as it strafes the roadway, or the sound of an RPG as it whistles inches past your head. It's really a huge addition to the immersion that Battlefield provides.Now, there are problems, and addressing them will make the game even better. My biggest problem is with the range of certain weapons and how you'll find players using shotguns and sub machine guns, all short range weapons, very effectively from long range. I don't think it's very realistic when you get outgunned by a shotgun, when you have an assault rifle and nearly a football field of spread between the two of you. I've also seen people with sniper rifles get outgunned by light machine guns, from long distance. Spawn killing can also be a problem, but it's still not as bad as Modern Warfare 3. In the end, by just being a little careful, these problems can be addressed in-game, by taking advantage of the large maps and the many ways to traverse them, but the developers can fix them pretty easily with an update. Oh, yeah. The building destructability isn't as good when compared to Bad Company 2, but it appears the first expansion pack will better feature it.In the end, Battlefield may not be for everyone, because it takes effort to get the most out of it. The player needs to engage with the map, the strategy, the teamwork, and the depth. Modern Warfare 3 is about as obvious as you can get, which worked when the maps were good, and the mechanics/rules of the game weren't totally frustrating, but it doesn't fly this time around. Try out Battlefield. Give it a real chance, and see the multitude of different experiences you can have on most of the maps. It's not perfect, but it feels a lot more fresh than the alternative this time around.Other aspects: Honestly, I've barely touched the single player game, and haven't opened up co-op at all. The single player didn't really compell me, at this point, to keep playing. It doesn't have the same character, or unique feeling, that the Bad Company games have, but it's such a minor element when compared to the multiplayer, where I've already spent way more time than I care to admit. EDIT: After finally finishing the single player campaing, I can make some more comments on it. The campaign has some great visuals, seeming to try to compete with the bombastic set-pieces in Modern Warfare, but I feel more and more like they're completely wasted. The developers design these beautiful levels, with great environments, that the player just rushes through for a few minutes, and that's it... you never see them again. It would be different if the campaign was so compelling that you wanted to experience it multiple times, but the story is so convoluted, particularly with the manner in which the hero catches up with the big-bad in New York, that one and done is all it's worth, save for the possible achievement poaching. Again, the visual effort seems sorely wasted. It should have all been dumped into extra multiplayer maps at this point. Now, if they had a story nearly as fun, and somewhat coherent, like in Bad Company 2, I would say bring the single player on. But, Battlefield 3 should have just let it go with this beautiful, but ultimately empty, shell of a campaign.Overall, I'd give Battlefield 3, combining the good and the bad, where the fun of the multiplayer becomes a driving factor in the score, a 9 out of 10. But, I'm basically ignoring the single player element to arrive at this score because the multiplayer has so much bang for the buck.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2011"}

You are the leader and can direct the teams as a whole to positions. You can't direct them individually. The game play while realistic also on many instances unrealistic and borders on the game using unfair advantages against the player.

{"product_name":"B003O6E6NE","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Bioshock Infinite Review:  Heads for the clouds, soars over the moon","reviewText":"NOTE 1:  This is a review in progress.  I got the game during the midnight release and have been playing through the campaign.  More thoughts will be added as I finish the game.NOTE 2:  I AM NOT an employee of 2K or Irrational Games.  All the writing you see are my opinions alone; see my other video game reviews (both positive and critical) if you need proof.The first thing that's going to strike you about Bioshock Infinite is the setting of Columbia.  No longer are you stuck underwater and going through tight corridors as in Bioshock 1 and 2.  The openess of being on will be unlike anything you've experienced in an FPS before.  Many games try to give you the feeling their setting is alive (Skyrim immediately comes to mind), but few immerse you with real life issues (racism, etc.) as B.I. does.  You'll literally stop and listen to the various conversations, that is when you're not getting shot or melee attacked!I don't want to give too much away, as I don't want to spoil the game for you.  Needless to say, some of the language is going to shock and awe you, so there's a reason the big \"M\" is on the front of the cover.  Definitely either have the kiddos away in bed or have a headset on.The next thing is your trusty sky-hook.  No longer are battles confined.  Now, you can literally leap on the multitude of railings, slide down, see an enemy and drop on them to attack.  The freedom this opens up to approach different situations is a liberation.  Yes, some of the game is \"on rails\" and you won't have this opportunity through the entire game.  But there are always going to be limitations with software, hardware etc. that restricts visions.Those familiar with Bioshock and Bioshock 2 know you carry a power in your left hand (called \"vigors\" in this game, previous veterans of Bioshock recognize these as \"Plasmids\") and a weapon in the right.  B.I. doesn't mess with this formula but DOES change your customization where it is much, much deeper.You will also find various Gear lying around, of which you can equip a certain amount (4 to start).  These effects vary as well, from giving your Skyhook melee a shock charge to increased damage against certain enemy types.When you add in the random things that Elizabeth brings into the fray later in the story (called \"tears\"), the combinations are staggering and offers replay just to see how insane a setup you can create.  For example, you could have Murder of Crows equipped, initiate it, switch to Devil's Ball, which will catch your crows on fire, which will catch your enemies on fire, and Elizabeth warps in a machine gun turret which finishes the job.  It's honestly something hard to put into words.  You simply have to experience it for yourself.Sadly, the weapons are pretty standard-fair for this kind of game (shotguns, machine guns, etc).  You could put a 1910 coat of paint on pretty much any COD gun and you have a B.I. gun.  Seems like a lost opportunity here.  The standard \"spend this to upgrade that\" is present in the game.  You will find locked chests which will make you hunt for keys.  However, what you find in these chests (infusions, which let you upgrade your shield, health or salt, respectfully, ala Skyrim) as well as Gear, etc. are WELL worth your time to seek and find the keys.But what's a great action game without a story?  The basic gist is you are Booker DeWitt, here in Columbia to rescue Elizabeth.  Who just may be the most full-fleshed out AI character to date.  Through her communication, both verbal and non, you feel an engagement with her that you haven't felt in other games.  You actually CARE what becomes of her.  And that leads you to got he** bent on doing anything and everything to leave with her intact.  Again, I'm trying to keep this a spoiler-free review, but there are so many twists and turns in this story that by the time you hit 10 hours through the game you'll be like \"what the heck just happened???\"  In a GOOD way.Enemy AI is very smart, and just jumping on one of those sky-hooks isn't always enough to escape getting pummelled.  They take cover and, especially at a point in the middle of the game, will make you bring all your skills and items to bear or else you will find yourself dying.  Repeatedly.Regardless of what you might have felt for Bioshock 1 or 2, or if you have never played a Bioshock game, the setting, gameplay and sheer scope of Bioshock Infinite are well worth the price of admission.  When history looks back on the PS3, this will become one of the defining games of this console generation and simply should not and cannot be missed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0071NH8B8","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Engel","summary":"Extremely misleading \"bundle\", but excellent system so far","reviewText":"As others have stated, this \"bundle\" forces you to pay *extra* just to access the bonus content it promises. You get the $15 PSN card and an *extra* AT&T; pass...all with the purchase of an AT&T; Pass data plan. You don't actually get a free AT&T; Pass with the bundle, you get one extra in addition to the purchase of one. There is no way around this, meaning that if you want those things, at least $20 is necessary for the absolute cheapest plan available. Further, the bonuses aren't accepted until *30 days* have passed upon redeeming it. Nothing else needs to be said about that.What you're really getting is the Wi-Fi/3G model with an 8 gig card, with \"bonuses\" that are not bonuses at all, but require you to sink extra money in just to access. That's just unacceptable, and if I had known this, I would have stuck with my original plan of just getting the Wi-Fi and an 8 gig card and saved myself $20.As for the system itself, I have to say it's so far been very impressive. The graphics power, especially for first generation games, is phenomenal, and the touch screen works better than expected. I could have totally done without gyroscopic sensitivity and a rear touchpad, though. These seem like things that were just never necessary and so far have no real practical purpose. Sure, they do things in games, but it's nothing you can't do with the controller itself with more accuracy. It'll take some time to see if these features are worth it at all, but right now they just seem kind of meaningless. Do we really need gyroscopic sensitivity on a handheld system? I personally don't think so, not until they're more than ridiculous tacked-on ideas to throw into games just to muck up the action.The overall feel of the system is especially nice for an initial launch version. It's surprisingly slim, the buttons feel right, and it just feels good to hold and use. I would have preferred a switch to turn on Flight Mode instead of being forced to go into settings to activate or deactivate it, like the original PSP has. This switch, being a major battery saver, is sort of important when you want to turn it on, then off, and then on again, but this forces you to \"minimize\" the game and go into settings to turn it on or off. Luckily, the option isn't buried, so you can do it fairly quickly with one switch in the settings menu, which can be easily made into a shortcut on the desktop interface.I can live with the new Vita-only memory cards in lieu of standard M2 cards the PSP used, as that system caused rampant piracy of PSP games that were extremely easily hacked and turned into ISO files to distribute and use for free. The PSP was murdered by the incredible ease of pirating software and games and custom firmware due to the M2 cards and lack of cracking security in the official firmwares. So it's understandable that the cards are now Vita-specific, and are luckily not too unreasonable in price. $30 for 8 gigs isn't bad and gets the job done, but it's not quite the $20 I paid for a bulk-packaged 16 gig M2 card for my PSP Slim.Following the trend of virtually every handheld system, the brightness on the system screen is somewhat lacking, even at max. The original DS and PSP both had this problem, too. While the Vita definitely is far less noticeable than the original DS or PSP, it still isn't quite as bright as I'd like at its maximum setting. But considering that this thing eats its battery alive already, you probably won't even be playing on max brightness now, anyway.The cross-compatibility many games have with the PS3 and PSP with the Vita is a very nice touch. You can instantly upload or download your save file, for instance, in BlazBlue: Continuum Shift EXTEND. One press of either and you start right where you left off, no matter which system you're accessing the file on. Downloaded PSP games are playable on the Vita, but obviously, discs aren't, which is very unfortunate, but of course understandable. If you've still got PSP games to play, don't sell the system quite yet. But Sony is offering a mutual relationship with us to allow downloaded PSP games to play on the Vita; Sony gets to keep those on their Store, and we get access to them as downloads. We can't ask for more, really.So, here's the bottom line: The bundle is crap, and extremely misleading, but the system itself is certainly competent for an initial launch, far more impressive than the disaster of a system and launch games the 3DS brought us. The 3DS remains a highly questionable system with its less-than-ideal 3D system and lack of graphics power or innovation, and still seems like little more than a somewhat more powerful DS Lite with 3D thrown in. The Vita manages to avoid any major pitfalls that many were concerned about, and the battery life, assuming you don't keep everything on all at once at full blast, lasts long enough to be tolerable. The OLED screen definitely helps in this regard, requiring far less power than a standard LCD screen to display a picture. Everything seems to work pretty well, and I have no major complaints. The potential is definitely here, and if the now-purposeless gyroscopic sensitivity and rear touchscreen are used well in the future, this system might be something really special. For the moment, it's still a great system, and worth it for those who are interested in it.Just know that the \"bundle\" is not a bundle at all, and take the system for what it is, and you should be content. But avoid this bundle, because what seems like an ideal buying solution (everyone's going to spend at least $280 for the Wi-Fi and memory card, anyway, so what's another $20 for this much more stuff you're supposed to get?) is actually not even a bundle until you pay extra. There is no free Pass, and no free PSN card at all until you pay for one in the first place, which isn't chump change.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2012"}

The ship battles in Star Trek were always meant to mimic those of naval warfare (nowhere better illustrated that the submarine-inspired battle in 'The Wrath of Khan') and when you take that in consideration, that's when you can give your twitchy trigger finger a rest and get into the meat of the battle system...strategy. Controlling your 'fleet' of four ships has a bit of a learning curve, but once you get it down, meeting objectives and crushing the opposition can be quite gratifying.There are some not so great points, such as the slightly underwhelming production values (come one, this is Star Trek...too many resources at your disposal to come up lacking) and that the captains sound like they're half asleep during their voice overs (except for Archer, who sounds amped up). Seriously though, aside from the learning curve and the decision to make a hulking starship control like a hulking starship (which to me isn't a bad thing), you'll find plenty to like about Legacy if you're a Trek fan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2007"}

There are no lags with the response time when I push the buttons, and it's very responsive in general.My only gripe is it's wired.  Xbox controllers are all wireless, so the idea that a flashy replica is wired lowers the value a bit.  The cord is 10 feet long which is a good length, but I have a 60-inch tv and sit about 12 feet away, so make sure this cord length will suit your needs.

GAME. EVER. MADE. PERIOD. Repeat Ad Nausem.","reviewText":"Think I'm joking?  Maybe this is all hype, and I'm just talking trash?  Consider this: as we speak, more people are playing Counter-Strike on the Internet than all other 3D action games COMBINED. That includes Quake 3, Unreal Tournament, and Tribes.  And it's been that way for months and months. The amazing thing is that Counter-Strike(CS) started out as just another free mod on the Web, created mostly by 1 person.  CS is a grass-roots kinda movement, and it reached its popularity by word-of-mouth, and by simply being fun and addictive.So if this is a free game, over a year old, than what exactly are you paying for? The original Half-Life is universally called the most entertaining and important game of the past 3 years.  It was also made in such a way that anyone could add their own rules and artwork to it, and basically change the entire game.  Thus, hundreds of &quot;mods&quot; (modifications) popped up, available for free on the Web.  HL: Counter-Strike gives you access to these free mods without paying extra for the single-player parts.  The best ones are included on the CD so you don't have to download them, including Team Fortress Classic, OpFor Deathmatch, and the insanely popular Counter-Strike.  It's like getting 5 games in one.  Also, if you play with a regular 56.6 modem, this game has a special network system that evens the odds against DSL and Cable modem users.Of the 4 or 5 games included, Counter-Strike is on the cover for a reason - it is so unbelievably fun and addicting, it's almost like Tetris for 3D shooters.  CS is very similiar to Rainbow Six, a Terrorist vs. Counter-Terrorist game, only CS never lets realism get in the way of fun (many people switch from R6 and never go back!). The matches are fast and exciting, and unlike other team-based games, CS makes working with total strangers necessary and obvious. You are REWARDED for working together, and quickly punished if you try to jump out by yourself.  The maps take place in airports, mansions, Las Vegas, the Middle-east, warehouses - just about everywhere - and they are amazingly strategic and complex.  What's more, CS has different types of matchs, like hostage rescue or assasination or bomb defusion, which change the entire pace of each match.Buy this NOW.

I wanted to be sure my feelings about it were accurate and fair since, at first, I wasn't *massively* impressed with it. That's not to say it's not a stunning racing sim, but it's also not the huge leap in graphics/physics I was expecting due mainly to the MS hype machine.Now I'm a big racing/driving game fan. I've got all the essential Xbox racers, from PGR2 to Rallisport C2; from arcade type racers to true sims such as Forza. And I have to say I find the arcade side of the racing genre to simply be more fun. I therefore chopped a star off the 'fun rating' - not fair perhaps but accurate.You probably already know about Forza - it's MS' attempt to de-throne GT3/4 as the ultimate racer. In a nutshell, if you're into racing sims MS would like you to drop the PS2 and buy an XBox. I therefore see lots of comparisons and the usual Forza vs GT4 debates. Personally, I don't know which is best as I haven't played GT since GT1 and have no intention of playing a 'sim' that has no crash damage. Which brings me to my first major complaint with Forza - the damage engine. It's not up to par... Sure the car models change as damage is incurred and the car will handle differently as it deteriorates but really it feels like an add-on. It's not the spectacular damage physics of Rallisport Challenge 2 and that's a shame. For a game with so much simulation the crashes feel like little more than decals stuck to the car. If you run into a wall at 220mph there would be little left of your vehicle but with Forza you might end up with some paint damage and a loose bumper. Objects that fall off your vehicle (few as there is) also don't affect other racers. Shame.My other major complaint is the sound. It's weak and whilst the engine noises may be accurate they're too quiet. A revving 350bhp vehicle should be rattling things off the wall, but the bass is diluted and sounds from the other cars only kick in when they're on your tail.I would also like to have seen different weather conditions and the ability to choose them.Now don't get me wrong Forza is THE racing sim to own. But my points aren't there for the sake of nit-picking. These things really bothered me and reduced my enjoyment.All in all Forza is amazing. The frame rate is soooo good and knocks PGR2's ~20 fps into a cocked hat. New York has NEVER looked so good in a game and every bump, corner and blade of grass has been recreated to perfection. I therefore have no hesitation in recommending Forza, despite my negative notes above. It's probably the last true race-sim for the XBox to come out before the 360 is released and it IS the best.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2005"}

Hayes","summary":"A Difficult Game: Though Solid for RPG Fans","reviewText":"Eternal Sonata was essentially an Xbox 360 exclusive that was ported to the PS3 a year and a half later.  The PS3 version features two additional characters, additional cutscenes that help explain the story better, and a bonus end game dungeon. Essentially with these additions it is the superior version to get.It is an innovative Japanese RPG type game with a modified turn-based battle system. Essentially during a players turn they can \"button mash\" to do whatever attacks they have mapped to their four PS3 buttons and also roam freely across the screen.  The player is only restricted by a timer that depletes once the turn starts. As the player advances in the game additional changes are made to the battle system.  The biggest selling point of the game is the evolving battle system for it really has not been seen in any other RPG.  Another major point is the beautiful story and narrative about the late renessaince composer Frederic Chopin who died of sickness in real life.  The game follows his tale through real events and musical compositions, and the player basically plays through a story that takes place in his mind while he lays unconscious. The in game story follows the tale of several characters as they try to overthrow the government intent on making its citizens slave soldiers to take over other kingdoms. Most events are carried out through voice cutscenes rendered with the in game engine (that means no fancy FMV cutscenes, however, because the games graphics already look amazing, the cutscenes do too).  There is also TONS of voicework, though it gets repetitive in battle when the player does \"Sacred Signature\" to heal their characters up to three times each turn during each \"lenghty\" boss fight.  Where the game falls apart are the bossfights. It is pretty much guaranteed that when a player stumbles upon the boss for the first time that they will lose in the first two or three turns.  Only the most gifted person will probably manage to beat this game.  The boss fights are lenghty and excessively difficult.  Oftentimes one will find that they need to level grind (attack numerous weaker enemies until they believe they themselves are strong enough to face the boss) to overcome the boss, and then the boss fight is dependent on if you can manage to heal and defend all on time.In the end this is a pretty solid game though a bit too difficult.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2009"}

Most levels are timed and require the player to roll up as many items as possible.  This creates some fast paced action as you scramble to get as many items as possible.The premise sounds a little odd, but it's addicting.  I first played the original on my friend's PS2 and ended up buying a PS2 solely to play original and its sequel.Katamari Forever is extremely similar to the original two games for the PS2.  In fact, it features many of the same levels with just a couple of small twists (such as a small heart that you roll up and then sucks in surrounding objects).  The game now keeps track of the items you roll up and you can see how many of each item in each category you have rolled up - such as people, food, sports items, etc.  The lists are detailed and funny.  I find myself obsessing over getting each and every item in the game.Katamari Forever is a retread of the original two games.  It doesn't actually contain many new levels.  That being the case, I only recommend this game to people who have either never played the original games or absolutely adored the first games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2010"}

It's like Stratego on Steroids had a child with Final Fantasy.  The end result is a game that, while probably not for every gamer out there, is worth a look by everyone.  You'll hear me talk alot about the strategy of the game.........simply because that is the path I took with it.  Other's may prefer a different way to play.  This is part of the games beauty and ingenuity.  Different players can make the game what they ultimately want.The graphics are not going to break the mold, but that wasn't the developers goal.  For what was intended, SEGA hit the nail on the head.....which is to say a beautifully hand drawn game.The gameplay is where it REALLY stands out.  As an avid player of Civilization on PC and a huge fan of tactics and strategy, this game gets all my cylinders pumping.  I love being able to plan out the battlefield, setting up ambushes, making the best use of the tools at my disposal, and ultimately destroying my enemy.  Check, check, and check.  For the people out there who tend to skip tutorials, you may want to run through this game's, as the idea behind the gameplay takes a second or two to sink in and you don't want to let it sink in on the battlefield.  Controls don't even come in to play really.  They are simple and to the point.......the real challenge comes not from quick button presses, but a carefully planned out mode of attack.  Sure, it's fun to wipe out all in your way............but sometimes discretion is the better part of valor, and a surgically cut path through the ranks can be just as effective, if not moreso.  And truthfully, if the game stopped there, it would be great, but adding in the RPG feature of leveling up, special traits, upgrading......  and I am in gaming euphoria.Ultimately, this game is going to appeal to some and not to others, as is the case with any form of media whether it be movie, music, or video game.  If you like chess.  If you like Stratego.  If you like Civilization.  If you like Final Fantasy, Legend of Dragoon (to this day one of the most underappreciated RPGs), or RPGs as a whole.  Or if you never played any of these but enjoy the challenge of a well thought out, strategic game.  This NEEDS to be on your shelf.  As for myself, I need to stop writing this review so I get back to it.  I can only hope to see a franchise rise from this title, or at least several others along this style of gameplay.  Try it with an open mind and I can guarantee you.......you'll be singing its praises, too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2008"}

For God's sake, Nintendo, why can't you just give people the option of turning voices off?!!!!!The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is releatively simple so you don't have to learn a lot of button combinations, there is a great selection of characters with lots of unlockables, you can earn trophies of past and present Nintendo characters, and the mini-games ... well ... the mini-games kinda suck.

Super Smash Brothers Melee is definitely one of these. It's fun for the whole family!In essence, the game is the same as the Nintendo 64 game Super Smash Brothers. This game was brilliant - for the first time you could see all of your N64 characters - Zelda, Link, Pikachu, Kirby, etc. - in one game, interacting with each other. There were random powerups from all of the games, and the levels and soundtracks were perfect. It was really amazing to see Yoshi up against Zelda in a StarFox background with the music.Super Smash Brothers Melee upgrades the game for the GameCube, adding new characters, new modes, new graphics and sound. Once again you have a variety of ways to play. You can do an &quot;adventure mode&quot; which really just means you play through a series of levels to an &quot;ending boss battle&quot; to win. There are many player-vs-player battles too, with up to 3 opponents.It's not a full fledged fighting game. There aren't multitudes of move combinations to work out. But it IS great fun anyway! The moves they do are all imaginative and fun. The powerups you find are also quite inventive. There are trophies and special characters and levels to earn as you play more and more, giving you incentive to keep playing. You gotta unlock them all!It's not really a thinking game. There aren't any great puzzles to figure out, no characters to develop, no long quests to go on. But many times, you don't want that in a game. Like Tetris and Bejewelled, you just want to kick back, relax, and have some mindless fun.

{"product_name":"B0050SXGU8","description":"","reviewerName":"546598","summary":"com bat","reviewText":"First off, I want to issue a bit of a warning come in here for you folks interested in single player. Crysis 3 is short. Much shorter than Crysis 2 and the first game. However, as I write this review, having payed the full amount of cash, I usually don't say this, but here goes: I'm glad I payed the crazy amount of money for Crysis 3. Crysis 3 has made this Crysis fan THIS happy. There is tons of replay value in its excellent, open-ended game play, and the set pieces I found are so outstanding that I can see myself playing through them more than once. I'm more than ready to do so myself. So I'm not at all worried about the short campaign; its sheer re-playable quality over forgettable quantity! Take my word for it, Crysis fans.In a world where generic, cookie cutter titles clutter the FPS genre, the Crysis series has always been a kick-ass counterpoint to all of the aforementioned clutter. The original Crysis is the second best FPS I've ever played (Half-Life 2 is No. 1), and the series overall is one of the best I've ever played. FPS junkies everywhere rejoice upon playing Crysis, and there's a darn good reason for it. Now, the series is back with Crysis 3, and it's as as predictably awesome as you expect. Amazing visuals, smart gun play, fantastic production values...you know the score. This is an excellent FPS, and its a wonderful continuation of the FPS genre's winning streak with 2012's brilliant Far Cry 3.We all know the Crysis series is known for its eyeball melting visuals, and Crysis 3 is no different from previous games in the series. Let me just say that Crysis 3 looks absolutely gorgeous, and its a technical marvel to behold. What's even more amazing this time around is the art direction. Everything here just looks so inspired, telling; you feel you are truly in the jungle, and each level has a brilliant aesthetic that with each of the seven natural wonders. Oh, and as usual, sound is absolutely amazing. Explosions are devastating, gunfire sounds absolutely relentless, the Seth sound downright vicious, and the Nano-suit sound effects are empowering. The Crysis series has one of the most visceral use of sound in gaming, and Crysis 3 assaults you like it's no tomorrow. It's oh so worth it. Get your home theater/amazing computer speakers/high quality headphones ready and crank it straight to the top!Regarding Crysis 3's story, the focused story-telling in the form of scripted sequences doesn't mean much if the content of the story doesn't match up. Fortunately, Crysis 3 has a well told and exciting story that recalls a well done summer blockbuster. This time, Prophet from Crysis returns after a twenty year period to New York City. The city has been taken over by Cell Corporation and converted NYC into a large Eco-dome in order to use the city as a land and technology grab. Through manipulation and whitewashing, Cell Corporation has successfully put into practice their plans of world domination, and hereby looms the end of the world as well. Meanwhile, protagonist must deal with the impending threat and fight his own struggles as a nano-soldier. Fans who followed the tales of their favorite nano-suit soldiers from the beginning will be satisfied by the story. As a fan of the series, I count myself amongst the satisfied. Yeah, Crysis 3 is stellar on the non-game play front in every way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2013"}

But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which isNew Super Mario Bros.

Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.Supports 2-4 players in multiplayer mode.Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies &ndash; or their fellow players.In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"S.Papstein","summary":"Detailed Simplicity","reviewText":"Mario has expanded his audience over the years to an extent where he is video games true mascot. Reconised world wide, Mario games are known for being one thing: better than the rest. Not to say other titles arent of quality, but whether it's an rpg, kart racing or the traditional platformer, Nintendo has been consistant with setting the new gold standard. NSMBW is no exception.Mario Wii gives the fun 2D platforming that you remember from 80's Mario Bros games (or the more recent DS title), but brings in an extra three players for the ride. Four players can traverse through what would typically be a regualr Mario level. Having four players frantically race through gives a much funner, if not tougher experience. Bopping off each others head, stealing mushrooms and getting pushed off cliffs is fun with friends for only so long. Competitive sides will comes out, and Mario Wii can quickly turn into quiet the explict fest.Nintendo's brilliancy does shine through though with the bubble mechanic. Mario becomes accessible to all ages now, with an automatic bubble that will allow players to drop out of games, and follow as a shadow to the remaining players on the field. Grandma will no longer hold you behind at a big jump, and your younger siblings can finally make it past the piranah plants.Once the relitives leave or your friends pass out, Mario Wii brings plenty for those looking for a traditional, single player exerience. Secrets are hidden throughout, new powerups are given, and there is plenty of throwbacks to SMB3. It may be an 'all-ages accessible' Mario, but don't think the difficulty is tuned down. Nintendo shows off it's mastery with level design, making Mario Wii as hard as it was when you where playing with an NES pad.Mario holds enough weight to keep the vetrans attention as well as the new-comers. Nintendo boasts its skill of 2D platformers, making a game that is enjoyable for 1,2,3 or 4 players. Overlooking MArio Wii would be as sad as skipping over any other big xmas release.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2009"}

This is a brilliant addition to 3rd person shooters, and solves the problem of going from cover to cover while also being cool and visceral. It also has a slow-motion feature that kicks in when you get injured which is a nice addition since when you're low on HP you want time to slow.The game world is fantastic. It is set in a gigantic space station kind of like a smaller HALO world so you see things like sloping landscapes and gigantic robots which are not entirely in your view.The weapons are creative. You have a besides the standard rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, rocket, a gun that locks on and sends bolts of lasers to individual targets, a buzzsaw gun, and a big ball of destruction plasma gun. There's also a a nice feature where you sort of do a Terminator/transoformers thing where your arm turns into the weapon you're shooting. Really cool visual feature, like origami.The characters are gruff and slightly over the top/tongue in cheek. They were cool.Boss fights are a challenge and a wonder. They have weak points you have to hit, while avoiding their fire, and are very mobile.The best shooter game on the PS3. Better than like Resistance or killzone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SY4DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Critics too harsh on this one","reviewText":"It is simply sad how some folks have given this game one star simply because they either don't like Capcom or other personal reasons. I personally despise Capcom for the cheap tactics they have used in the past. Therefore, I bought this game only after it got a bit cheaper. Now that I have played it, I have to say it is nowhere near as bad as people describe. On the contrary, it is a great game.**********************To start with pros.**********************-Decent Graphics and Great Character Design (for most part): Not much to say here. You must have seen trailers etc., as far as I can say the game looks great and most character other than Ada are very nicely design.-Four Different Campaigns and Seven Different Characters: To me this was pretty impressive. There are 3 different campaigns that you play with a pair of characters (Leon and Halena; Chris and Piers; Jake and Sherry) and Ada gets her own campaign. In each campaign, both characters have different personalities and moves. Their weapons are also slightly different and at times they travel using different paths. I personally loved this. This adds so much replayability to the game.-Very Personal Stories: There are 4 different stories of 4 campaigns that intersect at many points. Stories in each campaign are very personal to characters of those campaigns and honestly made me sad for those characters especially for Chris. Finishing the 4 campaigns will give basic idea, but if you want to learn about the events in more details you can collect the blue medallions to unlock files that have detailed description of events.-Believable Voice Acting: I like the voice acting in this game. Definitely makes the story more dramatic and personal.-Great Variety in Campaigns: In this game there will be parts where bullets will be scarce and you will be surviving hordes of Zombie attacks and other parts where you will have plenty of explosives and you will be fighting hoards of zombies, huge monster and/or bosses. In addition, you also have some vehicle gameplay in some levels which for most part is very entertaining.-Awesome Melee Combos and Quick Shots: I strongly suggest that player learn this early in the game as the game does not necessarily teaches you. This are fun to you and will make your experience much more enjoyable.-Nicely Designed Bosses: This is a must for me, especially in Resident Evil games. I loved the creation of main bosses in this game. Each campaign has multiple bosses, but the final bosses for each campaigns are the best. Personally loved the main boss for Leon/Halena . Very creative design.-Fun Online Modes: OK online gameplay is no Halo or COD, but still is quite fun. Like RE5, you can play story mode with a friend or do the same with Mercenary mode (You and a friend surviving hoards). Agent Hunk mode is interesting as you can invade other player's game (with their consent) as a creature.-Great Length and Replayability: I like to explore each level rather than just run through the story so it took me well >25 hrs to finish the game. At least on the normal mode, you can't rush through the campaign. Enemies and Quicktime events will punish you if you do so. And as I describe above due to number and variability of characters, this game has great replayability. Also campaign is interesting enough to make you play again.RPG element: Not necessary but is good to have. If you shoot enough enemies and search enough you acquire skill point with which you can get different perks making game easier and fun as you play along.Cut Scene Gallery: If you don't want to play the whole game again and just want to watch cutscenes. You have that option. LOVE IT and I hope more games have such cutscene replay options.**********************Now the Cons.**********************Too Dark at Points: I get it that this game is supposed to be creepy/scary but it is just way too dark at few points (especially Leon's campaign). At least after the enemy surprises me I should be able to see it. I tried adjusting brightness et., but no use.Too many Quicktime Events: I loved the quick time events in Resident Evil 4, but think this game has way too many of them. And some quick time events are punishment to your hands and controller. They should ease up on these in future games. Seriously. Fortunately, there are a few ways to turn some off them off (Amateur level and a skill I believe).Ada Wong: I have liked Ada in previous RE games and movies, but they have COMPLETELY MESSED UP her character design in this game. The voice acting and dialogues are also very poor. Her campaign is short which is fine as it is supposed to be complementary anyways, but her final boss and endings are very disappointing.**********************Conclusion**********************Contrary to the cons I described, this is a great game overall and is an experience you probably don't want to miss. Now that it is cheaper than before, I would definitely buy it and give it a shot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2012"}

That, or pure blinded fanboys who will inhale and praise anything with the title of \"Resident Evil\" on it. The reason I say such harsh criticism is that this game is garbage. Complete. Utter. Garbage. I can't even finish it because it's so bad, I could only take roughly 3-4 hours of each campaign. I'm returning it tomorrow.The Chris Redfield campaign is pure action. There's nothing else to it beyond explosions and gunfire. There is absolutely no subtly to it  whatsoever and the writing, oh god the writing,  is so cringe-worthy you almost want to pull your own hair out. The Leon campaign isn't much better. Equally bad writing but with more quick time events and a slower start. Don't worry though, you'll soon be shooting everything in sight just like the other campaigns. As for the last guy? Well..... he's...... I don't know, the ass debris from whatever they were making from the previous two campaigns.The shooting is all floaty  with no punch to the weapons, the bosses take waaaaaay too long to kill(seriously it's like power rangers) the story is nonsense, the voice-acting is cliche and cheesy, and there is absolutely nothing redeeming about this game.If you loved re4 and liked re5, stop right there and don't buy this game. It takes the worst of re5 as well as operation racoon city, and makes those points unimaginably worse.

The cool concept gets killed thanks to some unbelievably bad controls, even more unbelievably bad AI, a surprisingly lame story, and so many utterances of the F-word to make the game seem gritty that a majority of the story and dialogue just comes off as laughable.  If you manage to get passed what I just mentioned, you'll find some mindless gunplay to be had, along with some interesting twists on the multiplayer modes (even though there is no online co-op mode), but whether or not you get that far into the game is another story.

{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Nick","summary":"Incredible","reviewText":"Final Fantasy is unlike any other Final Fantasy. Sure, FF X has the spiky haired hero and the same themes as the other games in the series. However, this being the first game in the series for PS2, Square realized they needed to come into the next generation with a bang. Boy did they ever.From the opening of the game, you will be blown away. The first FMV is absolutely incredible. I am still stunned after seeing it many times. The game only gets better from there. The plot follows Tidus and Yuna's quest to free Spira from Sin. It is  intriguing (with some funky time travelling aspects), engrossing, and wonderful. Just what you would expect from Square.So far not much seems too diffrent. Then you notice the graphics. Even though the game is two years old, it still looks very good. And those FMV sequences are excellent (and there is a decent amount of them too). After the grapchics you will notice the battle system. It's been changed. No more Active Time Battle (ATB), which has been used in all the Playstation Final Fantasy games. Instead is more strategic, slower system called the CTB. In this system the game has an order at the right of the screen that tells the player when each of the characters will attack. Diffrent actions make the order change. If you decide to use an item, the character might be able to go again before the monster. But if you summon an Aeon, the order might change. It all leads to very compelling combat, and some important descisions. Should I use this special attack or just a normal one? Summon an aeon or use a spell? Your character's lives could depend on it.There are few more major changes you will no doubt notice on your journey. First, the spoken voices. This is the first Final Fantasy to contain voice acting. For the most part, it is pretty good. Tidus and Wakka are my personal favorites. Yuna's voice can become annoying after a while though. Another change is that this Final Fantasy is very linear. Although there are sidequests, no &quot;overworld' like in past FF's hurt FFX a bit.Also, the mini-game Blitzball is not very good. If you put a lot of time into it, the game becomes pretty fun, but Blitzball is just way to complicated. What hapenned to the great card mini games of FF VII and FF IX?These are just a minor quibbles, though because otherwise the game is excellent and more than worthy of the Final Fantasy name. And for only twenty bucks, this is a steal. If you are even remotely interested in RPGs this game belongs in your collection. The music is excellent, the story is excellent, the battles are excellent, the ending is excellent and the characters are awesome. What more do you want from an RPG? Square has outdone themselves yet again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2004"}

Rogue Galaxy may very well be the last, great, original RPG to come out for the PS2, which is fitting because it's from the makers of the amazing Dragon Quest VIII and Dark Cloud 2; which you'll probably be able to tell considering Rogue Galaxy's great, cartoony art style.  Playing as young Jaster Rogue, you find yourself playing space-pirate in a case of mistaken identity.  Without giving too much else away, you'll find Rogue Galaxy to have a great and lengthy quest with a quick paced battle system.  The game's imaginitive art style, environments, and atmosphere is a welcome look in an otherwise stale RPG market, with plenty of enjoyable moments for sci-fi buffs to boot.  The characters are great as well and don't get annoying as the game goes on, plus there's a boatload of enjoyable mini-games and other RPG elements as well.  The only real downsides to Rogue Galaxy are that while the game's fighting system is fast paced, there's really not all that much to it.  Not to mention that now and then, some of the explorable areas can often blend into one another.  All that aside, Rogue Galaxy is a more than enjoyable and original RPG that PS2 owners who have had their fill of Final Fantasy XII should definitely consider picking up, and it's probably the last, best, original RPG to hit the PS2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2007"}

It is everything you expect from the show plus more. they have everything from making the game so easy to making it so hard. everyone who is a fan of baseball should pick this game up. the only complaint i have is my online pass didnt work, but that does not reflect my game review because it isnt part of the game. the gameplay is so smooth and you feel a sence of accomplishment when you blast a home-run. they brought back where you can choose exactly where you swing and that is what i am talking about. This game feels just as smooth as when i played mlb 08 and mlb 11 on the ps3. playing on the vita doesnt take nothing away from the experience.editedMy online pass worked later that night when i got the game. i guesss they were having problems.I played a couple games online and the experience was fun, but also frustrating. It seems like a lot of people either disconnect or quit once you get the lead. I have played 3 full games and my record is 5-4. people are getting losses when they havnt even played. The timing for hitting is rediculous online. It seems like your always either late or early. If you hit a hard ground ball to right field it is so easy to get thrown out at first. sometimes the catcher will get stuck on a 3rd strike pass ball or a steel and who ever is running can run the bases and get a free run. If you really care about your record or play seriously then i suggest you wait for a patch to jump online. If you play for fun like me and could care less about your record, you can still have fun playing online right now.i chaned it to 4 stars overall because of all the problems online. if you buying this to play mainly online i suggest you wait to pick it up.online 3 starsoffline 5 stars. If you buying this game to play mainly offline i suggest you pick it up right now","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000KRXAGE","description":"Wii Play collects nine quick and addictive games that are easy to pick up and play and hard to put away. Thanks to the intuitive controls of the Wii Remote, even the most inexperienced gamers will have no trouble mastering the controls.    &lt;p&gt; Wii Play features nine separate mini-games, including the following: &lt;li&gt;Shooting Range, a point-and-fire game of target practice in the Duck Hunt tradition. &lt;li&gt;Billiards, a simplified variation of nine-ball with stunningly realistic physics that uses your Wii Remote as your pool cue. &lt;li&gt;Find Mii, in which you scan the crowds to find the right Mii&#8212;and Miis you and your friends created make an appearance. &lt;li&gt;Tanks!, in which you command a toy tank on a miniature battlefield in a gauntlet of 100 missions. &lt;li&gt;Other games include Pose Mii, Table Tennis, Fishing, Charge!, and Laser Hockey. &lt;p&gt; Every game features a multiplayer mode, so you and your friends can compete for the high score or go head to head to see who&#8217;s the best.  Wii Play comes with a white Wii Remote so that your friends can join in the action. (Nunchuk not included.)","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"A Nice Remote with some Cheap Games","reviewText":"Wii Play is a multi-game arcade set along with a free remote. A better way to look at this is that you get a remote along with a free or perhaps cheap game. The games aren't great, but they're certainly not awful!We had two Wii remotes and wanted a third one, so we could do party multiplayer. We assumed that the games that came with this would let you have more than 2 people playing. Wrong! These are all only two player games. That really seems a shame for a system that is set up to be a party machine.The games are all rather straightforward and use the basic Wii remote functions. You can do a target shooting where you shoot at targets, ducks, cans, skeet targets and even space aliens. There's a pattern matching game where you try to figure out which Miis are the same or different. In another game, you rotate and change poses of your Miis to match the shape shown. There's a simple ping-pong, a simple table hockey, a simple pool, a cow race, a fishing game, and then tanks.I had high hopes for many of these games. I love pool, I enjoy target shooting, and even fishing can be great fun. For whatever reason, they just didn't implement any of the games very well. Fishing in Zelda is FAR more fun than this fishing version. Pool is done much better in many other games. Even the target practice isn't varied enough to be interesting.The only game that really holds our interest for long periods is the tank game. I *love* the tank game. It can be quite challenging, and is fun to play both alone and with others.Really, you're not paying much at all for this game set. You're getting a nice remote, and you get the games for free. If you've got very young kids, they might be quite happy with racing cows, knocking over scarecrows, and trying to get the very best cow-racing score they can. In that case, you're all set! You paid very little for a game that fits your needs. For most gamers, though, don't get your hopes up too high. If you go in with low expectations, you might be pleasantly surprised with a game that catches your fancy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2007"}
