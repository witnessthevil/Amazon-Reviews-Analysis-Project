As with all releases in theDead Risingseries, it is a survival horror game. Players take on the role of an all-new character, with equally new motivations to survive and resources to do so. These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"matt","summary":"Same as the First, different location... But still FUN!","reviewText":"Dead Rising 2 is definitely worth the $10. I loved the first game so I thought I would give the second a shot. Here's a quick list of some pros and cons of the second:Pros:- Plays like the first. A fun run around save everyone kill zombies game- Loads more weapons. Addition of combo-ing weapons to make kick*** zombie killing equipment.- Large map to play around in- Great replay value. You get to keep your upgrades and money from previous play througs, so you can keep playing getting all the different endings and making yourself a bigger zombie killer!Cons:- An aspect of this is to give your daughter a shot every 12 hours (in game), which can get a little annoying- No &#34;Infinite Mode&#34; (but the replay value kind of negates this)- Pretty short story, if you play straight through it will probably only take you 4 hours aboutOverall, this is a really fun game. Maybe not worth the original $60 but for the price of $10-$15 that it is now it is definitely worth it. Really fun to play again and again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2014"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Dmitry Kristal","summary":"For the detective in all of us, Rockstar delivers once again!","reviewText":"Be honest: At some point of your lifetime, you always wanted to be a detective.  If you still have that feeling inside, then this is definitely a must buy for you.  If you have played Grand Theft Auto before, then you are already set to go as the game uses pretty much the same controls and mechanics scheme from previous GTA games.  Unlike many gaming companies, Rockstar has figured it out:  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  True, they are still trying to make us forget that they have released a table tennis game in 2006, but this title alone makes up for it big time.  One thing I must mention is that you get three disks in Xbox360 version.  My suggestion is to install all three on your hard drive before diving in to make the game run smoother, save some time and to take the pressure off your Xbox, not to mention make it much quieter.  As it will probably take you around half-hour to install the disks, use that time to flip through the game's manual.***Graphics***For the first time, Rockstar introduces us to MotionScan technology, which translates into excellent facial animations from characters.  I have been playing video games since the 80s and I have never seen anything quite like this.  At this point, I'm not even sure how much more life-like can these animations get.  MotionScan plays a huge role here, but more of that later on(See \"Gameplay.\")  Other than that, graphics fit very well with the 1940s theme and the noire-style filming, which is not too colorful, but just right to give you that 1940s nostalgic feel.  In fact, if you are feeling very nostalgic, you can go all the way by going to options menu and make the game black-and-white entirely.***Sound***The sound mechanics are very well done as well and music changes based on what you are currently doing in the game.  If looking for clues, you get a soft tune in the background.  If you start chasing someone, a more dramatic tune kicks in.  Also, whenever you are driving in a car, you can hear some vintage songs and news being played on the radio(Another beloved GTA feature.)***Gameplay***As mentioned earlier, if you have already played Grand Theft Auto on 360 in the past, you have already been briefed on most of the mechanics in the controls department.  The overall gameplay consists of multiple parts and is very-well organized.  You start off  as a rookie cop as you are trying to make a name for yourself and move up in the ranks.  As soon as you pick a case, there are multiple parts to sift through.  You start off examining a crime scene and start searching for clues.  It is not as tedious as it sounds because when you are near a clue, a soft tone will be subtly played in the background to give you a hint that you are near something interesting.  If this sounds too easy for you, feel free to turn that feature off in the options menu.  Not all clues will be valuable.  Some clues are \"dummy clues\" and will be irrelevant to you in the case(pack of cigarettes or empty beer bottle with no fingerprints, for example.)As soon as you collected some clues, you move on to questions and locating people of interest.  As you question them, this is where the MotionScan technology comes into play.  You must carefully listen and look at their facial expressions at the time to figure out if they are telling you the truth or not.  You pretty much use your common sense, instincts and evidence you collected to see if they are telling the truth or not.  For example if they tell you that there were no gun shots at a crime scene and you have found empty shell casings, you can use that to accuse them of lying.Accidentally accusing someone of lying when they are not will make the person of interest very angry and uncooperative or going along with a liar will also point your case into the wrong direction.  The genius part of this game is that you only game one save slot, which automatically auto-saves after pretty much every move you make.  This way you cannot cheat yourself and reload the game immediately after making a wrong decision.  If you do not like the outcome of the case or if you wish to take another path to see how it plays out, you have the option of replaying the case later on.As you level up, you earn intuition points, which can help you in the game big time.  If you decide to use your points during investigation, it will show you all the clues on the map.  If you decide to use it in the interrogation, you have a couple of choices here, which will remind you of that show \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire.\"  You can either remove one wrong answer(truth, lie or doubt) or \"Ask the Community\" which will tell you which is the most popular answer amongst the Xbox live community.  You only have a few intuition points to spare, so use them wisely!If the story line alone doesn't satisfy your appetite, there are many side quests and collectibles to be found: Random street crimes, discovering vehicles and locating landmarks just to name a few.  Also there are detective suits to collect as well, where each will give you a different benefit throughout your adventure.  Also caution to parents: This game contains violence(fist fights and gun fights,) gruesome crime scenes(poking through a dead body,) and strong language(not just your average F-words, but racial slurs as well.)  Rockstar has certainly hit yet another jackpot with the release of LA Noire, which will probably translate into a sequel in the future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2011"}

The mechanics are the same including the annoying &#34;chase the guy around the city&#34; missions.  Once you get past Havana things open up and it feels more like a ship to ship fighting game.  The ship combat is fun for a while but it gets incredibly repetitive, including the same cut scenes after boarding a fallen ship.There is a crafting system included but I've yet to see where it provides enough value to pay much attention to it.  Same goes for fleet operations where you can direct a number of ships by assigning them to do things.I've yet to get to the Observatory so there is much left to play before I could comment on the arcing storyline.Overall, I find it OK but it suffers from some of the same nagging issues as its predecessors.

{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play.

The levels can be frustrating, but you can figure them out. There is only one boss and she is sort of difficult if you don't know how to do it.Get this game if you have a PS2.

{"product_name":"B001YI0Z2U","description":"Blurring the borders of good and evil, this cinematic and stylized adventure stars Bayonetta, a heroine bent on sending supernatural forces to the depths of hell. Armed with her four enchanted guns known as Scarborough Fair, she battles both monstrous behemoths and angelic enemies. By combining special magic attacks, summoning primal forces and unleashing devastating weaponry, she impressively punishes anyone who gets in her way. From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint.Unleash your powersView larger.Amazing graphicsView larger.","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"\"Utter Mayhem\" may be too light a phrase to describe Bayonetta","reviewText":"I'd say that the level of chaos in this game is unlike anything I've ever seen before. There were more than a few moments where I was mashing buttons, hoping against hope that somewhere in the maelstrom of bullets, blades, explosions, geysers of blood and spiked heels made of hair, I was making some kind of progress. Still, Bayonetta goes down in my book of playing history as one of the most original, challenging and awe inspiring games I have ever played.Bayonetta is an Umbran witch with a gun in each hand and one on each foot. You will shoot plenty of bullets with these guns as you take on the hordes of angels you must destroy on your quest. She also has claws, katanas and shotguns for you to use. Keep the kiddies away from this one because this chick has a penchant for getting as naked as you can without showing the goods. Her outfit is made up of her long hair which is also used to summon demons. Don't ask as it just makes more sense while you play.This is a game that you cannot take seriously because the moment you do, you'll lose any enjoyment intended for you by the developers. It's very tongue-in-cheek and has a heroine that wags her butt and crotch in your face at any opportunity available. In this universe populated with witches who look like they've walked out of a leather fetishist convention, bird-like angels, flying motorcycles, gun heeled boots with infinite ammo, demons made out of flowing hair, doe eyed children and bosses that look like something out of an evangelist's nightmares, this game begs not to be taken seriously. The story makes barely a lick of sense and is as all over the place as the action. Still, its hilarious at times and benefits from a kooky mix of Japanese/ French new wave humor.The graphics really shine and everything just looks great. The frame rate is a solid 60 frames per second and runs very smoothly. The character design is top tier and are well realized as each character looks just like they should. The boss battles are spectacular and probably the best thing about the whole package. Each one trumps the last and the final battle is one for the books. I was literally sitting there with my jaw on the floor watching this amazing feat in gameplay design as I fought with everything I had. Seriously, the overall design of the bosses as well as the general artistic design of the game is beautiful and flawless. The game feels extremely polished and is very intuitive, even as you're feeling like you don't know what the hell is going on.The music in this game is probably one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in a videogame and that's not by any stretch of the imagination. The soundtrack was released as a 5-CD set in Japan and frankly, after hearing it in the game, I would definitely pick it up. Bayonetta's main theme reminds me a lot of the retro stylings of Space Channel 5's music while the rest of the music sounds equal parts jazzy, orchestral and choral.There are complaints to be made. The game may be just a little too hardcore for its own good and as much fun as it can be to jump headfirst into the complete craziness of it all, it can be a little cheap at times and coupled with a camera that isn't necessarily on your side every given moment, it can get a bit frustrating when you're dying multiple times at the same point.It's violent, it's brash, it's groovy and it's sexy in the most retarded of ways. This game is a triumph and one that may be a little too ahead of its time. I think a lot of people are not going to know what to make of this game and will unwisely pass on it. I think those with an open mind and who are willing to see what this game has to offer will be richly rewarded. If you liked mayhem rich games like Ninja Gaiden and Devil May Cry (which was also developed by the same guy as Bayonetta), then you'll appreciate this. You'd have to.One last note. I beat this game on Normal difficulty, which was pretty challenging. I went immediately to Hard and it was like walking into a dog pound wearing a suit made of steaks. Make no mistake, this is one game that will thrash you senselessly and keep you coming back for more. This may be the ultimate game for masochists yet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2010"}

The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword shakes up the tried-and-true adventure game formula and marks a turning point for the series. Link embarks on a sprawling adventure through the skies and across the continent when his childhood friend Zelda falls from their floating home in the sky beneath the clouds to the mysterious continent below. The introduction of full motion controls enabled by Wii MotionPlus technology synchronizes player movements with Link's actions while offering the most intuitive play control of any game in the series to date.","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"This game is a Zelda masterpiece that is most definitely worth experiencing (even without the bonus music CD)","reviewText":"The Legend of Zelda series is one of the greatest video game franchises of all time, if not arguably *thee* greatest. With each release, Nintendo has showed us the magic of journeying through Hyrule's beautiful kingdom. Now, they have done it again, greatly injecting innovation into the tried-and-true formula of past titles. This is a Zelda game unlike any other, and feels all at once both an incredible nostalgic celebration of 25 years of history, and a wholly new adventure full of wild, awesome new directions. Get ready for a fairly long review, but please know that this is written from the heart of a young man who loves the series above most others in his favorite pastime.The story and characters present in Skyward Sword are very different among the other Zelda titles, despite the obvious recurring ones. I don't just mean the amazing setting of Link's home, Skyloft, a fantastical city floating above the clouds where everone is bonded to their own guardian birdlike creature, a loftwing. No, from the start, Nintendo truly changes almost everything of what you'd come to expect from a Zelda game. This is the earliest tale in the series chronologically, acting as a prequel, making way for Ocarina of Time's tale to come. Zelda is not a princess here, just another common schoolgirl. She and Link have been best friends since childhood, and may even have feelings for each other (it's pretty obvious, and incredibly touching. My wife and I were both pretty moved by it). In Skyloft, the local school is essentially a knights academy, the uniform being a tunic that is easily recognizable to fans of the series. After completing a ceremony to become a senior in his class (the senior tunic is, you guessed it, dark green), Zelda and Link ride together through the sky to celebrate. Out of nowhere, a malevolent tornado knocks Zelda to \"the surface,\" a vast, unexplored land below the cloud cover and once again, Link takes up the mantle of being a fated hero, destined to save the day. I'll stop here, because this is virtually spoiler free and if I say more it won't be. Just know that Nintendo has really changed up the formula of story and characters we've come to expect from the Zelda franchise, and as a result, Skyward Sword feels incredibly refreshing.Another immediately noticeable change is in presentation. The story is much, much more cinematic than Zelda has ever been. Cinematic shot angles are much more dynamic than ever before, character expression is stunning, animation is smooth and realistic, and the writing is just fantastic. If anything, this feels like a very intimate entry in the Zelda series, not just epic or grand like past titles. It's a lovely direction for the Zelda series, if you ask me. The characters all come to life thanks to this presentation, of course, but the writing present certainly helps too. Each character has so much personality, and talking to each of them is a joy. Link is a somewhat distracted dreamer with his head in the clouds, loves to sleep, but has tons of courage and kindness, a true hero. Accompanying him in his journey is Fi, a new kind of companion to the series. Fi looks like a ceramic doll, her \"speech\" sounds likeGLaDOS, and is purely logic driven. She is amazing. Zelda is a strong-willed, tough tomboy of sorts, and very lovable. Lord Ghirahim, the new villain, is *extremely* compelling and creepy (Ganandorf makes no direct appearance). All of these characters, as well as the plethora of side characters, are written and presented beautifully.The art design and graphical implementation is awesome here. The game has married the art design of two past masterpiece Zelda title styles into one wholly unique direction. You have more realistic people and settings, like in the dark, matureTwilight Princess, but you also have the vibrant color and imagination ofThe Wind Waker, and it is a joy to behold. Nintendo EAD designed the game to look like a water color painting, and I must say, they did a fantastic job doing so. Draw distances are fairly short, and anything beyond is purposely blurred to look exactly like a water-color painting of the impressionist style, full of  brushstrokes of beautiful color. I am deeply impressed here. The Wii is a painfully underpowered system in comparison to its two competitors, but it is genius art design like this that shows why the Wii has had some of the most beautiful titles of this generation (Metroid Prime 3,Muramasa: The Demon Blade,Super Mario Galaxy,Super Mario Galaxy 2,Okami, now this game, the list goes on and on). To put it succinctly, Skyward Sword is one of the most beautiful games in recent memory, and that is totally thanks to the absolutely brilliant (and well implemented) art design.Koji Kondo and Hajime Wakai; any fan of Nintendo will instantly recognize these names as two of the greatest musical composers of video gaming. They are almost unrivaled as composers, writing some of the most iconic music in the entire medium. Koji worked as musical supervisor in this title (as well as composed the main theme and some other songs). Hajime was in charge of music composition. This may be, and I *do not* say this lightly, some of their very best work yet. The music here ranges from the entire spectrum of musical emotion: epic, intimate, touching, sad, meditative, dark, joyous, achingly beautiful, uplifting, goofy/doofy (for a certain character), anything you can imagine. Each theme, whether for an event, a character, a place, whatever, is absolutely perfect for its place and can greatly change depending on the situation. It takes something special for music to not only define the experience for any gamer playing the game, but also convey the emotion and thought its supposed to, and the soundtrack here does so perfectly. Like most Zelda games, Link acquires a musical instrument that helps progress the story (Ocarina of time had... well... duh. Wind Waker had a baton), here it is a harp. You can play it at any time, and when you do, you can actually accompany the beautiful background music of wherever you happen to be on the harp. That's very, very cool. Great job Koji and Hajime! You're amazing.The gameplay is what you're probably the most curious about. Does the Wii-Motion Plus work? Yes, it does very well, for the most part. You'll have to deal with calibration from time to time, sometimes actions won't register the way you hoped, but it's not too big a deal and doesn't happen nearly enough to mar the experience. The 1:1 swordplay works pretty flawlessly once you become acquainted with it. Link will seamlessly swing his sword however you do. Horizontal, vertical, diagonal, it all works quite well. Pretty much every enemy you will encounter will require a different strategy to defeat, and I have found that the swordplay grows more enthralling with each hour I play (Boss fights are outstanding). It took me quite a while to get used to it, but I must say that this is truly the game the Wii was made nearly six years ago for. It's about time. The quest items you'll find are also a blast to use. They give you some new ones right off the bat, and they're all awesome, feeling completely new yet appropriate for the franchise. Also, Link now has stamina that runs out as he climbs and dashes throughout the world (yes, Link can now sprint around if you'd like). Link's stamina actually adds a small layer of strategic depth to the game, and the concept comes into play in many scenarios throughout the game. This gameplay concept worried me at first, but it's actually really enjoyable, and implemented excellently.There have been several major shake-ups to the usual Zelda expectations we all had up to this point. Gone is the field-dungeon-field formula of past titles. Instead, here you have a hub world, the realm above the clouds, with Skyloft as your main town to visit. Here you can restock supplies, buy or upgrade your shield and other equipment using items you've scavenged in your questing rpg-style, and go on very personal side quests that feel very much likeMajora's Maskdid, making for a character-driven experience. A great change of formula, one I was *very* skeptical about beforehand.You can ride your loftwing and drop to the surface world below at key rifts in the clouds. Here, you have more concentrated lands you can adventure through until you get to a dungeon/temple that will advance the story. The world below, and its temples, feel quite a lot like the Metroid series, andthe Metroid Prime Trilogyin particular. The land is more condensed and concentrated, feeling like dungeon of sorts by themselves, but as you acquire newer items, more and more dimensions will open up in those places as you revisit them. It's a huge change-up to the Zelda formula, but one that feels surprisingly good. Having now beaten the game and played through all temples so far, I am amazed at the ingenuity of them (especially Ancient Cistern, one of the greatest dungeon/temples of any Zelda game from the past 25 years, no joke). Yes, you'll be pushing blocks and shooting targets to open doors, but you'll also encounter brilliant new puzzles. I mean, the puzzles are challenging and downright laugh-inducing in their ingenuity, and feel very satisfying when you figure then out. Combine this with the totally awesome new items, stellar swordplay, and ease of use and you get the feeling that every area feels like an innovation, in much the same way playing through Super Mario Galaxy 2 felt like standing before a firing squad of brilliant new ideas. I am downright astonished. I did not think it could be done, honestly, but this game really has reinvigorated the series through great change to the formula rather than refining it further like Twilight Princess did, and trust me when I say no one is more surprised than me.This is a brilliant game, even among the other entries in what has been for 25 years a brilliant series. It takes Zelda in a plethora of new directions, while miraculously feeling *exactly* like a true-to-form Zelda game. Color me surprised. If you're a fan of Zelda, then you don't need me to tell you to go get this right now. This series has some of the most diehard fans of any gaming franchise out there, but just for emphasis' sake, I proudly, and loudly proclaim that this game is incredible! Buy it, soar through the realms above, and dive to the vast, mysterious lands below and fulfill your destiny to save the world once again!* I know this review is quite long, but honestly, this game has so much that merits attention, the review could be much, much longer and still be appropriate. I will edit my review as I play through the game more if I feel there is something worth mentioning that I come across. However, I feel that this is a pretty good summary that hopefully gives you a good picture of the game. Seriously, go get it, like, right now. You won't regret it.- Update after beating the game:After playing the game for roughly 50 hours I finally beat Skyward Sword. In short, this game is an absolute masterpiece. Each and every hour spent in this game was filled to the brim with brilliance and excellence, and not one single minute felt like boring filler that artificially extended the game. This feels like the Super Mario Galaxy 2 of Zelda titles, where there seems to be an exciting new gameplay/puzzle element at every turn. The story is incredible, with a lot of twists that genuinely thrilled and surprised me. This game essentially acts as an origin story for the entire Zelda series. Pretty much every element that you're familiar with from Zelda games see their true origin here, and it is spectacular (I won't give any spoilers though, you'll be blown away when you experience it for yourself). I have to say that I have not been this entranced and enthralled by a Zelda game since Ocarina of Time and I am a HUGE fan of pretty much every entry in the entire Zelda series, so I don't say that lightly. The music is among the series' very best, which by itself is a massive accomplishment. The graphics and particularly the art design are incredibly beautiful, some of the most gorgeous and brilliantly inspired of the past decade, despite the underpowered system it is on. Because of all of this, I was compelled to play this constantly until beating it, AND there's a new game plus mode that adds substantially to the game as well! For fans of the series, this game is an immediate must-own. I give it the highest recommendation possible. I absolutely love this game, and I'm fairly certain most of you out there will too.*That's my final statement. This is meant to finalize the points I made from my original review, which I think will be as detailed and informative as anyone would want or need. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Good day. :)- I wondered when the supply of first-edition copies of this game, which came with a special bonus musical CD, would run out and Nintendo would start reproduction of this masterpiece without the bonus disc. It appears now is that time. I wrote a very detailed review of the game when it first came out. It's one of the reviews I'm most proud of, and I stand by my assessment. This game is just as good now as it was when it released about six months ago, and is just one of those magical games that must be played, as Zelda games tend to be. Having had months to think about the game since completing it for the first time, what really stands out to me about it is the spectacular art design and execution of said artistic concepts, the absolutely beautiful and moving soundtrack that I think is some of Kondo and Wakai's best work, the exceptional story and the way it is told, the very unique and enjoyable temple/level design, and finally the unique gameplay and control mechanics. It's a very moving experience when all combined together. Also, may I just say that Ancient Cistern may be, in every way imaginable, one of the very best temples/dungeons in Zelda's rich 25 year history. Seriously, it's fantastic, but in all honesty, the entire game is so incredibly memorable and endearing. So enjoy this review, and have a good day. :D","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000XJS00K","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A fun gritty shooter","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing gritty art style, superb voice acting, great characters, involved story, fun gun play, a variety of eventsThe Bad: Repetitive after awhile, cramped environments, shallow sword playWET is one of those gritty trying-to-be-bad-ass-but-doesn't-concentrate-on-other-aspects type games. The feeling of the game is it's strongest point, and ironically, not the acrobatics that the game boasts about. The developers tried to nail the 70's Quintin Tarintino/Wild West feeling and did it perfectly. Everything from buildings to clothing have a bad ass brown dirty scheme to it. There is even an old 70's film reel filter over the screen that adds to the atmosphere. The music is also a big helper in this thanks to its classic indie feeling to it.But atmosphere isn't anything if the game has bad game play and this game does not. What it does have is unfinished game play that seems rushed. There is a lot of thought behind it, but it seemed quickly tossed together, but also is really shallow. The whole idea of the game play is based on slow motion combat. Yeah I know, we've seen this before in countless game (Max Payne started it all), but to be fair they add a little twist. Whenever your feet leave the ground and you start shooting you enter slow mo mode. In this mode you have a red circle that auto locks onto an enemy then you am your reticle at another. This was executed brilliantly so you don't have to worry about aiming both weapons. You can go into slow mo when you slide on your shins, jump whichever way in the air, shoot from zip lines, poles, ledges; you name it.Another addition to combat that really felt shallow was the sword play. A simple one, two, three combo and that's it. There could have been so much more to this, bu it seem the developers were more worried about atmosphere and style than actual game play. You can swipe out your sword from a slide, wall run, or dive, but little does this do in turn with guns.Over the course of the game you get three additional weapons aside from your dual revolvers: Sawed off shotgun, explosive crossbow, and sub-machine guns. Each as their strengths and weaknesses, but overall they are not used as they should thanks to sparse ammo and limited capacity. You can however upgrade all your weapons and buy more abilities via balance points, but you will not be able to by everything through one play through simply due to the fact that points are given in too small of increments.The is also very linear and acrobatics tend to take a slight tumble thanks to this. You can hand from ledges, jump gaps, swing on poles, and what seems, everything Lara Croft can do, but the somewhat cramped environments hamper this a tad. Some times you will wall run and rump over to a ledge only to find out you can't hand from there. You will some times try to wall run and jump to a different wall only to find out you forgot to keep the L trigger held down during this transfer.If you think acrobatics are a tad cramped try the arena events. These are what really break up the game too much. Most shooters have \"arena areas\" where you have a closed off area and must defeat all enemies to advance. WET takes a little turn and has you closing off spawn points before advancing. These seem simple at first, but later on there are so many guys that concentrating on slow mo, acrobatics, and finding the right paths to these doors and get very frustrating and many restarts will incur.Another addition to the game is Rage mode where Rubi will see in a red vision that kind of reminds me of Killer7 and is faster and stronger. Enemies are weaker and die faster, but there are more of them. Both arena modes and driving modes (explained below) apply in Rage mode. Rubi also gets to get her counter up faster (which I find useless) by scoring more points. The more style you use the more points you'll get that will add to your multiplier.There are a few other events like turret events, that are fun, and the driving events which are pretty awesome and epic. You ride on top of cars and shoot at enemies while jumping and diving around cars to avoid getting killed. This is both epic and fun thanks to its simplicity and cinematics.One thing I have yet to mention is story and WET delivers strongly upon this. You play as Rubi Malone who is a hired mercenary/assassin that gets involved in the wrong deal between a father and a son. The voice acting is superb, but the graphics are a little technically under developed. While the art style is top notch the graphics aren't up to par with the most recent next-gen games (Gears of War 2, Uncharted 2, Assassin's Creed 2, BioShock 2...yeah all the twos!!!). However the awesome art style makes you see past this so it's not so bad.WET is a great weekend rental and has fun gun play, and a few different events to keep things mixed up. With hot eye candy that is Rubi Malone you will want to follow this sexy protagonist through the twists and turns that is WET.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

My wife and I were excited to play it with all the lights off, hoping to have the bejebus scared out of us. After 3 of 11 \"intervals\" only the gameplay was scary.FEAR is a patchwork quilt of gameplay and story elements that have already been done (and done better) by someone else. That's not to say that a marvelous work of art cannot contain influences from previous masterpieces, but if you just stitch together pieces of famous works by Monet, Rembrandt, & VanGogh you'll wind up with something appalling, not appealing.The enemy soldiers sound just like the soldiers from the original Half-Life. Alma appears as a young girl with her face obscured by long black hair. Remind you of The Ring? Maybe The Grudge?? Paxton Fettel eats people like a Resident Evil zombie, except for the thin premise that he doesn't do it for nutrition- he absorbs their memories.Speaking of thin premises, let's talk about SlowMo. Your character's reflexes are so fast that you can slow down in-game time. Thanks to the part about reflexes, that doesn't sound anything like Max Payne's Bullet Time.Health dips into the original Doom's bag of tricks, complete with a max of 100 points each, health & armour- that is, unless you pick up health boosters that add 5 pts to your max. What is this, 1993?? Oh, and Heaven help you if you pass a checkpoint with low health. Also borrowed from Doom3 were messages left through the game. Except instead of watching clue-laden video-memos like Doom3, FEAR offers voicemails from one plant worker to another who asks \"Are you alright? We heard loud noises.\"There was ONE trait that was unique to FEAR: You can't always just pass over ammo & items to collect them. Sometimes yes, but most times you are forced to press and hold X.Was there fear in F.E.A.R.? Apart from the occasional \"Boo!\" moment, no not really. Like the rest of the game, scare tactics were recycled and repetitive.I cannot recommend this game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2007"}

Over 120 plus hours of total combined gameplay, numerous additions and enhancements, and critically-acclaimed game and art design.","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Persona 3 Fes is a great tribute to a good game","reviewText":"I was impatient with Persona 3. I got it even before Fes came out when all us fans still thought there was no way in hell Atlus was going to ship it over to the states. However we signed a petition,rallied a bunch of team spirit, and miraculously Atlus took our whining as a valid point. Sure they likely did it because they knew they could make more money but at $29.99 this game is very much a steal! All I have to say is thank you Atlus.Honestly I'll start by saying this rpg is not for everyone. If for example you hate dating sims, destest Japanese culture, or prefer more traditional RPGS that include knights,barbarains,dragons, fair damsels, and scantily clad spell casting elf babes Persona 3 is not for you. I do not say this to sound snutty or elite I'm just warning you so you know what you are getting into.However if you are open minded to heavy social interactions in rpgs, a great modern day story in which our world is threatened by demonic shadows of ill intent that come out during a hidden 13th hour, and a group of teenagers that use their inner psyches to battle for the fate of mankind while trying to keep up with their responsibilities tied to high school life you will love this improved Persona 3 dearly.As much as I want to describe evokers, Apathy syndrome, fusing cards to create new personas, strengthening social links to make your Arcana types more powerful, and running around in the labyrinth of Tartarus which oddly enough is your High School during the day time I think it is more important to discuss what is new in Fes. I assume most of you have at least researched the original title so I will not waste your time going over what has already been covered.If you think \"The Answer\" segment with Aegis is the only thing new about FES you are mistaken. \"The journey\" has an added hard mode, more ways to increase your social links, a weapon/persona forging system,more interactivity amongst your SEES comrades,additional quests, and though it may seem like a trivial detail everyone will change their clothes throughout the year. Getting the sexy costumes for the female heroines is a guilty pleasure if you are into that sort of thing. (Maid wear and swim suits anyone?) and if you are a girl playing you'll get a giggle out of dressing down the guys too. If anything at least P3 fes does not descriminate  against either gender. No feminists will have the excuse to wail about burning bras here. The female characters have alot of depth,personality, and lovable quirks and there's so much more to them than looks alone. The same thing can be said for the guys. You'll take to Junpei's class clown antics and Akihiko's fighting spirit in no time flat. I must say this is one of the only RPGS I played in which I liked every character and none of the cast felt like over blown comic relief or tacky add-ons. The endearing heroes/heroines in P3 Fes will make you wish Final Fantasy as a series still cared about giving their characters heart and soul instead of just marketing them to be \"cool\" as shallow gimmicks.While the Jorney is easier due to all the additional ways you have of balancing normal adolescent life with fighting shadows \"The Answer\" is automatically on hard mode. For those of you that do not mind a challenge you'll still enjoy the same old level grinding but if you are a casual gamer it can get tedious. That said getting more revelations about the first game will be worth the drudgery to most of us. Because \"The Answer\" ditches social links and focuses more on combating your way through the new dungeon called the abyss of time the only conversations you'll see are between the SEES members themselves as they discuss how they feel about where their lives are heading after the events in the journey. Aegis takes the role as the lead so at the very least she has acess to more then  one Persona and can enter the velvet room.By now if what I said has intrigued you Fes is likely worth your dollar. There are alot of less fun RPGS out there going for higher prices so right now Fes is a win/win situation.Pros1. Taking Elisabeth for dates outside the velvet room.2. Walking the dog to up your social links3. More social links to estabalish.4. P3 fans get more answers and more closure5. Getting revealing or outlandish costumes for each character6. Hard mode for those that thought the original was too easy.7. Metis is a good new character both as an antagonist and an ally.8. Fuuka gets more love9. More quests (One which deals with Chidori)10. Great translation and voice overs11. Addition of classic Persona battle songs in \"The Answer\"12. Good music that fits the game. (By this I mean the music would be weird or abyssmally bad if not in P3 but it compliments this type of adventure perfectly.)13. Very affordableCons1. Gameplay is mostly unchanged2. The Answer is nothing more then a difficult story driven dungeon hack.3. Tartarus and the abyss of time get very repetitive. It would have been nicer if more missions took place outside the main dungeons or there were more enviorment types.4. Those not open minded to modern Japanese culture may feel alienated.5. Atlus could have waited so we only had to buy this version instead of belting out money for two versions of essentially the same game. Hopefully Persona 4 will come to us finished the first time. If they later release P4 fes I'll be irrate.6. The game is very linear (especially if you've romped around in the wide open spaces of Dragon Warrior 8 or Final Fantasy 12)7. Likely the copies are limited so snatch it soon or forever be in gamer purgatory. (Atlus always has limited copies. What gives?)8. To clarify evokers are not real guns but the imagery of putting a gun like object to ones head and pulling the trigger to summon a persona is still risque. No problem for gamers with a good grip on reality but if you are a parent considering this a purchase be sure your teenager or child is firmly rooted in common sense before you get them P3 fes. Overall it is not nearly as violent or vulgar as God of War or GTA San Andreas however.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2008"}

{"product_name":"B002LBGB1S","reviewerName":"LM1000 \"LM\"","summary":"great for gaming","reviewText":"We own both a PS3 and an 360, but I wanted to write this review for the reason why I prefer the Xbox 360.  It is better for gaming.  We do not pay full price for games all the time, getting the newest releases. Often times, we will buy a very good game from 2-3 years ago for $20...and the Xbox 360 has more good game choices in that price range.Also, most new games are too complicated and not fun for the kids...but the games they love are the ones you can download from online for often under $10-$15.  Once again, there are more and better choices of those games on the Xbox 360.Finally, it is less frustating to play the 360. One of the earliest games we had fun with was marvel ultimate alliance. We had it first on the PS3..but the graphics were 'choppier' (it wasn't smooth to watch) and there were parts of the game you had to do some silly things with the PS3 motion sensor controller.  We ended up selling that copy used, and got it for the Xbox 360. It was a smoother game that was easier to controll.So the Xbox 360 doesnt' have a blu-ray player, so you miss out on that. But for pure gaming (especially if you want both the newest, hi-tech games but also choice of simpler games for the kids), the 360 is a great choice for those people.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"One of the Best Games Ever Made for Xbox","reviewText":"If you are a fan of action RPG's or a fan of Star Wars, this game is not one you can pass up. The game offers over 20 hours of genuin playing time. Most new games these days are lucky to have 10. On the start-up screen you are given a choice of a combination of various characteristics for your hero. You get to pick a name, the gender, the type of character--scout, soldier, or scoundrel each with their own personalized skills. In addition to those, you get to determine what features your character has such as a power attack or specialization with a melee or ranged weapon.The best feature of the game is being able to choose between being a dark or light side character. Every action changes how your hero answers in conversations and how the appear as well how others feel about them. The story is definitely worthy of the Star Wars universe and rivals some of the best books I've read. I won't give away too much, but I will say somewhere in the game you get to use a lightsaber. Almost all the weapons are upgradeable. Higher quality armor is also upgradeable. The presentation of the fight options is well layed out and easy to use. Leveling up is rather simple too. Graphics are pretty good for a couple of years ago.The gameplay is excellent and will make you a prisoner of your couch. Game value is near perfection if you don't already own the game since the current price for the game is only seven dollars. Replay value I would say is high to very high. It is difficult not to desire to play again with a totally different character.Lastly I would have improved a few things about the game. One problem is the terrible autosave which occurs in what seems like every other load screen. Another is the graphics, they leave something to be desired becuase of the fact it is on the Xbox. The last thing I would have done is probably added 10-15 hours to the game. Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic is an amazing game which I think would bring even non-rpg game players to the genre.

On top of that early battles are rather easy while the last couple require a speficic strategy that can make them controller-throwing difficult if you haven't figured it.Framerate was also a mixed bag.  I'm not usually one to complain about framerate but when it starts getting choppy during one the games \"Guitar Hero\"-type solos it can be irritating if it causes you to miss one.  Luckily missing a solo doesn't happen that much as executing them is fairly forgiving.Therefore when you account for all of this on top of the overly short single player campaign and what you're left with is a decidely mixed bag.  Even more so if the RTS based multi-player doesn't interest you.In short, if you're a fan of 1) Metal (and mostly retro metal at that) 2)Jack Black's brand of humor and 3) RTS-lite gameplay than this is a must buy.  I went 2 for 3 and was let down. I suppose at this newly discounted price one might overlook some of this and just give it try as the aesthetic Tim Schafer built in this game is pretty cool.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2010"}

This game has some great innovation and some horrendous flaws.Story:The story is a mix between the Matrix and Norse Mythology.  As the story began I felt like I was reading the 8th novel in a series because all sorts of epic things were happening and I had no clue what was going on.  Apparently, the Norse gods live in the matrix, fight monsters with swords and laser guns, and travel through cyber space.  My friends told me the story was awful and I really tried to like it, but I just couldn't.  The main character, Baldur is voiced by Crispin Freeman of Hellsing.  I'm a big fan of Hellsing... still couldn't get into the story.Gameplay:The gameplay basically sucks.  You use the triggers to fire your long range weapons and the right analog stick to point to the enemy that you want to attack with a melee weapon.  (sword, hammer...)  If you double tap the stick, you launch the enemy into the air and you can jump combo them or shoot them as they fall.  This is pretty fun.  However, often times, you target enemies that you don't want to target.  To make matters worse, some enemies explode or poison you.  So, you end up dying from time to time by accident.  What really breaks the game is that unless you play the Bio-Ops class, you cannot heal yourself.  That's right.  No health potions, regeneration, heal spells... nothing.  The only way to get health is from random enemy drops.  Sometimes, you can kill 30 guys and they don't drop anything.  Other times, you can kill 3 and 2 of them drop health.  This is extremely frustrating because you may be near death, and there's nothing that you can do.  There are crystals that you can destroy in the environment, that drop health, money, or weapons, but those are random as well.  With no consistent way to regain health, you end up dying repeatedly.  This is NO FUN!Death:Dying takes about 30 seconds to a minute.  An angel comes down and takes your body away.  There are times in this game where I saw the angel more than I was playing.  This was very frustrating.Economy:The economy of the game is pretty good.  You never have too much money and you need to make decisions on what weapons you want.Inventory:This game may feature the best RPG inventory system of all time.  It's incredibly easy to sell, buy, and customize your weapons and armor.  You don't have to waste hours in cities like most other RPG's.  It's all done with the Start Button and a few inventory screens.Art:The art style of the game is very cool.  A nice blend of Warhammer 40k and Norse Mythology.Camera:The camera is your friend most of the time.  However, sometimes... the camera is not your friend.  When you are in combat, it is difficult to target enemies and you often target the wrong enemy.  The camera points to that enemy allowing you to get killed from behind.  This is... no fun.RPG:You get new gear and level up quite often and that gives you a good sense of accomplishment.  However, the enemies level up with you, so most of the encounters feel exactly the same.Overall:Playing through the game once takes about 12-13 hours.  About 3 of those hours are fun.  2 of those hours are nonsensical cutscenes.  2 of those hours are spent leveling up and getting new gear.  The other 5 or 6 hours are painful.So, if you're a big fan of hack and slash games, don't mind a weird story, want to play Diablo without health potions, and know a bit about Norse mythology... pick it up.Anyone else... you've been warned.  You're in for a confusing and frustrating time.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00BGD6LMG","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew Gray \"Beezer Review\"","summary":"Really enjoyed it, finally something new.","reviewText":"In the late 90s, one of America's most infamous hackers was arrested and locked away in solitary confinement. At the time it was believed he could launch a nuclear missile by just whistling into a phone. While back then this notion may have seemed quite far-fetched, computer technology has become an integral part of everyday life, and with more devices becoming interconnected there are growing fears about what some people may be able to do if these systems were to fall into the wrong hands. Ubisoft&#8217;s latest title, Watch Dogs, takes this idea and puts players in control of a future where digital warfare is a scary place to be caught in the middle of.Set in an alternate version of Chicago, gamers take the role of a computer hacker named Aiden Pearce. Using a tool known as the Profiler, Aiden is able to hack objects within the open world of Chicago and use them to his advantage.  Because the entire city is connected -- as we all know by now because of the Watch Dogs' hype train -- using a central system called ctOS, it also gives Aiden the ability to discover personal information about other people. Furthermore, it displays the questionable access that this system has overall within the streets and homes of the city, unknowing to those living in it.The game sets itself up to play more towards a stealth approach. Throughout the world security cameras play an important role of providing a strategic view of the area and mapping your plan of attack. Because Aiden is not your typical video game bullet sponge you&#8217;ll want to avoid running into a mission with an assault rifle just gunning down enemies.Instead, slowly taking out each foe one by one is a more reliable and satisfying task with the environmental hacks you&#8217;ll have at hand. Even when driving around you can trigger a number of events to aid in your missions, like manipulating traffic lights to cause chaos at intersections, raise and lower bridges to slow down pursuers or deliver a blackout to the city and shutdown every electronic device in the area. When you successfully pull off one of these events it&#8217;s great to see the outcome as the game will normally switch to a cinematic camera to show the damage you&#8217;ve caused.There are some small touches that help make the world a little more realistic. You&#8217;ll randomly see a car accident and the people involved will jump out of the driver&#8217;s seat and engage in an angry conversation. Passers-by on the streets will recognise you from the news and, depending on your notoriety, may contact police officials to notify them of your whereabouts.Apart from the quite lengthy campaign, there is a lot of side content to explore within Chicago. In addition to this you&#8217;ll sometimes receive information about events taking place nearby as you are driving around. As you progress and complete tasks the skill system allows you to unlock a vast array of extras for Aiden ranging from new skills to weapons and vehicles.There are however a few things that really stood out as problem areas in Watch Dogs. I found Aiden Pearce to be quite a bland character; there isn&#8217;t much of a personality behind him. The story starts off quite slowly and it does not give you much of a backstory relating to who Aiden is and what his motivations for hacking are. At the beginning of the game you are given a brief flashback of Aiden&#8217;s past, but this doesn&#8217;t start to unfold more until half way through the main campaign, by this time I had lost complete interest in the character and didn&#8217;t really care about him at all.One of the most interesting directions Watch Dogs takes is with some of its online multiplayer components, borrowing the popular player invasion system that can be found in Dark Souls and Demon Souls. While roaming around the world you can be invaded by other players who have been tasked with an objective. At the same time you&#8217;ll have to try and stop them from completing their mission, which usually involves first profiling your target and eliminating them. What makes this so fun is that the person that initiates the invasion will have their appearance changed to look like an ordinary NPC; they're able to blend into the surrounding environment.The challenge for the invader is to complete their task without being found to be another player; a stealth approach is usually a key factor. This gameplay makes for some really intense situations that you don&#8217;t normally find in the course of the main game. Apart from the invasion system there are a few other multiplayer modes including online races and free roaming. This is bound to keep many players engaged after working through the main story.It&#8217;s hard not to compare Watch Dogs to Grand Theft Auto V; as the latter was one of the biggest titles of last year and also set in an open world, you can draw parallels straight away. Grand Theft Auto V does a lot of fantastic things that really build the world and the characters within it, which is something I don&#8217;t think Watch Dogs does nearly as well. The way Rockstar Games handles its storytelling, characters and missions is what puts them on a completely different level compared to other open world games.The fact that Watch Dogs has come out as second-best against the juggernaut that is the Grand Theft Auto franchise doesn't mean it's a bad game; it's quite the opposite. It&#8217;s quite a great achievement for a brand new IP to come out and be as good as it is and to also try to do some new things on such a large scale. Its multiplayer is by far one of Watch Dogs' stand out components and this is where you&#8217;ll start to see some great videos floating around online from the community as they invade your game. Watch Dogs has dozens of hours of content and will certainly keep you entertained its world and what's on offer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2014"}

Then damage numbers burnt images into my vision; had to disable those too. Needless to say, it can be fun to grind eq hoping for that small gain in power, but it's VERY repetitive grinding the same areas over and over and crafting LOTS of times to get something decent (which requires grinding for resources).Blizzard did a lot of work revamping this game and many improvements were made (I added 2 stars as a result). The eq is among the best in gaming and requires math, research, and testing to make it work with the huge variety of skills/ways to play your character.Unfortunately the work they did was to finish the game, which was only mediocre when released. This work requires pay, which will come from buying the game (again) to play as 'reaper of souls' which has more areas to grind and another character class people seem excited about.The game is simply not good enough to buy twice. Wait for a GOTY or package deal and don't pay more than current value for 1 game (around $60). Publishers need to learn that when consumers make a purchase, they expect a finished game instead of being double charged and having to roll with the punches of massive game changing patches which render some of your previous efforts a waste.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2013"}

priests, kings and titled nobility are conspicuously absent. monsters range from the comedic or whimsical (midget hobbes, demon doors and enormous trolls) to the really creepy (banshees and balverines).special praise has to go to the character of hero's unnamed dog, companion on all adventures and assist in finding treasure or warning of dangers ahead. just the motion capture work necessary to animate this character must have been a project in itself, as the dog runs, jumps, begs, gambols, fetches balls, eats, chases its tail, cowers, growls, capers, urinates, limps in pain and rests, all with remarkable realism. in fact, its movements seemed to me more varied and more lifelike than the human characters outside of the cut scenes. just having this affectionate, eager and trusting fellow spirit accompany the quests created for me a unique and unexpected emotional involvement with the game.play within this rich and complex universe combines elements of sandbox and episodes or \"quests\", which range from battling monsters to shattering obnoxious stone gargoyles. these, spewing insulting patter in an old scottish brogue, are only one of many humorous, whimsical, ironic or sardonic details of this game. nothing is ever taken completely seriously, but the levity never distracts from the involvement in play. there is a rich palette of expressions hero can use to instill fear, trust, anger or love in other characters, who can be manipulated for gifts, discounts, or favors. the management of these expressions -- and the accumulating quests, maps, transports, items, weapons, attributes, gifts, and so on -- is handled through a simple and partly automatic system of control inventories. there is none of the picky clutter of points, menus, choices, spells, lore and other trivia, or the creepy puppetry of face to face conversations and endlessly branching script choices, that makes games such as \"oblivion\" or \"fallout\" so tedious and insufferable.finally, all this provides support for moral themes, which fuse with several world simulation techniques. hero is first of all either male or female, to suit the player's sexual orientation. then hero can earn money forging weapons, pouring drinks, assassinating targets or freeing slaves; wealth accumulates with treasure and can spent on weapons, food, gifts and clothing. or hero can buy and sell property and furniture, invest in business ventures and collect rents; hero can marry and have children, set up a household and furnish it with luxury; he or she can vandalize, thieve and murder, or whore with raunchy housewives, househusbands and prostitutes. all these actions combine with the physical changes of aging to produce a character appearance that is either virtuous or dissolute. the final task of the narrative is a moral choice between sacrifice, love and wealth, and once made, the player is returned to the fantasy world to finish smashing gargoyles or take up remaining quests.special mention has to be made of the music, which is masterfully crafted -- tuneful and pleasantly orchestrated, it doesn't stale with repetition. the aural design matches the different environments or task moods perfectly. and finally the voice acting, from the sorceress theresa (zoe wanamaker) and the heros hammer and reaver to the many citizens and yes, that barking dog, are perfectly realized.i had no problem with major bugs, such as the game crashing or refusing to save progress as described in the negative reviews posted here. however i played on an xbox 360 purchased six months ago: possibly the game does not play well on older consoles. i did encounter some minor a.i./scene mapping bugs (people walking through furniture, failing to yield gifts, etc.), and the game can be fussy about the spatial orientation of hero necessary to produce object options (open treasure, leap from a ledge, address a citizen, etc.). but for a game this long, rich and complex, the technical integrity is really remarkable.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2008"}

Lerch","summary":"Pretty graphics, fun game, but nothing you haven't really played before","reviewText":"Ryse is a very pretty, very smooth running, graphical feat. Underlying the pretty graphics, there is a fun but kind of redundant set of game play beneath those pretty graphics.At the heart of the game is a Dynasty Warriors type of thing playing out, with a lot more strategy and timing to your attacks.It's also a very bloody game.When you first start pushing out multihit combos, on multiple enemies, you start to get this feeling of fun and over the top theatrics, which just adds to the fun you have with the game.One issue I do have is that the campaign is pretty short. If you buy this for the single player experience, be prepared to put in 8-10 hours for finishing the game, and if you play through again on a higher difficulty you are probably looking at 14 hours total. The game keeps it fun, so playing that long doesn't feel like a chore, but it will definitely wear off.Overall Ryse is a good game, that shows off the starting potential of a game system years in the making and hopefully years of support to come.

Already a huge hit in Japan, the game ramps you up and then wages an all-out war.

Easy to get into, and deceptively deep. Advance Wars is strategy at its best. What makes it so special? First, the graphics are great. The animations are instant gratification when a well-timed attack turns the tide of battle, help you visualize battle results in several ways so you know exactly how your units are doing. Second, the options for multiplayer are excellent. Because the game is turn based, 4 players can play together even on only one system. Grab a friend, and enjoy the anticipation of having the system handed back to you and seeing your opponent smirk as you stumble into their trap (playing on seperate systems can be done, but isn't nearly as fun).The most important facet of this game is depth. Fog of War (where parts of the map your units can't see are blacked out) makes for intensity- you're always trying to calculate what forest or hilltop might contain enemy units waiting for you. The basics of troop movements give way to incredible strategy (delay the enemy tank by sacrifing your troops, or retreat and lure the tank into range of your artillery?). Each CO is completely unique (Max has stronger tanks, but weaker artillery. Sami has tougher troops, but weaker vehicles) and thier individual powers add an extra level of depth to the process.Advance Wars is an amazing game for singleplayer action. Add in a full-featured map creator, a ton of unlockable COs, and the wealth of options, and this is one of the best multiplayer games on the GameBoy. A must-have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2004"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K898","description":"","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"May just give City of Heroes a run for the money!","reviewText":"DC Universe Online 1st ImpressionsSo, finally after a delay, DC Universe Online is out and not with a few hiccups but it's common with MMOs to have a few at launch so just be prepared.  The biggest issue is, depending on your internet connection, you may want to find other things to do while it installs. For the PS3 using FiOS, it took almost an hour and a half start to finish for the downloads to install. One of my other friends using DSL took almost 3 hours to complete.Before I really get into this I want to make clear that most of the comparisons I make of this game will be with City of Heroes and please understand too, that I haven't played it in almost 5 years but that's where I can base my closest experiences to. Also, I put about a good 7 hours into this game so please don't take this as a final review but I just want to give an impression for those that are on the fence about getting this game.It's been a really long while since I have played any MMOs with the last one being Guild Wars and I even gave a shot at WoW but it just couldn't keep me interested long enough to stay in it. But DCUO seems like the game I could get into and maybe stay in until Marvel comes up with something.Once the install completes you are ready to begin. In most ways, the DCUO character creation seems to be a bit more robust that CoH was when I played it. Some will find themselves either spending a lot of time trying to get their one character just right or creating multiple characters. I believe you are allowed up to 8 characters per server and if you really try hard enough for those of you Marvel fanboys you can create some good analogues of your favorites. I did one based on the Black Panther which was easy and I saw someone do something that looked like Iron Man. With a little know how you can do some basic X men characters and the like BUT since this is a DC game, why do that? Another good thing is that there are random templates you can use to generate ready made characters based off of the main heroes and villains even with similar costumes.Once you have finished your characters, you are ready to go. One thing I did like is that if you want to get thru cut scenes, you can but if it's your first time seeing them, they are a joy to watch as it really sets the stage for the game that you are playing. Jim lee as always has amazing panels that you see throughout and it really gets you in the mood to play.As your game starts, you play through in a soloed instance where you are guaranteed your first 3 levels and you try to escape Brainiac's ship. In this you find out how you got these powers and why he is invading. This level is also used to let you get a feel for your character and their abilities as well as the controls which I must say for a console game are pretty ok but more on that later.  The one main thing to keep in mind as with most MMOs , once you build your character, it's really difficult to go back in and respect them and by using the introductory levels you get to see if what you built is what you want to use and if you do finish and are unsatisfied with your build, at least all you have wasted is about 20 minutes of playtime without being thrust into the larger game world with everyone else...so yes CHARACTER BUILD MEANS EVERYTHING.Once you get into the larger world, you have access to missions, vendors, even the Watchtower. You can spend time just wandering around seeing all of these things before you head out to start doing missions.Now since my hero's mentor is Batman, my starting world is Gotham so once I step out of the police station, you get to see Gotham in all of its gritty glory. You will see some pieces that looks like it was taken from the Dark Knight and even some iconic points from the comics, like Crime Alley.So now that you are out in the main world itself, how does it handle? Again, this comes down into how you built your character.  Now that you have all this open space, what can you do? Well, let me start with making one of my biggest CoH comparisons: The powers that you start off with. I remember when I played CoH, I believe that you had to get at least 10 levels under your belt before you got the ability to fly, sprint, jump, etc. It made you work even harder to get it because it could piss you off seeing other fly overhead and you are stuck on the ground trying to walk to your checkpoint. Well in DCUO, you have the ability to choose from the start how you want to get around and not only that, you can \"adhere\" to any surface, climb up anything imaginable and go anywhere in your realm at the start which to me adds to the fun of the game...your initial powers do not limit you.Another aspect that DCUO has done is that from the start you can CHOOSE to be a hero or a villain.  It doesn't take another game to do this!  And each faction has its own missions!  For instance, in Gotham, the heroes are trying to stop the Scarecrow, so what do you think the villains are doing? However the thing to keep in mind is that most of this is PVE and everyone has their own set of missions. That brings up another good point is that you will always have tons of missions to do from the start and in some that are instanced only to you and your guild (or whatever they will be called in this game) you can expect appearances in some areas by DCU characters.  Even early on in your start stage, you get a Superman sighting.With all this variety that you get you will never lack for action. There have been some MMOs I have played over the years where it seemed like you had to wander around and look for trouble but not here. Almost every inch of Gotham is a hotspot and even as you pass through or fly over a section you are almost always tempted to drop in on the action. Initially I was dismayed at the fact that it seemed like it was a free for all as everyone was making a mad dash to fight an enemy and scrambling to the next but the respawns for the enemies seem plentiful early on so you will always have something to fight even if someone else steals your kill, This game feels and plays a bit more like Marvel Ultimate Alliance and less like WoW. Which also reminds me, and you can take this in a few ways, the penalty on death is not as severe as I have seen in many MMOs, as a matter of fact thus far, it's not really severe at all. I will say that if you have seen differently, please correct me, but in CoH what made that game hard sometimes is when you died, you had to pay a `death tax' on the leveling that you had which at times made your grind much, much longer, meaning there were times that you were gaining  as much EXP to play back for a death that you had which could really slow down your game and this was part of why I stopped playing.And with all of the fighting and saving that day that you will have going on, so far it's pretty quick to level up. With no effort at all I have already seen some who have reached level 15 and higher and I know just for the short time that I have played, I have reached level 7 and still have a few more characters I want to try out.This brings me to my concerns that I have with the game. The level cap is 30. What does Sony plan to do to keep this game fresh after you have hit the cap because what I have heard from the beta testing you can hit that cap pretty fast. How long will it be before the cap is lifted higher so that you don't lose a lot of the crowd that Sony hopes to take away from WoW and CoH? Another issue that I have is some of the gameplay graphical glitches. While that game does indeed look very nice, I notice that as I am supposed to have a character that climbs, in many cases when he hits a wall, instead of him climbing the wall, he actually WALKS up the wall and that sometimes takes away from the immersive-ness of the game. For a console game, the controls handle themselves pretty well although I think the flying aspect could be handled a bit better. It takes a while to get used to it but it works. Your hotkeys are pretty much set and I have yet to find a way to change this if any and this may also discourage some vet MMO players but to me after awhile it becomes 2nd nature. Also, so far, I have not had a problem with lag. A lot of people will be discouraged with the price. I will agree 60 bucks and 15 dollar a month subscription is a lot to pay for an MMO that so far seemingly doesn't have the depth of say, your WoW or Guild Wars but I think in part, Sony hopes to get that crowd who doesn't want to be bogged down with all the minutiae of all of the 2ndary and tertiary character play of your WoW games and so forth. It's a straight forward button masher and if this is what you like, then this is for you. This may turn a lot of people off. One other thing that so far, my friends and I have had difficulty with is trying to find each other in the game.  Something we plan on taking care of once we all make the time to do so and in game chat? Without a dedicated keyboard, you can forget about it! I really would like to see if there is a way to do voice chat so we won't have to worry about typing as you play because there really isn't a lot of downtime that you have to type to each other.To conclude, DCU Online is going to be a game that if you are a fan of comics and have a little extra to invest in, you will jump right in. I think because now that one of the Big Two has an MMO out, this may start pulling that CoH crowd away to play a game to play in a Universe that many have waited for.  Anyone sitting on the fence, I would strongly advise waiting for more reviews before getting this game because this can easily be $60 bucks gone and no way to take it back to your retailer. You do get 30 days of free play before you get on a monthly fee schedule. So far, my friends and I are enjoying this game on the PS3 and I do like that even from the start you do feel that you are doing your part to shape the DC Universe so if you can get past the huge download time and have no problems with some button mashing, you may just enjoy this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0037LTTRO","description":"","reviewerName":"Mr. Kirk J. Wagstaff \"kirkwuk\"","summary":"Fun for fans of Advanced Warfighter","reviewText":"Newer fans to the Ghost Recon series would be amused by the style of the original Ghost Recon. Twelve years ago, Tom Clancy was simply a war novelist venturing past his first gaming franchise; Rainbow Six. GR was a simple squad-based shooter, the cover of which resembled a Choose Your Own Adventure book. More amusing would be the gameplay itself, which modern gamers would associate more with rambling than shooter. Over the years, the sequels got less-and-less simulation-like, such as Advanced Warfighter in the mid-00's. The latest addition to Ghost Recon bears no resemblance to 2001's classic. Future Soldier is worlds away from the PC days of yesteryear.Future Soldier focusses on advanced technology and gadgets, the most of which you may have seen before in previous titles, with some new toys. These consist of a predator-like cloaking system which promises the user ghost-like capabilities to stealthily manoeuvre enemy territory completely unseen. Hours of guaranteed fun, but you can't help feel like you're cheating, as NPC's only suspect anything if they're in close proximity. The UAV is back in more mobile form (the quad-rotor) - this device has been upgraded to be used as a mobile robot that can eject short out electrics, useful for breaking electric fans.Linearity is what hurts the most. If Advanced Warfighter felt claustrophobic, Future Soldier feels like you're treading the line on a leash, like a puppy out on his first walk. Move anywhere the game doesn't want you to, and a \"losing signal\" message threatens to end the game. It's a convenient mechanism for the developers to show you only what they want you to see. It doesn't hurt the game too much, but it sure gives the impression the devs are just plain lazy.A worrying trend in this game is how many \"eXpLoZionzzz\" there are. In one mission, you control a tank-like vehicle which is used to eject infinite quantities of missiles to targets. If this isn't bad enough, in quieter moments, conveniently placed explosive barrels litter the landscape next to groups of soldiers. Using so many explosions and missiles on humans, makes Future Soldier feel not just arcade-like, but also more Angry Birds than squad-shooter. Make as much carnage as possible to kill the bad guys! This feels unlike Ghost Recon, and moments like these make this production feel just like so many other games you've all seen and played before.Flaws-aside, Future Soldier is a good game. For one, the graphics are some of the best this tech has seen. The mission in the countryside in particular, is beautifully crafted and rich in detail. Controls handle extremely well, using a similar mechanic to Gears Of War, which is intuitive and second-nature within minutes.Overall, Future Soldier is a satisfying game which provides plenty of fun and action. However, the single-player is a bit short, and you can't help but feel something's missing. Tracking enemies through your HUD and being able to see their exact positions and what they're doing feels cheap somewhat. I missed not knowing what was round the corner, and knowing I could thrown a grenade which told me exactly where everyone was became too tempting. There were a few ingenious ideas with the levels which I haven't seen much of before; eg one where you venture back to the same places with different threats, and a sequence where you find yourself behind enemy lines and take them stealthily from behind. However, I found the slow nature of the game interrupting me from the action and producing cut-scenes and sections where you could only walk (ala Gears of War) irritating.Overall, I give Future Soldier 3/5 and can recommend it to fans of Advanced Warfighter.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2013"}

Hand-to-hand combat is the order of the day and that's the way this game plays from start to finish. Whilst it's true the game does introducing projectile weapons, they're simply a \"bonus\" where you don't have to get too up close and personal to devour the enraged bums. Guns run out of ammo very quickly and take you back to your melee roots.Condemned is an ingenious mix of crime and the supernatural, whose borders are never fully realized throughout this game. The character you play imagines macabre beasts and nightmares involved with tracking a criminal. You are never clear on whether what you're seeing is a metaphor or reality. In execution this works really well. The levels in the game mostly have you walking around derelict buildings and being attacked by bums. Atmosphere is always very tense, not for one second do you feel utterly safe. I found myself closing doors I'd been through to ensure I would hear a sound if anyone was after me. I was very careful as to not bump into anything, as the engines excellent physics are enough to make you more anxious of an attack.The interface and weapon system are clunky on purpose - switching weapons and devices feels realistic and adds extra tension to an already unnerving game. This isn't Call Of Duty; switching is slow as to not give players an advantage over his enemies. This makes those tense fights that bit tougher and more rewarding.The closing moments of this game are very tense and grueling. When it was finally over I breathed a sigh of relief.Condemned is a brilliant game not just for the gameplay but also the unique story and the characters involved. It revolves around a grand conspiracy theory and an \"inside job\" in the police force regarding a mystery killer, and the lengths your character will go to solve it all.9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"Eric Jacobs \"ESJBond007\"","summary":"Dantes Medieval Vision of HELL","reviewText":"Have you ever wondered what hell might look like? Dante's Inferno offers an incredibly vivid and detailed hypothesis. The game is based on the 14th-century Italian poem by Dante Alighieri, but Dante never could have imagined a hell this visually captivating. The walls themselves crawl with the bodies of the damned, other lost souls intermitently rain from the sky burning in torturous flames. In the distance, great columns of souls can be seen marching along monolithic causeways. The air is acrid with smoke and charred flesh, pierced by screams, fitful sparks and motes of ash. Each of the nine circles is here, along with the river Acheron and Limbo, and each setting is distinctive and fiendishly impressive. Through it all Vergil is your guide, just as in the poem.The gameplay is fluid and satisfying, with Dante boasting an array of combos with either his scythe, stolen from Death himself, or his cross that Beatrice gave to him. There are a variety of trinkets to collect - from the 30 pieces of silver received in ramsom by Judas to dozens of relics that Dante can equip to enhance his abilities.Dante attempts to rescue his lover Beatrice from the clutches of the Damned.along the way, Dante encounters many Lost Souls from various historical and mythological points in history,the player's interaction with these characters is not merely discourse, however, as Dante holds the power to either absolve these Lost Souls of the sins which condemned them to Hell, or hand down the ultimate Punishment instead. I consider this to be a brilliant mechanic that serves to immerse the player in a very personal manner, as it tends to compel the player to actually reflect on his/her own views of sin and punishment before deciding a Lost Soul's ultimate fate. Very well-executed.I had very high hopes for this title, but it has far exceeded even those. This game is one of the best I have ever played.Do your self a favor and BUY DANTE'S INFERNO!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2010"}

I got more to tell you with the story mode. The story has a good catch or good attention to make to play more. The thing I don't get is that cinematic scenes had great graphics but when it goes to game play, the graphics look pretty distant. For me, I think they improve the graphics a lot than the first Medal of Honor. The story was well done. The game play got better. Love the sound when you aim and the new technique to peek out. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM OF ALL in the single player mode was the enemies along with the AI teammates. All the enemies will be shooting at you. Not your teammates. JUST YOU! Your teammates will just stay back and watch you clear the area. The breach mode options are such a waste. After pressing X to breach, they give choices such as break down the door knob and open the door and then throw a flash bang, or kick down the door and then throw a flash bang. After breach, of course you will go into slow-motion to kill the enemies. You must do it quick before they aim at YOU. Now to talk more about the story. If you seen Act of Valor, you will know that this game story is kind of related to the movie. I didn't really like the movie due to lack of action. I say that Medal of Honor Warfighter had a better story than the movie. The explosives was also a great improvement. The sound of the explosion was like real for me. Overall, this game was very intense to play and great movement of game play.Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Sounds: 9/10Story: 9/10Weapons: 9/10There are just some minor problems in the game.

I put in 20 hours to finish the story and that's with barely any sidetracking.  I usually prefer games that are 6-8 hours in length so this game was off the beaten path for me.  It has been described as a Japanese GTA, but it plays nothing like it. I really hate GTA or Saint's Row or RDR types of games, but I loved this so if you're in the same boat, you can give this a try.  This is a brawler at it's core with the silliness that can be attributed to Japanese style games.  The fighting is pretty easy for the most part aside from some boss battles, but you can load up on health packs beforehand.  The fighting does get repetitious because you'll be spamming the same moves throughout the game, but the ability to play as 4 protagonists does break up the monotony a bit.  Another reviewer mentioned that the cutscenes are long and cannot be bypassed so if the story doesn't capture you from the beginning, then you'd be best served to move on to something else.  Best way to tell if you'll like this game is to watch some combat videos online, because much of the game will be just that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2012"}

It uses it's theme well, adding Metroid elements to a pinball game flawlessy. The game is fun and playable, it is very easy to pick up and play but it is very hard to master, just like any good pinball game should be. The theme for this game is also very clever and it fits the setting, it is not just a silly gimmick. After all Samus armor can turn into a ball, that is a big part of the normal Metroid games so why not take that and turn it into pinball.In this game you do everything you would do in a normal pinball game, hit targets for points, flipper your ball, gather bonuses and so on, but you also fight bosses, exterminate aliens who wander around the board trying to eat your balls and so on. The science fiction elements are great and makes this a sure hit with both Metroid and regular science fiction fans. Sure the game is cheesy, but that is part of the charm.This game is a little different, it is well executed, it gives you the classic pinball feeling while at the same time allowing you to do things you could never do on a real pinball table, unless you where living in a science fiction world that is :P This game is full of charm and space adventure goodness.The game's controls are good, the graphics are rather ok. I am not that pleased with the sound effects, they get a bit bland at times but the music is great. All around this is a solid title and one that I would gladly recommend.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2010"}

WHY CANT I JUST BUY THE ABILITY AND HAVE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO SEARCH FOR CRAP IM NOT INTERESTED IN?????? Time i just do not have and the powers make the game too easy Anyway so it doesnt even matter.i think this game could have been INCREDIBLE if they made each area in the city something like Skyrim or Fable where each person Lives in that section of the city and other NPC's constantly interact with each section....maybe you could defend a section from random bandit attacks or fight off guards??? a day/night cycle????

However, within the first week, my Kinect died and the games stopped being fun.  My wife went out of her way to buy me a PS4 in time for Christmas (found the last one in stock at gamestop the friday before christmas).  I immediately was a fan and placed myself officially back into the Sony camp.  The controller feels more natural and easier to use the triggers, bumpers and joy sticks.  Battlefield 4 and Lego Marvel are the only games I played on both X1 and PS4....and both are better on PS4.  Lego Marvel doesn't have a graphics difference; but the controls are easier to use as well as maneuvering the camera on ps4.  Battlefield 4 is a world of difference.  It is sooooo much better on ps4.  My biggest gripe about it on the Microsoft consoles were that the water looked like mercury instead of a natural water.  You can really, really tell the 60 frames per second and see the higher definition with stuff like vehicle textures, the grass/dirt ground and even the skies.The PS4 itself has an amazing and easy to use UI.  Xbox one is all in one place, PS4 is organized and you can easily access your friends menu, join and leave parties, send messages, settings, browse web and surf the PS store.  Not to mention that through PS Plus you get some amazing games like Contrast and Resogun (probably the most fun i've had on the console).  You need to play this to enjoy it (as a lot of people are taking sides without playing one console or the other).  Owning both, I can say that I enjoy the PS4 much, much, much better.

{"product_name":"B000095ZH6","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Solid, horrific fun","reviewText":"The Suffering, Midway's much hyped about survival horror game, is solid, horrific fun from beginning to end.  Playing as death row inmate Torque, the newest resident of an island prison, he is one of the few survivors of an attack by some horrific monsters in the prison.  From then on, you take on a horde of ghastly creatures, while finding a few surviving inmates and guards as well; your choices determine one of the game's three different endings depending on your actions.  Torque has plenty of different weapons to his disposal, and as his insanity meter rises, he can transform into his monstrous alter-ego.  Besides a bit of a sloppy frame rate and some minor control and camera issues, The Suffering is a fun game, and does offer some replay value with the three different endings.  It offers less on puzzle elements and more on bloody action than other games in the genre, which can be both good and bad depending on the gamer.  Besides it's third person perspective, the game can also be played in a first person perspective, but that is practically useless when you have to see if something is attacking you from behind.  The monsters are varied, albeit repetitive, and are designed reasonably well, while the graphics are solid PS2 fare.  The sound is where The Suffering shines; with plenty of shrieks, screams, and everything else that makes survival horror games enjoyable.  Be warned however, the game earns it's Mature rating as it is exceptionally violent and contains some of the harshest language to ever be found in a game (then again, considering this is a game revolving around prison inmates, is that a surprise?), but despite it's shortcomings, The Suffering is worth checking out for fans of the genre.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2004"}

For reasons beyond my control I was without internet for almost a month and there was no way to play this *single player* game for which I paid full money. I understand the reasons behind blizzard making gamers to log online but there should be a option for at least a few offline play-throughs and than the player must log online to renew that option. This is a single player game not a multi-player or MMO that player must always be online. As of now this just rewards the pirates and penalizes honest paying gamers.*Over my long gaming career I have had the most enjoyable experience playing Blizzard games by far. From Warcraft series to World of Warcraft to Diablo to Starcraft. Though there have been occasional hiccups mostly with World of Warcraft like the latest expansion etc.(didn't like it much from under-whelming Monk Class to Asian themed story-line of the recent expansion) but other than that Blizzard single players games are star-studded gems and StarCraft 2 is no exception. Having played the original StarCraft so many years ago, I find SC2 to be a worthy sequel well worth the wait and a evolution of the franchise while keeping steadfast to the game core mechanics.Pretty much SC2 sticks to the traditional mechanics of the RTS genre but the evolution is in the way each mission handles in a completely unique way. Every new mission requires new tactics and you have to come up with innovative strategies to progress while the game requires you to think and to keep on thinking. Combine that with great cut-scenes, conversation options with characters, your own ship to call home and a engrossing story-line which becomes epic and grander in scale as the game progresses make this game a sure-fire winner and among the best of the RTS genre.Highly recommended and looking forward to playing the expansion Heart of the swarm..","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2013"}

Mario has been kidnapped by King Boo and you must find and rescue him in the mansion.Gameplay: Action/Adventure game. You go through a mansion trying to turn on the light in each room by trapping ghosts in your Poltergust 3,000 (a vacuum). Your vacuum has 2 options, suck and blow. When trying to capture ghosts, they have a number on them and you must get that number down to zero before they will be sucked in. Once a ghosts is in the vacuum's stream (first by stunning them with the flashlight), you need to rotate the control stick to the opposite way the ghost is facing. Most of the main ghosts you have to discover a way to startle them to start the process. It may be opening a window, catching them when they are distracted, rocking a chair, etc. Each has a special way to take them down and it is a lot of fun trying to figure it out. You also get special vacuum powers later on such as fire, water, and ice. Each is used to clear certain rooms in the game. To continue through the mansion, you must find keys to unlock new doors. Once a key is found, you can check the map to see what door it opens. You also have the ability to scan ghosts to see a hint at their weakness. As you travel through the mansion, you will also get a boo meter in the game that helps track down the boos. You can't get into the last room without trapping all the boos first. The boos have a number by them and you have to follow them room to room until you capture them.Conclusion: Graphics are good for the GameCube. Controls are easy. The game is probably 3-5 hours. It was longer than I thought and a few of the ghosts are pretty tough to capture/figure out. Worth getting if you still have a GameCube or even a Wii since the Wii will play EVERY GameCube title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2011"}

Xtreme 2 is the sequel to Xtreme Beach Volleyball for the original Xbox. Everything is in tact, with a few additions. The consists of 6 mini-games, and 5 casino games, but that's not enough to save this simple-minded game.The whole point of the game is to play mini-games with other DoA ladies and earn their trust and friendship and this is harder than it seems. The game plays similar to a Japanese dating sim game, and it can take forever to buy a lot of the items, and learn how to become friends with these lovely ladies. You have to figure out what each lady likes, loves, and hates and send them gifts accordingly. All you get is a visual guide for each lady with pictures of what they like, but this doesn't help much. After you spend a whole two weeks at New Zack Island you pretty much give up trying to gain trust and friendship since it's so hard to figure out without some in-depth guide. After a tries you end up just playing the mini-games and ogling the scantily clad women lying around, and even dancing.The mini-games are the most fun of the game with pool hopping, flag running, beach volleyball, jet skiing, and water sliding. Pool hopping consists of pressing the buttons according to what is shown on the floaties. This game tends to be very hard since it requires precise timing. Flag running is pretty simple, but the best game is probably volleyball. It has tight mechanics and controls and can be a blast to play. Jet skiing is very mundane since it's the same track over and over again, however, the water effects are nice and doing tricks on the ski can be fun. Water sliding is the hardest game of them all since it's so hard to stay on the slide and after you fall off you don't get another try. After you earn enough money from playing mini-games you can purchase a camera and take sexy photos of the ladies, and view them later in your album.The casino is the second major part of the game that lets you really earn some bucks. All the games are pretty self-explanatory, roulette tends to be the most intense, but you can lose all your money in one go if you're not careful so watch how you spend your money. The casino is all in 3D so it's nice to view, but I wish you could walk around in it and see all your DoA lady friends playing in there as well. When you earn enough money you can go buy stuff at the store to give your lady friends or yourself.The game really has no purpose except to ogle your favorite DoA girls and trying to buy the skimpiest bikini for them. The graphics are great and everything jiggles in all the right places. The audio is pretty mundane with Japanese audio tracks to cover the horrible English voice actresses. The game isn't serious, but it could be so much more, and I just hope DoA Xtreme 3 becomes more deep and involved. I just wish there would have been more interaction, and all the load times don't help either. The game is just to hard to figure out with the whole dating sim thing going on so just sit back and enjoy the women and mini-games. The game will make you choke your chicken for sure, so DoA fan boys (girls?) should pick this game up and enjoy it's simplicity.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Rygar debuted on the NES, and then died.  For almost 20 years the game lied in wait for a sequel and Tecmo eventually delivered, in what is an example of a Badass Character for a Badass system.The story of Rygar revolves around tha argonian gladiator who at his awards ceremony is attacked by the TItans, evil beings that in some ways look human, but have supernatural abilites.  The princess is kidnapped and Rygar is thrust deep into the earth.  The gods grant him the gift of the diskarmour and from there the game begins.The diskarmour is probably the most badass weapon ever created.  It is basically a spiked yo-yo that you can use to create some wicked attacks with (and later summon creatures).  Although for some creatures only minor combos need apply.  But that is not the only thing that seperates this from the average action game.  The ability to destroy literally almost every thing you see.

The load times!  Saving is rather brief, but load times of saved games and area changes almost warrants a book to read.  Accidentally running to an 'area change' line almost makes you consider restarting the Xbox as it may be shorter than two area change load times.3.  General bugs, which are hysterical at times.

I Mean Guitar Hero Was A Good Game!","reviewText":"Ever heard of Beatmania?  Probably not.  Beatmania is a Japanese game where you hit buttons on a board and use a turntable to scratch with.  It was first created in 1997 when Konami started their music game campaign in Japan, taking arcades by storm.  The \"notes\" had to be in a timely order with what was on the screen.Fast forward to 2005, and you have Guitar Hero.  A game where you pick up a plastic guitar and strum to the modern and classic riffs of guitar bands. You had to play the \"notes\" in timely order of what was shown on the screen.Guitar Hero is \"cool\" (despite the 6-year-old looking plastic guitar) because of the music. In terms of innovation or orginality, there is none.  Guitar Hero is exactly the same game that Beatmania is, but it has different music.  The scoring system is the same, the level progression, even the breaks in the song if you screw up the riffs are the same as Beatmania.  The only difference is you use a plastic guitar, while with Beatmania you hit big buttons on a board to annoying J-pop songs.Dave Chappelle said it best when he told his audience white people relate to electric guitar.  This is exactly why Guitar Hero is so popular in North America right now.  Red Octane simply took Beatmania, and made it for white people to enjoy. The music drives people to play this game, and the licensing will get everyone from a metalhead to a goth-emo kid wishing they were in a band after playing.  This game will be a blast to play if you like or ever liked rock music.If Konami never released their music/dance games, Red Octane would be out of business.  I think this game is fun for what it's worth, but in terms of innovation, I'd give it a zero. I endured listening to j-pop on Beatmania, so I'm glad Red Octane made something worth playing for people in the states.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2006"}

Now Lucas Arts has given us the gift of LEGO Indiana Jones (LIJ).  Is it as good as the previous LEGO entries?No.  Don't get me wrong, I love this game, but it's not as good as LEGO Star Wars.  First of all, I really don't think Indiana Jones was the greatest choice for a LEGO game.  One of the many great features of the first game was that all of the characters were cool and fun to play as, but in LIJ, the only character I wanted to play as was Indy.  The other characters didn't have cool moves like him.  There just aren't enough characters in the films for a videogame.  Also, all of the good scenes of the movies are the worst to play, mostly because the vehicle scenes were poorly constructed.  The boulder chase was done horribly!  Along with LEGO Star Wars, this game is much too short.  I also wish they included the fourth movie.  When I go home after seeing Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (which by the way was great), I want to play the game for it, not just the first three!!  Adding that movie would include many more characters, which is needed.On a positive note, LIJ does a great job of following the movies.  It still has the fun LEGO gameplay, but brings some new things like riding in vehicles.  Now you can find and use items in the levels like shovels (to dig up treasure.$$!), wrenches (to fix broken machines), guns, and books (to translate ancient writing).  The levels are fun and exciting, and the graphics look great.  The worlds are very detailed and remind me a lot of Indiana Jones, my favorie action/adventure movie series.  The controls are tight.  If you don't like the motion controls, button controls are an alternate option, which is awesome.  The levels are much harder and longer than LEGO Star Wars, but getting a True Adventurer in each level is easier, so it balances out well.  True Adeventurer requires you to collect LEGO bolts, which can be found by smahing things or going on ledges and such.  Smashing stuff is really fun.  The gameplay is you run through levels based on the first three IJ movies and you have to get to the end by jumping on platforms, fighting enemies, solving a few puzzles, and a few more things depending on the level.  Once you complete it, you get to see a hilarious cutscene which unwraps another piece of the plot, which follows the movies extremely well.  I thought the jumping was done very poorly, because the camera isn't always there.  One other complaint that I have is that most of your enemies have a gun, and many times you die because some of the characters are limited to close range only.  There is no way to block bullets coming at you.  However, being able to collect weapons they drop and using anything you can find as a weapon helps this problem a little bit.  Another great feature in this game is that you can watch cutscenes over and over again in Barnett College (The college is similar to Dexter's Diner).  The music is great and is taken right from the movies.  The drop in/drop out co-op mode is very fun and cool.  The controls and gameplay are so simple that any one can start playing.  The backrounds look good graphic wise, but the LEGO characters don't.  Some glitches made me have to start the level over again.  On that note, the Xbox 360 version is probably more worth the money.  Any IJ fan will LOVE this game and should buy it, while it is worth a rental for others who are interested.  Two thumbs up from the Ultimate Gamer!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00008URUA","description":"Join Yuna in mission-based, non-linear gameplay, as she and her companions travel across Spira in this epic Final Fantasy adventure.","reviewerName":"GintaxAlvissforever","summary":"Still a Fun Final Fantasy Game","reviewText":"Given the Final Fantasy fanbase, we all know how broken it is to the point everyone fights over which is the best Final Fantasy. People tend to put this game as one of the worse Final Fantasy games made Is it really the worse Final Fantasy game though? No. And I'll try to explain it here as best as I can (since I still can't understand the controversy with this game. Then again, I'll never understand this fanbase like how I don't want to understand the Sonic fanbase).Story: Taking place after Final Fantasy X, Yuna is now the main character. She's no longer the Summoner though. Free from her role, she decides to be a sphere hunter with her cousin Rikku. They are joined by Paine and they form a group with other people called the Gullwings. Yuna's mission though is to find Tidus after the end of Final Fantasy X. This is pretty much the main plot but adding the fact that Yuna has to save the world again as there are other problems going on with the people and another conspiracy that is planning to happen. I think the story is inferior to the original X story HOWEVER, this is a great way to pick up after X. Without Sin, people don't live in fear and without fear, people can live on happily and fight over something else.Characters: People's major complaint was how Yuna's personality went 180. Let me tell you know that a few years can change people and at the end of X, Yuna was breaking out of her shell. Why continue living the life of a summoner when she can be someone else and live life to the fullest? The other characters also have to move on with their lives. Rikku is more chirpy now that the discrimination against her race isn't as bad as it was in X. Kimhari has to rebuild the Ronso Tribe again. Wakka and Lulu are married and have to prepare for a family again. So everyone is being developed. This game also introduces new characters of course like Paine so it wasn't just the old cast. So the change in her character is good because they cannot be the same after the incident with Sin.Gameplay: The gameplay is the highlight for me of this game. The battle system isn't turn base now. What you do instead is like in the previous FF games where events go on when you're inputting commands (but you're still going to be standing there) so battles are very fast. What's great is that with the dress sphere system, you can change the way you attack. Don't want Yuna to be the gunner by default? Switch to dancer or vice versa. I think the dress spheres is a beautiful aspect of the game and gives you many ways to play and you'll be choosing which one suits each girl. Now alas some outfits do come off as being fanservice based but I personally thought that Yuna looked pretty as a songstress/lady luck and didn't think of the skin exposure as a little kid. I think the downside is equipping weapons though. Because you focus mainly on dressphere, equipping items are practically worthless given how each dressphere gives you a standard move anyway. Another downside is how Yuna got rid of her summons to be mighty powerful but this is for plot related reasons.Music: Still think the music is one of the best (but it's Final Fantasy). Music is actually a big part of the plot which is why the music has to be top notch. 1000 Words is a powerful song regardless if you don't like the game or not. Very meaningful and deep. Not the crap we get nowadays that is dubbed music.So overall, I give this game a 4/5. In honesty, the only Final Fantasy game I can give a 5 star rating is IX (I'll review that in the future), but this is a good game in its merit and it didn't drop in quality at all. Since the game is cheap now, I would suggest to buy it after you beat X so you won't get confused with the story like I did (I got this game first before X...)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2013"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

The combat system is really neat and unique, despite having to give up control over the minutia completely. I don't really like having to try to switch paradigms lightning fast, and I really don't like that you can't build one set of paradigms that works at least reasonably well for the whole game. But if you're underprepared for a fight - which you will be if your paradigms are wrong - you can always back out to just before the fight and try again through the \"retry\" option, which something all games should have instead of sucking out untold hours of your life by kicking you back to your last save.The story is great, and the voice acting superb. The scenery is quite possibly the most beautiful, most engaging and expansive world I've ever seen in a game. However, I'm a perfectionist and a completionist, and getting that perfect 1000 gamer points is a chore.There are a lot of achievements that you can't hope to get until after you beat the game the first time. Once you do so, you get the option of \"saving\" which puts your party at the save location just before the final boss. This also unlocks certain areas and character abilities you couldn't get to before, and gives you a teleporter to an area where you can level up and collect money and such to power up your weapons. You'll need to do this to get the \"item collector\" achievement. It's not a lot of gamer points, but it costs the most amount of time of any achievement in any game I've ever played. You can beat the game in ~60 hours or so of straightforward, engaging play. Getting together the gil to upgrade all of your equipment takes another 60~100 hours after that, depending on how lucky you are with the rare enemy drops. Getting gil in this game is a serious chore of grinding because enemies don't drop that much stuff and what they do drop is an ittybitty fraction of what stuff costs in the shops. The word \"grind\" should never, ever be used in a game that isn't a MMORPG. And when that last achievement pops, it will give you a great sense of satisfaction. But it will be from a sense of accomplishment rather than from pure enjoyment, which is a bad thing for something that calls itself a \"game\".But don't let that ruin it for you. The game itself is a lot of fun and, like I said, very pretty.

Rather than introducing a lot of new features, Civilization IV tends to stick with the tried-and-true aspects of the series.Those familiar with the series will recognize the gameplay. The player takes the role of a civilization - one of many real-world empires, such as the English, the Greeks, or the Japanese.  The game is turn-based, with each unit moving a certain distance - and getting a certain amount done - each day. The focus is on infrastructure as much as warfare, with most of the units having to do with building cities or maintaining the land around them. Settlers build cities, which serve as a hub for a local network of farms, villages, and mines. Cities can build specific structures or units, and each has its own happiness meters to take care of.Outside of cities, the major area is research - various technologies (with descriptions narrated by Leonard Nimoy) in fields like architecture, agriculture, literature, and religion that boost your civilization's power. Of course, if you can't resort to peaceful measures with the other civilizations, there is always war, conducted in a fairly simple tactical manner (mostly just consisting of unit strength and any bonuses).New to Civ IV is the expansion of governments. There are now several key parts to the government of your civilization - the leadership, the distribution of labor, the enforcement of religion, and so on. Religion, also, is new to the game. Different religions have different effects on your empire. Furthermore, there can be a difference between what your \"state\" religion is and what individual cities' religions are. Generally, you have better relations with people of the same religion, so you should try to use missionaries to expand your chosen religion. Another new feature is the concept of \"Great People\" - individuals who are summoned by researching certain advances in the fine arts or whatever field they may specialize in. These people can give several sorts of one-time bonuses and are fairly rare, so their usage is very important.The graphics are decent, but kind of minimal in usage. There aren't a lot of visual indicators, so really it's just more like a board game with little pieces. It serves mostly a utilitarian purpose, just to show where stuff is and not really have any sort of epic scale or embellishment. One part that is pretty neat is the option to zoom out and see the entire map as a globe, dotted by the various cities and empires. But, other than that, there's not much to the graphics. The music is nice, with different songs for each leader and each civilization. Music increases as you are over empires depending on their point in the timeline - a medieval civilization has the proper music, for example. This is a nice ambient touch and the music is well-executed in general.As a whole, this game is more of the same. For some people, that's a good thing, but I personally felt like there wasn't enough depth in the game as a whole. It concentrated too much on the entirety of history and lost the enjoyment of being in certain periods. It is a good game, yes, but it just didn't really feel as deep as it could or should have.8/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Reggie","summary":"Hooorrayyy for the FLASH LIGHT!","reviewText":"In addition to the developers fffffFINALLY making the flash light stay on at all times while im walking around in the dark, the gameplay in this game (just as it is in the first FEAR game) is still excellent.

Gordon \"A. Gord.\"","summary":"The best Final Fantasy game - list of pros and cons","reviewText":"Final Fantasy IX is, to me, the best Final Fantasy game and the pinnacle of the series before it started to decline after FF10.I'll break this down into pros and cons (not very many of the latter):Pros:-Story: one of the best aspects of this game. It is presented and executed perfectly, with ample plots twists, drama, romance, action and excitement. It starts off sort of throwing you into it, not really sure of the point, but it all comes together in the end, leaving few to no plot holes or questions left unanswered-Writing/dialogue: another amazing part of this game. Whoever wrote the English script is a GREAT writer. It is so well done you can hear each character's voice within the writing (not just main characters but everyone you encounter).-Characters: the characters are all unique and very well developed. There are no boring, soulless characters, such as Vaan in 12. Each is memorable, even if memorable in a bad way. Each has his or her own backstory and issues to deal with.-Great UI and easy to learn: this is something that Final Fantasy games have always been great about doing-Medieval setting: I prefer this to the futuristic direction that Final Fantasy was taking previously-The backgrounds of the environments are beautiful-The FMVs are amazing, action-packed and the best in the FF series-The spell animations are some of the best in the FF series (e.g. flare, doomsday, Bahamut, etc)-Combat: combat is simple and easy to learn yet still very fun. There are a TON of pieces of equipment in the game and the support ability customization can be fun and strategic (though at times game-breaking). The characters are all different with unique abilities (and not samey like they are in FF8)-Music: superb music by Uematsu-Environments and level design: environments are big enough to let you explore (not too linear) but still maintain enough linearity for a strong plot-Treasures: there are a lot of treasures and secrets to find in this game, hidden in every corner of the world (in chests or with the '!' icon). I LOVED searching for these and finding them. It's something no other FF game does quite like this one.-Side quests: there aren't a ton of side quests in this game but quality over quantity, they are very well done. I love the Chocobo Hot and Cold game. It is so basic yet very addicting, sort of like a treasure hunt (and the treasure rewards and exceptional in some cases)Cons:-Gameplay in FFIX is poorly balanced. Many bosses are a complete joke while others are extremely difficult and luck-based. Still, it's not anything too serious, it can just be a little annoying.-Tetra Master is, imo, not the greatest card game and a downgrade from FF8's Triple Triad. Still, it can be fun if you just want to collect the cards!-Fairly ugly character graphics but this is due to the age of the game","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2014"}

While certain factors of RPG playing on Gaia remain constant, Squaresoft has managed to create infinite variations on the theme of overcoming enormous odds in order to save the world.In terms of what a PS One role-playing game can be, Final Fantasy 9 lies close to the limit.  Extensive use of graphic cut scenes, detailed characters and backgrounds, complicated points of view -- all of that is here, and more.  As such, it represents a watershed moment in the game developer's art, even though it was promptly overmatched by what could be done on a PS2.  Oddly enough, PS2 games are not all that much better, and the PS2 itself is already struggling with it's own limitations.Despite all of these positive factors, my gut reaction to FF9 is that it is a lesser game than FF7 or 8.  Some of this has to do with the adoption of a weaker and less complex plot.  Understand that I don't mean this is a bad plot, just that it is lighter in weight, and thus less compelling, than its immediate predecessors.  There are also some tedious elements in game play that drag out battles.  This makes leveling up a bit of a pain.  Of course, the bosses are less of a challenge here, so levelling up is not as important as it has been.I believe that the one thing that tempered my initial reaction to the game was the cartoonish nature of the characters.  There is an element of silliness in the design of characters like Vivi and Quina that kept me at arm's length for longer than usual before the game builds finally them into more solid characters.  Eventually one gets past that reaction, but I had to make an initial effort towards suspension of disbelief that I haven't had to make in any other game in the series.Taken by itself this could very easily be mistaken for a 5-star game.  But in the context of its fellows and my expectations it fell just a bit short.  This is still an eminently satisfactory game that stands above many of its competitors.  If you liked FF7 and 8 you are going to like FF9 as well.  No doubt about that.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2003"}

Play as Crypto, an alien warrior sent to Earth to clear the way for the Furon invasion force","reviewerName":"sporkdude \"sporkdude\"","summary":"Simple action game, but doesn't really do much","reviewText":"This game has an interesting concept.  You're an alien, and you have to take over the country.  You're named Crypto, and you accomplish this task through over twenty levels, spanning six areas.  Each mission, with the exception of the last, is very short (i.e. less than 20 minutes).  They are mostly in the form of a third person shooter, but sometimes require you take control of a flying saucer.The gameplay mechanics are pretty simple.  For the third person aspect, you have 4 total weapons, and a few telepathic powers (brainscan, lift objects, copy the form of a human).  Most missions require you to get to some certain place.  Often times you need to copy the form of a person and walk to the place.  It's a little annoying, because you can't use weapons or pick up objects in a human form, and certain federal agents keep disrupting your human form (which, in latter missions, means you start the mission over).  Afterwards, you just have to shoot people, protect, or destroy objects.  Nothing radical or special here.  The controls are really easy to master though.For the saucer parts, you control a saucer that apparently can't go up or down.  You use a few weapons to destroy certain things, and you can collect items to give you more ammo or heal your ship.  Pretty simple, though standard fair.This game, though, is very playable.  The graphics are pretty good.  The levels, though really small, offer some freedom of movement (everyone says GTA, but it's definitely not as large or as open).  Except for the last level, you don't repeat or get stuck in one place for too long.  It's a bit on the easy side in the beginning, and a bit annoying at the end, but the difficulty balance is pretty good.  Also, the cutscenes and humor are both funny and relevant to today's politics.  That's an added bonus.However, there are numerious problems with this game.  Many people somehow love this game, but unfortunately, I don't see it.  First off, there are no mission saves or checkpoints.  This is beyond lame.  I don't like repeating stuff I already did.  Even though missions are short, I still don't want to repeat 15 minutes of gameplay if I die in the end.  At the end of the game, getting to the boss requires 20 minutes of gameplay.  After dying a few times, I said forget this and used a cheat to finish the last 5 minutes.  Secondly, this game doesn't offer much in terms of gameplay.  Not much strategy or innovation involved.  The shoot 'em up is really standard, and the stealth movement is annoying because it's just boring (take the shape of a human, scan a person, avoid federal agent, rinse, repeat).  Finally, there is no fluidity or continuity.  There are constant breaks in the action, as missions are small and repetitive, so that it is a major chore to sit and play this game for more than an hour straight.All in all, it's not a bad game, but it really isn't that good of a game either.Pros:Good graphicsGood cut-scenesFunnyCons:No misison saves, checkpointsShort missionsNo fluidity, continuityNo online, multiplayer, lasting qualitiesRepetitiveUnoriginal gameplay mechanics.Difficulty: Easy/MediumFrustration Level: Low/MediumHours to Complete: 10 hours","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2005"}

The sound and sounds effects,plus controls are also good. If you liked Fallout 3, you'll love New Vegas.With that being said, the PC version of Fallout: New Vegas requires an internet connectionand a Steam account. I had trouble connecting and installing Steam on the version that camewith the game, so I was forced to download Steam myself from their site, and click \"Install Steam\"on the upper right corner of their homepage (as of this writing) then down Steam with updates (aroundan 80 MB download for me, apx. after many failed attempts to connect to one of their servers).I don't even know where to begin, but Steam is very confusing, offers nothing for me, does nothingfor me either except it downloaded 7.7GB of Fallout::New Vegas Ultimate Edition, which took well overa day of my time and should have been on the CD I bought in the first place (I also have Cricket Broadbandwhich only gives me 5.0GB of data per month, after that is runs notoriously slow though you can still browsethe internet and attempt to load videos and download stuff).I don't play multiplayer nor download most games online, and this is one reason why Steam for me is anightmare, not to mention it is very confusing for most people (keep in mind I know basic HTML, have usedWindows since Windows 95 and MS DOS and used to create levels for Doom and Duke Nukem 3D back inthe day plus have an IC3 Certificate).Steam is probably nice for some people, and others may love it though people out there like me, well, justfind it confusing as heck and frustrating when we can't play a game we paid good money for, just wanting to popit in and install it. Hell, I didn't even mind entering the validation code that came with the game, but when youhave to wait over a day to install it and cannot play it out of the box, it speaks volumes and also sucks big time.Fallout: New Vegas on the Xbox 360 I give 5/5 stars, PC version of the Ultimate Edition of this game I am sad to sayI only give 3/5 stars too, mainly b/c it requires an internet connection and a Steam account and you have to downloadit online (like I said before, around 7.7 GB's to download, which is very slow for me, though the only good thing is if yourinternet connection disconnects when you connect back to the internet, Steam will resume the download, however slowand in a side note the CD has 7.7 GB's on it, what the heck Bethesda?).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2014"}

Featuring Chris Redfield of the originalResident Eviland Sheva Alomar, a West African agent of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA), this sci-fi survival game is staged in a remote desert colony packed with hordes of fast-moving, quick-thinking enemies that represent a whole new breed of evil..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: 20px; } table.callout { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, serif; margin: 10px; width: 250; } td.callout { height: 100 percent; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding: 10px; width: 250px; } ul.callout { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -12px; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5em; } h5.callout { text-align: center; } img.withlink {border:1px black solid;} a.nodecoration {text-decoration: none}Cooperative game play options let you take teamwork to a new level.View larger.Dramatic graphics and lighting effects add a realistic edge to your mission.View larger.Move through vast environments that have a discernable impact on game play.View larger.You'll face faster enemies backed by improved AI.View larger.Meet Two Fierce, Playable Main CharactersBack from the original title andResident Evil: Code Veronica, former S.T.A.R.S. special forces team member Redfield is a battle-tested, founding member of the BSAA. With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Remarkable Addition to a Great Series","reviewText":"Pros:+Stellar graphics+Really Fantastic Gameplay+An easy to follow and absorbing story+All around good sound and music+For Resident Evil, the voice acting is all right+Cooperative play is done really wellCons:-Limited Inventory is kind of a pain-A more subjective con: Some Resident Evil fans might not like that the game focuses a lot more on action rather than on horror. There are still some gruesome moments, but you won't be scared or put on edge in many moments through the game. This will be an experience that changes from gamer to gamerWhen Resident Evil 4 dropped down in 2005, it was hailed as an instant classic and often goes down as one of the greatest games ever made. With that reputation Resident Evil 5 has a lot to live up to. After four years in development, Resident Evil 5 is finally ready for its outing. There are some things to note, however, such as the idea that much of the horror is gone. So you probably won't be scared at any point while playing the game, but you will definitely be thrilled and you'll have a lot of fun.Resident Evil 5 sports a story which continues the conspiracy and most of it happens to be presented very well. The game is absolutely gorgeous looking in every way and runs consistently. The voice acting, for the most part, is pretty good. For many Resident Evil fans who can still remember the bad voice acting of the first one, it's nice to see just how far the series has come. Does Resident Evil 5's gameplay live up to its graphics and sound? Yes. The gameplay is perhaps the games strongest suit.A lot of the gameplay is similar to Resident Evil 4 in terms of its shooting mechanics. If you mastered the fourth installment, you'll be set to tackle what lies ahead here. The controls are easy to get acquainted with. You've got a large assortment of guns, even though you won't start with a good haul. Along those lines you've still got a trusty knife at your side that's a lot easier to use. As you gun down most of the evils that await you, you'll also notice that when they stumble you can approach them and a button prompt will pop up letting you perform special attacks. It helps if you want to conserve ammo.Conserving ammo might not be a problem, however. For what it's worth, there's quite a bit of it, not to mention some of your enemies might drop more. You'll be charged by hordes of bad guys all at once and have to take them on. Those who struggled with Resident Evil 4 might be surprised to find that the difficulty in fifth installment has been toned down considerably. You can absorb a bit more damage than you could before, and healing items restore are also a lot more plentiful along with ammo. This doesn't mean the game is entirely easier, just a bit more inviting.What's new for everyone, however, is the co-op mode and having a partner by your side. Playing co-op is a very fun, very exhilarating experience. No matter how you slice it the game is more fun with a friend. It can also be done online. It might seem gimmicky at first, but it all works out really well. There are moments where you'll be split up and have to send one partner somewhere while another provides cover fire, but for the most part, you'll be sticking together. It all comes together and works really well. You'll want to get a friend and play together whenever you can.If you feel like going at it alone, however, the AI will happily control the other character. In many games when the words \"AI\" and \"Partner\" come up it usually spells disaster... but this isn't so in Resident Evil 5. You'll control Chris in the single player experience, but Sheva will be alright in holding her own in many instances. She shoots and dodges enemies fairly well. In short, you shouldn't have to babysit her. This doesn't make the AI perfect. While she isn't useless in a fight you might notice that Sheva goes through ammo quite fast, sometimes even shooting enemies that aren't fully within reach. There's also not a whole lot of commands you give your partner either. You'll also find yourself having to organize her inventory. Constantly. It's not a bummer to play on single player, but some of it can feel like a chore.There are two things that might make gameplay take a little getting used to. The first is the menu system. It is now in real time. You only get nine spaces (eighteen, if you count your partner), and it never expands. Also, you can't move while the menu is open--despite it being in real time. This makes it hard to access healing items in the middle of a fight. However, Capcom has remedied this by having the directional pad be shortcut keys, which helps things along. One thing that might not seem as good is that you can't move while you shoot. Some argue if you could do this then Resident Evil 5 just wouldn't feel like Resident Evil. I can accept that, but some might not like the idea that in thirteen years Resident Evil still makes you stand perfectly still to raise your weapon. It's a minor complaint, however, as you'll rarely be so over taken that you should have to run and gun anyway. Besides that, the game is still easy despite this, it is obviously a design that Capcom intentionally left unchanged. You'll notice that while you can't move while you shoot, enemies are more than willing to slow down to give you a moment to aim. Nevertheless, there's an intensity to the gameplay that feels perfect. It's a lot of fun to play. You can't move while you shoot, but the lack of being able to do so never really presents itself as a problem. All this amounts to some pretty exciting gameplay. There's never a dull moment. And when the action slows down it's only a matter of time before it picks up again.If there was anything that truly might upset some fans, it would be that the horror element of the games is just about completely gone. You'll more than likely never be scared. There are a lot of thrilling moments, well designed enemies, bosses and level designs, but some might not like that Resident Evil 5 turns its back on horror almost entirely. You'll find some gruesome things, and plenty of blood and gore, but don't expect to be frightened by anything the game throws at you.Other than that, Resident Evil 5 is a solid game, in part because it's just amazingly fun to play. The fact that you can now go about it with a friend makes it much more exciting. It might not be scary, but at least it's still fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2009"}

SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire. It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept. Also, it's one of the best.

{"product_name":"B00A750QIE","description":"","reviewerName":"PandA","summary":"Great graphics, authentic gameplay, good sports game (a casual gamer review).","reviewText":"Baseball is views by some as a slow and tedious sport to watch. Games take 3-4 hours and, unless you like fielding and pitching over a home run derby, there isn't a ton of non-stop action.This means the video game will be slow and tedious, too, right?Wrong. If anything, baseball is the perfect sport for video games. Basketball and football are so complex and dynamic, with each play being completely different. The challenges of designing AI for that are immense.Baseball, however, is a bit easier. Sure accurate pitch counts and throwing pitches correctly is an art, but for the most part, if you can make it to second base when you hit the ball, so be it. You made it. Double. Or you are out.The graphics are top notch, the learning curve makes it easier to pick up (I'm not interested in playing a 3.5 hour game, with a final score of 2-1, and 6-8 hits for each team. I can customize the game and the settings to allow for a bit more scoring and up tempo, but still competitive, game. If you do prefer the former, you can setup and customize it that way. No problem.Gameplay feels great and authentic. King Felix dominates, and the M's rarely can get enough runs from more than 1-2 guys a game (should have bought 14 to get Cano on the M's! :) )All-in-all it is a strong, good package. I like to have one sports game from each genre (don't really care about having the most up-to-date rosters, I just want to casually play a few franchise/career games of various sports throughout the year). I wait to find a highly rate title a year or two later and get it for dirt cheap then I am set.I have added MLB 13 as my go-to baseball game in my collection. My other sports games (very highly rated and cheap!) are FIFA 12, NHL 11 & Madden 12. I have NBA Live 09 (the last good one, I will get 2k14 but waiting for the price to go down).Anyways, add this game to your collection if you want a solid, accessible baseball game to toy around with in your free time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2014"}

Well, I'm sorry, but it's not.  Zelda, has a better story and better gameplay.  Ture, the &quot;georama&quot;  feature is cool, you get to build your own towns and place anything whereever you want but it's just not enough.  Most of the game, you're going through dungines, looking for the pieces to build the towns.  This could have been tolerable it the dungines had different looking rooms. They don't. They graphics aren't what you would call a second generation.  They would have been more impresive if this game came out when the PS2 first came out.  Zelda is so much better because Zelda had so much more to do than just dungine crawling. It had a bunch of secret things and mini games, and it had a big world for you to explore. Dark Cloud has none of that.  There isn't even an overworld or whatever you call it.  You just go straight to the towns.  And in each town, you have to find the stupid pieces and rebuild the towns, then repeat the process.  Now, for the combat.  It's totally like Zelda, except you constantly have to go and buy repair powder because guess what, your weapons have a ceratain amount of hits before the break and disappear.  Also, you constantly have to go and drink water because you get thristy.  Sure, it's realistc, but we get games to escape to a fantasy, to do things we can't do, and to have fun.  You want thrist?  Go run 20 miles non-stop.  The characters don't look unique at all.  The main character looks like Link except for the hat.  And the flying god looks like the flying dog from the Neverending Story, if you've ever seen that movie.  This game was interesting for the first 30 minutes, but when I saw what you basically have to do for the rest of the game, it got old pretty quickly.  I suggest you rent the game before you see if you can look past all these cons.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2001"}

In the past month or so, I only lost my savegames on the Live server twice and have only had it crash itself once.  That said, here is the original review.  I hope it is helpful for you.I bought Halo 2 for the PC excited about trying it on my brand-new Vista machine.  I have had it for over a year now and have yet to be able to actually play the game all the way through.I went through the agony of having to create a Live account, and then having the game not \"see\" the account (but not let me log in because I'm \"already logged in\").  I experienced the unfun joys of having Halo 2 randomly tell me my savegame file is corrupted and I have to start again.  I had updates crash the game, my license key invalidate itself, and after unanswered support e-mails, it took me multiple calls and over 3 hours on the phone to get someone to fix the problem.  They had to do this by removing my license key, issuing me a new one, and telling me I'd lose all my \"achievements\" and account info.  That wasn't a great loss, since the program would regularly log me into Live, then say, \"You are not logged into Live.  You will not be able to have any Achievements.  Sorry about that.\"  A lot of the messages I get in Halo 2 say, \"Sorry about that.\"  Sorry, indeed.By the time I actually got the game to work (with shuddering framerate and random dropouts in sound), I was just angry.  Angry at all the \"Sorry\" messages, angry at the hassle I have to click through just to load a saved game, and angry at the constant savegame level resets.  I see new Microsoft Games for Windows titles, and I feel I'd be stupid to put risk putting myself through that again.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2008"}

However, the game does show its age especially in the graphics. For those who jumped into the Halo franchise on 3, like me, and are looking to see the origins you wont be disappointed by the game, but you'll probably be frustrated by the many differences.First, I'd like to make a note about system requirements. This game does require Window's Vista, but this isn't a review of Windows Vista. If you don't have Windows Vista you can't play this game! As for system requirements, this game runs really well on my Pentium D system with 2GBs of RAM. I only have a 7600GS 256MB video card. Of course I'm restricted to the lowest resolution (800x600) to get the performance I need, but on my old 19\" CRT Monitor that is just fine.The single player campaign is very fun on Halo 2. One thing to note is that there is no 2 player co-op like there was on the console. Otherwise the experience is largely the same. Halo 2 has a pretty punishing difficulty especially on the harder modes. One thing that is particularly frustrating though is the level design. There are holes in the floors and ledges that you can just walk off of resulting in an instant death. Even with these problems, the game manages to squeeze in a lot of fun. The story is pretty involving on this game and adds to the motivation. The classic Halo formula works here too. Although, with the harder difficulties you'll find you'll have to be much more tactical instead of just running and gunning. However, should you win you'll feel like you've really accomplished something.The multiplayer component is pretty good too. Halo 2 PC uses the Games for Windows Live service. Which means you'll have to sign up for a windows live account (hotmail) if you don't have one. You can play online for free, but some options are left out (there are Gold exclusive games, but not many people play them). If you already have an Xbox Live account, like I do, then you can use that and still talk to your friends from Xbox Live. The game uses a lobby system opposed to the Matchmaking system of the console version. It works well and makes it easy to pick the specific game type you want; deathmatch (slayer), team deathmatch, capture the flag, king of the hill, oddball. There are still plenty of people playing as of the witting of this review, but not as many as on the console version. The game has plenty of maps built in and also includes a map maker so there is more than enough content. The game supports voice chat, but you can still chat with the keyboard. Multiplayer is very fun and is one of the things that sold the game so well originally. Its still good, but there are some better newer options out there now.With the delayed release of the PC version of this game, it might have just missed its core audience. Compared to most game released today it could definitely use a graphical update. The surprising thing is how well everything else holds together. The campaign and multiplayer are still great. If you're curious about the Halo Franchise this is good place to get an introduction, and if you're a fan of Sci-Fi shooters at all, I'm sure you'll find something to enjoy in this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2007"}
{"product_name":"B002I098JE","description":"","reviewerName":"Zalmorion the Fantastic","summary":"Fun COD Game With Some Major Flaws","reviewText":"It is flawed, yes; but it is far from deserving the monicker of \"failure.\"  Bottom line, if you enjoy playing any of the COD games, this game is going to be a fun and different addition to your FPS library.The maps are much larger.  This makes play a lot more fun because 1) there are more sniping spots, 2) there are more routes to one place, 3) every corner, turn, hill, wall could be harboring an enemy (scary), and 4) nowhere is safe and impenetrable.The downside to this is the developers' foolish decision to limit the number of players!  What a dumb thing to do!  I am praying they fix this.  The only reason the larger maps are not blowing everyone's minds is that there are too few players.  This results in some boring running around which makes you uncareful which often gets your head blown off by a sniper or camper.The customization options are myriad and a lot of fun.  The graphics and sound effects are excellent.  The maps are creative.  There are a lot of realistic places to cover or even hide in plain sight, if you are good enough.  The new armored guard dogs/wolves are a lot of fun--they follow you around and rip out the throats of campers, or at least give up their positions.There is a lot of good in this game, but the developers are erasing the game's full potential by limiting the number of players allowed in a game.  There are a ton of weapons.  The damage has been adjusted to reflect a more accurate result of being shot by each weapon.  Their are a lot of unlockable perks and gadgets.Buy this game if you are a COD fan who wants a little bit more space and variety.*****UPDATE*****After having played for quite a while, I have to say that there are more flaws than I originally posted.1) Extinction Mode is horrible.  Nothing like Zombies.  It is boring.  The aliens are not scary.  Remember how you had to shoot at a bunch of dogs when someone earned that care package in past COD games?  Well, this is like hours of shooting at dogs.  Boring.2) Fewer people play.  If you are not online at rush hour, you might end up with fewer games in session.3) Ranking up takes forever.  I do not like easy games, but I also do not like having to play everyday to get anywhere!  I can't do that, because of this thing called \"life.\"  So this is a drawback.  I love all of the options, but I may never see all of them.  LOL.So keep these things in mind before buying.  I bumped it down a star because it is definitely less fun now.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2014"}
{"product_name":"Logitech G700s Rechargeable Gaming Mouse","description":"","reviewerName":"Scott","summary":"Very responsive wireless gaming mouse","reviewText":"For me, the Logitech G700S is a replacement from theLogitech  Performance MXthat I've been using for the last two years. I've also use the G700, and the G700S is a noticeable improvement from that mouse and addresses some of its faults.INSTALLATIONVery easy to install. Simply plug in the USB receiver and your computer should automatically install the drivers. There is no driver disc to use, which is great because I can't stand some of the software that comes with mice and sits in your system tray. Although you can download Logitech Gaming Software from Logitech's web site, which will allow you more fine tuning, and also easily explain what the buttons do.SOFTWAREI installed the Logitech Gaming Software, and noticed a lot of updates since the last time I used it, especially with this mouse. The software allows full customization of the buttons and sensitivity levels.  You can use the software to set up profiles for individual games, which the G700 will remember and automatically switch to at loading, or by pressing the profile button on the mouse. The software also has built-in profiles for specific games, and will automatically scan your system for known games and assign profiles. There are 260 profiles built in, and within a few seconds, Logitech found 6 on my system and assigned profiles to them.  I found this to be a very useful feature and the profiles I viewed seem to be fairy well though out.  You can customize the DPI on the fly, which relates to the mouse cursor Dots Per Inch and determines the mouse reading and movement on the screen. Higher DPI provides for smoother movement and faster cursor speed.WIRELESS TECHNOLOGYI've been using wireless mice for several years now, and had a lot of misses with previous mice which had terrible recharging options.  Like the MX, the G700S uses anEneloop 2000mAh AA, Ni-MH Rechargeable Batterywhich is recharged through a micro USB cable that must be plugged into your computer (there is no AC connection). If your battery starts to run down during a session, you can connect the charging cable and still use the mouse, but it can be a little awkward to play with it. I had a lot of success with the Performance MX charging, with the battery still holding a full charge after extensive use for two years, Since the G700 uses the same technology, I think it is likely I will find the same results with it. The G700 uses three LED lights on the side of the mouse to show battery life, however they are not always on, and are only activated when the mouse comes out of sleep mode. The MX has the battery life indicator on the top of the mouse, which I found easier to see.  The USB receiver is very tiny and can easily be removed and taken to another computer, which makes the G700 very portable.  It also comes with an extension cable which will give you another 4 feet.  Without the extension cable, I was able to get reliable performance from a distance of about five feet. Between 5-7 feet, the connection became spotty, and any farther and it wouldn't respond.  I use the extension cable to keep the receiver less than 2 feet away from my mouse and received great performance.FORM FACTORLike the Performance MX, the G700 has a nice feel to it and is very comfortable under your hand.  It has a slightly smaller footprint, and is designed for a right-handed person. You can use it as a left-hander, but it is going to feel very awkward since it is designed to wrap under your thumb. The mouse has a textured pattern on the sides for a nice tactile feel to it. The DPI buttons are above the index finger position and very easy to access. The thumb cluster has four buttons and is also easy to reach and has a soft \"click\" to the buttons to give you good response when engaging a profile. The scroll wheel is in a good position, and can easily be switched from free-wheeling to a click wheel from a middle button, however I really feel like it should have been moved to the right side and had a programmable button put in its place.PERFORMANCEThe macro controls on the mouse are great, and perform very quickly. They are easy to set up using the software and can really improve your gaming experience. You can adjust the mouse from 200 to 8200 DPI. 8200 is insanely fast for a gaming mouse, and the highest I've seen by far.  Realistically, you're not going to get any use out of much more than 4500 DPI in an FPS game. Any higher than that and you will find the cursor flying all over the screen. It is really great though to be able to go from 800 DPI when I need precision for a head shot, and then switch straight to 4000 for quick movement. Many people might want to use this as a wired mouse. I think the cable they shipped with it is a bit too heavy and would prefer something 20% lighter, however I will almost never use it wired so this isn't as big of a deal for me.  I tried the mouse for several hours wireless, and wired, and didn't notice any latency issues when using it wireless.I didn't use the original G700 enough to really notice a difference between it and the G700S, but if you currently have a G700, I don't think you need to upgrade. But going from a Performance MX to a real gaming mouse makes a huge difference.  Even if not used for gaming, the response on this mouse is very nice and I think it works well for general non-gaming applications as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2013"}

This game's superior artificial intelligence, seamless graphics, and advanced multiplay features make it popular.","reviewerName":"Knewace","summary":"Half-Life","reviewText":"Half-Life deserves more than 5 stars. It is the new king of computer games, Surely the best first person shooter ever made. You play gorden freeman a 27 year old research associate in the Black Mesa research facility. The game has 16 very large and strong levels plus two starting levels and one end game level and it has a game ending that 50% of the gamers would say it is the best ever and 50% would say the worst ever, If you ask me it is the best ending ever for a Pc game story, It has got two great endings a climax and an anti climax. Right from the start you're engaged in events like riding a train to work, finding the locker room and suiting up, and then heading for the test lab. The experiment in the test lab goes very wrong and alien beings are teleported through the portal that opened and the goverment wants to cleanup the mess completly including you. You must fight your way through the aliens and the commandos and be teleported to a distant planet to cleanup the mess that was created. The Game starts and ends on a train. What i really like about half life is that there are no cutsences, The whole story is through the eyes of Gordan, I hate it when games take the controls away from the player.Half Life has the best graphics ever in a computer game, Dont worry if you dont have a 3D card, You dont need them, The software rendering itself is as good as Direct3D or OpenGL. Valve's artists and sound artists should win awards for their contribution to half-life. The charecters look so real that you really feel sorry for them when they get killed. Not only does the game look and feel like the science lab, but it's monstors and live wire electricity effects all come alive. The graphics of fire and water are simply superb so life like. The sound in half life is very clear that you could understand what the scientist and commandos are talking very clearly, The explosions and the gunfire sounds along with the graphics give a real war like atmosphere. The sound track in half-life the opening music is fantastic. Half Life's level designing is superb, The black mesa is a great place to hang arround. The levels are so beautifully desinged and they are very strong and the puzzles are very challenging. Surface tension is my favorite level. There are 13 weapons but why did the makers have just 5 keys for them, Most of the weapons have secondary fire mode. This is the first game were living creatures are used as weapons, The small alien crab like thing and the hand of an alien, Leave your charecter alone for sometime holding a weapon and you will see him play with it. The commandos are more challenging to fight than the aliens expecially the black dressed woman assasins in the levels apprehension and Lambda complex. Fighting them feels as if you are suddenly in a multiplayer game. Half Life's loading time is really fast and quick save and quick Load lives up to it's name only in half life.Half-Life has the best multiplayer playability in action games and probably the most easy to use interface ever. Half-Life is a must for all FPS fans. I can't understand how Myst is still the best selling game ever. There is absolutely nothing wrong in half-life, It is probably the most perfect game ever made, There should be a prize to persons who find real fault with half life. The NPC's look alike but that's understandable, In all games two out of ten charecters look alike, It bothers only in half life because they look so real, For people who find that as a big con let me tell you if valve decided that each charecter must have a different then half life wouldn't be half complete today. Some people think Xen is not fun to play, That's because you are in the science lab and all of a sudden you are in Xen and could not handle the sudden atmosphere change, Xen is fun to play. Half Life is a very well planned and polished game that it is very shinning. And it is the only game which has not crashed on my system. Forget Quake II or Unreal, Buy Half Life you would not regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2000"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Not bad but not original.","reviewText":"There's a very simple way to describe Castlevania Lords of Shadow...it's Devil May Cry!What started off as a platform game where you explore endless rooms in a spooky castle in your search for Dracula has turned into a 3D action game with lots of combos, skills and relentless enemies, and the resemblance to the Devil May Cry series is startling. I think a summary is worthwhile here.Our vampire killing hero is Gabriel, and he starts of with a basic weapon and moves through the various levels of the game which are cunningly designed to be small linear corridors masquerading as free roaming areas but actually with very little room for going off-course. He starts in a village, moves through a wood, another village, a castle, a wasteland, another castle, a swamp, etc etc. Every now and then he'll get stuck in a closed off area and have to fight a swarm of enemies, unable to proceed until they are all dead. Every so often there are bosses. Using this style of game play is already very reminiscent of DMC, but there is a lot more that this game copies. New skills (by which I mean button combos) are available at a cost of skill points, which are earned by killing monsters. There's even a \"super\" mode you can go into where Gabriel lights up, his attacks get stronger and he slowly self heals, until the magic meter runs out! There's still more. Every few chapters or so, Gabriel obtains a new \"relic\" that allows a whole new level of skills to open up, for example after a while he gets a longer whip, a gauntlet that gives him extra melee attack power, shoes that allow a dash move, or (much later) an ability to double jump. Some upgrades are well hidden or out of reach until these upgrades are found, but you can play earlier chapters again at any time to go to previously unavailable areas.I know it sounds like I am fixated on this comparison, but they could literally have replaced the character model of Gabriel with Dante, changed the script a bit give him a suitable motive and then just let things run as they stand. It really feels the same. I cant argue with any of the mechanics of the game play, its smooth, absolutely beautiful to look at (especially some of the castle exteriors), and some of the bosses are superb, especially the Titans, although can I just say Shadow of the Colossus here? Climbing up legs and arms? Stabbing weak points? Riding on a flying dragon trying to stab a weak point and not get shaken off? Come on guys! I also didn't get much fun from the story, basically it's just a journey/quest to get from point A (the game opening) to point B (the final boss).The difficulty level is also oddly pitched - some real tough spikes appear dotted around the game (for me it was the first few fights with giant spiders and some packs of the very large werewolves), but then at the end the final boss is almost a pushover. But I will say again, it does look stunning. Even the menu (the big book) is great. It's also quite long - there are loads of chapters and remember that you can re-visit completed chapters to look for secret areas that you may have missed.I just wish it felt more like Castlevania than another game I could mention.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2010"}

The hard case for the LE was very nice...I don't give it a 1, because there are far worse things out there. But I cannot for the life of me understand why this is a franchise. Not really impressed by it's production company either (RARE). Maybe this next-gen release is an upgrade visually from its predecessor in the franchise, but even compared to last-gen games like Halo, Half-Life2 or Doom3 produced years ago, it just doesn't measure up.

{"product_name":"B0087OZ5FG","description":"","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"A very simple-to-setup versatile wireless headset","reviewText":"If you want a headset that's dead simple to set up then you can't go wrong with the Sony Pulse Headset. All you have to do is plug in the USB receiver into your computer or ps3 and it just works. The sound quality is great for the price, though don't expect audiophile grade audio at this price-point. These aren't going to replace your high-end Sennheisers or compete with wireless headsets that cost 3x more from reputable companies. However, I do think they're better than some Bose headsets that cost quite a bit more in terms of just pure enjoyment. The upper-mids and lower highs are where I feel the Sony Pulse excels in the frequency range overall, with the bass-impact helping round out the lows. The music genres that to me sound best from my initial sampling are the pop/rap/r&b;/hip-hop genres more than classical/pieces that emphasize either the low or high ends much more. I love that you can adjust the bass-impact (which basically is like having a rumble-pack that literally sends the \"bass\" vibrations into your head) to get that extra oomph. This bass-impact feature works great with genres and songs that emphasize bass, naturally, but come off a bit annoying and disruptive on tracks that are more neutral or focus on the mids/highs. But thankfully it's entirely optional and can be easily turned off/adjusted to your liking. It simulates the feeling of a powerful subwoofer in a small package, though it's a bit jarring since you only feel it up top vs. throughout your body with a real sub. But in my opinion it still does the job of making music/movies/games more immersive so it's a win in my book. Just don't expect miracles in terms of having a rich full low-range on the bass.For games and movies the headset does a great job with simulating the surround sound aspect of things. I can easily discern where shots are coming from in games, and in movies there's that sense of surround with explosions and the like. Again, just don't expect this to perform close to the really high end sets in the $300+ range. You get what you pay for, and frankly I'd say this headset more than satisfies the \"good enough\" rating for the majority of users. The fit of the headset for gaming sessions lasting longer than 3-4 hours for me personally was a bit uncomfortable. The headset fits very snugly, which is great for blocking out outside noise (which is does an admirable job of), but can feel a bit tiresome on my ears after a while. The earcups themselves are well-padded and don't look like they're going to start tearing apart over time. I don't like the use of the glossy black plastic on the sides since they grab so many fingerprints, but at least it doesn't feel cheap. Durability is probably moderately above average, but these are not the kind of headphones I'd want to take to and from work/school with me. They are more meant to be kept and used around the home or maybe over to a friends place. The battery life is also about 6-7 hours from what I'm seeing with mixed usage, though that depends on how much you have the bass-impact turned up. Those are little rumble-packs running in either ear-cup with the bass-impact so the higher it's turned up the shorter your battery life will be. I'd say your worst-case battery life will be in the 4-5hr range (probably more the latter).One other perk is that these will work not just with the ps3 and a tv, but with almost anything with a audio port. The receiver has a 3.5mm input jack, so you can connect your iPod, xbox, or even TV audio into that input slot on the wireless receiver and it'll work. You just need to make sure the receiver is plugged into something so that it's getting USB power. This makes this headset truly Universal. I just got tired of dealing with headsets from turtle-beach etc. that have those clunky extra base stations. Others that have tried this on have commented on how it's got a nice fit that is really snug. The lack of a dock and just a simple USB receiver also got big brownie points with my testers, with many looking to pick up a pair of their own to use with their TV's and computers. This thing is just great to look at, comfortable, and dead simple to use. The only thing missing from the package is the USB charging cable, which is included for those who bought a ps3 to charge their controllers with. That means for those of you who want to use this and didn't buy a ps3 you'll need to get that charging cable, which should cost a few bucks tops to get. If you want pure audio fidelity I'd say you should shop elsewhere. You're really paying for the wireless freedom + versatility at a price-friendly entry point with this set.All in all if you want a fantastic wireless headset to use with anything - this is the pair to buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2013"}

HUH?!  this is 2007, this is the powerful 360, and you're telling me we're still using TEXT instead of VOICE?!  it screams \"this was a rushed game.\"there are too many complications to getting into the zombie-killing fun.  if they had simplified this game and improved the controls, i would have liked it.  but i got bored before 30 minutes of gameplay.oh yeah, how could i forget the save system!!!  as you can see, everyone hates the save system, and for good reason.  i'm not the kind of person who has to save whenever i want, but in place of that i at least want a good checkpoint auto-saving feature.  instead, when you die here, you have to go way back before the part you were playing, to the dialogue etc. before it.  that is really annoying to me.  every other game out there has a good checkpoint auto-save system but this one.  again, it screams \"this game was rushed.\"","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2007"}

Textures and particle effects do look improved.  Overall, all these new feature doesn't help the fact that Crysis 2's gameplay is still mediocre.  Too little to late?  You decide.IMPORTANT NOTE: You cannot customize any video options.  There are only 3 presets available: High, Very High & Extreme.Crysis 2 feels like a clone of the Call of Duty series since it shifted to a New York landscape.  I miss the openness/vastness of the island in Crysis 1.  The environment here feels constrained, but there is still multiple paths to reach an objective.  If you are playing this game for the continuation of the story, it will be a big let down.  This game vaguely references the events from the first game and there is a huge plot gap between the two games.  No mention of the where abouts of Psycho and Nomad; all we get is a brief encounter with Prophet. Overall, its more of a spin-off rather than a direct sequel.Graphics wise, the game looks good running on DX9 but you'll encounter some low res textures.  The game runs very well on my PC on \"extreme\" settings.  I have encountered flickering in SLI mode when setting the video options to max via a config file. The biggest letdown is not being able to customize the video settings within the game, no DX11 out of the box, bad FOV and AI bugs.

When you really analyze what takes up most of your time, it is hunting, sidequests, and getting radio towers. Out of all 3, I enjoyed hunting. The game has a great concept and beautiful environment, but I can't simply get past its setbacks. Why? I was very honest about how repetitive and linear Assassins Creed 1 was despite its beautiful environment and concept, and they made a huge improvement to AC2. So, I'm hoping that they will do the same for Far Cry 4 if they ever work on it. I think if they added better quests and somehow made the whole sandbox type setting less boring, it would be a definite 5/5. Also, some of the main missions are all about grabbing a gun and shooting everything. I realize it is a first person shooter, but do I really want to go through endless waves at times? Not really. It reminded me of halo 4(at times) with its never ending enemies with very added value to the storyline. Despite all that, it is still a good game.

This is the first excellent RPG of the next generation consoles, and it will be a hard act to follow.  Almost everything is wonderful and fresh.  The graphics, the story, the fighting system, the world of Arcadia - this is the stuff of gaming legend!Naturally, the graphics are jaw-dropping.  Just imagine the static backgrounds in Playstation RPGs, except that you can move about them in full 3D, and you'll get the idea.  These textures are the most detailed I have every seen in a game - you'll stop just to study a mosaic in the floor.  The towns and dungeons are impossible complex and detailed.  Each seem to be more spectacular than the last.  What impressed me the most, though, was how completely the graphics combined with the rest of the game to give you a great experience.  For example, the character animation not only amazes you at how life-like it is, but draws you into the story and the characters.The plot starts slow and predictable, but finishes incredibly strong.  Everyone who's played this game agrees that somewhere in the first 3rd of the story, something grabs your attention and doesn't let go.  Maybe it's the spectacular world of Arcadia, which basically combines the Age of Discovery and pirates with magic, and throws everything into the skies.  People live on floating islands, with magic powered sailboats sailing to and from, clouds pouring down like waterfalls, and strange cultures sitting undiscovered by the Old World.  Like in any good RPG, the story stirs emotion by taking you to new places and introducing new characters.  I don't want to ruin anything for you, so I'll just say that Skies of Arcadia makes discovery *fun* again - you'll look forward to finding that new island, or meeting that new character, or challenging that new enemy.  What a blast.The combat system is actually broken into 2 seperate parts - your standard, run-of-the-mill random monster fights that any fan of Final Fantasy is familiar with and probably getting sick of.  This type of battle is actually too frequent for my tastes, especially when exploring the world map.  At least Sega has thrown in some new strategic elements to spice things up, like a group-shared spirit pool, or the most user-friendly elemental system on any RPG ever.  The second type of combat is a more strategic battle between 2 seperate airships.  These battles are very cinematic and a blast to play.  They also require more thought and planning then your ordinary turn-based combat.  You can spend a lot of time recruiting the perfect crew, or choosing the best combination of weapons and defense.If you can only get 1 Dreamcast game this X-mas, definitely get Skies of Arcadia.  Besides all of the above, this RPG had so many extras and hidden sights that you can easily spend an extra 10 hours finding it all.  You can even download entire continents from the Sega web site!

{"product_name":"B0017HPE7E","description":"Transformed and unleashed, Sonic races to save the world...and himself. Sonic the Hedgehog is on an adventure unlike any other. Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new proprietary &ldquo;Hedgehog Engine,&rdquo;Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other next-gen technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Anti MTV \"Old school MTV 4ever!\"","summary":"The best sonic 3D game!","reviewText":"After watching a lame video review on youtube from one of the worst lamest game reviewers of all (irate gamer) on sonic unleashed saying it was bad I was not convinced not one bit that sonic unleashed sucks, Infact that lame video review actually encouraged me to go out and buy that game and I loved it, And If anyone has heard of the irate gamer or seen his sonic unleashed review please don't listen or support him because he's a big phony and an idiot who mainly nitpicks instead of reviewing and can't get any his facts straight.I hear alot of talk about this game being terrible and boring especially the night time levels, I completely disagree this game is so much fun to play even the werehog stages give a good feel of a hack and slash god of war style game play and I found that to be more fun than the daytime 100 MPH dashing levels and their more harder than the night time levels. The graphics are beautiful the game play is fun but I keep on struggling to press the right buttons for when the screen indicates what buttons to push and I keep pushing the wrong ones and I feel like im playing guitar hero on medium mode especially the plane and shamar day level.I do admit this game can get pretty annoying and hard even nauseating while running aroung a hub world can give me a horrible vertigo and the camera angles are pretty horrible for when your trying to view your platform jumping and I think many game developers need to work on that before releasing their games and the controllers don't respond that great sometimes but it's not that bad.I also heard A rumor that sonic colors was better than sonic unleashed, Are you kidding me?! Thats A total BS statement, I mean what are these fans smoking?! I think sonic unleashed was way better than sonic colors. Why? Because sonic colors is more for little kids who can't take a challenge while sonic unleashed is more for grown hardcore gamers who can take greater challenges and different varieties other than just dashing all the time. I played sonic colors and it's not as good as this game, The levels are short piece of cake boring and repetitive while unleashed has some amazing long challenging dashing platforming stages and a fun button mashing beat em up GOW style night time levels.This game does have some major flaws but that doesn't mean its a boring unplayable game and this whole nostalgiac sonic VS current sonic from the ignorance of fanboys just makes me sick, This is a great sick game!The verdict: 8/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2011"}

Who is going to want to use that giant controller screen thing?&#34;  Well, that was before I saw the game lineup of current and future Nintendo games.I had a Wii, and that system had a TON of bad quality games.  Sure, there were some good ones, but not enough.  Also, I am SO OVER the whole standing up to play thing.  I watched E3 this year, and I decided to take the plunge and get a Wii U.  It is SO worth it.  Here's why.- The games are outstanding.  I bought the bundle with Super Mario Bros U / Super Luigi Bros U and those games are fun.  It's classic Super Mario fun, really.  Even better is the Super Mario 3D World.  Mario as a cat?  Yes please!  Nintendoland is very fun too - especially for those of us who are lifelong Nintendo fans.- The screen is actually pretty cool, and surprisingly comfortable to hold.  You can keep it in your lap or hold it.  In games like Nintendoland, you can use the screen to play &#34;hide and seek&#34; type games.  You obviously can't normally play those types of games on other consoles, and they are fun!- The idea that I can use the Gamepad (i.e. big screen controller thingy) to play most games while watching TV is awesome.  I had to buy a Playstation Vita (now sold) in order to do this with my PS4, and this is much much better (no streaming!).- The games that are going to be coming out are so awesome!  Zelda!  Kirby!  Yoshi!  I'm so excited.- Mario Kart 8.  Enough said.- Nintendo has mastered the ability of making a console for EVERYONE.  Serious gamers, casual gamers, and everyone in between.GO BUY ONE NOW.

Battlefield  has lots of features that the other FPS don't have. Battlefield allows you to employ vehicles in combat in multiplayer. You can jump into jeeps, tanks, helicopters, airplanes, boats, etc. This makes gameplay interesting. The other important feature in Battlefield is the ability to specialize your infantry between assault troops, snipers, anti-tank, and engineers. In this way you don't just pick up different weapons on the field of battle, you get to pick your kit to suit your mission or role. Each have their abilities and weaknesses, but as a combination they are stronger.I did notice an improvement in the graphics fromBattlefield: 1942(BF1942). Running through the jungle in Battlefield Vietnam (BFV)reminded me of the movie Platoon.  The nostalgic 60s music also provides great atmosphere and gets you ready to jump into the battle. The weapons are fun and extra options for the different infantry types allows for more customization. BFV land vehicles are not much better than BF1942, but the helicopters are pretty cool. Unfortunately my piloting skills are pretty poor so I had to rely on others for an airlift. But the damage the Cobra gunships can dish out with a good pilot is incredible. It also is a lot of fun to let loose with the 50 cal on the Hueys. I would say if you only want a land based game, BFV is really not for you. Most maps allow for aerial combat.I felt the single player experience on BFV was better than BF1942. I think this type of setting is better suited to Battlefield's style of gameplay. However, the AI would at times cause frustration by having everyone going after one control point (and still not being able to take it) while I'm left to fend off all the bad guys trying to capture the other control points.I would note that there are still an active multiplayer community. However, there are far fewer people playing BFV as there are playing BF1942. If this game does interest you, you should getBattlefield 1942: The Complete Collectionwhich comes with two Battlefield 1942 expansions,Battlefield 1942 Expansion: The Road to RomeandBattlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII Expansion Packand Battlefield Vietnam.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2013"}

I am on level 7, about 8 hours into the game.  If I change my opinion or have to add information I will do that when I've finished the game.  I just want to pass on my experience with this game for those on the fence about it.This is to PS2 what Ninja Gaiden is to Xbox.  And I don't mean that they are both kick ass action games and are the kings of the genre (which they are, by the way).  But they are both two of the hardest games I've played on either in a long time.  And not hard in \"the controls are wonky\" kind of way.  If you aren't the top of your game, you will die.  All the time.  And even when you think you are the top of your game, DMC3 will remind you that you are definitely not and you will die.And yet, through all of this, you will be having fun.  Capcom has managed to wipe the slate clean with the abysmal failure that was DMC2.  This game follows the gameplay of the first DMC, that is small rooms with lots of creatures, gothic architecture and insane monsters who keep coming.  DMC3 takes these conventions and kicks it into high gear.  The biggest and by far the most welcome change is that you go into a mission being able to select two long range and two short range weapons (from those you have acquired) and your attack style.In the mission you just hit L2 and R2 to switch between your two guns and 2 melee weapons.  What this means is that 1) there's no more going into your inventory just to switch your weapons and 2) since it's so fluid your combos become amazing.  Imagine throwing an enemy up in the air with your sword, juggling him with your hand guns, switching to your shot gun to blast him, switching to your three headed nunchucks to finish him up, then jumping on his prone body and use him as a skate board and sliding around the level blasting the other creatures.  You can and will do this if you want a high combo rating (and more red orbs of experience).The four beginning styles are an awesome addition too.  The beginning four are Trickster (evasion), Gunslinger (shooting), Sword Master (swords) and Guard Royale (defensive, counter attacks).  I am currently using Trickster and I think that's probably a great beginning start for this game because with a push of the circle button you zoom out of harms way, you can run up walls, run across walls, and (at higher levels) zoom while jumping.  I haven't use the other styles yet, but Trickster is very helpful in a sticky situation, which you will be in a lot.My problem with the game is not the high difficulty level.  It's the fact that there isn't a check point in any of the levels I've been through.  Unless you have a yellow orb, if you die you will start back at the beginning of the level.  This can be frustrating for some.  Take for instance, the level I'm currently at Level 7.  Not only is it a long level but towards the end you are fighting creatures that summon more creatures so you have to kill them before any others, then the boss from the second level shows up only he's not a boss (even though he has the same amount of life).  After you finish off these hard encounters you have to fight the real boss.  And if you die you're doing it over again.  For some this will be a major turn off.My recommendation is to save during the level if you find the fights turning sour.  This way, when you do die you will save all of the red orbs and items you've collected during the level.  For me, dying isn't THAT big of a deal then because you aren't losing any of the xp progress you've made.The graphics are great, the sound is a nice heavy metalish sound.  Sometimes the voices can't be heard over the music so it's a good idea to have subtitles on.  It supports Pro Logic II for the game and 5.1 for the cutscenes.As it stands, I think this game and Ninja Gaiden are the pillars of action excellence.  They definitely aren't for everyone and those who don't want a hard game should definitely look elsewhere.  But for those who are tough enough to stick it out, this game is excellent bar none on the PS2.  It's fun, moves fast and will blow you away.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2005"}

The dialog and the combat systems of Skyrim are dated, but the immense photo-realistic open game world, the riveting stories, and the rich contents, typical of The Elder Scrolls series, are all present. Skyrim is a place where a gamer can lose himself and live a different life. However, there is a potentially game stopping anomaly in the game that a gamer should be aware of - the difficulty setting of the game. I started out the game at the novice level with my Xbox 360. From level 1 to level 5, the game was relatively easy; my character got killed a number of times, mainly due to my ineptitude with the controls, but I got better and better every day. Then from level 5 to level 12, the game inexplicably became immensely more difficult, as if I was at the master level, even though I was at the novice level from the start. My character got killed every minute or so by enemies much, much stronger. There were times at which I couldn't go on with a mission because of immensely more powerful enemies. I had to back track to earlier saves. Then somewhere in the middle of level 12, the game got easy again. It was night and day (See Note). I killed dragons with a couple of firebolts and a few swings of my sword. I am aware of the new leveling system of Skyrim, where the NPCs do not level with the player character, but it doesn't explain what I experienced. For example, the strength of a pack of wolves should be the same at all levels. At level 3, when the game was easy, I dispatched the wolves with a few swings. However, at level 10, when the game was difficult, the wolves ate my lunch - one bite and half of my health was gone, another bite and my character was dead. In the meantime, I managed to make a couple of swings at one wolf and it hardly flinched, and I was surrounded by three. The wolves were not this powerful at level 3; why were they so powerful at level 10? I can't explain this; it has to be a software glitch.Another thing I like to mention is the interest in Skyrim as expressed by Ray Muzyka, CEO and co-founder of BioWare, whose latest work was Dragon Age II. He was quoted saying, \"We're checking [Skyrim] out aggressively. We like it. We're big admirers of [Bethesda] and the product. We think we can do some wonderful things.\" Wow, just imagine - a game with the advanced dialog wheel and the spectacular combat systems of Dragon Age II, and the immense open game world and riveting stories of Skyrim. It would be gamers' heaven.Note: To be specific, the difficulty seemed to return to the novice level after I interrupted the Skyrim game to play another. This involved removing the Skyrim disc and replacing with another game disc at the Xbox 360. When I returned to Skyrim, the difficulty level might have reset itself.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00006418I","description":"Wouldn't it be nice to play games without a cord stretching across your  living-room floor, especially if you have little kids or large dogs in your  household? Nintendo's Wave Bird isn't the first wireless controller ever brought  to market, but it's a whole lot better than what came before. You may remember a  brief fad a few years ago with spotty infrared devices. These units failed  because they were a lot heavier than standard controllers, and also because they  required a direct line of sight between the controller and the infrared  receiver. The Wave Bird is much lighter (it weighs a bit more than a regular  controller) and uses radio frequency signals for reliable game control at  distances of up to 20 feet. Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough. The unit will last for about 100 hours of use  on just two AA batteries and has 16 channel frequencies, so you'll easily be  able to hook up four controllers without interference.","reviewerName":"Scottypiper \"Scottypiper\"","summary":"Best GameCube Controller and works on Wii","reviewText":"I recently bought 2 of these grey color controllers from some local video game retailers and 2 platinum color from a local seller for pretty cheap. Not sure why I didn't get any of these during the GameCube era but I'm glad I have some now. I have over 170 games and my daughters are just at the age where they can start playing some of them.Quality: Official Nintendo brand and the best I have used. Quality is higher than any 3rd party controller.Playability: Each Wavebird and receiver has a frequency wheel numbered from 1 to 16. You just have to match the controller frequency to the receiver frequency. With 16 frequencies you can easily use four Wavebird controllers and just set each one to a different frequency. I use 1, 4, 8, & 12 and haven't had any issues. We used all 4 controllers to play Mario Kart, Medal of Honor, Mario Party, Pacman Fever, Bomberman, and many more.Conclusion: I have been using wired controllers for the GameCube since 2002 and with these wireless Wavebirds, I don't notice any difference in lag than with wired controllers. Absolutely the best controller for the GameCube and it will also work on the Wii for GameCube games and some Wii games (including most virtual console games). Not having cords to deal with and not having to worry about someone tripping over the cords and either ripping the controller out of hand or knocking your GameCube or Wii over is well worth it. The range on these is amazing. I've used them at 15 feet without any problems and they probably go further than that. The controllers run on two AA batteries. I just use some rechargeables. If you still play GameCube games on the GameCube or Wii (and some Wii games) and you don't want to worry about cords, get some Wavebirds. You won't be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2012"}

Catherine's core themes-those of free will, of the delicate nature of relationships and the choices we make within them, marry perfectly with the intense, terror-filled gameplay that serves to accurately reflect Vincent's growing sense of anxiety. It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"Lee","summary":"Very Unique","reviewText":"If you're a grownup hardcore gamer looking for something new and different, I would highly recommend getting this game. The game has two major parts: the first portion consists of just talking to people and interacting with stuff in a bar, while the second portion happens in a dream world where solve climbing puzzles.[Good]Theme: I can't think of any mature games set in modern times that don't involve guns aside from Catherine. It does have a mature PG-13 theme that deals primarily with relationships. It's a fresh take with a decent starting story. That being said I didn't like the dream world portion of the game. It was fine in the very beginning, but it just turns in to an unwanted distraction.Graphics: This is a great looking game. I really like the art style. It's so good that the in-game engine cut scenes actually look way better than the hand-drawn cut scenes. I actually didn't understand why they had any hand drawn cut scenes since the in-game ones were so much better and they were probably a lot cheaper to make.Choices affecting the world: Your decisions actually have some effect on the game. It determines who lives and dies as well as the ending. Most of these choices are morality based, right and wrong.Good Replay Value: There are three major endings, each having multiple variations, as well as unlockable multiple player. Also depending on the choices you make, it can affect whether the game's minor characters survive.Voice Acting and Script: The voice actors are great for an import game, and it's comparable to the voice acting you find on say Mass Effect. I also have to give credit to the translators. No matter how good your voice actors are, if they have bad scripts, it will never sound good. The writers did a really good job of adapting the script for Western audiences. It feels like a decent movie, with some exceptions.[Bad]Difficult: Even on 'Easy' mode, this game is really hard and frustrating. It's so bad that there's a secret 'Very Easy' mode. I think Atlus needs to realize that adults, the game's target audience, don't have a lot of time. Moreover the vast majority of us can afford every video game we want unlike our younger selves. I don't mind when a video game is really long (that's actually a good thing if the game is good). However I no longer have the time or patience to keep playing a game that's ultra hard and repetitive. I will not waste hours on one game when all it does is annoy me.Bad Controls: The controls for the actual puzzle game are just horrible. It's makes a hard, timed game even more difficult. I haven't been this angry with a video game since I was a kid.The main game itself: Even if the difficulty and controls were fixed, I didn't really care much for the climbing puzzle game. It was more of a repetitive, distraction than anything else. If it weren't for Catherine's graphics and the game's (non-dream world) theme, I would have rated this game with 1 star. Gameplay is that horrible.Choices affecting the world: While your decisions have some effect on the game, it is really limited. You can't change major plot points no matter how major your decisions are until the very end. I wish they would have mattered more.Cultural Issues: The game was built primarily for Japanese culture. While it has stuff in common with Western culture, there are many things that are different. I found it weird that the writers didn't fix this. This greatly affects the game's morality question portion. For example, I don't think most people outside of Japan will think that it's evil to have a bloody nose when you're excited. Like the script itself, the morality questions should have been adapted to Western audiences. Another major part where you see problems is in the plot itself. It's hard to fully understand unless you know that Japan currently has a population problem: not enough Japanese are getting married and having children. That being said, if you're familiar with Japanese media, you should be fine. For others, prepare to be confused here and there.[Verdict]I would recommend people try this game out. It's not without its flaws, but still a good and original game. The art style and theme are enough to overcome the weakness in the actual game itself. I hope Atlus makes a sequel that fixes all the issues, and releases it for Western audiences again. It was a good risk for them to take.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005ULXN","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"The greatest irony since Final Fantasy went PS","reviewText":"There are occasions when a fanboy has to fall on the floor laughing. PS fanboys celebrated when Final Fantasy went to Playstation, and now Nintendophils have something to celebrate. Sega was the first to accuse Nintendo of catering to children, and Sonic was the mascot \"bad boy\" that they were using to target the teens. Back then nobody bought the Nintendo only for kids garbage the way they do now (Excpet people who actually own a Nintendo system and know better. We forgive the ignorant media though.)Sonic was used to wage a war against Mario, a war that Sonic eventually lost. Nintendo and Sega were once very bitter rivals, both offering a decent system (the SNES being the better of the two but some Genisis games were still great.) But eventually Sega spent too much time on developing new machines and selling them at prices noone could afford and thier reputation went downhill. Playstation slaughtered the Saturn, and Sega all but vanished until the beauty that was the Dreamcast. The DC was a great machine with some amazing games and could have revived Sega if it weren't for some poor advertising and marketing.Considering the biter rivalry between Mario and Sonic, the hedghog landing in the GCN is perhaps the most ironic event since the Nintendo-Square break up. Not only that, but that Sega is offering Nintendo quite a line up from here on out as well!The game itself is far from graphically impressive, as it is only slightly enhanced from the Dreamcast version, however this game is so much fun that everyone should buy it! The problem I have with it is that I have never been good at Sonic games, and playing as the Sonic team I can't even clear the first stage. Playing as Dr. Eggman's (formerly Dr. Robutnick, I don't know why they changed the name) team I got much further. I do have a complaint about Rouge's fetch quests though. Each time you die (and you will) the item placement changes which can make the levels frusterating at times. There is one part where you have a five minute time limit to fetch a series of Choas Emeralds, a feat which I wonder if it is even acievable because there is no time to check the hints screens that are afloat, and the radar doesn't really held to determine which of the four floors the emeralds are. The stages that are the most fun are hands down Sonics and Shadows as both are lightning quick and the camera has been tweaked for much better performance than the DC version. There is no slowdown, no framerate drops, and aside from a couple of parts being too difficult for me (but mind you I suck at Sonic games) this game is great. Don't hesitate to buy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2002"}

Bound by Flame is NOT a highly-polished, AAA game.  This is, by all accounts, a very ambitious indie game in disguise.  Developer Spiders wasn&#8217;t trying to compete with the likes of Dragon Age or The Witcher (at least, I hope they weren&#8217;t&#8230;wow, haha).  However, what you get here isn&#8217;t bad at all and given the lack of options when it comes to RPG&#8217;s on the PlayStation 4, I found this game scratched that itch in a very satisfactory way.  The game has every semblance of what you&#8217;d expect in a Witcher/Dragon Age type game:  the dark fantasy vibe, elves, warriors, grotesque creatures&#8230;and of course you have open world structures like side quests, crafting, and upgrading.  There are definitely some half-baked ideas here and there, but pretty much everything from the story to the gameplay works just well enough to be serviceable and not a tiny bit more.The story has to do with destroying an Ice Lord and journeying to a magical netherworld called the Worldheart.  Honestly, the story isn&#8217;t anything to write home about and I can&#8217;t really say it was memorable in any way.  You create a character (with very limited options), and begin your journey.  You are quickly introduced to the battle system, which works in two stances you can switch between, plus the magic and stealth aspects you can add to them.  The warrior stance is for big swords, axes, etc. where you strike more slowly and powerfully, while the rogue stance uses daggers and is light, quick and less powerful.  Each stance has its own skill tree you can upgrade once you level up.  There is also Pyromancy, which adds fire (the only spell) to your attacks and/or defense.  That has a skill tree as well.  Combat pretty much boils down to a standard attack, an area-wide attack, blocking and dodge/kick.  Nothing very deep, but as I said earlier it&#8217;s functional.  The only thing that&#8217;s sorely missing is an evade move which would come in handy many times over.  It is really the biggest oversight by the developers.  I should definitely mention that this isn&#8217;t a button masher.  In combat, you MUST exercise caution and use your blocks and parries.  Simply mashing square is a surefire way to get yourself killed, especially in boss fights later in the game.  There are multiple difficulty levels, and they can definitely provide a tough challenge.  After getting reamed, I went from normal to easy, and even then the final boss took about 30 tries.One of the best-designed aspects of this game is the surprisingly useful crafting system.  To be blunt, crafting is how you get stuff done.  Need health or mana potions?  Just craft them!  Crafting materials are found literally everywhere from random chests and stashes to enemy drops.  This also applies to weapons and armor.  You also find Gold to buy things at shops, but shops and currency may as well not exist.  Gold is exceedingly rare and shops are prohibitively expensive.  But that doesn&#8217;t matter because 99% of the time the armor and weapons found at shops are far below your current stats, and the gear you find out in the wild is far better.  Any gear you find can be recycled into components for crafting upgrades, and that is always your best bet.  In essence you are your own &#8220;shop&#8221;&#8230;you can literally craft anything you will ever need on the spot.The writing and characters are, as expected, decent enough to keep you interested.  Amusingly, one particular character is pretty much a blatant rip-off of Morrigan from Dragon Age: Origins.  The voice acting can be pretty wooden, but you shouldn&#8217;t be expecting Uncharted-type acting in a game like this.  The game does contain a bit of profanity, but I actually saw that as part of its charm.  The dialogue is ever so slightly out-of-character for the setting and lore, but I loved that about it.  The game just doesn&#8217;t take itself too seriously.  The graphics are good as long as you don&#8217;t look too closely.  It&#8217;s far below eighth generation standards, but they don&#8217;t look bad.  On PS4 they&#8217;re in full 1080p while the frame rate ranges between around 30 to 60 fps, staying closer to 60 most of the time.  Not bad at all.  The textures have a slight cel-shaded look which actually doesn&#8217;t look bad.  A complete playthrough for me, doing every sidequest I could find, took me about 17 hours, so the game doesn&#8217;t overstay its welcome.In the end, I have to say I enjoyed this game way more than I expected to.  If you&#8217;re expecting the next Dragon Age, you&#8217;ll be sorely disappointed, but for a small game from a small studio, the game actually exceeds expectations.  I had a blast with it and am now interested in seeing what Spiders does next.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2014"}

If you have played quality RPG games such as Skyrim as I have, there is a high probability that you will have difficulty enjoying this game. I will explain my reasons below.ProsThis game does a few things well but these tend to be the norm these days. Visual design is solid and the atmosphere looks clean. Character model looks fine but nothing extraordinary.ConsThis game fell apart as I discovered many flaws in the basic mechanics of the game.1 - Difficulty level is artificially high. Even on the easiest setting, there are little loot to find in terms of ammo and health, which makes it very difficult to survive combats even in the beginning levels. Enemies gang up on you, which is fine, but you are unable to defend yourself due to lack of health potions. I consistently died and had no other option but to run away and wait for my health to regenerate.2 - Voice acting is REALLY REALLY bad. These actors sound like they just started acting. There is no conviction or passion in their voices, which combined with poorly-animated facial models, makes the cutscenes nearly unbearable to watch.3 - Combat is very sluggish. The response rate of control inputs seems laggy most times, and it takes several hits to take down enemies.4 - Enemies are dull and just lame in some cases. Strolling through the swamp, I was attacked by a tree and nearly died. Seriously??? A tree? Is this really worthy of putting into an action/RPG game???5 - Menu system and map navigation is confusing. I had a very hard time following the map to my next objective because the map does NOT rotate so even if you are walking to the left of the area, on the map it could show you walking to the right side of the map. It's hard to explain this but if you play the game you will know what I mean.6 - Upgrade system is flawed and useless. You gain XP by completing missions and defeating enemies, which earns you skill points that you can spend on the skill tree or passive skills. However, these don't seem to make a difference in your performance; I could not tell any difference at all even after leveling up to 7.Overall, there are just too many little flaws and quirks for me to enjoy this game.

However, as I was playing through the Wrestlemania story mode, problems ensued.For one thing, the computer AI got increasingly more difficult.  Not that this is a bad thing, but the game has a fatal flaw to it.  Even when the difficulty is set to EASY, and you decrease all the AI Reversals to MINIMUM, the computer is STILL too difficult, and you can't achieve the historical objectives.  In later matches, the computer opponents reverse like crazy!  WHY is this happening when the options have been tweaked to the easiest of settings?  Illogical.Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this is a deliberate attempt on behalf of the developers to get more money out of the public.  How?  With the Accelerator Pack DLC for $1.99 that unlocks everything in the game.  You can't unlock everything and get all of the superstars (except for one) without completing the 30 Years of Wrestlemania mode.  2K and Yukes are making it clear that you have to pay an extra $2 to do that.This devious tactic will NOT be tolerated.  In addition, why do you think this particular DLC is priced so low?  I would imagine that it would be priced really high, like future DLC packs, since it gives you everything.  It's priced at $2 so that people would be able to afford it due to the massive inconsistencies present in the Wrestlemania story mode.Save your money and do NOT buy this game!  I just revealed the developers' hidden agenda for all to see.  I'll be writing to them shortly about this as well.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7S","description":"","reviewerName":"Corey Turner \"The Musician\"","summary":"Even With Some Sun Brooding Will Occur","reviewText":"Max Payne met the last generation of consoles and gamers in two installments, both detailing the downward spiral of titular figure Max as he fought through slums, run down apartments, and his very own nature. Key companants to the Max Payne universe have been kept intact and is still ultimately a third person shooter. Rest assure 'bullet time' (slow motion) isn't just a fashion statement, nor are the sleek graphics. Crack open the Xbox 360 version and take a gander at disc two, Max in fact deeply understands satire, sporting a tropical button up and displaying a 'Breaking Bad' baldness, he's back.I emphasize the feel and look as this is a new premise for the series. There is far more to said about the presentation of the game, than the straight to the point shooting, which wasn't a great leap forward. The gameplay is not particularly intricate. Typical of todays third person shooters a cover system can be found nestled between pavement, objects and corners preventing you from eating bullets (and painkillers). It really might just be the overall projection of everything in motion that gives this title such sweeping charm.Nearly a decades past and Max is more cynical than ever, no longer a homicide detective, Brazil serves as his new drinking spot and not just when he's an off duty body guard. Sunshine and all this is not a bright game, credit goes to lead writer Dan House who apparently respected the complexity of the characters and the darker qualities surrounding them. Much like his work for Red Dead Redemption, another prolific Rockstar title, characters are  charicatures, parodies, capable of expressing far more about our society than most forms of prominent media. Max's engagement to protect a rich family who constantly include him in places he's least likley to thrive only bring out more of his jaded quips. Could one honestly imagine a Bruce Willis like figure lounging in a dance club complete with DJs oonce oonceing the place with house music? Martini glasses sipped on roof tops with glass siding to take in the high life in contrast to Max's desire to grip hard alcohol by his lonesome. Max does have a buddy though, Passos, who helps the player draw out more interesting dialogoue. No amount of yuppie yaht cruises or fevala trailing will keep his memories at bay, expect flashbacks. Expect to enjoy those flashbacks more so due in part by the dynamic Euophoria engine that throttles the animation(s). It's like revisting the past with gifts from the future.Every bullet is traceable in this game, certain executions trigger a cinematic approach to view the last moments of your enemy. Jokes on you though, this same fate can be met. Stay alert the cover system may of been a coveted feature, slowing down the action and leaving one to play whack-a-mole, but with no regenerative health abilities it's a life saver . Slow motion is a concept that sounds good on paper but hard to introduce on am multiplayer game without feeling broken. Think 'Dead Eye' in Red Dead, offline it wrack up dozens of slow motion eliminations, online its cheapened to a tool of quick fire to compensate. The multiplayer portion of the game actually works this in by having a player aim at the intended recipient. Slow motion will only be enabled for those caught in the way, so as to keep matches from constantly being stuck in the Matrix. Modes include a standard team deathmatch, free or all, and an experimental mode that has players fighting to become Max by eliminating whoever is selected as Max (odd I know).Player customization is faction specific, but what you can do with each model is astounding. There are minor and major character models to be unlocked, expect to see many of the same looking characters at first though. Leveling up uses a currency experience system, buy what you want for weapons, then assituate yourself on the battlefield, your weapon needs experience too. This sounds menacing, but it's surprisingly reasonable and enjoyable, it's a metagame within a metagame.The multiplayer isn't a true indication of skill, it can be lopsided, camping spots have already made way, it's a simple fun online investment. Accept it for what it is. If you'd like to use auto aim their is a partitioned set of playlists just for you. The only gripe I've had with this option is the pistols having no reticule 'bloom' making it easy to exploit. Other weapons still require one to feather the trigger. Overall the online could have been a lot worse, and it doesn't demand some goofy online pass code to play. It's a pop and play game where the menus feel like a left over from Grand Theft Auto IV and you don't even care.All in all Max Payne might just make for a better rental if you intend to hit up the campaign, you are a lot closer to disc two then you'd think. For a game series that hasn't been touched upon since the early 2000's, and having endured a rough film now fostered forever to its legacy, Max Payne has made a notable entry for 2012's hottest games. Big titles are scheduled this year, Max Payne more than likely isn't going to win any game of the year (GotY) awards, for what this is it works. The multiplayer may not be anything to write home about but it's entertaining, the story is all over the place, but the writing is alluring. Exchanges between characters are memorable, funny, interesting, things that are like a forgotten art in the world of game lingo tying down to \"tango down!\". The artsy flash of text on the screen from flashy or stale statements is a nice change, and ultimately while the story may hold similarity to the film \"Man on Fire\", it's how everything culminates. Shake but don't stir, some elements just work.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYILE","description":"","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Welcome to the American Jungle","reviewText":"Video gaming has come a long way since the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Game budgets have balloned into astronomical proportions and marketing campaigns have become blitzkrieg extravaganas.  Major video game titles, like the major \"tent pole\" movies of the summer Hollywood so heavily relies upon, represent significant investment of capital.  If you believe the marketing copy, each of these big budget video games represent the very best the video game industry has to offer. *Sadly, such hyperbole is very seldom the case, especially with non-Nintendo titles.  Unlike Nintendo's IPs, which are consistently recognized as some of the most enthralling, well-designed games out there, and also certainly among the most bankable, newer games must establish such a strong, realised world and marketing presence that big budgets are in demand.  While Nintendo and Mario/Link are the family friendly alternatives, there exists an large opening for more adult oriented fare to enter and dominate the market place.  Enter Rockstar and the GTA titles which, while always controversail, has long helped bring adult themed video gaming into the mainstream with writing that is both brilliant and deeply satirical of modern day life..GTA V follows the Grand Theft Auto social commentary satire the series is so famous for, and expands it tremendously, becoming a mirror of America after the economic downturn. Rockstar paraodies everything form Facebook to political classes to celeberity culture, etc.  The use of smart phones in our culture is also heavily featured.  GTA has become the video game equiliant to South Park - there is no sacred cow left standing by the end of Rockstar's commentary on America.CHARACTERS:  Rockstar changes up the GTA formula by introducing three main protagonists.  GTA V features Michael, a retired, bored middle-aged criminal who reminds me of Henry Hill's fate at the end of \"Good Fellas\"; Franklin, a young gang-banger reminsent of Carl Johnson, and Trevor, a psychotic, in-your-face nutjob who is so unhinged that you can't help but feel he is little more than a caricature than an actual person.  Of the three characters, Trevor is by far the most over-the top.  At any time (other than specific points restricted for story purposes) you are able to switch between the three characters, which are at differing locations depending on time of day.  The game will then take you to where the characters happen to be at the time. Each location fits into the character's story and place in the GTA universe.One of the weak points with the GTA series has always been the sometimes unavoidable narrative inconsistencies brought on by its open-ended gameplay, all the while moving the characters down specific narrative arcs.  Likewise, the Elder Scrolls games from Bethesda suffer from this flaw to some extent.  By introducing three characters, Rockstar is able to marry that illusion of cohesion between character and gameplay much better than the superficial unions of past games.STORY: Rather than gradually introduce a wide cast of supporting characters and develop their backstory, Rockstar has streamlined the writing, focusing largely on Trevor, Franklin, and Michael, at the expense of having numerous, secondary characters that so frequently stole the show in previous titles.  That's not to say there aren't any memorable secondary characters; rather, the narrative focuses on the big three (and I don't mean Harry, Ron, and Hermione) and delves expensively into their lives and how the characters' fates become inextricably intertwined as the game proceeds.SETTING:  After the sprawling landmass of GTA: SAN ANDREAS, which featured three cities divided by expansive countryside, deserts with secret government bases that may or may not hold alien bodies, and rural communities that appear to be straight out of Deliverance, GTA IV focused on a reimagined New York City.  GTA V returns to the west coast, taking place in Los Santos, one of the three cities first introduced in SAN ANDREAS.  While not as widely broad and disconnected as \"San Andreas\", GTA V features the series' biggest map yet, which also includes surrounding mountainsides and Sandy Shores, a costal village. Unlike previous titles, the entirety of Los Santos and the surrounding areas is available from the very beginning.  The gaming world, while always artificial, feels truly alive.GAMEPLAY:  The gameplay elements of GTA IV have all been finely tuned.  AI is superb,.  You can engage in a wide variety of activities, such as base jumping, cycling, flying, golfing, hunting, tennis, triathalons, vehicular racing, and yoga. Expanding on \"Vice City\", \"San Andreas\" and \"GTA IV\", you can also unlock vehicle storage facilities and purchases businesses and go on missions to help those businesses make profit.  You can even play the stock market on your smart phone.  There are also individual activities tailored to specific characters (Michael visitng a therapist and playing tennis or practicing yoga, Trevor hunting, etc).Like any GTA game, there is driving, and a LOT of it.  For a series focused so heavily on driving, GTA V is the first time that Rockstar has nailed the driving down so effectively.  Cars handle so much better overall (though the joy rides can still turn into some memorable crashes).  Certain elements of driving in past titles have been frustrating, due to how wildly odd they handle.  vehicles handle with precision, while still providing a wide variety of gaming experiences.  Unfortunaly the flying sequences are still dreadfully awkward to control  Another great addition is if you fail missions, you are no longer required to repeat the driving segments of those missions.MISSIONS:  The shining point of GTA V, undoubtedly, is the missions, which constitutes the core of the gameplay.  Several of the missions are tailor made to one of the three characters.  Michael's missions deal with his increasingly fragmented family life as he goes back into crime.  Franklin becomes more and more involved with grand theft auto and assassinations.  Trevor's missions intimately suit his extremely psychotic psyche with larger-than-life explosions and wild, freewheelin' rampages that would earn anyone in real life a one way ticket to an impenetrable mental instution.GTA V grades missions on different qualifiers, contingent upon completing optional objects as well as time, appealing to the speedrunners out there.  The biggest addition (and it's been a LONG TIME COMING), is, after failing a mission three times, you are able to skip that section of the mission, though your score will be directly effected.  Since the 1996 N64 classic \"Super Mario 64\", open world games have been notorious for having that one, infuriating mission.  In the GTA series, often times that mission must be passed in order to progress, and it's high time Rockstar has come up with a solution for those \"one mission\" nightmares that so often send us into tirades (I'm looking at you, \"Wrong Side of the Tracks\" from \"San Andreas\"!).  Why develop all these hours of content if, because of one mission early in the game, the player eventually puts down your product, with the game unfinished?  Likewise, you can replay missions at any time, another needed addition to the franchise.A major addition is the heist missions, which involve all three characters.  Rockstar is able to show off just how effective they are at featuring three protagonists in the Heists missions, and add a new depth of gameplay not previously seen in the GTA universe.  The heists can be done one of two ways: guns blazing, ala Clint Eastwood, or channel your inner Solid Snake and infiltrate and plunder by stealth.  Depending on what route you go, the three protagonists then must chose a crew (such as computer hackers, drivers, gunmen, etc) with varying degrees of experience.  The better the crew, the more expense, but the less likely the mission will fail or you will run into further complications.  The multiple character mode, the choice between stealth and combat, the action-packed setpieces, along with the variables of the crew you have chosen, make the heists some of the most engrossing missions ever seen in an open world game.  Unfortunately there is only a handful of such missions in the game.  The future of GTA, and sandbox games in general, resides in these type missions, and theres so much untapped potential in them that it almost comes off as a criminal waste.  Off the beaten path you will find a wide variety of one-off missions that are both fun and imaginative.VISUALS: Fantastic and breathtaking.  The game features a wide variety of environments for Rockstar to show off their graphical prowess, from scuba-diving sequences to cross-country to wealthy neighborhoods to seedy, dank areas more terrifying than they are amusing.  The variety of locals is astonishing and adds to the overall texture of the game.  You will be very hard-pressed to find a more gorgeously looking game on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, with all the details becoming much more crisp and the character animations superb.SOUND:  Fantastic as always.  GTA V does everything the other games in the series does and more, with a wider variety of musical content, new original music, and the best talk radio (featuring the GTA III perennial favorite Lazlo) this side of Rush Limbaugh.  The voice acting is top-notch, as always.CRITICISM:  The game comes across as rather misogynistic, with no strong female characters treated with respect, even given the criminal nature of the gameplay. Sometimes Frankenstien's seams show through, breaking the illusion of reality, and the scripting becomes apparent.  While boundary-pushing content has always been a hallmark of the game, there is an (unskippable) torture mission that Trevor must complete that is little more than a veild criticism on the US policy of waterboarding.  Even for a game as intentionally lewd and morally reprehensible as GTA V, this mission is deeply troubling and the one time that Rockstar breaks the illusion of \"this is just a video game\" and actually feeling dirty about yourself as a human being, even though you are playing as Trevor.ENDING COMMENTS:  The GTA games have become a massive cultural phenomena the likes of which few games can attest too, attracting both controversy and fanatical players.  With the release of GTA III in 2001, Rockstar introduced a fantastically realised, open sandbox world which was deeply satirical in nature and have only built on the foundations laid by that groundbreaking game.But twelve years in the electronic entertainment industry and pop culture in general can be an eternity.  With the prevelanace of increasingly violent and sexual content regularly displayed throughout our culture, games like GTA V aren't quite as shocking as they were in 2001, let alone 1994 with Mortal Kombat's spine-ripping fatalities went all the way to the United States Congress.  Even Christine Hefner, Hugh Hefner's daughter, has stated pornography has become such mainstream that it can hardly qualify as edgy anymore.  By this point, the major groundbreaking gameplay elements introduced in GTA III has become a matter of course for big-budget titles.  To Rockstar's credit, they have prefected and honed the GTA gameplay to such fine precision that GTA V stands proudly as among the best games ever made in the admittedly very young medium of video gaming [history].Overall, despite the jaded, cynical culture we now live in, GTA V pushes the boundaries of sex, drugs, and violence to a new level.  Like Insane Clown Possy's Dark Carnival mythology , I believe Rockstar is more moral than their detractors allow for.  They hold up a twisted, exaggerated picture of life in America today, twisted by crime and sleaze which is enacted by deeply pathological, flawed people.  Essentially, GTA V is a video game equivalent of the sleaze of Guns N Roses's \"Appetite For Destruction\", and, more specifically, \"Welcome to the Jungle\".And what a twisted, warped, manically unhinged jungle that truly is.*Both Steven Speilberg and George Lucas said Hollywood's reliance on huge blockbusters would cause the implosion of Hollywood's business model when several pictures costing over one hundred million would fail to recoup their investment, shaking the studios to their very core, Modern video games can also represent a significant investment of capital.  Disney's video game division estimates the new Disney Infinity game, with its focus on NFC enabled action figures, has a development price tag of one hundred million dollars.  Disney's video game division has lost 3.4 billion between 2010-2013.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2013"}

It has openness and freedom similar to TES, but with more visceral combat and better character building like DA. It's very reminiscent of Dragon Age Origins, only with more freedom and a less engaging story.The scenery looks beautiful, though trees and leaves never move (which is only noticeable when you stop to look closely). But would I want that if it caused combat slowdowns? No. I stopped dozens of times just to admire the scenery.The combat is dynamic (making a fight vastly different depending on factors as simple as the terrain), responsive and mostly satisfying. E.g., after downing a troll, his dropped club rolled down a small hill; for some reason, it stayed with me. Very cool.Combat is like a cross between Dragon Age and Demons Souls. And it's not that far below an all combat game like God of War. (But two ability wheels are a must for a sequel.) Amalur has probably the best combat in any RPG I've played.I love the openness of the world (ginormous) and the varied landscapes. Forest, plains, desert, swamp...The flexibility of character building: no classes, just allocate points into whichever tree you want (mage, warrior or rogue). And the ability to completely respec your character whenever you felt like was great.Literally hundreds of quests (I completed 213 with a dozen tasks that could be completed multiple times) with a wide variety of goals.You can name self crafted equipment.Reckoning mode adds a nice twist to RPGs.There are actually some pretty cool cut scenes, epic battles (including a siege) and good boss fights.Cons:No voice for the main character.Names for NPCs, towns and enemies felt a little too \"fairy tale-ish\"; almost old fashioned and childish.Combat was too easy, even on hard. Potions and even money were abundant. I had almost 3 million gold at one point!Decent voice acting, but terrible lip syncing during conversations.Only four quick slots for powers. So if you want to switch between a healing power and a lightning bolt (while keeping the other three abilities available), you have to go all the way into the menu of your abilities, select the healing spell, place that into a slot, back out into the game world, use that spell, then to go back to the abilities to re-enter the lightning bolt into your quick slot. R2 should've accessed the second ability wheel (instead of activating stealth).It doesn't tell what your critical hit chance is. It would've been helpful to know.No weather effects.Some pop in.The finesse ability tree pales in comparison to might and sorcery.Uneveness of skills: blacksmithing, sagecrafting and detect hidden were easily the best skills, while mercantile, persuasion and lockpicking hardly helped.A level cap of 40. Once I hit that, I lost some enthusiasm for the game (though I regained most of it during the last quest).Conclusion: I feel way too many have focused on the negatives without mentioning the positives of KOA: Reckoning. This is one of the best gaming experiences I've had on the PS3. It's a shame the developer went bankrupt, because I would LOVE a sequel. Hopefully, someone picks up the rights and we get that down the line.PS: The House of Valor quest line (that only comes with new copies) is a great addition and worth the extra $.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2012"}

The graphics and cinema alone are gorgeous,but make no mistake that this game is just eye candy or cutscene after cutscene. During the first parts of gameplay with the \"go here,get this or talk to this person\" quests you will find yourself smiling with the fluid movements and the innocent backdrop of a 1950s setting. Once you get to the parallel world and start battles,prepare to \"ooo\" and \"ahh\" even more.The voice acting is well done in English (this is just my opinion,I know alot of people prefer Japanese) esp. in regard to your sidekick Mr.Drippy. Not since Jaunty of the Shadowman games,have I loved Scottish/Irish accents this much!The battle mechanics are an amazing homage to the old school rpgs with some action thrown in for something a bit fresh. As soon as my first battle was underway,my first thought was \"Yes! They are finally brining this back!\" Even as Mr.Drippy was explaning the mechanics to me,I just had to smile and think to myself \"Yeah! Hit the attack command pay attention to your HP and MP meters. Get the enemies HP meter down to zero.\" The action aspect is easy to get the hang of and you'll soon find yourself dodging attacks and sneaking up on enemies.For my preference,I am starting the game on the Easy difficulty. I'll kick it up to normal gameplay on the second runthrough (and who knows how long that will take?)The story is addicting and unlike many rpgs as of late (and I'm not complaning about this) it is not too serious. Although the death of Oliver's mother and his mourning can be somewhat heartwrenching in the begining;the sorrow quickly turns to joy just as Oliver's tears turn his plush doll into Mr.Drippy. From what I have seen of the White Witch,she is a very alluring and convincing villain. One of both beauty (be it dark) and an intimidating,cold power that never waivers.I could go on,but this review would never end and I'm sure it's already been said by other members. I just wanted to add my 5 stars to the growing list of praises. I am honestly tempted to go out and buy two or three more copies of this game and keep them shrink wrapped.

{"product_name":"B000B6ML28","description":"Project Gotham 3 zooms onto the Xbox 360, expanding many of the features you&apos;ve grown to love. In these races, speed alone isn&apos;t enough to win. You have to pull some of the wildest moves you&apos;ll ever see. See if you have what it takes, in updated version of incredible racing challenges.","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"Somehow, it betters PGR2.","reviewText":"Anyway, PGR was always a brilliant idea. When it comes to that warning about not using these driving techniques in real-life that devs whack on the front of racing games these days, it lurks somewhere in the gap between Ridge Racer's \"because you will die\" allusions and GT's \"because nobody's this good\". When you clamp the accelerator and fishtail the back of the car and then wrestle it straight, it isn't just forgiving, it actually awards you points. Applying this to exiting tight turns and using a model that rewards sharp braking and traction loss was inspired.It was inspired in Metropolis Street Racer, it was inspired in the first PGR. It's still inspired. It's not a realistic game - you bump and scrape when you should be deflating like a turbo-accordion, and the collisions between cars on the track and the AI drivers' apparent lack of concern about them and the way you're all bashing past each other is wrong, but that's easily overlooked because the core skill that it asks you to develop is so satisfying. And that clicking of the Kudos meter, which tots up points for drifting, drafting, riding the curb tightly, and comboing it all together and suchlike, tickles your ears with the promise of points to go with your podium positions.PGR3 arrives on Xbox 360 with surprisingly little to add to the mechanics and structures that underpinned PGR2. Career mode allows you to pick one of five difficulty settings before tackling each challenge - and your daring or confidence in your ability informs the choice, because if you don't live up to the goal you've set you won't bank any points. Challenges range from racing and time trial affairs that are about speed to more technical cone and drift challenges that are about stringing Kudos-heavy moves together, and each adopts a different route through one of the game's city areas - London, Vegas, Tokyo, New York and Nurburgring (Ok so Nurburgring's not a city, but it might as well be for the distance and range it offers). On top of that, every single task synchs ever so elegantly with global leaderboards, so even the highest-ranked will have something more to push for.Its principle divergence is in the way it separates these tasks from car classes. Now you simply go to a shop and buy yourself a car with credits earned by completing challenges - the idea being that you can use your favourite car throughout if you like. Along with the five grades of difficulty, this gives the game a level of accessibility that would've been alien in MSR or PGR, and even PGR2. You can make easier progress and move off tougher tasks by brushing them aside on lower difficulties, and the balance is such that even an accomplished racer will need to work for those Hard (gold) medals, which lurk tantalisingly just out of reach when you first attempt them, and their credit benefits, and Hardcore achievements are just that. Collecting cars as you go rather than having them prescribed will please everybody who ever whinged about the truck class in PGR2.But you know what? I hate those bastards who whinged about the truck class, given what's happened. The concessions have bred profligacy by design. You gain enough credits by smashing through the relatively easy silver-medal band of races that you can amass a garage of Enzos, DBR9s, TVRs and other high-end machinery within a few short hours. The central Kudos mechanic of having to put your own imagined potential where your BHP is by selecting a target score before a race remains good - although personally I preferred the way you played with your shades of ambition by more closely defining your goals in the older games, half-second by half-second - but this is now more of a personal quest than a predefined one. It lacks incentives beyond the colours of medals, the ranks on Live and the badges you can earn that celebrate 360 spins and tasks completed in one combo. These are good incentives admittedly, but they're not as good as cars and new tracks were in the olden days.PGR3 also plays with the separation of offline and online, and does this to better effect. Live's integration in single-player is limited to leaderboards and downloadable ghosts in Career mode (two of the best things ever done with Live, frankly), but now there's a distinct Online Career, with its own Live-specific Kudos-accumulation. There's a range of events to join in with at any given time. You can also set up your own Live races of course, in the game's Playtime area, and the way the game matches your connection speed and skill level to random opponents seems to work even at this early stage in the console's life.The Route Creator, meanwhile, opens up a great many possibilities. It's simple to set up routes between start/finish and the waypoints available, and the results are easily distributable. But while the selection of cities is decent and the number of possibilities is barely conceivable (until a load screen somewhat comically suggests you \"create over 100 million\"), and nobody's questioning the devs' meticulousness in modelling each environment, the area covered is actually surprisingly small. Take London for example (since I live here) - the area covered is a fairly small section about ten minutes from my front door (by foot, mind you - not in a DBR9 or anything), and runs from Victoria Embankment through Trafalgar Square, loops round Piccadilly Circus without reaching upper Regent Street, and then circles back down to Pall Mall, St James's Park, and straight back to Big Ben. It's not that big. The Getaway's mapped area was many times the size and you could do the in-between bits. What is included works well - each city section features several memorable turns, straights and distinctive sections that combine to good effect, and to be fair Vegas and the winding sections of Tokyo feel more varied than London - but you have to wonder whether all that time wireframing buildings might have been better spent.Which leads me inexorably to the question of how the game looks. This is undoubtedly the main thing people know about PGR3 at this point: the cars are enormously detailed, the environments are thoroughly mapped and modelled, and the visuals are presented in resolutions hitherto unseen on console hardware. And yeah, you've picked up on the tone - this is the point in the review where I say I don't think it makes as big a difference to the play experience as everyone's been so breathlessly declaring elsewhere.Someone asked me a whole bunch of questions about PGR3's graphics yesterday. If it was true that the tarmac was virtually photo-realistic, if it was true all the pedestrians were 3d models, if it was true that you could stop and read the hoardings on the buildings, and see the light bouncing off windows and so on. Frankly I don't really know. My recollection of the tarmac is that it passes under me like a blurry grey conveyor belt, because I'm moving so damn fast. The spectators I only see when I stop, and that's only when I've screwed up, and when that's the case they're hardly my priority. The things you notice are the big things - the sun creeping over the skyscrapers in Shinjuku, the incredibly pronounced and sometimes blinding effect when you emerge from tunnels, the trees lining a road, the wealth of scenery. In terms of providing a world around the track, PGR3 goes the furthest so far, and yes, everything's presented in ways that other consoles can't present it, in a game that even PC owners who can reach these visual heights haven't much to compare directly to.But you're only really going to notice where most of the grunt went in replays. Or on Gotham TV. The latter is a nice idea, but kind of ignores the unspoken truth about replay modes: they are boring. Watching the best of the best do their stuff is interesting, but watching eight mediocre players bashing into each other is not. Being one of as many as 30,000 people doing so simultaneously is a technical accomplishment, not an extra point on the score. Then if you look around, you're forced to admit that the spectators are automatons, and the trees aren't moving. It's quite a sterile environment, for all its definition and the wealth of objects outside the track boundaries.But let's say you view it as a spectacular whole - even at this, for the most part the enormous amounts of incidental detail presuppose that you aren't actually racing. When you are, the key things are being able to see the next corner, or the next cone gate distinctly, and here the game is no better than any other. You'll notice far more impressive effects and depth of background material than you ever have before, and when you fiddle with that Photo viewer mode and actually marvel at the vehicle exteriors, you'll be hard pressed to think of another car model that includes as much. It's like watching those GT videos before Polyphony actually had to run them through the ancient PS2 graphics tech.But we do still truly love the clicking of the Ferrari.Hop into the cockpit view, which many are eulogising, and you'll certainly feel more immersed than you have elsewhere, owing thanks to the terrific engine sounds and enormous amount of in-car detail. But it's also kind of peculiar, because when you're in a car you don't find that half of your view is taken up by steering wheel, dashboard and the frame of the car; you focus on what's outside of the windscreen. The windscreen filter here is lovely, but unless you really divorce yourself from the interior modelling it feels more like you're leaning forward from the backseat, and the viewing window is quite restrictive. In the end I preferred the bumper cam, as I often do, not least because it's much easier to get a handle on the precise demands of the Kudos challenges and see what's coming when the track ahead fills the whole screen.Let's give it its dues: when played from this perspective, PGR3 is an excellent, well-refined racing game. Cone Challenges, Drift Challenges, Street Races, Hot Laps, Eliminators, Time vs Kudos (where you stop the ticking down of the clock by playing up to the Kudos system - an excellent idea) - all are good, most are ridiculously compulsive thanks to the superb balancing of the medal targets, so much so that you'll happily pause and restart them every time you spin off and the chap ahead quickly builds up an unassailable lead. And while the range of challenges will probably feel a bit narrow to people who have stuck with the series since its birth on the Dreamcast, the temptation to try and scale those greater heights will appeal to the arcade mentality that still lurks within a lot of players.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2006"}

It works.","reviewText":"On the HD consoles, Sonic Generations is a 3D platformer that follows \"Classic Sonic\" and \"Modern Sonic\" through stages all across the history of Sonic games. The big gameplay feature of this game is that you get to experience, for instance, the same old Green Hill Zone in a 2D (but with HD graphics) perspective as before, but then in Act 2 you get to see things in a 3D perspective... which is really a whole new stage but with that look and feel of the classic. And then the contrary happens with the stages based on 3D Sonic games. It is actually a great game with its own merits.Now back to the 3DS version. They could have very well ported it with dumbed down graphics or something, but instead they opted to do a 2D focused game with its exclusive set of stages. That means that most of the stages you will play on this version are not on the main version. This is pretty cool and since the gameplay is 2D focused, it feels more attached to the expected classic Sonic gameplay than the HD game. In this case, modern Sonic still plays in 2D but has a different set of moves and it is more focused on Speed runs than platform jumping.Another thing that I like about this game is that it features things like Special stages (where you get the emeralds) and it has a Casino themed level from Sonic 2. These are iconic Sonic elements that are not present in the HD game.This game also features Online versus play and side missions if you feel like doing that after you are done with the main game.If there are a few things I didn't like are the following: 2D Sonic for some reason doesn't feel as \"fluid and thight\" as the classic Genesis games. There is a long discussion on the quality of more recent Sonic games and it seems like Sega is slowly working to improve that, but until then I feel that they are \"almost there, but still not quiet\". The best example of this is playing Green Hill Zone on the original Sonic and then playing the new Green Hill Zone of Generations. It definitely doesn't feel the same, for whatever reason.There's a misconception that Sonic should just keep running forever and non-stop, and Sega has been making modern Sonic games based on that idea. The problem is that when you need to stop and do some platform jumping or something that requires precision, control issues will betray you over and over. This is more true on the HD outing but Modern Sonic suffers some of that here as well. Sonic games have reached a point where they feel like they rely more on quick-time event mashing than actual platformer skills. Anyway hopefully Sega will find a way to fix this. Eventually. Someday.Sonic Generations is a nice 2D platformer. Sonic fans will love it, and if you can play the HD version as well, even better.If you don't know much about Sonic, it is still a great game to play. I don't know if it is a must have though, it probably isn't. But if you get it you will enjoy it for what it is.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2013"}

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising. Players can choose from six different classes in multiplayer, each with its own set of pros and cons. Just as in the single-player mode, multiplayer games will feature dynamic elements, making each session unique.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemMicrosoft Windows XP with Service Pack 2 or Windows VistaCPUIntel Pentium 4 3.2 GHz, Intel Pentium D 2.66 GHz, AMD Athlon 64 3500+ or betterIntel Core 2 Duo Family, AMD 64 X2 5200+, AMD Phenom or betterMemory1 GB2 GBHard Drive Space12 GB of free spaceGraphics HardwareNVidia 6800 or ATI X1650 or better; must support Pixel Shader 3.0Nidia 8600 GTS or better, ATI X1900 or better","reviewerName":"Brian J.

I don't know what UBISoft charges for phone support, but it probably isn't free.What is an activation? Install the game, that's an activation. Change a piece of hardware, that uses an activation. Reinstall Windows without changing any hardware, that uses up an activation. You might even use up an activation upgrading a video or sound driver. Adding a USB peripheral device could use up an activation. You get 5 of these, then the game ceases to function and you'll get a message saying that you need to buy a new copy (not call them for more activations as it should say).SecuROM has been known to give users errors or not allow an installation to occur due to CD/DVD drive incompatibility problems (usually older drives). You will typically get CRC or checksum errors while a file is being read from the drive. SecuROM also maintain a \"black list\" of processes where it won't allow the game to run if you have one of these black listed programs installed or running.SecuROM is just plain bad news for the honest customer and to make matters worse it hasn't had much impact on piracy at all. In fact, the pirates enjoy greater freedom and far less headaches than the honest customer.

They barely mention any of the events that happened in the previous game.  Some of the story seems drawn out purposely to fill the game out and hurried in some parts.The things that keep you occupied in between memory sequences (the main storyline) are pretty fun.  Assassin contracts, Buying property and renovating Rome, Borgia Towers(they could have made each one a bit harder to destroy but still fun), Guild challenges that are both fun and annoying will keep you killing guards long after the story is finished, TONS of unlockable stuff like the 2 capes you can only get by reaching level 30 in Project Legacy on Facebook and syncing your game save to your Facebook page.  And in game cheats you can use when replaying memories for unlocking full synchronization for a full chapter of memories.Multiplayer is like nothing i've ever played anywhere.  The ability to either run around and assassinate other players or discreetly walk up to them and kill em is amazing.  The most fun ive had in multiplayer comes from when you are first and have up to 3 people hunting you at the same time while you are trying to kill someone yourself.  Pulling off a silent kill or a not so discreet one then trying to pull a triple escape.Whether you are Running around Rome taking on 10+ Guards and pulling off Execution kills one at a time or running around different cities trying to kill other players in Multiplayer This game is pure fun.  AC2 was great but i have to admit i put the game down after i beat it and had no need to play it again after i got the trophies.  I can see myself playing this again because even after beating the game and getting all the single player trophies there is still alot more things to complete.  I highly recommend to anyone who is a Assassin's Creed fan or just wants a great looking and playing game that might be lacking in the story side.  10/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2010"}

However, it wasn't until two years later that Nintendo really perfected the 3-D adventure genre with the release of \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\".\"Ocarina\" is, for lack of a better word, a nearly perfect game in almost every sense.  The graphics are great (for N64 standards), the music is fantastic, the gameplay is smooth, and the story is incredibly engaging.  Much like the Mario franchise before it, the Zelda franchise (although already somewhat established on the NES and SNES) took a simple character (Mario to Zelda), put him in an interesting environment (Mushroom Kingdom to Hyrule), and pits him against fantastic enemies.Of course, perhaps the true greatness of \"Ocarina\" is its balance between the essential gameplay and the sidequests.  While this game added more depth (riding a horse, getting items that, while not vital to the outcome of the game, will help you, etc.) than any previous game in history, it also wasn't too complicated (see \"Donkey Kong 64\").  In the game, Link has a straight-forward mission and accomplishes each objective in sequence...you only need to pursue the frivolous things if you so desire.The quirkiness of the game is also charming.  Along the way, Link meets a talking tree, gets trapped inside a fish's belly, befriends the roly-poly Gorons, and liberates temples that each correspond to some sort of natural theme (forest, ice, water, fire, etc.).  The first time I ever played \"Ocarina\", and every time since, I found myself amazed by the crazy and colorful characters that Nintendo came up with for each area of the game.Finally, a great adventure games also needs to have an intriguing plot (i.e. the reason why the \"Myst\" computer game series was such a big success while its clones failed), which \"Ocarina\" delivers superbly.  Right away, you are drawn into the storyline that includes rescuing Princess Zelda, defeating the evil Gannondorf, and bring peace to Hyrule again.  I know it may sound cheesy, but without an engaging plot the game would have been little more than a sword-slashing RPG with a few puzzles thrown in.Thus, I recommend \"Ocarina of Time\" to all gamers, whether young or old, beginners or experts.  The difficulty curve is set as such that you will be able to steadily improve your skills in time to defeat each obstacle before you, while enough really challenging side quests exist that you can also hone your skills to a \"tee\" if so desired.  So whether you want to fire up the old N64, dust off the old Gamecube (for which a version of \"Ocarina\" was released), or buy the game on the Virtual Console of your Wii, do so with confidence that you will instantly be charmed by this amazing work of video game creation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000099T2H","description":"The sequel is here with new challenges, enhanced graphics, and eviler terrorists!","reviewerName":"Robert P. \"Hugs and Curses.\"","summary":"Socom II delivers BIG!","reviewText":"Well we waited and here it is.  Socom II has been released and the hype has been satisfied.  Now, I'm not into stealth combat games so I cannot review the single player campaign as I have yet to even begin it, but we all know that this game is about the multi-player aspect.If you played the first game online, you are familiar with the excitement of seeking out and killing either terrorists or SEALs depending on the side you've chosen.  Now the exact same thing has been recreated, and vastly improved upon.The new maps are phenomenally detailed.  They are larger and have a ton of new features.  Fortresses that need to be breached via c4 explosives, gun turrets to take out enemies, thermal sites in the maps that are dark and so forth.  The new maps are plainly HUGE.  I've noticed a lot more draws on the new maps, as there are just so many places to hide.  If you don't believe me, spend a set of rounds on &quot;Shadow Falls&quot;.  The new maps feature tons of ground foliage to hide in, abandoned buildings, the new turrets.  All of this hiding leads to a heart pounding time as you lie in wait, praying that your enemy will show up and get his chest blown up.  The old maps have been upgraded as well, and whereas I haven't yet played them all on II, I've seen enough to know that they look good and have some new changes, such as all the tunnels being connected on &quot;Frostfire&quot; and &quot;Rat's Nest&quot; being changed to a nighttime map, which makes it look much cooler.Speaking of the enemy, it does take a bit more to kill them.  In SOCOM I a simple 2-4 shots would leave a dead body before you, whereas now it takes 4-6 shots to down the opposition.  This is a double edged sword.  You take more hits so you can survive a bit longer, but so does your opponent, so make sure you have red crosshairs for quite a few seconds, or you're cycling through teammates for the next 4 minutes.The online menu has been expanded as well.  A friends list makes it so easy to find the people you love to play with, just check your list and find the room they're in.  If theres a slot, jump in.  If not, join as a spectator and wait for one to open.  The rankings have also undergon a dramatic change.  No longer do you guess how you did and who is the MVP.  The game keeps a score for everything done.  6 points for surviving a winning round, 5 if you died but your team won the round.  5 points for being the player whom plants the bomb or frees the hostage, 2 points for a kill and -2 for suicides.....so dont fall of cliffs or throw grenades into the wall that land at your feet.  Of course, I do it all the time.  All of this score keeping determines the MVP of the round.  Very simply, most points equals MVP.

{"product_name":"B002I0J82G","description":"","reviewerName":"James Donnelly \"Ave Atque Vale\"","summary":"More for a Multiplayer Fanatic, Less for Story-Based Gaming.","reviewText":"I'm a big fan of combat FPS's. They tend to have a pretty solid arc to the story that the combat revolves around. The CALL OF DUTY: MODERN WARFARE series capitalized on this very heavily and very successfully. COD, though, is pretty restrictive as well as far as vehicular combat. There really isn't any. Sure, you might get on a snowmobile or a Zodiac or man a 20mm gun on a helo or a gunner on an AC-130, but other than that, you're Oscar Mike with Boots on the Ground.BATTLEFIELD 3 successfully expands that idea, and has you in tanks, manning Technicals, and being co-pilot/navigator in an F/A-18 Super Hornet. While these missions are exciting, they're not particularly fun, especially the tanks. The controls are too clumsy. In my dreams, they're creating games that give you the ability to be involved in almost every aspect of sea, air and land combat (from fighter/bombers to subs to being a sniper's spotter to piloting UAV's, etc.), but those are just dreams.Where BATTLEFIELD 3 does go a little off the rails is in its attempt to create a clever story arc for the main character, which very much resembles the 2nd-Gen Combat FPSBlack, also by EA. Of course the graphics are beautiful in the cut-scenes, and the voice acting, while nowhere near the quality Activision gets for the COD games (Gary Oldman, Ed Harris, Lance Henriksen, and the onmi-present Keith David just to name a few), is good (although the only memorable name is Glenn Morshower). However, the fluidity of the combat controls in COD are more efficient than they are here, and the characters of each of the heroes as well as the villains are much more fleshed out in all the COD games (and I'm even including BLACK OPS in this as well), and the story is pretty weak.Of course, where the game really shines, apparently, is in its Multiplayer category. Now I enjoy Multiplayer, and I've logged far too many hours playing MW3 multiplayer, but there's a simplicity to MW3's multiplayer aspects as opposed to the several times I've tried to play multiplayer on this game and found myself just not enjoying it.I can't fault EA and DICE for being this ambitious for the really epic multiplayer sensibilities within BATTLEFIELD 3, but for someone who is perfectly happy with more basic multiplayer elements (the COD multiplayer interface is MUCH easier to use in selecting your map of choice), I guess I just feel too overwhelmed in the multiplayer aspect of this game and a little too underwhelmed by the story and combat mechanics of the game to find a lot of repeat playability in it.Probably not too far off from trading it in.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2012"}

Set 150 years from now, the world has been ruined by war and ecological disaster with only a handful of survivors remaining.End Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"M. DiSpirito \"mentored1\"","summary":"Despite potential, it's an Odyssey to Mediocrity","reviewText":"Greetings Amazonites!Enslaved got a lot of great reviews--and in many ways, the game deserves a lot of praise.  There are many things to love about this game, but I found some glaring problems that made the game unplayable.  Your mileage may vary, but I'll lay out my thoughts in my patented 3-tier system.ENVIRONMENT (5 Stars): this is the strongest part of the game, by far.  The detail in the terrain, buildings, and characters is top notch.  It's hard not to be immersed in the broken, overgrown landscape of some futuristic New York wasteland.  The characters look and move great, with good attention to detail.  The music and sound is fitting and strong throughout.  The battle sounds and hits sound tough and brutal.  There were some repetitive scenes; even the bright, beautiful colors can get redundant when everything is bright and green.  Regardless, there's little fault to be found in the game's environment.GAMEPLAY (1 star): this is the weakest point of the game.  The controls are okay--simple and effective, with little to confuse the player.  The problem comes from level design and camera control.  Many of the levels have confusing areas that are hard to see due to the angle of the camera.  All the levels are linear, and the way across is often highlighted by glowing objects or markers; this is fine, but it really takes the challenge and thrill of discovery away.  It's boring to know you're going to have to hop from point A to point B along a pre-determined path.  If you enjoyed Tomb Raider, or similar games, you'll likely enjoy this part of Enslaved.The camera is a pain in the neck.  It's hard to get it where you want (the camera controls feel restrictive) and the camera often moves and resets on its own.  This makes seeing how to get across certain areas tricky--I died way too often because I couldn't determine the correct path around a certain area, or I got stuck trying to make a jump or find a route because I couldn't see the right angle.  The camera is equally frustrating when you're attacked by a group of enemies.  Oftentimes you can't see all the enemies and they'll blindside you; sometimes you don't even know where they all are!  I found these camera problems frustrating.DESIGN (3 stars):  The story is intriguing enough to want to see it through, but there's really no surprises or anything to make you feel like you're in control.  It feels and plays out very linear, very scripted; the player is just tagging along with the characters and watching a movie script unfold.  A lot of games are like this, and it's fine for a lot of gamers, but I like to be more involved in a game than just jumping around and beating up bad guys.  There are too many elements in Enslaved that give the feeling of constraint: the linear storytelling, the lack of choices in dialogue or what path to take, and the constrained level design coupled with a frustrating camera.The characters and their relationship to one another is very interesting.  The different personalities are well-realized; it's pretty intriguing to see the characters develop.  This is the strongest part of the game and redeems some otherwise lackluster elements.OVERALL (3 stars): The game has interesting and sometimes captivating characters.  The environments, graphics, and sound are beautiful and well done.  The camera controls are wacky and very annoying throughout most of the game.  The level design is one way only and there is no choice in path or outcome.  Ultimately the game is constrained, linear platformer with great visuals and characters.  Almost like Mario Brothers with a better story and nicer graphics.  If you enjoyed Tomb Raider or similar games, you may enjoy this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2010"}

This game was released in 1998 and was once again, developed by Naughty Dog, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and distributed by Universal Interactive Studios. It was originally a PlayStation exclusive but was later re-released as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation Store.The game&#8217;s story takes place immediately after the events of the second game in which the ruins of the Cortex Vortex come crashing down to Earth and lands on a temple unleashing an evil entity known as Uka Uka who is Aku Aku&#8217;s evil twin brother; Aku Aku is the mask that helped Crash out in the first two games. Uka Uka joins with Doctor Neo Cortex and Doctor Nefarious Tropy as they plan to gather Crystals in their original places in time and use their energy to enslave the Earth.The game is once again a platformer with pretty much the same kind of controls as the second game. You can not only play as Crash but also as his sister Coco who was a supporting character in the second game. You travel back and forward in time to gather the 25 Crystals from the previous game in their original places in time before the enemy does; but don&#8217;t worry, the levels are completely different from each the second game. The game takes place in the Time-Twisting Machine which acts as the hub area of the game. The machine is split into five chambers with only the first chamber being available at the start. Each chamber has five buttons that open portals to different levels. The goal is the same as the second game; obtain the crystal hidden in the area. Some crystals can be obtained in the middle of the level or by completing a certain task such as winning a race. The gems are also back and can only be obtained by destroying all the boxes, or completing a hidden level or task. Once you obtain the five crystals in a chamber, a sixth button will appear that warps you to a boss who will fight you in order to get the crystals back. By defeating the boss, the next chamber will become available to play. By defeating a boss you unlock a new power, there&#8217;s the Super Slam which makes your body slam more powerful, the double jump, a tornado twister which lets you glide for a short period, a bazooka launcher which can be used to destroy crates or enemies or collect fruit and one ups and the running shoes which allow you to sprint.The newest main feature in the game is the &#8220;Relics&#8221; which can only be retrieved in a time trail mode for every level in the game. After you obtain a level&#8217;s crystal, you can go back to the level and collect the yellow clock at the beginning to start a time trail. The goal is to reach the end as fast as you can, but there are some differences: There are yellow time boxes that when destroyed will stop the clock for a short period of time, there are no checkpoint boxes so if you die, you have to start the level from the beginning; but there are plenty of Aku Aku masks to help you and that&#8217;s pretty much it. It proves to be very challenging and getting the Platinum relics is insanely difficult and even I never managed to get all of them.This game proves to be the best one in the entire series and one of my favorite games overall, period. I would highly recommend getting this game off the PlayStation Store for $6, this is a MUST PLAY. It really is one of the best.FINAL RATING:  10 out of 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2014"}

Allen","summary":"Interesting overall with few problems.","reviewText":"For those who played Indigo Prophecy would have a good idea of how Heavy Rain is going to play out.To best explain Heavy Rain, think about an interactive story where you have control over the direction of the story. Heavy Rain mainly focuses on story presentation rather than gameplay. You control your characters by simple button command that appears on the screen but the overall result is changing the story results. That's Heavy Rain in a nutshell.Since Heavy Rain focuses mainly on story presentation rather than gameplay, it's very hard to give a review on the game since there is little to none to discuss beyond the story. I will say that the story is great! The fun part is that at the end, you may or may not get an ending you'd expect. The first run of the game, you will always be wondering what's going on, but then the second and beyond, you're sort of trying to find different ways to do stuff knowing the outcome of the story.Comparing Heavy Rain to the Indigo Prophecy story - which are both made by the same company I believe - Heavy Rain is a lot more mature and there aren't any \"deus ex machina\" story line pulls and is realistically presented. So that is a good thing in my opinion and a very nice touch.As far as game play and re-playability, I would say this game has little to none. The game play is simply commands you press. There is no \"action\" button. There is no inventory screen or anything. You just press buttons as they pop up on the screen. That sounds boring but remember you're watching a story unfold so you're always trying to pay attention but at the same time trying to press buttons. Like in some cases, your life could be on the line, and if you don't press a button, that character can be gone forever! Also keep in mind, what you do isn't wrong in this game. Like there isn't an absolute character that must survive to progress the story. Everything is up in the airs and you might find one favorable over the other based on what you think is right.As far as re-playing the game, it's a matter of what you expect. If you're the type who wants to see every possible action/reaction, you can replay and try to get the many endings you can get. Keep in mind the game is about 8 hours long or so, and the second play through is not as exciting as the first, in my opinion, but it is still interesting to see what happens when you do something.Overall I'm happy with the game and think anyone with a PS3 should play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}

However, there truly is nothing else on the market similar to \"Heavy Rain\" in terms of gameplay or design.  The game has its ups and downs, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons, making this one of the most addictive games available on the PlayStation 3.The game focuses around a series of button prompts, in similar fashion to commonly used \"quick time events\" that began their emergence last generation with games such as Resident Evil 4 and God of War.  The difference with \"Heavy Rain\" is the matter in which it uses the prompts.  In games like God of War, the prompts are used only to ensure that the actions are performed correctly in order to vanquish an opponent.  If the prompt is failed, the player gets a chance to attempt the sequence again if the proper damage is dealt to the enemy once again.  However, with \"Heavy Rain\" the button prompts determine the player's choice and decision based upon the available actions for that given story sequence.  For example: there may be an instance where the player has to quickly press a button to shoot a man who is seemly going to murder an ally police officer.  If the player presses the button, the man is killed, and the story continues with that option.  If the player does not press the button quick enough, the man lives on, and the story continues with that scenario.Moving characters within the 3D world created within \"Heavy Rain\" can be a somewhat daunting task.  The characters control in the exact same manner as the old school Resident Evil games.  For anyone who has never played these games it basically means that characters can only walk in a straight line according to the direction pressed on the directional pad by the player.  Turning and navigating through a room with obstacles can sometimes be clunky, resulting in players running into tables and door frames, something common of the old school Resident Evil controller layout as well.Despite the somewhat clunky controls used to maneuver throughout the game, \"Heavy Rain\" more than makes up for it with character development and a plot that is well thought out and keeps the players on their toes.  Twists and turns occur every second, and players' choices will affect the gameplay even more as each action has a reaction, similar to one of Newton's laws of physics.  The story plays out like a \"Saw\" film, with a killer on the lose forcing parents into torturing and killing themselves in attempts to save their kidnapped children.  The game starts off slow, with the first 1 hour or so being devoted to learning the controls with basic elements such as setting a table, getting dressed, driving your car, etc.  However, once it picks up, the game doesn't relent on the characters within the story.  Throwing all characters into the hands of death at every turn leaves the player with the choice to follow the prompts and save the characters or venture into a new plotline where that character has been killed.\"Heavy Rain\" is truly great and once it gets going it's hard to stop since you will constantly want to see what is going to happen next.  Besides the clunky controls used to actually walk around within the game, the only other factor that holds it off from being perfect is the replay value.  The killer's identity remains the same despite the player's choices and despite the fact that the game makes it seem like every character is a suspect.  Other than these complaints, \"Heavy Rain\" is a very solid release worth looking into.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2011"}

Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play.

The fact that you can manipulate the environment and objects in this fashion, adding your personal taste, makes the game that much better.Performance, Graphics, etc: The visuals in this game are nothing short of eye-candy!  With the graphic settings turned all the way up (need a rockin' PC) the world of Guild Wars is breathtaking.  I haven't been blown away by a computer-generated natural landscape since I first played Morrowind.  The soundtrack and sound effects are top notch - some may get repetitive if you play often but at least they sound good.NOTE: make sure your PC exceeds the minimum requirements by a comfortable margin - this game, though very efficient, is HUGE and BEAUTIFUL: both memory hogs.  Update any system drivers, disable any unnecessary background programs, and optimize your system before installing & playing.  If you don't have high-speed internet this could be a painful experience: broadband is definitely needed.  My recommendation for MINIMUM PC requirements: CPU of 1.0ghz, 512mb RAM, 64mb AGP video card, 24-bit sound, and a Broadband connection.  More CPU speed, RAM, and Video memory will boost performance significantly.Check your system, get this game, and get going!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2006"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A great concept plagued by reserved design","reviewText":"The Good: Fun weapons to shoot, time manipulation is very interesting, good story, nice atmosphereThe Bad: Story is very confusing, time manipulation isn't as fleshed out as it could have been, looks very datedA lot of developers with risky ideas tend to get low funding, and in some rare cases, the game turns out well. Singularity is one of the those games with a low budget feel, but with AAA ideas. You play as a special ops agent named Nate Renko who is sent to an island called Katorga-12 and must stop the singularity. In 1955 Russians found a new element called E99 and tried using it as a new weapon to wipe out America. The experiments went wrong due to an evil and greedy man and a scientist who created it all. The story is pretty decent, but very hard to follow, and feels like something from a sci-fi TV series.The game starts out kind of like BioShock or Half-Life, and even Fallout 3 with an introduction of excellent atmosphere and first person real-time narrative with movie reels, and the whole destroyed apocalypse feeling. It never really strays from this, but it does wear off fairly quickly and the game's atmosphere loses it's touch after you get further into the game.The game has very fun gun play, but the weapons are what draw your attention and make you want to actually shoot stuff. You get your typical pistol, shotgun, assault rifle entourage, but there are other unique weapons like a grenade launcher that let's you control the grenade on the ground, so when you let go of the alt fire button it will blow up where you want. My favorite weapon is a mix of a sniper rifle and grenade launcher that let's you control the bullet and steer it. Watching enemies heads blow up or legs coming off is very satisfying and never gets boring.While the guns are fun to shoot and feel powerful and satisfying it's the time manipulation that pulls the game's fun factor up. You find the TMD about 20% into the game and it lets you do a slew of things. Aging enemies into a corpse, bringing back stuff from time such as destroyed ammo crates, electrical boxes, aging safes to get inside, renewing crumpled stair cases etc. Another ability allows you to create a bubble and everything inside is slowed down, you can also use a telekinetic power to throw objects around as well as an impulse ability that pushes enemies away. The game allows you to use the TMD in large epic ways such as restoring a broken down train, but you always feel the TMD isn't used to it's full capacity.You can upgrade the TMD with perks such as longer durations for powers, allowing extra energy when killing enemies, as well as upgrading weapons with more firepower, faster reloading, and bigger clips. While the upgrades are a nice touch they don't really make a huge impact like you would think and the game adapts to these upgrades too fast so you always feel like you're not quite powerful enough.While it's neat to reverse time, and go back in time to stop things from happening then come back you always feel the TMD and the whole time manipulation thing isn't fleshed out enough. For example: There is a door in front of you that isn't quite open enough to crouch under so you age a metal crate, slide it under, the bring it back and it pushed the door open. Not very creative and I feel that all of these time elements could have been fleshed out more. This isn't the only game's problem, but the biggest one is it's looks. It uses the Unreal Engine 3, but looks kind of ugly wish flat muddy textures, and the only real thing going for it is the lighting.The creature design is pretty neat, but there's not much variety and the story is very confusing. The game just loses it's strong appeal that you get in the beginning towards the end. Singularity is a bunch of gory fun, but it feels like it could have been a lot more if Raven had gotten a bigger budget. If you like FPS games and are a fan of BioShock, Fallout, or Half-Life then you'll appreciate what Singularity brings to the table, and can forgive its short comings.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004YVOCYG","description":"","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"It's like they forgot to make the other half of the game.","reviewText":"Assassin's Creed Revelations (ACR)Ezio is back for one last hurrah before the third installment of the Assassin's Creed saga. He has traveled to Constantinople - the Crossroads of the World to discover the knowledge of Masyaf from Altair's clues.ProsCombat works just like alwaysGraphics are outstandingThey've added bombsConsJust about every extra or mini game was cutStory is just unforgivably bad for many reasonsWeapons and game in general are nearly identical to previousCutscenes lack any familiar facesUnsure what's happening outside AnimusGameplay - 5 of 10It's really sad to see this happen to such a standout series, but they fell into the CoD mentality. And in many ways the lack of innovation is apparent in the game. In short, if you've played ACII or Brotherhood this will be a depressing game to play. At least it was for me. After playing for less than five hours you notice a few things that just show a complete lack of effort. First of all, the city is smaller than Rome. Is it like that in real life? Who really knows; but shouldn't it be at least the same size just for gaming purposes? Secondly, there are very few side missions. You have the assassin's guild where you level up your assassins and do imaginary side quests where you can't see what's going on. You have the thieves' guild, mercenary guild and collectables. They removed SO much from what AC: Brotherhood had. Sure it was a little scatterbrained at times, but the gaming value was great because you just had so much that could be done.Aside from a few minor additions and this \"defend the city\" mini-game it is for all intents and purposes a large expansion for Brotherhood. If there were a number attached to it I'd say it's Assassin's Creed 2.75. That's right, it's  of a game. It could have easily been a DLC for Brotherhood for $30 in my opinion. Sure it's a holdover for ACIII, but it is by no means worth paying $60 for. Thank God I didn't. Gameplay is the same exact engine from ACII in 2009 for obvious reasons. Combat is literally identical. Purchasing weapons, pouches, shops etc. is all the same. The map is the same, viewpoints same, same same same. What isn't the same is the magic that I first felt when I played ACII. It was the feeling I had when I first played Final Fantasy VII. You could tell they had made something truly brilliant. Instead of being ridiculous and just expanding on ACI, they listened to the critics and fans and fixed almost every problem the game had.Features and Extras - 3 of 10The only extra I really count is the Animus Island. This is sort of a spoiler but you find out literally the minute the game starts. Desmond is stuck in the Animus and you go through these really weird simplistic platforming levels where Desmond reminisces about his life. It looks like Tron. Why does this not impress me? Because they were so rushed (or lazy) that you don't even get to see the videos from his life - he just talks about them as you bounce from platform to platform. And you only have the ability to do basic jump and create walkways. You don't have any assassin capabilities. Gone are the interesting puzzles and historical data as well as almost anything that made the game worth a second play. A lot of assumptions are made by Ubisoft. First off, they assume you've played the game before because they don't even have optional tutorials or the training grounds from AC: BH. They also assume you won't notice they've cut so many things or that you understand the backstory of Altair and Ezio's past. Why Ubisoft, why?Weapons - 5 of 10There is only one new weapon - bombs which you can craft. And they tried to really \"blow\" this out of proportion like the combat was going to be way different. It's a nice feature and is occasionally helpful, but I find it cumbersome in the heat of the moment. Crafting is a little customized as you can use multiple ingredients for the three constituent parts. Aside from the bombs all the other weapons are minimally changed.Story - 4 of 10The story is woeful, boring and hard to follow. Ezio is looking for the \"wisdom of Nicolo Polo\" who is Marco Polo's father. And honestly it's a cobbled together collection of uninspiring cutscenes. Prince Suleiman whom Ezio met on the boat coming to Constantinople is one of four main characters and probably the only one who isn't instantly forgettable. Ezio is in Constantinople for some reason but I have no idea why. I'm not even sure who the main antagonist is yet. This is just another reminder of how this is a shadow of ACII or even Brotherhood. The developers couldn't even be bothered to make cutscenes with Desmond's crew in them. This is because you're stuck in the Animus the whole time? Give me a break. The only redeeming quality to the story is it has one historical figure in it.Graphics and Presentation 10 of 10Visually the game is mind blowing. The detail put into every little thing creates a tapestry of beauty that borders on a pure work of art. For an action/adventure game it looks better than anything I've yet seen and that includes the Uncharted series. Every piece of armor has intricate engraving and lighting is lifelike. Textures are detailed even with close up views. The people's faces look so realistic it's hard to describe. Ezio's hair in particular appears to have individual strands. And this is hard to believe because the first game looked amazing at the time. But they managed to build on that and maybe spent a bit too much time on it.Conclusion - Maybe rentDespite the unbelievably good graphics, it doesn't redeem the slovenly game development that was dropped in our laps. The gameplay is surprisingly much less fun that AC: BH even though it's so similar. To sum it up: the storyline sucks, the extras are non-existent, weapons are almost the same, map is smaller, graphics are better. There's less of everything aside from graphical content. I'm being generous when I give this game three stars as I really think it's closer to two. What is so painful and disappointing is how great the previous games were in comparison to this one. Stay away if you're not a huge AC fan, because this one is a money making machine nothing more. Let us hope that they dust off their keyboards and use the full capability of a multi-million dollar development company for ACIII.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2012"}

This game has appeared to be coming out on more systems over the past 5 years, first GameCube them Xbox and now Xbox 360.  I have loved Rare since Donkey Kong Country for the SNES and know they deliver great titles and this is one of them.  I would say it is probably the prettiest launch title for the 360, graphically close to Call to Duty 2 but different colors obviously.  The game is not all that long, a good 8 to 10 hours for a typical gamer.  Would have got five stars from me if it lasted at least 15 hours.  But if you are a new gamer, or wanting something that isn't so typical of Xbox titles (First Person Shooter) then this might be an excellent choice.  If you are a hard core gamer, give it 30 minutes and it will grow on you.  This game was touted by Microsoft as being the NEW and IMPROVED Zelda, and guess what...  IT ISN'T!!!

Whether that hype centers around it's MASSIVE difficulty or it's innovative gameplay. I'm here to tell you that although the game is fun and makes smalls steps in innovation - it's nothing special.The difficulty level that everybody brags about is only because it's all trial and error. Remember the old nintendo games where you had to know how far to jump before-hand? Well, it's sort of like that. You have to know how to kill certain mobs or if you even CAN kill a mob before you do. This leads to frustrating deaths and hence the bragging rights of those that have beat the game. There are spots where the devs, for whatever reason, place high levels mobs in beginning areas that you're supposed to avoid until later. The class system is needlessly complex and the entire soul and death system is convoluted and messy.These many short-comings aside, the game is decent. It's fun if you don't let the hype get to you and gamefaqs will be your friend here. My advice is to wait for a price drop.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2010"}

This collection's biggest flaw is that the SF games here (Street Fighter 2, SF 2: Champion Edition, and SF 2: Hyper Fighting) have suffered the most because of the annoying loading times between fights.  Not to mention that the Playstation's controler never really suited the SF control scheme, but when you get past all that, you'll find one of the best classic game compilations on the market today.  There's some excellent games here, including 1942, Mercs, Forgotten Worlds, Final Fight, the Ghosts 'N Goblins series, Bionic Commando, and more; and for the most part, they all play as great as you'll remember.  There's a ton of unlockable content and extras as well to keep you busy, but while as great as this compilation is, there are a few glaring omissions.  First of all, where are the Strider games?  The Strider series is one of the most renowned Capcom series alongside Street Fighter and Mega Man, and the fact that there are no Strider games here will leave you scratching your head.  Also, how about the very first Street Fighter game?  Or how about Puzzle Fighter or Darkstalkers?  I would have rather seen any of them than the lackluster Pirate Ship Higemaru.  Oh well, it says \"Vol. 1\" on the side of the case, so hopefully Capcom will roll out future volumes with the aforementioned games (and if you know Capcom, you know they have no quams about sequels).  In any case, Capcom Classics Collection is still a must own for retro gaming lovers, and at the bargain price this package is all the sweeter.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2006"}
{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"Steve Sterling","summary":"Lara Croft, the Adventurer, has returned","reviewText":"Basically, Tomb Raider is the story of how Lara Croft went from timid archeologist to courageous adventurer, and it delivers on every level. The most recent entry in Lara Croft's adventures not only does the legacy justice, but effectively puts Tomb Raider on the must-own game list for 2013.I have heard arguments that this is just Uncharted with a woman. However, that could not be further from the truth. The only real similarities are that it is an adventure title, climbing involved, and QTE's (quick-time events) as part of the story. However, it is more in the direction of Far Cry 3 than Uncharted - though this is definitely not a bad thing.There are no spoilers, so don't worry.Graphics - they are truly amazing and show the visceral combat, gritty climbs, and lush landscapes that are all abundant in TR. Truly a beautiful game - even if it somewhat darker because of storms on and around the island.Sound - from ambient sounds and speech to the wholly appropriate soundtrack, this game sounds amazing as well.Controls - very solid, fluid, and easy to master (you just have to really watch for button-prompts during QTEs)Story - One of the best I've played in awhile. If this was a movie it would very likely win a plethora of awards. As a game, it has dramatic moments, \"Oh Crap\" moments, and those fast-paced, \"fight for your life\" moments that will keep you on edge.Replay Factor - From start to finish, the story is amazing. Along the way, Lara's survival, hunting, and gunfighting/combat skills can be upgraded as you earn experience points. On top of that, there are dozens of puzzles to solve, tombs to raid (no pun intended), and areas of the island to explore. Even if you play TR every day, you will still have tons to do for a long time.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great action-adventure title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2013"}

But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros.

Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun.

After reading some reviews and checking out some game footage online, I decided to pull the trigger and get it.  While not being totally in love with this title, I have to admit that it's still mindless fun.  Yes, the voice acting is stupid, trite, and just plain bad.  No, there is no multiplayer (just on line scoreboards).  Yes, the characters are dull, one dimensional stereotypes that have been done countless times before in better games.  However, the graphics are terrific with some excellent boss battles and set pieces.  The action is fast, frenetic, and way over the top.  The weapons look and sound great.

While it is true that you will encounter glitches, stuttering, FPS drops, and crashes, I can say that if you enjoy the Battlefield experience of massive combat, vehicular combat, and the joy of playing an actual role in an online shooter, Battlefield 4 will not let you down. Unfortunately, the campaign is very disappointing, following too closely to the tired formula that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare grandfathered.Campaign: A low point for the franchise. Not only is each mission a roller coaster ride, but control is taken away from you at every turn. The intro to the game fools you into thinking otherwise (by letting you open doors by yourself!), but you are immediately thrown into an all too familiar situation where you are stuck shooting at baddies on the ground from a window. What follows may be epic in some ways, yet ultimately stilted by what I can only imagine is a play at cashing in on the Call of Duty crowd. The story attempts to tug at your heartstrings multiple times, failing constantly. Dialogue consists of your usual 'Oscar mikes' and other such jargon. The story has you traversing the globe, of course, from China and back, but once again control is taken away from you so much it feels more like a sight seeing tour than an actual war. Battlefield 3 was just as disappointing, but part of me hoped things would change with this iteration. Sadly, I was wrong. It honestly felt, to me, that DICE could have nixed the campaign and released a multiplayer only title for a cheaper price, or even an online download of the multiplayer only for a discounted rate.Graphics: As always, DICE, the games developer pushes PC hardware to the max. The graphics options are oozing with settings, allowing you to tweak the experience to fit your rig, and believe me, the ultra settings will push your hardware. It is worth it though, as Battlefield 4 is easily in the top-tier in terms of graphics.Audio: Drone-like music and military jargon; what else needs to be said?Multiplayer: As epic as ever, the online portion of Battlefield 4 still packs a punch with new maps and the return of destructible environments...and that's about it. The weapons and game types are exactly the same as before. It's still fun, no doubt about it, but the formula hasn't changed. This isn't a bad thing, as there was nothing wrong with the Battlefield 3 formula. Leveling a class still feels good, and playing a class role in the battle is always fun. Assault, Engineer, Recon, and Support are the classes, each offering up different gadgets and weapons.If you enjoy Battlefield multiplayer you will want to pick this up,unless you are looking for a game changer, as this title is exactly like the previous title. If you're looking for an epic campaign again, Battlefield 4 delivers on some scale, but if you hate shooters that force you to sit and watch while control is taken away for 'cinematic' moments, you will hate Battlefield 4. Coupled with a very short campaign and it hardly feels worth your money. The choice is up to you. Overall the total package is weaker because of the lackluster single player campaign.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2013"}

It was just rushed and sloppy and felt nothing like the 2D Sonics. After countless failures Sonic Team FINALLY gave us a good fun Sonic game with SatSR. SatSR has an interesting story where you have to get the 7 world rings to return the world (which is a book) back to order from the Erazor Djinn. Forget the story though it's the gameplay that's satisfying here.While you can blaze through the levels in old Sonic style there are other elements such as hanging from zip lines, side stepping across walls, activating switches, pulling levers, and lots more. This game is also SUPER deep and very long. You have a very deep upgrade system where you can get skill points by beating levels and then gaining skills and equipping them with your Skill Ring. There are hundreds of different skills from speed boosts to smoother side stepping to faster grinding. In addition to all this you can use special powers such as Time Break and Speed Break which are cool looking and very useful.The mission system is very deep and extremely varied and even though you do the same things in the game you never feel bored or like you're repeating the same thing. Missions range from races, to collecting a certain amount of rings, to defeating a certain amount of enemies to not getting defeated at all! The voice acting and music can get pretty irritating and lame but what can you expect from Sonic these days? I also have to mention that the graphics in this game are pretty good.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora.

{"product_name":"B0050SXVK8","description":"","reviewerName":"Private Quentin Tarantino Fan","summary":"This is a Must-Play Package for Any God of War Fan","reviewText":"I love the God of War series, and its one of my all time favorite game series, alongside such other series like BioShock, Half-Life, It's easily one of the best action franchises to ever grace the medium of Video Games, and it's no secret that all Sony game systems benefit from having God of War on it.  The highlights of the PSP's game library were definitely the two God of War games, so naturally I was very excited when I heard the two GoW games were being ported over the PS3.  I've played both games on the PSP before, but ever since my aging PSP died on me, I was definitely bummed I would never be playing the two God of War PSP games.  Rest assured, two of the PSP games are now available on the PS3, and they are better than ever.First off, the games themselves.  What exactly do these two new games offer for God of War fans?  Are they worth the journey?  The short answer is YES!!! (OK, that's pretty obvious, but read on anyway).  (Minor Spoilers Ahead).Both games have their own original plots, with CoO being a prequel to the whole series, and Ghost of Sparta being set after the second game. Both stories are well written and bring out entirely new elements and subtexts, filling out plenty of back story and developing the characters, especially Kratos.  In particular, Ghost of Sparta does an amazing job at really setting the tone for the rest of series.  More members of Kratos family appear, and it's the suffering and the negativity about that is caused by the gods, that really give an understanding of the agonizing ten years he spent serving the gods.  It actually doesn't QUITE explain why Kratos went on a killing rampage in the beginning of the second game (it's actually because he was betrayed, in game, in the cell phone game God of War:Betrayal), but it really lingers on Kratos own suffering and more intimate feelings, really showing you as to WHY he's so pissed off.  Chains of Olympus is an excellent prequel as well, highlighting the seemingly never-ending quest of serving the gods.  At the end, it all comes to a deadly conclusion that would ultimately lead to the most harrowing journeys in video game history (at least for Kratos).  In particular, the revelation near the end of the game is the light bulb moment if you always wondered why Kratos made the ultimate sacrifice at the very end of the series.The games basically follow the same GoW formula, as you will perform combat, solve puzzles, execute quick-time events, and collecting red orbs in order to level up and gain new abilities.  The same action-based, combo-stringing, combat is here and works as great as before.  You will still gain access to awesome magic and weapons, including my favorite new weapon, the Arms of Sparta.  You will be able to combine and use a single combat spear with a heavy duty shield.  As a matter of fact, the two games contain some of my favorite magic and weapons.  I also love the Djinn, which let's you summon a fire genie that pounds flames into the ground, and The Horn of Boreas let's you wield the name sake, with the ability to freeze enemies in a whirlwind of Ice and wind.  However, I'll let you explore all of the new abilities yourself. The controls have also, actually, improved a bit thanks to the PS3 controller.  The addition of rumble is a nice feature, and the the DualShock 3's extra buttons provide for easier controls as well (rolling with the analog stick, for one), since the PSP didn't have as many buttons.Most of all though, those who enjoy the game series for it's awesome level design, excellent stories, great writing, emotional content, and the GoW experience will love these games like the rest of the series.  None of the games feel redundant; they are always fresh in it's execution of its world.  From exploring the monumental Helios temple, exploring the Pits of Tartarus from the very deep, being present during the seize of the city of Attica, and watching the world crumble beneath a stone pillar, I've always played these games knowing exactly why I treat this game series the ways fantasy fans do The Lord of the Rings.  You will not regret playing these games, as you will gain more insight into the unique GoW series, understand the characters even more, and the God of War universe itself.  After all, one main reason I play these games is because you love the art of the game, and all of the games here would be utterly indispensable to the series in my eyes.  They are just that important to the series.As you all wanted to know though, God of War Collection, besides giving a wider audience a chance to play these two games, is known for it's \"remastered graphics\".  The team responsible for the previous collection did an excellent job with remastering the visuals for the first collection, as it was one of the big selling points of the first collection.  For those of you unfamiliar with the process, the HD remastering adds better texture, speeding up the frame-rate to a constant 60fps, and cleaning up the rough edges and shoddy textures of many PS2 games.  It really cleans them up and makes them look more vibrant enough they can hold their own against today's visuals.  While these PSP games obviously show some graphics shortcomings due to the fact these are PSP games, they still look excellent.  In particular, I personally think Ghost of Sparta looks terrific.  Ready at Dawn used excellent graphic technique, and it honestly is the second best-looking GoW game, with the third with the lead.  Colors look amazing, the liquid and particle textures looks ultra clean and dense, and the backdrops are stunning and slick.  Chains of Olympus is a bit more rough around the edges, but it still looks great and much of the rough edges have been cleaned up.Perhaps the best upgrade, however, is the HD experience.  This may just be a selling point for those who still are able to play their PSP versions.  While it's plenty possible to connect your PSP to your PS3, the image will not be very pretty, and it's definitely not as easy and you might end up spending around the same amount of money to do so.  But with this collection, the crisp High Definition picture, the pounding, visceral, earth-shaking sound design, all work together and can truly floor your home theater system and your own God of War experience.  This is what the medium/art game gamer mindset LIVES for!  Besides, these games SCREAM epic treatment.  You don't play GoW on a little portable handheld that only has a 4.3 inch screen.  You play it with a TV, a home theater system.  With astounding sound design, larger than life, awe-inspiring visuals, these are the types of games you buy a Home Theater system for.  Thanks to this collection, you can finally translate the PSP games to the area it's truly known for.On top of that, God of War Origins also features a lofty new addition for people who really enjoy such a thing (nothing wrong with that): 3-D.  Alright, fine, I admit it.  I did not get any time to check out the 3-D first person.  I don't own a 3-D TV, and I agree with such figures as Roger Ebert that 3-D is largely unnecessary and a complete gimmick.  However, I can definitely understand why people like the effects, and from what I heard, the 3-D works fine and really helps amplify many effects such as fog and other material.  However, I'm definitely hear to tell you that It really shouldn't detract you either way from purchasing this, as 3-D or not, it should not disappoint.  If you like it, great.  If you don't, also great.  It's not a make or break decision in buying the collection, as the main feature here are the games themselves.As far as bonus features go, you can also unlock trophies. watch documentaries, and spend some time with the DLC.  I didn't find the bonus features to be a \"must-buy factor\", the games included are, but they are fun and interesting.  The DLC is definitely interesting and fun, and most GoW fans will definitely find some use and value in it.  The Forest of the Forgotten is a brand new arena challenge similar to previous ones, and you will get all new objectives to solve in the vein of Super Smash Brother's challenges, like most of the challenges.  The Kratos Legionnaire is basically a costume where you play with a very Golden Spartan soldier, complete with awesome helmet.  The roundtable video is where all five creators of the series all meet together and discuss the franchise together.  You also get Trophies, which are mostly just virtual bragging rights and a way to compare each others skills.  Well, skills predetermined by the software company, but hey.  Personally, I'm not a big fan of trophy achievements (I find them trivial and I never go out of my way to achieve them, I just achieve them unintentionally), but some people like them and they aren't too difficult to unlock, as you get them for activities such as beating the game on higher difficulty levels, using items for a particular amount of time, or achieving/completing/coming to certain plot points.I easily give this five stars for what it is, as all God of War fans who haven't played one of the games here would be fooling themselves if they didn't own this one.  The games here are essential to the series, and if you don't have these games, then you should buy this collection as soon as possible.  It's true that, if you own the PSP versions, the value of this collection may not be AS obvious (although I don't think many would regret it, given that you can play these PSP games on an awesome Home Theater System).  For everyone else, you will be spending your hard earned money very well.  I can't think of a single God of War game not worth playing, and this collection is just as essential as God Of War 3 is.  The games are, in many ways, more intimate, more personal, and emotionally satisfying, especially Ghost of Sparta, which has one of the best story lines in the series.  Really, I'm running out of things to say here, just get it, and you will not be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2011"}

Either it must be free, or people have never seen Halo.Made by Valve (makers of Half-Life -- an infinitely better game) using a modified Quake engine. It's basically a multiplayer-based tactical shooter a lot like Rainbow Six, which looks and also is, infinitely better. Many of the weapons and items in CS are also used in Rainbow Six...This game is ugly, flat, colorless and lifeless. It's also frustrating. A couple hits and you're dead and you then you must sit there and wait until the other players are dead or the game is over...There really isn't much to this game.If you want good multiplayer for the xbox or 360, get Halo, Halo2, or Unreal Tournament (a multiplayer-based game). These games have many more options, are more fun, and just plain look better.If you want a good game made by Valve for the xbox or 360, play Half-Life2 until the OrangeBox comes out.And if you want to play something that feels like CS for the xbox or 360, play Rainbow Six 3 or Rainbow Six Vegas.And lastly, if you want to play a cornball crappy looking multiplayer game like this, but have a lot more maps and weapons, try Red Faction II. It's not very good either, but at least not as bad as this...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2007"}

Raillard","summary":"If it ain't broke, don't fix it...","reviewText":"I was a latecomer to the Guitar Hero series.  I have never been a huge fan of rhythm games; while they are fun initially, they rarely hold my interest in the long run.  Guitar Hero, however, was a different beast altogether.  The series is been predicated on simple yet challenging gameplay, made addictive when combined with the inherently fun aspect of being a rock legend playing well-known tunes.  I loved Guitar Hero II, and I picked up III the day it came out.  I decided to save some money and pick up the game-only version, as all previous peripherals work with this third version.The GOOD: This game is graphically impressive, though most of your time is spent looking at a fretboard and not the background animations.  The gameplay is as addictive as ever, and the new boss battles are a nice, though ultimately shallow, wrinkle to the game.  They can range from this super-easy to the uber-hard, especially on the higher difficulty levels.  The set list is okay, though it's nice to have some truly classic bands in a Guitar Hero game: Metallica, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Rolling Stones, Guns 'n Roses (was also in GH II).The BAD: I feel this franchise has been taken as far as it can be taken, in terms of gameplay.  You can always add more songs and I'm sure it'll sell copies, but unless something dramatic changes with the mechanics, I don't know how you could genuinely market the next Guitar Hero as a \"new\" game.  Playing this game was almost exactly like playing GH II, which is definitely not a bad thing, but it meant I got through it and bored of it quicker.  I also wish that a guitar hero game were made with a truly great song list.  As with most albums, there are a lot of \"filler\" songs  in this game, songs that either nobody's heard of, or that well-known but not exactly guitar rock anthems (Hit Me With Your Best Shot?  Come on...).  I know a lot of it has to do with licensing from the artists' end, but where are Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Dire Straits, Eric Clapton (though Cream is on there), Buddy Guy, Yngwie Malmsteen... the list goes on.Bottom Line: Great fun, and very addicting for a while.  I'd give the song list a B/B+ at best.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2007"}

The graphics look amazing but that's the only plus. It does use the same dungeon crawler style but the enemies are downright pathetic, you're weilding a wrench as a weapon, not a sword. You pretty much die the moment you get hit. I recently put it back into my ps2 because I'd decided I never really gave it too much of a chance but it was a big mistake. It made me hate myself even more for wasting all that money and time. You'd be happier if you threw your money into an office shredder.  A giant elephant and a big fat clown with dynamite strapped to his half-naked body  (It's not the psychotic kind of clown you see  in horror movies either.) is hardly worth  fighting if at all and the story is utterly ridiculous. By the time max actually saw the outside world I expected the problem and solution to be explained but all we get is \"A bad guy destroyed the world and we don't know why.\" They never even explain where the characters are going and why.The races in the last game (Though underdeveloped as characters) were loads more interesting than anything I ever saw in this  poor excuse for a sequel. I played long enough to encounter the \"firbits\". Rip offs of the seven dwarves from snow white. (They even have you keep an eye out for a woman who appeared in their forest one day, made their lives better and mysteriously disappeared.) NOTHING about this game keeps the player interested. You don't know why Max does anything when the adventure starts Or how Monica supposedly came from the future when the first time we see her she's in a castle  fighting stupid looking monsters and the next time she's a boy  with an oversized shirt on who apparently has a knack for  transmitting telekinetic messages into Max's mind.I got hours in and nothing makes sense.

N","summary":"Uneven, but a lot better than a quick glace would imply","reviewText":"I have to admit, I was extremely skeptical when I put down the money for a Mega Man 5 cart. In all honesty, I thought it was ludicrous that I was paying more for it than I did for a copy of the 1987 original. Nothing in that respect has changed, but I'll be damned if Mega Man 5 didn't pull the rug out from under me despite partaking of previous, seemingly uneventful play throughs.As the title suggests, Mega Man 5 is an uneven beast when it comes to difficulty. Fun as it still is figuring out the \"weakness chain\" it takes next to nothing to get through the initial robot master crew and their levels. This and the overall feel of the game changes dramatically once the player enters the fortress levels. There's an abstract sense of maturity that presides over this portion of the game, something that reminds me of the sobering steel and seriousness of a Mega Man X game.Interesting as this can be, the most significant change Mega Man 5 brings to the table is the fact the series has finally cleared that oddball hump that started with Mega Man 3 and continued with Mega Man 4. Even after playing through the NES Mega Man games I still can't explain why these particular titles feel as bizarre as they do. Needless to say, I was glad to see things were back on track despite the fact Mega Man 5 doesn't deviate from the tired and true formula.While I can't say I was exactly thrilled with the price tag it carries, Mega Man 5 is a lot better than a quick glance, or a half-remembered memory would suggest. As one would expect the game doesn't do anything radical yet there are some covert forces within that are devilishly alluring once they're discovered. If you're into Mega Man, I'd definitely suggest digging for them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00004U1R3","description":"Paper Mariohas a 2-D look in a 3-D game world--an aesthetic designed to make players feel as if they've entered an animated pop-up book. A stationary camera helps reinforce this storybook illusion. The game's title is taken from the paper-thin characters inhabiting the Mushroom Kingdom. For example, when Mario is sleeping, he flips and flutters through the air like a leaf falling from a tree.Paper Mariois the sequel to the classic Super NES role-playing gameSuper Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. Like the original, it contains a mix of turn-based battles and intricate puzzles, as well as timed attacks. Players time their attacks by moving the D-pad and pressing the A button at exactly the right moment to inflict maximum damage. This seasonsPaper Mariowith a little action/adventure flavor. Classic characters, such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, and Toad, are joined by the likes of Goombario and Kammy Koopa.","reviewerName":"Sylph StarWind \"sylphstarwind35\"","summary":"Great rpg","reviewText":"I think this is one of the best rpgs ever. The story and the characters are more for younger gamers, but other than that, it's very good. The battles are pretty fun, although turn-based. You get special attacks and star power to do extra damage, and the items are varied and interesting. You can cook the items (which are mostly food) and make them into better items, or combine them to make more room and to make them better. The worlds are pleasant and there is a good variety, like some dark, creepy woods and a world of snow and ice. The music is good, although nothing I'd buy the soundtrack for. At least it's not annoying. The game is not too easy, but not too hard. You may get a few gameovers but it's not really frustrating. I was entertained through the whole game. I actually played through once or twice more. This is definitely a game for any rpg or Mario lover, and others should try it, too. There aren't any extras for a second time, unless you missed a few items, so not much replay value other than that it's a good game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2004"}

I remember way back when the first Gran Turismo had come out in Japan and a friend of mine showed it to me (like 6 months before it came out in America) and I first glanced at the hidden high-resolution mode. I remember thinking that it didn't look like a playstation game and didn't play like one either. It played like something from the future, like something brought back in a time-machine. Every since Gran Turismo people have been trying to steal its thunder with their own driving simulator for the masses. The first one that made a dent was Forza for the Xbox. And naturally when the long-awaited 360 version came out people were excited (and especially since Gran Turismo 5 has been ages in development the full-priced tech demo called Prologue is a disappointment to some as it lacks full-version...depth). It ain't perfect. But it really is quite a beast.If you're looking for the perfect driving simulator you can look somewhere else (Gran Prix Legends maybe...now why don't they make a console version of that?). While there are good tracks, there's no Monza, no Longbeach, ect.,ect. (crazy to say it, but the best track selection is still in Ferrari F355 Challenge for Dreamcast and Grand Prix Legends for the PC). The controls are great, but they can frustrate as well. The graphics are beautiful, but not definitive from my viewpoint (even in high-definition). And then there's the irritation of the letterboxing in standard aspect ratio which FORCES you to run the darn thing in widescreen ratio if you don't want a huge chunk of your screen empty (and makes me have to keep switching the aspect ratio back and forth... Urgh!). And if you don't want to fly off the road into the dirt over and over and over.... you're going to have to concentrate on your driving and tweak your setups like never before (when oh WHEN are they going to start putting in some kind of auto-tuning wizard?). But the upside...ah the upside.I've been playing racing games since Rad Racer on the NES. I've played every kind of racer you could imagine over the years, and very near and dear to my heart are good racing simulators (provided they don't get to PC levels of complexity that drive men insane). This game may not be Gran Turismo, but it definitely is its Nemesis. The soundtrack turns itself off during an actual race, but if it bugs you during menus you can turn it off. The controls are precise and smooth. The level of car data available is almost too much to fathom. The graphics on a high-definition display are incredibly crisp and clear. And the car A.I., all so often the weak point of a racer, is pretty darn awesome. So many times I was racing, and one of the other cars tapped me just right to spin me out and send me into the wall. Call it what you like, but I swear it was on purpose.The meat of the game, strangely enough, is not the racing. It's the car collecting and (RPG/racing fans rejoice!) Leveling Up. That's right. You Level Up your cars in this game through winning races with them, simultaneously leveling up yourself. As your car gains levels you get discounts. As you gain levels races are unlocked. You also get to add a custom paint job and decals to your car, turning it into your own work of art. And that's where all the depth hits you.You see, you can't just buy the most expensive upgrades for any car and go to town with it. Some races have weight requirements, some races have horsepower restrictions. You'll find yourself undoing upgrades so you can enter the race. And then you'll find that certain upgrades will make your sweet ride totally unusable simply because the car-type isn't suitable for that oh-so-pretty turbo tune you saved up for. I found that out the hard way. But on the upside, when you finally figure out how to maximize your car (I took a Porsche 911 Turbo into Unlimited Class through a powertrain swap, every engine upgrade, and every handling upgrade possible), you'll really love driving. The key in my case was discovering the tire and rim upgrades combined with the downforce upgrades. Trust me, the difference in handling with wide, super-slick tires with extra-large, extra-light rims and three downforce upgrades (spoiler, front and rear flaps to decrease lift) is HUGE when you've got an S or U class monster.While there aren't ALL that many races to compete in and you'll find yourself doing some over and over and over on the same glorified oval tracks, the tracks are fairly well designed (not Gran Turismo 1 or 4 well-designed but passable for fun driving), and can be very very pretty on a good display. Personally I find more gratification in finally getting that tuning setup on a car just right (or getting just the right upgrades), painting a car with a neat custom pain job, and seeing my skills as a driver increase as my car increases it's drivability through upgrades and tuning tweaks. That's where the real fun in this game is, that's where the gameplay is at. I've restarted races countless times because I got tapped and hit the wall, getting more frustrated each time, only to find that those two or three upgrades or tweaks made my car unstoppable.Thankfully, you can also make a LOT of adjustments to the difficulty of the game (including the now-famous driving lines to guide you), so if you keep spinning out and cars keep racing ahead of you, you can turn the difficulty down a notch at the expense of extra credits you would earn for a difficulty bonus. The actual damage simulation is pretty neat on a cosmetic level, with mirrors and bumpers ripping off, pain jobs getting scratched to steel-wool proportions, and windshields shattering. It's still not perfect of course (only Grand Prix Legends lets you blow out your transmission on the starting line by red-lining in neutral as far as I know), but the effect of hitting walls with simulation damage on can make your car undrivable if you hit a wall head-on at 200MPH. The replays at kind of neat (worth watching but still not Gran Turismo level), and the car views are greatFor the inevitable Forza 3 I have the following recommendations: More real-world, world-class tracks such as Monza, Silverspring, Monaco, and Long Beach. They would add tremendous depth. Also, race series in which you must complete every race in order, larger numbers of cars to race against, an auto-tune wizard, and maybe some dynamic weather and time-of-day changes to make the tracks less boring. I say if you're going to go for realism, go all the way. Make those changes and a few more (I loved how Gran Prix Legends had the car's handling change based on how much fuel was in the tank and how your car would break apart differently every time when you had a crash).If you dig the whole car collecting aspect of racing games and really dig simulators this game will be right up your alley. If you just want to race and feel the racing atmosphere you might want to look elsewhere (I thinking GRID). I don't enjoy this game more than any other simulator (the most fun one I've played yet is Gran Turismo 4), but it IS a very different kind of game and an enjoyable experience all-around. I just have a LOOOOONG way to go before I unlock everything (just like every other simulator I own). See you on the track race fans!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2008"}
