Kind of surprising, considering that the company that made them are best known for Pac-Man.Vesperia is the latest entry in the Tales series, and it manages to stay true to the other games' roots while still having its own unique features. Released in 2008, the game was the only 360 game to be a top seller in Japan, but here it didn't do too well, which is a shame.GRAPHICS: Like the other 3D Tales entries, the graphics are cel-shaded, and they are some of the best cel-shaded graphics I've seen. The characters are finely detailed, almost looking like interactive anime characters, while the backgrounds are lush as well. And finally the game has real shadows instead of those stupid circles under their bodies. Of course, even though the graphics are amazing, the game still includes the always lovely anime cutscenes.MUSIC: Some great compositions here, but none of them really stood out except for the Danghrest music. The opening song, Ring a Bell by Bonnie Pink, is awesome, though. J-rock is a guilty pleasure.VOICE ACTING: The Tales series always seemed to have luck with good voice acting, as the English actors actually seem quite passionate about their job. The actors themselves are experiences actors in anime and video games, but like the other Tales games, the makers decided not to credit them for whatever reason. Just go to Wikipedia and read who the actors are and read their other works. For instance, you might be surprised to know that the woman who voices Nan is none other than Wendee Lee, who voiced Fay Valentine from Cowboy Bebop, or that the guy who voiced the crazy Zagi also does Edward Elric, or that Cumore is voiced by the guy who does Gaara and who also voiced Dist in Abyss, which is still my favorite Tales game, BTW. Also the cameo Tales character who appears in the bonus dungeon is voiced by Cam Clarke, who did Liquid Snake and Alexi is voiced by the same guy who voices Wesker in RE5. While the voice acting is prominant in many scenes, there are still some scenes that are important that don't have acting. On the plus side, however, ALL of the hundreds of skits (conversations, usually humorous, that can be optionally viewed after a certain event) that are in the game are now voiced. Yay.Of course, there are still those weeaboos (I love that word) who like Japanese voices no matter how good the voice actors are, but whatever.STORY: While I didn't like the story as much as the other Tales' stories, the plot to this game is still quite strong, with some pretty cool characters with unique personalities. Though many of the characters have kind of bleak, unmentioned pasts. Maybe more of the plot will be expanded in the upcoming anime, but that's only in Japan. HA! Or maybe more of the plot will be expanded in the PS3 port. Keep reading for my rant on that.GAMEPLAY: If you've played any of the previous Tales games, you're familiar with the gameplay, and it still remains the same here. You've got your real-time battle system where you choose how to control your characters, you've got the ability to earn titles, which are still kind of useless, but some give cool alternate costumes, you can cook food, which is still a useless function, you can change the difficulty of battles anytime, with a new Easy option, there is still the infamous spa scene, there are still plenty of sidequests, the weapons quest, New Game Plus, and the many artes you can learn. But there are also a lot of new features as well. For instance, on the menu, besides changing the characters' costume, you can add attachments to the character, like sunglasses, hats, canteens, and other cool items, which are usually found in chests or by making them with materials, which are also used to make other items as well. While the attachments do nothing for your character, they look cool. Also you can learn skills, which are acquired by getting LP points and are in weapons. In battles, you can also do a Fatal Strike, which occurs when you press RT when a symbol appears in front of an enemy. In kills any enemy who is not a boss easily. Also in the game are Secret Missions. In boss fights, attacking them a certain way will complete the mission and give you an achievement, but to find out what the mission is, read a FAQ.I have qualms with the game, though. The world, while well-designed, needs a lot more cities. There are a lot of continents that are pretty much bare. Also the game makes you believe that Flynn, the blonde guy on the cover, is playable, when he only fights with you in one battle. Also the game could have used a better main villain. Also the coliseum this time is not as good as in the other games, and the game needed more cameo fights, as their only is one. Interestingly enough, in the coliseum town, behind one of the signs is a list off all the playable Abyss characters, making me believe that you could fight them. Sadly not. And how come you never get to fight Cumore?DLC: Nothing that special. The DLC consists of things such as leveling up the characters by 5, giving you a lot of Gald, and alternate costumes, which are IN THE GAME, by the way. Pretty much stuff for people who are too lazy to get themselves. I mean, there are tricks to leveling up fast and getting lots of money.ACHIEVEMENTS: They could have been a LOT better. Most of the GamerPoints are acquired by just progressing through the game. The descriptions for the achievements are vague as well. And the hard achievements are not very rewarding. The No More Grinding Achievement, which consists of getting to level 200(!), only yields 10 points. Getting ALL the skits (good luck on that) only gets 10.PS3 Port: This is the reason why I knocked off a star in my rating. Or would have, but I rated the 'fun' 4 stars by accident instead. -_-. The cover claims that this game is a 360 exclusive, but that's a lie. Coming in autumn is a PS3 port of this game, with a bunch of new sidequests, full voice acting, a new character (some loli pirate. LOL) the ability to play as Flynn more, and probably a bunch of other stuff. This happened with Viewtiful Joe and RE4 as well, two Gamecube games that were apparently exclusive but then released for the PS2 with more features, but the difference is that those two games only took you a few hours to beat, whereas it took me 90 hours to beat Vesperia. I kind of feel screwed now, as I have a PS3. I mean, the new features look awesome, but I don't want to replay a game that pretty much has the same plot and will take me forever to beat again. Why does Sony always have to get special treatment? I personally dislike the PS3.*BUY: It all depends. If you have a PS3 or are planning to get one, wait till the PS3 port is released. If you don't have a PS3 and don't want one, then buy this game!Here's to many more Tales.*Before you go posting comments calling me a console fanboy, I'm not. I judge all three systems equally. For instance, with the last generation of consoles, the PS2 was my favorite while the original Xbox was my least.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2009"}

The game play is a higher difficulty than New Super Mario Bros U. The levels are different enough yet familiar enough to make you feel like you're playing a different game all together, but still have the classic Mario feel. I probably enjoyed playing Luigi U over Mario U because I am probably the one of the few people who actually liked Luigi's controls over Mario. His high jump is such a useful tool to conquer any level. The addition of Nabbit to help through the adventure when levels get really hard, is just the cherry on top of this perfect game.

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Preston L. Marshall","summary":"Nintendo 64","reviewText":"The N64 for me represents the golden age of gaming. Back when this console came out nearly every title released for it was a genuinely unique and fun game experience. The video games that were released on this console have very probably the single greatest range of different game systems you will ever encounter. There are dozens of distinct and unique platformers ranging from Super Mario 64 to Rayman 64, some of the most beloved action and adventure games including The Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, and most people's first foray into first person shooters with Golden Eye and Perfect Dark.There are hundred of games available for this console and most of them can be found on Amazon.com for under $10!

{"product_name":"B000O5FUKQ","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"O.

Wagner","summary":"Flowers DIE?","reviewText":"Sometimes I'll go a week or more without playing my old Gamecube Animal Crossing game. A New Leaf has flowers that wither and die! So that's kind of an issue. The trees are too small compared to the humanoid figure in A New Leaf, too. Look at a Gamecube version capture and a New Leaf capture. Why are the trees so small? Weird.In my old Gamecube save, after 12 years, I have *LOTS* of flowers. And they look great. And I don't need to water them constantly. This is kind of a big deal with me. I really like planting flowers in the Gamecube version. I'm not so sure I want to commit to watering so many flowers in New Leaf.I'm not wild about being the mayor of the town and having to organize things. I just want to play the game. I don't particularly want to be responsible for the whole town.The area at the back of the shopping district / high street is disturbing -- some kind of showcase for home designs? Why is it so big? It's not a pleasant area. I wish it had been devoted to big garden plots to grow vegetables on, something like that. I don't like the Happy Room Academy in the first place. That big wasted space on the map is creepy, makes me think of nightmares where stuff doesn't make sense. Why is it on the map?I still prefer the point of view in the original game, the way the camera moves as you run along.The flowers are too detailed in A New Leaf. They just are.The Island is fun to visit, but I miss Kapp'n rowing his boat, and his songs in the Gamecube version were a lot more fun. He seems to have gotten married and settled down and become... boring. He traded his rowboat for a motorboat? Why was that considered to be an improvement?The mini-games on the Island are amusing but something I'd think of more in a Monkey Ball game. You collect medals, which you use to buy items on the Island.The wet suit and goggles are great, but you can't see anything under water, which is something of a disappointment.Interaction with Tom Nook is minimal, his nephews run the store on alternate days from one another.You know, all the pieces are there, but it's not as much fun as the Gamecube version. I never played Wild World and I was seriously unimpressed with City Folk. I was hoping this would be another great version, to the point where I spent $275 or whatever it was buying a 3DS XL. And I haven't been playing the game constantly, or even often, really. Meanwhile, I *STILL* play the Gamecube version nearly every day.I wish they'd expanded the Gamecube version, not reinvented it. Maybe over time I'll grow to enjoy New Leaf more. Right now it feels like work to play it. Kind of like a cartoony Sim City.I still love the Gamecube version. I'd like to think that I'll grow to love New Leaf. I remember feeling excited and happy first playing the Gamecube version and I wonder why I don't feel that way about New Leaf.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2013"}

And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"JackLiberty \"Steven Smith Jr.\"","summary":"Fun Game","reviewText":"This game is really fun, but I honestly enjoyed Crash Team Racing for the PlayStation a lot more.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

I think the reason Nintendo will always stay around as a seperate company is because it has 2 systems that are selling pretty well.I read in Rolling Stone that the biggest and most popular system of all was Game Boy. Now with no competition in the handheld game world and sales of Super Mario games on it and the fact of it being a little less than a hundred dollars it probably is a given that the Game Boy Advance is probably the best selling system of all. And that means that Nintendo has enough money and sales that they will keep on working as a seperate company from PS2 and X Box for years to come.Personally I think the Game Cube is probably the best next generation system out with great games like Sonic Adventure 2,Namco Museum,Pac Man World 2,Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2, Resident Evil, Resident Evil Zero,Spyro, Super Mario Sunshine,Luigis Mansion, Super Smash Bros Melee, etc.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2003"}

MacMahon","summary":"Mafia 2 is an Epic Interactive Story (and a Pretty Good Video Game Too)","reviewText":"The first thing you need to know about Mafia 2 is that it is the same type of game as the original PC game Mafia.  If you liked Mafia and the idea of another game just like it, but with improved graphics, mechanics and polish, then you should buy this without hesitation.  The second thing to know about Mafia 2 is that it is NOT a sandbox game.  Mafia 2 is a linear game which uses an open-world environment for immersion, realism and freedom of movement.  It does not have side-quests, it does not have mini-games, it does not have multiple missions open at one time for you to choose from.  It does have collectibles, both in missions and in the open-world, but that is the extent of things to do outside of missions.With that out of the way, let's focus on how the game plays, looks and rates.Mafia 2 is the story of a young Sicilian immigrant named Vito who decides to enter the world of crime due to a friend named Joe who is a mobster and his family's debt problems.  Vito and Joe are pretty much inseparable throughout the game and most of the time when you're doing something active Joe is there with you.  The relationship works well and as the story evolves you realize this is not a rags to riches tale, but more just a story about a man, his decisions and the effect he has on those around him.  The narrative is delivered through compelling cut-scenes, interactive gameplay segments and some of the best voice acting and cinematic direction ever seen in a video game.  Mafia 2 is not over-the-top like Grand Theft Auto, nor does it tell its story completely through cinematics... it is truly interactive, and as you move around the city and involve yourself in the world you realize that you play the story out yourself, through every action you take.  It's the best of the best at turning interactivity into story and is a stellar achievement for games as a story-telling medium.It is exactly this narrative focus that has caused some trouble for Mafia 2 in mainstream reviews, so let me address that.  Some missions in Mafia 2 have you running from the cops, or shooting up a warehouse full of bad guys, but there are many missions in Mafia 2 that involve you just driving to pick some people up, interacting with them in some way, and then dropping them off.  The game makes you live the life of a gangster in order to really tell a tale, and if you're someone who just wants to get to the action this may frustrate you.  At the same time, this interactive storytelling is exactly what sets Mafia 2 apart from the rest of the games out there, and for that I love it.  One of my favorite missions in the game involved picking up some drunk buddies and burying a body in the woods; the entire mission consisted of driving to them, driving to the woods and then driving home.  The story, dialogue and general mood of the mission though made it a lovely piece of interactive entertainment.There is much more to Mafia 2 than story though, and many missions have you shooting a ton of dudes and racing through the streets of the most detailed city in gaming.  One of my favorites involves sneaking into a high-rise, planting a bomb, then shooting your way out.  The game is a cover-based shooter, which means you press a key to hide behind cover and then peek out to shoot, so-called \"stop n' pop.\"  It works pretty much the same as Mass Effect 2 or Gears of War and the aiming, movement and general controls are perfect.  There is also fist-fighting, which has you holding the space bar to block and then either jabbing or punching your enemy.  Fist-fighting is cool, but I found it so easy it almost wasn't a game at all, more an interactive cut-scene.  Lastly there is driving, which offers simulation or arcade modes and both behave exactly as you would want them too.  I used simulation most of the time, but had to switch it to normal to beat a timed driving mission that was relatively difficult.Visually Mafia 2 is a treat, the city is alive with wondrous visuals and the spirit of either the 1940's or 1950's.  During the early segments it feels dark and oppressive as the USA participates in World War 2 and snow fills the streets.  Later on in the 50's the city feels alive and vibrant, filled with the sounds of rock n' roll.  While Grand Theft Auto 4 created an intricate and detailed version of New York Mafia 2 takes a more artistic approach in presenting the spirit of a different era and does it with crisper visuals and better frame-rates.  I was able to max the game on an nVidia GTX 275 and quad-core processor and while it isn't the most perfectly polished game, no open-world game is, it ran well and looked amazing throughout.  The AA option only works on certain objects, so you will see some jaggies and maybe a little pop-in, but it mostly looks truly wonderful.Sound is a true achievement.  From the perfectly chosen period music to the orchestral score, the whole game feels like it was intricately designed from start to finish to be an emotional and contemplative experience.  There are many moments in Mafia 2 that feel as well directed, scored and performed as a classic Hollywood film like Goodfellas or Casino.  The voice acting is simply excellent with every actor sounding like a real Italian New Yorker.All in all, Mafia 2 achieves the same amazing level of interactive storytelling as the original Mafia did, only with a much better and more effective presentation.  The shooting, driving and fighting mechanics all work well and when used extensively, as they are for most of the second-half of the game, make Mafia 2 feel like a good shooting game as well as an excellent interactive storybook.  Mafia 2 is certainly more of an interactive experience than a \"video game\" sometimes though, if you define a video game solely as something with challenge and action.  The first half of the game especially can often keep you away from shooting or car-chases for long stretches of gameplay.  If you're the kind of gamer who needs constant action and challenge you likely will want to stay away from Mafia 2, and if you expect it to be a sandbox game you are likely to come out disappointed.  If you go into Mafia 2 looking for a interactive story spread out over 12+ hours of linear gameplay however, this is an amazing experience that won't let you down.DRM Alert: Mafia 2 uses Steamworks for DRM, which means every version is a Steam version.  To install you must be online and tie your game to a Steam account, but offline play is available after that.  DRM is not included in my scores, only in an advisement at the end, so that you can decide how it balances with the game itself on your own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0047THYWC","description":"","reviewerName":"M. MacMahon","summary":"Bioware Continue To Make Movies More Than RPGs","reviewText":"While story has always been a big factor in RPGs it was always in service to the gameplay.  Western RPGs were born with the idea of roleplaying a character you design and making choices through that character that effect the story and game world.  Since Baldur's Gate Bioware have been inching ever closer to removing this freedom and choice in order to make prettier movies.  Dragon Age 2 is the worst offender yet, offering you very little (if any) real choice and creating your character for you, making the RPG elements of this RPG limited to things like stats and inventory, which even shooters have now-a-days.You play Hawke and your only real control over Hawke's personality is whether he/she is mean, nice or joking.  You seriously have no other control over who Hawke is what-so-ever.  Hawke is either a rogue mage or a sibling to a rogue mage, and therefore you must play as a mage sympathizer for most of them game.  Hawke is a human, a refugee, and not long after you start a Kirkwall noble... nothing much can be done to shape or control Hawke's story or personality.  In the first Dragon Age you could create whatever kind of character you wanted and shape who they were over the course of the game.  That is roleplaying, not stats or inventory.  Dragon Age 2 has none of that.  Even the very few actual choices the game offers have very little effect on the narrative.  The most laughable example is the ending, which plays out EXACTLY the same no matter what factions you tried to support or sympathize with the entire game.  All that changes in this game is brief bits of dialogue... NOTHING else.  You're basically watching a movie between combat sequences, the same as a JRPG.So, the combat then...  I actually like the combat in Dragon Age 2 on a fundamental level.  It's roughly identical to Origins' combat, just with a faster pace and a larger emphasis on flashy powers.  There is a lot of fun to be had in playing a rogue and toppling entire crowds with the \"rush\" ability, or electrifying entire crowds of people with lightning and fire.  It feels genuinely awesome to knock a ton of enemies over and to run through their flailing bodies, eliminating stragglers.  The problems with combat are mainly the endless waves of enemies that appear mid-fight and the lack of better camera control.  The waves are annoying because they come with every fight and make it impossible to plan strategically.  Want to set your party up?  Evaluate the scene?  Place your companions?  Too bad, because every fight will randomly change halfway through and none of that will matter.  On the camera front you can't zoom out like you could in Origins, making AoE spell placement much harder and in general just offering less tactical options.Presentation wise Dragon Age 2 is typically impressive from Bioware, but does have some faults.  I personally love the new art style and I hope they keep it for future (better?) games in this series.  It looks unique and vibrant, compared to the muddy Tolkein cliche that Origins was.  There is nowhere near enough environments though, as you walk the same three city sections and the same four or five dungeons for the entire 50 hour game.  It gets repetitive after 20 hours, let alone 50, and it just smacks you in the face with how lazy and rushed it is.  Comparing Dragon Age 2 to Dragon Age: Origins in a value sense is almost laughable.  Dragon Age 2 feels like a budget release compared (and amusingly was $10 more at release than Origins).  On the plus side the PC version works great with a well-designed UI and control system.  The game looks really good in DirectX 11 with the high-res texture pack add-on (available on Bioware's website).  The redesigned skill-trees work very well too.Other complaints include the use of online activation DRM, which is pointless customer bashing.  The game will still be pirated, the DRM does not stop that, it is simply used as a method to prevent resale.  Companions cannot use any armor other than what they come with, which severely limits inventory options.  Bioware developers have said in interviews that this was because they wanted to make companions look unique, which is clearly a case of preferring presentation over gameplay which makes no sense what-so-ever.All these complains aside I still enjoyed the game for what it was.  The combat is fun in an action-game kind of way.  The story, while more of a movie than a game, is still enjoyable to watch.  The flaws, rushed and limited content and lack of actual roleplaying are really unforgivable though.  At the end of the day it's a 2-star RPG and a 3-star game, so I guess I will give it three stars overall.  It's so frustrating to watch these RPG companies that have been around for years and years turning away from true roleplaying to make movies though.  If you read Bioware developer comments on their forums or in interviews you hear them talking about how cinematic they want their games to be and how important presentation and story is over gameplay.  It's the exact opposite direction RPG developers should be going in if you ask me, and sad to see.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"ShoppingGeek","summary":"Better than Bioshock 1 !!","reviewText":"B1 was my favorite shooter ever, but like many other great shooters (e.g.: Fallout 3), once you learn how to play the game, it is just WAY too easy, even on Hard. In B1, only the first Big Daddy battle was any challenge at all. After that, it was just a matter of having the right weapons and ammo. It is not difficult to play all the way through B1 on Hard without ever dying. B2 is MUCH more challenging. I haven't made it through one level without dying many times.In B1, I was constantly maxed out on cash, ammo, EVE, and first aid. \"Looting\" was no fun any more because most of what you found had to be left behind. In B2, I haven't maxed out on cash once, and while I sometimes find more first aid and EVE than I can carry in one area, I almost always have to go back to get it when I run short in another area. Of course, you can't use all of every type of ammo, but they have to make it available for all weapons whether *you* use them or not. I have never maxed out ALL the ammo, as I frequently did in B1.As for all the comments that B2 is the same as B1, all I can say is that these people must not have played much of the game. Here are just a FEW more of the many differences:1. In B1, you have to battle 2-3 Big Daddies on each level/area, and that's it (and again, it's not at all challenging). In B2, for each of 2-3 L.S.'s in each area/level, you first have to battle a Big Daddy to get his Little Sister, then you have to defend L.S. from swarms of splicers (and worse) while she feeds (similar to, but harder than the Proving Ground in B1), then after L.S. has fed twice and you return her, a Big Sister attacks, and she is armored, fast, and very tough. And in case that's too easy for you, while you are trying to set up traps to use in defending L.S. when she is feeding, splicers attack you, setting off your traps and using up your health and ammo before you even set L.S. down to feed. And save fast once a battle is over because another bunch of splicers drop by soon after (before you can get more first aid, ammo, etc.). There is absolutely no comparison between B1 and B2 in terms of challenge.2. If that wasn't enough battling for you, B2 has the Brute Splicer and the Alpha Series attacking you from time to time. The Brute isn't *too* tough, but Alphas are pretty bad. Brutes and Alphas also can attack when L.S. is feeding, which is a major headache.3. The tonics slot system has been reworked, combining them all into one large area, so if you want to have more of one type of tonic and fewer of another type, you can.4. The lock-cracking mini-game has been changed and made easier, though I preferred the old method. A really interesting new twist is that you can fire a remote lock pick at a device and crack it from a distance. Not only does this make it easier to crack security cameras and turret guns, but it opens up a whole new way of unlocking doors by shooting at an interior control through a window. Another new feature is that if you use a more difficult route to hacking a machine, you get rewarded on the spot. For example, a Health Station will give you a free first aid kit; a safe will give you extra cash, etc.5. While the functions of most of the weapons are basically the same, there are still a lot of new twists in the form of ammo: The spear gun (B1: crossbow) has an exploding spear. You can set up mini-turrets  around a perimeter to defend an area where L.S. is going to feed. Traps can be fired into the ground to serve like mines. Then there's the Drill. How many charging drill attacks did you do in B1?6. The research camera concept was improved. In B1, you \"researched\" a foe by taking a snapshot of it, usually while it is standing around. In B2, you have a movie camera, aim it at the foe, and start it going. It films while you battle the foe (or while the foe is battling other foes) and you get a grade which is (supposedly) based on the variety and combinations of plasmids and weapons you use.7. IMO, the most important plasmid in B1 is the Target Dummy. It can keep turrets, security cameras, splicers, etc., off you while you wipe them out. In B2, I think that the most important plasmid is the one that lets you turn opponents against each other, but which on its 3rd upgrade, can be used to get Alphas and Big Daddies, as well as splicers, to go with you and defend you the way the Big Daddy tonic would in B1. If you can enlist a Big Daddy when it is time for L.S. to feed, it makes defending the area a lot easier. It also makes it easier to defeat a tough enemy like an Alpha: you get him on your side, then after the foes have all been killed and Alpha weakened, you can kill him before the effect wears off and he turns on you again.8. When you upgrade plasmids, they don't just get stronger, they improve in new and interesting ways. For example, when you set a Cyclone Trap 2, you get to charge it up with an additional plasmid, so that you have a flaming CT or a CT that also gives an electric shock, etc. The Target Dummy upgrade can deflect enemy fire back at them, etc.Given that the plasmids and weapons don't lend themselves to underwater battle, I'm quite happy with the variety added to B2 by walking from one area to another in the water, going through airlocks, etc.There are a lot of other big differences, but this is getting too long. The point is that it's hard to see how they could have changed B2 much more and still had it qualify as a \"sequel\". It doesn't make sense to penalize a nearly perfect game for being a sequel, which means retaining some of the style and play of the original.I just finished Mass Effect 2, which G4TV gave 5 stars. Most people gave Batman:AA 5 stars. There is no way either of those games matches up to B2, in my opinion. 5 stars all the way!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2010"}

There's a reason that this game was so overwhelmingly popular, and the cold-blooded, hand-to-hand combat is as fun today as it was when it first came out.","reviewerName":"Deimos \".\"","summary":"The best fighting game except for cheap AI","reviewText":"All the mortal Kombat games are awesome save 3 which sucks and it the cheapest of the bunch.

{"product_name":"B00000I1BR","description":"Let me go on record and say that I was never a fan of the original Crash Bandicoot. Even though Crash was disarmingly cute and fuzzy, and even though the game's graphics were just about as good as they got in those days, the frustrating design of the game made playing it such a painful experience that I still have flashbacks when I see small marsupials on the Discovery Channel. But just one short year after his debut, Crash is back in a sequel that is so far superior to the original that I'm willing to forget the mistakes of the past.The new storyline is simple: A very gullible Crash is corralled into collecting crystals for the evil Dr. Cortex and gems for the terrible N. Brio. There are 25 levels in all; each level contains an easy-to-find crystal and hard-to-earn gems. Instead of being forced to approach the game in a strictly linear fashion, you progress through a series of five warp rooms. Each warp room contains five levels, which you are free to tackle in any order. After you have found the crystals in each level, you can progress to the next warp room. This system of warp rooms is a great innovation; it's clear how to progress in the game, and yet you have the option of moving to a different level if you're hopelessly frustrated with one area. Best of all, you can save your game in the warp room at any time (a big improvement over the original game's horrific save system).A lot of variety is packed inside this game. You'll navigate through simple run-and-jump areas, try to outrun a very mad polar bear, work your way through sewer systems, and even fly around with a jet pack. Within each level, the basic gameplay is similar to the original Crash: Running, jumping, and spinning are still the order of the day. Even though most levels are set in a semi-3D environment, Crash Bandicoot 2 is a platform game, plain and simple. The graphics are in a league of their own among PlayStation games, and the music couldn't be better. Unlike the original, Crash 2 is rarely frustrating enough to make you want to throw your controller at the TV. In fact, some expert gamers might find Crash to be a little on the easy side.There are only two real problems with Crash Bandicoot 2. First, the semi-3D setup is sometimes hard to navigate, and you'll find yourself missing jumps because you're unable to judge distances properly. Secondly, the game is just plain cheap at times; in some areas you must sacrifice many lives until you memorize a level's layout.In any event, these problems are balanced out by the game's excellent gameplay and intelligent design. Crash Bandicoot 2 is a topnotch platform game. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. -- John Broady--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

This game's graphics, music, gameplay, and even story were much better than in the first. But it's kind of weird how Crash Bandicoot doesn't end up staying with Tawna Bandicoot and instead ends up living with his little sister, Coco Bandicoot. Well, at least Coco has the ability to speak, unlike her big brother.The voice acting changed dramatically as well, and for the better(Dr. Neo Cortex's new voice was much cooler and evil-sounding). If you liked the first Crash game, get this one. Although it's more difficult(especially in gathering Crystals and Gems), it's really fun!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2002"}

I am a huge gamer. I play shooters, MMO's, RPG's, RTSs you name it. I've tried many other gaming controllers over the years but they always took up more room than they were really worth.So, here is a look at the G15's key features:Macro buttons: I love the huge selection of macro's available. You can use the included software or program your own. Additionally, the G15 recognizes when you start a specific program and will load the appropriate macro set. It doesn't get any easier than that.Backlight: This is great for gaming, not so great for regular work. When I game, I keep the lights low. When I work, I keep the lights on. The backlight is just not enough to keep the letter illuminated when there is a light source in the room. However, it provides just enough for you to type away in the dark.USB Ports: The USB 1.0 compliant ports are great for when I want to plug something in on the go. Not so good for when you need to transfer data (say from a camera) or if you want to charge something (like a cellphone). However, it works great for when I just want to plug in my mouse or a scanner to import a document real quick.LCD Screen:  Depending on the application, the LCD screen is great. In World of Warcraft the screen is really useful for tracking your character stats. However, in other games all that is displayed is the name of the game. I would love to see more support both in titles and in the way the screen is used.Overall, especially with the recent price drop, I'd say this is a great keyboard for any gamer that wants more macros available. However, I think that if you can afford it you should go for the new model.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2009"}

With the right game, in the right environment, it's great fun. However, it's a V1 of the product and it is definitely flawed.Here's what you should know:It needs a lot of space. In a confined space, it won't be able to track your whole body correctly. This is why I found some of the exercise games, designed to track your form, somewhat unusable.It's not perfect, but it mostly gets by - Take a game like Dance Central. This is great fun, and for the most part, tracks your movements really well. However, if you are looking for 100% scores, and you are not in the perfect environment for the sensor, sorry, but that aint gonna happen.

If you beat it, you get your Hardcore Gamer License Renewed.Concept: 9/10In this day and age, video game publishers learned that if nobody finishes your game, they don't buy the sequels.  If you can't get through Space Ninja Vampire Massacre 1, are you gonna buy 2?  So, over the last decade there has been a conscious effort to \"assist\" gamers so they can get through the adventure.  Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed are great examples of this.  Although Call of Duty is exciting, it feels like you're going through a war adventure on rails.  You can't get lost, the game helps you lock onto enemies when shooting, and the Check Points are extremely generous.  Assassin's Creed makes it really easy to kill bad guys and feel great doing it.  Have you ever put the controller down and watched how many hits Ezio can take when he has 1 box left on his health bar?  He can take about 5 more hits before he finally dies.  You have a very friendly user map and markers show up in the real world to help you out.Dark Souls does absolutely NOTHING to help you out.  This is an open ended world where the following things can happen to you:1)  You can accidentally fall off of a cliff and DIE.2)  You can accidentally fall off of a cliff and DIE because you were running on a ledge and the camera bumped something, changing your run angle.3)  An enemy can knock you off of a ledge, causing you to DIE.4)  Enemies can critical hit you of they get behind you or parry your attacks.  This will leave you almost dead if you are lucky.5)  Multiple Enemies can stab you at once.  So, you're level 20, feeling pretty tough and you head back through that noob area.  Well, if 3 enemies strike you at the same time, you'll DIE.6)  Some enemies have some lengthy combos and if you get hit by the whole thing, you'll be almost dead.  If you get stabbed while you're getting hit with by the combo, you DIE!7)  The Drinking Potion animation is fairly long and you can get killed in this animation.8)  Some bosses have insta-kill attacks.9)  Other Players can invade your game and kill you.  No seriously, they can.10) There are traps that will kill you or leave you badly injured.11) Some enemies are invincible until you get a special item.12) Your sword collides with walls.  That's right.  Swing your sword... CLANG... it bounces off the wall and you get comboed by an enemy... and DIE.13) You can walk through water, but guess what?  There are pits in the water where you can fall... and DIE.14) Some enemies are just as hard as Bosses.  At some point in the game you'll fight one and DIE.15) Enemy Spells and Arrows have Knock Back, which means if you're on a ledge and get hit by an arrow you get knocked off the ledge... and DIE.16) Enemy attacks pass through each other, so it's possible to get spear comboed by 3 enemies in a hallway and DIE.17) If you block a two handed attack, your stamina bar drops, the next attack knocks your shield out of the way and staggers you... leaving you defenseless.18) You can get cursed, which lowers your MAX HP 50%!!!  This stays even after you die!  The only way to cure it is with a special item.When you kill enemies, you get SOULS, which act as XP and Currency.  If you want to level up, repair a weapon, buy something from a vendor, you need Souls.Now, here's what makes Dark Souls an intense experience.You carry these SOULS with you and when you die, you drop them!  In order to collect them you have to go back to the area and pick them up.  If you get killed on the way back, all those SOULS you dropped are gone forever.But wait... there's more.  When you die, you respawn at the last Checkpoint where you rested.  And guess what?  ALL of the enemies in the whole game respawn.  Yup.  So getting back to your SOULS is quite dangerous, especially when you die at a boss.  You didn't think there would be checkpoints near bosses did you?  Muhuahahahaha!So, instead of Benevolent Game Designers helping you through an adventure, the design team of Dark Souls is purposely trying to kill you.  There are enemy ambushes, traps, snipers, enemies with critical strikes, massive bosses, enemies that get back up after you kill them, floors that collapse, lava, etc...Here's the typical situation.  You need 10,000 souls to go up in Level.  You are carrying 9,500 and you just ventured into a new area.  The next Checkpoint must be close because you haven't seen one in a while.  You slowly make your way through, wary of traps, ambushes, surprise sub-bosses, and cliffs.  Every step is intense as your heart races.  You suddenly see a new type of enemy rushing towards you!  It's some kind of death knight!  You have no idea what it can do or how many hits it takes to kill it.  What do you do?  Do you fight it?  Do you run?  Do you go back to the last Checkpoint, but doing so will respawn all of the enemies?But something happens to you while you are playing this game.  You start thinking strategically about every encounter.  You learn not to fight 3 enemy spearmen in a hallway.  You learn to lure them into open space where you can evade their attacks.  You learn the weaknesses of every sub-boss.  You start to study the timing and range of the enemy attacks.  As you are doing these things you actually get smarter about fighting the enemies and better at playing the game.Well, with all of these things going against you, you really do feel like a CHAMP when you do reach a new Checkpoint.Story:  6/10This isn't your typical story based RPG.  In fact, very little is explained to you.  You're an undead and you wake up in a medieval prison.  You escape from your cell and battle your way through hell.  There are NPC's in the game who tell you very little and not all of them are trustworthy.  As I was playing, I really wished I knew more of what was going on.  But the lack of information given to me added to the tension of the adventure.Graphics:  7/10The art Direction is very creepy and the monsters are things out of a serial killer's worst nightmares.  There are a ton of different environments with their own creepy look and feel.  From Castles, to dungeons, to dark forests, to catacombs, etc...  The AAA titles (Assassin's Creed, Call of Duty...) look much better, but Dark Souls doesn't look bad.Gameplay:  8/10The combat is like Ninja Gaiden where timing, angles, your health bar, and even your stamina bar all come into play.  Because every fight is high stakes and the enemies are all dangerous, every fight against an NPC is exciting.  When you hack your way through 5 or 6 guys without getting hit, you feel like a superhero.  Every challenge in the game can be overcome if you are patient, observant, lucky, or persistent.  You can also hang out in a semi-safe area and grind to level up 10 times to boost your character's abilities.Character Customization:  10!Make any type of character that you want and play any way that you want.  You can be a tank-like fighter in heavy plate armor with a giant axe. You can be an agile fireball throwing mage.  You can be a dual wielding thief.  You can be a poison using assassin, specializing in speed and backstabbing...When you Level up, you put a Skill Point on your Stats.  Just about everything you do raises your character's Defense Stats.  (You take less damage when hit.)  Weapons have a requirement.  So, if you find a HUGE SWORD and you want to use it, but the Strength Requirement is 20 and yours is 18, you can still use the sword two handed, and the animation will be a bit clumsy.  As you increase your Strength, the animation will smooth out and you'll do much more damage with it.  The same is true with armor.  If you want to be agile, you should wear leather or chain armor, but if you want to wear plate armor, your dodge animation will be slower.  It's up to you to find the best weapon / stat combo that fits your character.Also, just about every piece of armor or weapon can also be upgraded to be more effective.  Weapons do more damage and armor does a better job at protecting you.  There are also loads of magic rings, items, and spells you can find throughout the world.Multiplayer:  8/10Although this is primarily a single player game, Dark Souls does wonders with Multiplayer.  There are 3 ways in which Multiplayer is used.  The subtle way is that you can see other Players playing their games as ghosts that pass you by and fade into the distance.  If they die, they leave a bloodstain.  Touching the bloodstain will show you the last 5 seconds of their life.  So, if there's a seemingly clear hallway, you touch a bloodstain, and you see the other Player's phantom run down the hallway and suddenly drop dead, you know there's a trap or an ambush somewhere.  Player's can also leave messages for other Players.  Write it in your game and it shows up in theirs.  \"TRAP ahead\"  \"Be wary of Sniper\"  \"Weakness: Head\"  \"Illusory Wall\"  \"I DID IT!\"  So, even though the game designers are trying to make your life hell, you get the feeling that you and all of the other Players are in this together.  You may have died 10 times at a boss, but when you see \"I DID IT!\" you know that someone else just beat it in their game, so there's hope for you.  You can also invite Players into your game and play Co-operatively until one of you dies.  You can also invade other Player's games to fight them in a 1 on 1 duel.  I thought I was pretty tough, so I started invading other Players' games.  Some of the other Players were twice as strong as I was.  But it really is interesting to see the different types of characters you can make.  I was a Thief with chain armor, a small shield, some magic, a bow, and a longsword.  I fought against a knight with a sword that was bigger than me.  A pyromancer who threw massive explosions.  A warrior with a giant hammer.  A dual wielding assassin.  etc...  I was amazed at the different looks and abilities of the other characters.Maturity: MThere's some gore, blood, scary monsters, but no swearing or nudity.  This is also an incredibly hard game.Replay Value:  6/10It took me over 60 hours to finish and there is a New Game+ Mode where you can play again with all of your stats and items.  The enemies are a bit tougher this time around though.  There are two (short) endings to the game, too.Overall:  8/10This is one of the most intense games you will play and if you finish it, you've got bragging rights!  The reason it's only an 8/10 is because there are quite a few areas of the game that just feel cheap.  You can also screw up your game completely by accidentally attacking or killing an NPC.  Yup, you can murder any NPC in the game and you usually get a cool item, but once they're dead, they're gone.  The game also fails to explain things to the Player.  The items descriptions are fairly weak, so you don't know what an item does until you use it.  You have no idea how to upgrade your weapons until you actually start upgrading them, there's no map and no indicator that you are in a tough area, and in many instances you really have no idea where to go.  I think 90% of the people playing this game will have to consult a walkthrough at least once.Buy this game if you consider yourself a Hardcore Gamer and want a challenge!Buy this game if you really want a dark / creepy action RPG!Buy this game if you love deep character customization!Avoid this game if you have a life or want to maintain a healthy relationship with a spouse or children.  This game takes dedication and concentration to finish.Avoid this game if you don't like dark games.  Dark Souls has Dark backgrounds and Dark themes.Avoid this game if you get frustrated easily.  Losing 10,200 Souls because you got ambushed by an enemy and fell off of a cliff is incredibly frustrating!If you liked this game for the challenge, check out Bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden 2.If you liked this game for the RPG elements, you need to try Skyrim and Oblivion.If you like medieval horror themes, definitely check out Castlevania!If you finished this game, you are a badass!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00HGLLRV2","description":"","reviewerName":"Carl Ward \"Black Sinow\"","summary":"E.T for Atari was better...","reviewText":"Going through more of Sucker Punch's latest inFamous sequal, Second Son, I find myself experiencing multiple feelings at the same time, hate, anger, and enjoyment. But what I look for in any game, Second Son seems to have less of.Easy of Navigation: As someone who has NO sense of direction, I will tell you now that I found the map to be offputing. It doesn't at all have the functionality needed to tell you where to find point A or B. You cannot properly mark your point of interest, which bothers me insanely. A prime example was a good karma mission that came up and I had trouble locating it. The map overall is just, too distracting, too pretty.Functionality: I find that Bioware seems to have a better grasp more and more on how difficulty and game mechanics should be, the case is not so with Sucker Punch. It feels as though Sucker Punch either learned nothing from inFamous 2 or learned so little that it hardly mattered in the grand scheme of things. You find yourself treated to not one, but three different sets of powers, smoke, neon and video (in that order). The problem is that these are nearly identical, with only a handful of things that seperate them from one another, besides those differences that are aesthetic, that is. What I would have really prefered more then anything when playing through Second Son is a decent defense power. Dashing around is nice, but there are sometimes that I feel that I am trapped in an enclosed space, thus it becoming totally useless. Whether or not the recovery effect was in the other inFamous games is pointless, but what bothers me is that it exists. It is distracting to me, especially when I find myself being attacked from multiple sides.Activities: From what I've ever seen, most inFamous games have activities in one way or another, some good and others bad. With this sequal, there comes activities that remove the D.U.P's control by a varied percentage. I have no real opinion, except when it comes to the stencil minigame in which you move this curser that you can barely see and use the R2 button to cover a specific surface until you alternate to another stencil and so on. Making the curser highly visible would have been prefered personally, especially since I do have bad vision. The others, I think are unimpressive, but managable at best.Extra Content: For such an open world game, there seems little to do aside from help the innocent, be a jerk, or fight the D.U.P. The game hardly breathes, feeling as though (again), Sucker Punch didn't learn as much as I would have liked from their previous success in inFamous 2. It doesn't even bother me about the claims of Seatle being too unimpressive, but I would have liked to see options that are prevailent in games like Grand Theft Auto V and Sleeping Dogs (like changing your clothes or improving your apartment?).Conclusion: If it comes bundled with your playstation 4, then by all means play it. For a bundled game, it isn't all bad. But I would never in my own right mind suggest to any consumer to buy it. If you must buy it, then wait it out a few months to give Sucker Punch the chance to update and patch the game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Joe Rhodes \"JR\"","summary":"Very good, but not the best of the series","reviewText":"Ok, let's start by saying 13 is obviously a piece of work that has been put a lot of time into.  GRAPHICS (let me emphasize) and gameplay have progressed drastically. The picture in this game is stunning, definitely blowing the roof off of it's previous installments and setting a new standard for FF RPGs, much like FF7 did when it came out.The thing about 7, however, was it's stunning story. Complex, engrossing, shocking.  FF13 does NOT deliver a mind blowing story. Although the story is very strong and complex with no loose strings.  It is not as great as 7 and 10 in story.  Characters were even a little bit forgettable in my opinion, as I can't really even remember every character after beating it 6 months ago.Gameplay is the other thing that has improved.  FF12 had a new faster battle system, making it like an action RPG, 13 is better evolved and went back to the old school decisive battles, just as it should. One thing I really liked was customizing different types of roles and formations, which were a little confusing at first but very useful. Still can't say gameplay is the best as I have enjoyed that of 7 and 10 even more as well, but it is creative and not boring, and very good overall.One thing you might like, or find annoying, is the CHALLENGE (underline, highlight) of this game.  It takes enough time to beat this game, but if your a perfectionist like me, this game is your worst nightmare.  Subquest after subquest, perfect score subquests, and not to mention ultimate weapons which are next to impossible in obtaining for everyone unless you have plenty of time on your hands.  I think most would find this a good quality, but trust me, I even gave up before getting any ultimate weapons or getting halfway through subquests and I spent A LOT of time on this game.Bottom line, if your a hardcore RPG fan or even just playing an FF game for the first time, I'll say go for it, it's a great game, with the best graphics out there.  If you've never tried an RPG I'd say start out smaller, and if your not even into RPGs, I don't even know why your reading this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2011"}

I was a bit hesitant at first when this version came out for the XBOX 360...will I have to get used to a different control set up, a hand held controller instead of a keyboard and mouse?  I'll never get used to it.  WELL I WAS WRONG!!!  COD4 is my favorite game on the Xbox 360.  The gameplay is fast and furious in both the single player and the multiplayer mode.  The storyline is great also in the single player mode;  the maps look a little different but you truly get a course in how to use the plethora of weaponry!  The multiplayer mode blew me away..I have made a lot a friends (and I admit, some enemies too!) playing this fantastic online game.  You move up in rank fairly quickly even if you end up last on the winners list (as I often do, ahem); as you move up, you unlock weapons and other fun items like camo and gun sights.  There are also like 15 different multiplayer games but I basically stick with \"free for all\"..every man (and woman)for him/her self.  The only negative I find is you can't control how your character looks..you can't make it female (if your into that (LOL)). Basically, the game controls the characters appearance..you might be a marine in one game and a terrorist in another (there is even a character that looks suspiciously like Saddam Hussien).  The other problem is that you can't easily \"mute\" a player like you can in say HALO 3;  you have to click on the players name, go to the xbox dashboard and mute him there.  Pretty elaborate while your playing.  Just like in any other online game the Trash Talk is very much alive in this game; not for the sensitive types (you know who you are).  All in all I am truly hooked on this game and I am sure you will be too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2008"}

A personal opinion of FFXII","reviewText":"After a complete playthrough, I decided to give the positive and negative points of this epic campaign called Final Fantasy XII.Positive:- Better than its predecessor FFXI; FFXII takes the best elements of the online version and incorporates them well into this verson.- Intuitive combat system, challenging when played live and not turn-based- Beautiful graphics and a great soundtrack despite the system's limitations- Better voice acting than FFX, contributes to character development- The best storyline in an RPG to date, there is nothing betterNegative:- Combat system is easy; essentially automatic on regular enemy fights- Confusing license system- Combat relies mostly on melee and healing spells, mages are slow and almost worthless- No progressive scan feature (not a big deal, but would be nice for HDTVs)- Setting up spell and auto attack features for characters becomes a choreThe game in itself is an epic story told through a video game.  You could easily take the policial issues shown in this game and incorporate it into a Tom Clancy novel, only set in a mideval atmosphere.  I am hard-preseed to see another RPG that has something this deep and adult-oriented on plot.The main character you play unfortunately doesn't play into the political strife of the game, and I think it is mostly because of his age.  You play a 17-year-old vagrant named Vaan.  While I dreaded playing a whiney teenage character due to previous RPG experiences (dot hack and FFX being prime examples), Vaan is anything but.  He does go off on tangent at times, but it is nowhere near the extent that I expected.  Despite his maturity on the situation, you feel Vaan is more of an observer of the politics than a player.  He stays quiet through many of the cut scenes.  Basch would have been my pick for the main character.  He was directly involved with most of the story, and had a great redeeming quality about him I felt could have been explored more if I followed him instead.Beyond the storyline and character development, the combat system is a mixed bag of bolts.  The gambit system, which dictates how your character friends fight for you, was a blessing and a curse.  It was a blessing in that I didn't have to worry about taking care of other people in my party beyond myself, and a curse in that it made the game easy.  You can set up the gambit system and ADP to automatically fight battles.  This makes it so you run in the direction of an enemy and it is killed without having to press a button.  I didn't understand how the core element of gameplay could be automated like this and not have been improved upon (Star Ocean's battle system is a great example of how FFXII could have been).I also found that bringing a caster character that didn't heal was a worthless slot.  Fighter characters do more damage over time, and you can set them up to heal themselves.  If you bring a character that only does spell damage, they take twice as long to cast, and do the same damage as a front-line fighter.  There were many instances were a mage character (Fran) wouldn't be able to get a spell off on an enemy till a boss fight.  I had an easier time with a team full of hybrid healers with one primary healer than I did with a damage caster.However I consider these nuisances small toward the total scope of this installment of Final Fantasy.  Plot development is top-notch, and other RPG companies can easily take a lesson from FFXII on how not to make another dull manga-looking game about \"saving the world from total destruction\".  This game will remain timeless because of its quality, and I recommend playing this to anyone who enjoys epic RPGs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2007"}

The game can get repetitive and boring with monotonous tasks - example - the one hideaway you first have to go see the mayor, then he wants something and you have to go to the vehicle shop, then they need something so you have to walk over to the parts shop, then they want something and you have to go to the bar, then you go back to the major, blah blah - this is the point I said the heck with this.

{"product_name":"B0056WJA30","description":"","reviewerName":"Street Jay","summary":"Perfect Adventure game for casual gamer","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying I owned and played the original Darksiders, and as much fun as that game was it had flaws and had moments where I would force myself to continue playing because of how bored I was while playing. When I bought Darksiders 2 I figured it would give me the same thrills with an improved combat system, I was very wrong. In my eyes this is what the original Darksiders wanted to be but was unable to become for whatever reasons. I love RPG's and Action adventure games, I love stories that take my places and I want to keep playing because I am into the world, characters and exploring. Darksiders 2 has enough depth to make the RPG fan happy with loot drops that remind me of Diablo, fighting that is straight out of the God of War series (which is a must own RPG for anyone with a Playstation), and the adventure and spirit of The Legend of Zelda games. As soon as you put the disc in and start playing right away controls feel natural and the way Death moves on screen feels so fluid that you feel like he is one with you. The prince of persia type platforming moving is very fun to watch on screen when pulled off smoothly, I have felt like a super ninja plenty of times. The story is good, it isn't great but its entertaining, I would say its like a summer blockbuster you go to see just because you want to enjoy a fun time. There is nothing grounding breaking in this game, it wont change your life or how you play games but for the price it will give you many hours of fun, I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Zelda games, you'll enjoy it once you start feeling the \"Zelda Spirit\" in the game, if you want a simple action adventure title that you can enjoy. Just buy this title don't think about it you wont regret this purchase. One thing that you will have to be warned is the frame-rate can be annoying at times while walking and exploring but I haven't noticed it during crazy battles which is surprising, as well while fighting the camera can get awkward just kept evading and attacking and you'll be just fine.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"C. Kim","summary":"a few WARNINGS before you buy","reviewText":"Dang.. it surpassed my expectation when I actually held it in my hands; it doesn't feel like a gaming device but more of a sophisticated electronic gadget.I'll just get to the point here.Having a memory stick in the Value Pack was nice (memory stick is large enough for saving gaming data, however, far too short for carrying any substantial music, picture, movie files with 32MB memory stick they provide), however, I believe rest of stuff like remote, carrying case, and soft cloth are not good enough to match with top of the line gaming device: PSPMy problem with remote is that it is made out of this cheap plastic-like and it doesn't really go with PSP.  It may look good on the picture but can't get rid of that cheap feeling when you actually hold it in your hand.  This frustrates me because I know SONY can do better with remote; look at their MD players with remote - they are small, some are screen lighted and it brings out the MD player even more.  But with PSP, it's just a way of cutting the cost and maximizing the profit; and I believe that SONY deliberately included this half-baked remote because they know that consumers will buy PSP anyway.My next complaint is the carrying case.  You will realize sooner or later that you need to keep your PSP inside when not in use because PSP is a very fragile, delicate gadget.  Thing with this carrying case is that it will prevent from scratches but not from any substantial force or pressure.  It means you need to get another PSP carrying case, something that can protect your precious PSP from dropping, being mistreated by children, or any substantial force.  I realized the flaw of the included carrying case and bought a screen protector and a carrying case right away.  Again, it seemed to me that SONY included useless stuff to keep up with that 249.99 price tag when the system was released in Japan with lesser price tag(not to mention that SONY released just a PSP without any accessories).My last complaint is that soft cloth, which comes with the system to clean any dust, marks on the screen, is flawed if you don't use them with caution.  If you feel the soft cloth, then you will notice that one side is softer than the other.  If you clean PSP screen with not-so-soft side of the cloth with some force, IT WILL CREATES SCRATCHES; yes, my PSP, unfortunately, got some scratches from doing so (although scratches become invisible once you light up the system, however, it still HURTS)and this thick manual book, which comes with the system, only talks about how to clean PSP screen with the soft cloth; doesn't mention anything about it being capable of creating scratches.Well, I know you will get one no matter what if you are reading this review; and IT DEFINITELY IS WORTH YOUR MONEY FOR SURE.FINAL WARNING is that make sure you get a SCREEN PROTECTOR because no matter how hard you try you will get few scratches here and there.  PSP screen is unbelievably VULNERABLE TO SCRATCHES; I WARNED YOU.Well, I can't wait how this protable monster will shape the portable gaming industry while competing with Nintendo and how Nintendo will fight back to secure their throne.Enjoy","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"BruceWayne","summary":"Don't You Dare Believe It.","reviewText":"Next to \"Fable\", this game was THE DISAPPOINTMENT of last year.

This is the second dumbest idea in video game history---next to of course, Kojima making us play as \"Not Solid Snake\".The multiplayer is cool for about ten hours, but after awhile you'll be longing for the comfort-zone provided by the original \"Halo\", and if you're like me, you may weep at the thought of what this game could and should have been.A painfully average game at-best...but definately not \"Halo\".2.5 Overall.  3 for fun ONLY because of the multiplayer modes.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2005"}

Where the first game was light and almost musical in its fluid grace, this latest Persia game is dark, violent, and has throbbing heavy-guitar soundtrack.The hallmark of the original Prince of Persia game was its amazing motion and graphics. The prince would jump up ledges, run along walls, somersault, and all the while the banners would be blowing in the breeze, a cloak would be fluttering, torches would be flickering. It was really beautiful.In addition, Prince of Persia had a time system where you could go back or forward in time. This added a really interesting element to puzzles, where you had to figure out if \"backing up\" the time would help you solve the situation.Skip forward to this current release, Warrior Within. The prince is definitely dark and angry now. The levels are all much darker visually and in emotion. Monsters spew blood. Body parts come ripping off. The prince's moves are angular, angry, full of power. He's still solving puzzles and skipping through time, but it is with a dark stare.This game is rated M for MATURE and this is very apparent. It's not the whore-slaying modern issues of Grand Theft Auto, but it's definitely violent. It's a game about rage and violence. It's not something to get for the younger tykes.The sound is very well done, with the voice acting, additional noises, and the throbbing soundtrack. That being said, if hammering guitar and hoarse yelling isn't your type of music, you might get tired VERY quickly with this. There are missions that should be stealthy and it's sometimes hard to get into that mood.The graphics, as mentioned, are gorgeous. Maybe a bit TOO dark at times, but that's the mood they're going for.All in all a very fun game, the graphics still stun, and adult gamers will appreciate the immersion into an alternate (violent) reality.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXEW","description":"","reviewerName":"OoAK","summary":"Phenomenal","reviewText":"What a fantastic game Ubi ended up with here. ACIII was a good game in my opinion. But, it was held down in some ways by featuring a lackluster antagonist in Conner when compared to his predecessor in Ezio. ACIV rectifies that greatly with Edward. Edward is fun to play as, has a great personality, and fits his role perfectly. One of the biggest pluses is that the naval battles (one of the highest points of ACIII) are back in Black Flag and even more plentiful. The Wii U specifically, once again, has the advantages of the Gamepad. Always having a full map readily available, not having to go into a separate menu, is a big plus for me. Also, like in ACIII, I enjoy watching the cutscenes on the Gamepad when they happen then looking back to the TV for gameplay. Visually, it's a step up from the X360/PS3 versions, but not as good at smaller details like PS4/XBO in areas like water effects and plants.Of course one of the biggest things in this game's favor is...You get to be a pirate! It's almost baffling to see that no other big AAA games have really gone down this road before. It is so much fun just taking a break at times and sailing the ocean. Listening to your crew singing their shanties is so much fun. Then, being able to customize your ship is a huge win. Obviously, the more you progress the better you can make your ship, thus the bigger the battles you can get into and get bigger loot and more equipment for upgrades and such. One complaint I will give about the game, and this is just me, is that they went with the first person perspective during the &#34;present day&#34; sections. Getting rid of the character to identify with during those sections like you had previously with Desmond. Not a big deal, just something I wasn't a fan of. But, other than that, it's really nothing I came across that I find I can complain about.Overall, this is a fantastic game. Even though, I enjoy all the games in this series, this is the best installment since ACII, which is my favorite of the entire series. But, now that i've finished this, ACII may be knocked to second place. If you're a fan of Assassin's Creed this is a game you should absolutely pick up. If you've ever wanted to live out the life of a pirate in a big open world environment you should absolutely pick this up. Great job by Ubisoft....Now if they can just give us that Assassin's Creed game set in Japan we'll be all set :-)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Matt Mabry","summary":"The Suprise Hit of the Year!","reviewText":"This game is Amazing, and with all them amp about the new Rachet and Clank:Going Commando game, it's great to get back to basics and &quot;duke it out with your favorite baddies&quot;.You have to play this game, there is nothing more fun than this game, except for it's sequel.If you're thinking of buying Rachet and Clank: Going Commando, you have to buy this game, not only does it lead you into the sequel, it's just all out FUN.I love this game and I love it's gameplay,get this game and you won't be dissapointed.Overview of the GameGraphics-10/10 The new cartoony look is awesome.Difficulty- 9.5/10 Hard, but some parts are easyFun- 13/10 Fun at it's highestOverall- 32.5/30This game is really fun, so you should really play this game.(Check out the sequel (Rachet and Clank: Going Commando), and check out Metal Arms: Glitch in the System.

You&rsquo;ll get a competitive advantage by hearing sound cues that youcan&rsquo;thear with speakers, such as the soft footsteps of an enemy sneaking up behind you, or the loading of a weapon far in the distance, regardless of the direction. By hearing sounds others can&rsquo;t - and by knowing where they&rsquo;re coming from - you&rsquo;ll react faster and take them out before they takeyouout.If you&rsquo;re serious about XBOX 360 gaming, get serious about the sound. Invest in an Ear Force X41 and experience the game the way it was meant to be heard. It will help you to become a better player and you&rsquo;ll have a lot more fun enjoying your XBOX 360.&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround Sound Technology!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Take your gaming to the next level by experiencing how your Xbox 360 was meant to be heard!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Enjoy late night gaming without disturbing others!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround SoundThe Ear Force X41 transmitter uses a 150MPS Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to deliver genuine Dolby Digital sound, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, and Dolby Headphone surround sound processing technologies - the industry-standard formats for encoding multi-channel sound in XBOX 360 games and DVD movies. The X41 uses the latest version of Dolby technology to create realistic game sound in 7.1 channels for improved surround sound accuracy.Dolby Pro Logic IIx and Stereo EnhancerThe X41 transmitter incorporates the latest Dolby Pro Logic IIx decoding system for surround sound realism from Dolby Pro Logic II encoded audio. When used with stereo sources, the Dolby Pro Logic Decoder also enhances the sound by spreading the stereo signal to provide a &ldquo;wider&rdquo; effect. This results in a richer, fuller sound than normal stereo - almost as if it originates from outside of the headphones.2.4GHz Wireless Digital RF TechnologyThe Ear Force X41 transmits game audio to the headset with an uncompressed wireless digital radio frequency (RF) signal to deliver CD-quality sound that rivals professional-grade wired headphones. Best of all, the wireless RF signal does not require &quot;line of sight&quot; to operate. That means you can stand anywhere near your XBOX 360 and hear a clear, noise-free signal.Chat Boost&nbsp;Dynamic Talkback&nbsp;ExpanderIf you&rsquo;ve ever had trouble hearing teammates on XBOX LIVE when the game action heats up, then you know how frustrating it can be when you have to keep adjusting the chat volume. Chat Boost fixes this problem by automatically adjusting the XBOX Live chat level when the game gets louder, so chat from teammates isn't lost in the exciting parts of your game. As the game sound gets louder, Chat Boost turns up the chat volume automatically so you can still hear what everyone is saying.It's a simple solution to an annoying problem, and it all happens automatically - so you don't have to adjust anything!Microphone MonitoringIt's hard to hear yourself speak when a headset is covering your ears. The X41 corrects this annoyance with its microphone monitoring feature. The X41 adds a portion of the microphone signal into the headset signal, so you can hear a portion of your voice along with incoming chat and game audio. Microphone monitoring not only prevents you from talking too loud or accidentally yelling into the mic, it also eliminates that annoying &quot;clogged ears&quot; feeling when talking while the headset is covering your ears.Bass BoostThe X41 headset DSP also lets you turn on a Bass Boost feature that produces deep, rich bass tones by increasing the volume of low frequency sounds - just like turning up the volume on the sub-woofer on your home theater system. Bass Boost improves your gaming experience by kicking-up the sound level of explosions, gun shots and other deep-bass sound effects, making them even more dramatic.Wired Headphone ConnectionThe X41 transmitter includes a headphone output jack with volume control to connect an optional pair of wired headphones in addition to the wireless X41 headset. This jack outputs the same high-quality Dolby Headphone 7.1 surround sound that&rsquo;s being transmitted to the wireless X41 headset, which allows two people to hear the game sound at the same time.Independent Chat/Game VolumesSeparate volume controls let you adjust the game and chat levels individually, so you can easily balance them and never have to worry about missing a cue from your teammates.Advanced Battery Booster CircuitryThe X41 has a &ldquo;battery booster&rdquo; circuit that squeezes every last bit of power from the batteries and assures high quality sound until they&rsquo;re completely dead. This allows a pair of AAA Alkaline batteries to last for as long as 25 straight hours of game play. You can also buy standard rechargeable batteries in place of Alkaline batteries.Powered By USBThe transmitter is powered by a single USB port on your XBOX, or from a nearby PC or laptop. So there is no need to fuss with a separate AC power adapter.","reviewerName":"Joe","summary":"Great headphones which enhance immersion and fun.","reviewText":"7.1 Dolby digital Headphones are simply amazing.This was the first time I've ever experienced Surround sound.  They're a great pair of headphones, they make sound in movies, music and games simply unrivaled.  I've never tried Astros but the X41s are simply awesome.  These badboys are awesome for videogames.  Take BF3, Skyrim or Gears.  In BF3 the sniper rounds crack by and have startled me several times from how real they sound, in singleplayer games they immerse you in the atmosphere and don't let you go.  For gears they've helped me step my game up and wreck kids like it's cool.These are powered by AAA batteries but only 2.  The 2 will last you about 25-30 hours which isn't too bad.  You have the option with these to listen to either stereo or surround sound.  The headphones come with a Bass Boost button which I've noticed makes most games sound awesome while others worse.  I used to blast these things on Halo or Battlefield and you can go deaf from these if your not careful.  Take care of your eardrums and they'll take care of you.  Why do I say that?  On BF3 for example if your volume is too loud when firing any gun without base the guns sound almost lifelike, if you've ever fired a gun in real life and know how loud they are it's close to that; they'll vibrate your eardrums from how loud they are.I don't have very much to say about these except they're worth the price tag.  I plan to get the XP500s soon enough but I've been wanting to give my opinion on these for a while and havne't gotten around to it.  They're great for what they do and help me play better.  The only downside is when talking to people it's harder to hear small cues in the game like rocks being ruffled, grass, reloading, whistling of tank shells, the roaring of dragons, Arrows flying by, crunching of snow, etc.But besides minor static interference with other 2.4GHZ signals these are very good.  Oh by the way skeptical customers, alot of people complain about static with these but what most people don't understand is that these operate on the same radio frequency that your phone, microwave, and router operate on.  Otherwise just find a spot where away from your router or any other electronic device.What this means is that the radiation/alpha waves are interfering with each other.  And don't worry, as humans we're expose to radiation on a daily basis from TVs, lights, anything that produces heat is technically radation ;-)Anywho I hope you enjoyed this review and hopefully I helped.  These things are very good at what they do.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2011"}

I do apologize as this can't give to much detail of the game since I just started playing but so far this game makes me very happy to have bought the Ps3 since the game only comes for this console.  The one thing I have always found annoying with most action games is that most times your character will have a melee weapon or gun or some other high-tech weapon but when besieged by enemies or only just one enemy your character would either run out of ammo or the enemy would block your melee weapon so easily it became frustrating that you just couldn't punch your enemy down or something, but now we have an action hero more daring than the iconic Lara Croft and can actually do hand to hand combat if you wish to do so when near an enemy which was a godsend in this game.  I've already ordered the sequel to this incredible game and am just waiting for it to arrive.  This is one of the few games that you can't praise enough at its addictiveness,  I've already played five hours straight almost with just small breaks in between an trust me for me to play a game that long is amazing if you ask my friends and family.  So if you're still undecided about getting the PS3 check this incredible game online or at a gaming store and trust me you'll be getting that PS3 console off the rack in a second....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2010"}

These same people however obviously aren't familiar with the developer Quantic Dream. This game plays much the same way as their past 2 hit titles(Indigo Prophecy and Heavy Rain). If you don't enjoy those two games, you probably won't have much interest in Beyond: Two Souls, if however you loved those games? Then you will like this title.I'm not going to go into the description of the game, Amazon does that well enough on their own. Instead, I am just going to discuss the game mechanics.The game plays sort of like an interactive movie, where your actions determine the outcome of the game. While the game does have multiple endings, it doesn't have much of a replay value. The graphics and animations are top knotch, and the professional voice acting is top knotch.The biggest fault to the game, is the clumbsy and awkward controls. Yes, they are similar to the previous games, but just doesn't feel as refined, at least while playing with a gamepad.The story is good the first time around, and blends sci-fi with paranormal triller.I can't stress this part enough: The game fits a very niche market, and there is a strong chance that it just won't appeal to you. If you are unfamiliar with Quantic Dreams, it could go either way, and I strongly urge you to rent this, before adding it to your cart(If you do enjoy this, be sure and check out Heavy Rain and Indigo Prophecy)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2013"}

The graphics aren't bad, but they won't win any awards.  The gameplay when swinging through the cities is exciting but when Spidey hits the indor levels he gets &quot;less manueverable&quot;.  The camera angle can sometimes greatly affect the gameplay.  Sound is ok, with Tobey Maguire voicing spiderman and william dafoe voicing the green goblin.  Even though they have the movie actors for the voices, they sound like they aren't even trying.  The game closely follows the movie, and it could use some more outdoor levels.  As a matter of fact, the entire game should be outdoors.  The fact is I enjoyed spiderman while it lasted, but it needs more umph.

Nor did the idiots who programmed this make any cheats available.I'm not sure why they did this:  isn't this supposed to be for little kids?Part (but not all) of the problem is that the game is a 3D game masquerading as a 2D game.  There are in fact usually three levels of distance from the front your gut can be at:  at the front, at the back, and in the middle.  The problem is, you're going to lose many lives as 1) it's hard to tell on the fly which level your guy is on, and 2) the game thinks nothing of bumping your guy between levels without alerting you to what's been done.In the end, despite the cutesy look, the game has got overtones of punishment.  They should have just given you infinite lives, or at least had that as an option.  As it is, the game gives you all sorts of stickers and balloons but not what you want:  more lives.  If you had had more lives, the game would have been far more innocent and fun to explore.  Instead it was just infuriating having to start entire levels all over again.Also:  there's no way to save your game deliberately.  You'd think that the game would save your progress once you return to the \"Pod,\" but not so.  I once shut off the console only to find that my progress on the past four levels had been totally erased.  Currently I have no idea when it auto-saves the game and when it doesn't, and the manual certainly isn't helpful.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00BMFIXKQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Great story and setup with some bad missteps","reviewText":"Assassins Creed has been a series near and dear to my heart, so I'm somewhat unsettled by the number of flaws that the latest installment has.The story is the mainstay still. You start off as a down on his luck sailor who accidentally kills an Assassin after escaping from a sinking ship. What follows is a rather pleasant exploration of more of the Templar backstory. The best part is Edward though, who flies by the seat of his pants with a panache thats almost Bond like and a real treat to watch. No training, no prep, you're dropped in the ocean and have to swim immediately. In the modern day, you are a Abstergo employee, silent and with your eyes locked into FP view with a tablet screen never out of sight, it feels like you've woken up in Google Stepford Wives.Graphics are off. I don't know if is my TV, but everything had too much color, like you were running through a Salvidor Dali painting rather than a Caribbean beach. While this worked great with the jungle environments, in the cities, it always felt like you were slightly stoned with how bright and vibrant everything looked. Similarly, the modern day setting has everything so clean and neat, without any realistic grit to it, that it creates a sense of detachment thats hard to ignore.Audio continues to be near flawless. Voices match well to characters, the dialogue is set to the time period but still understandable, and even foreign languages all add to the sense of involvement. It'd be more interesting if they messed up a voice badly enoguh to be noticeable with Ubi's track record in that area.Gameplay is basically all the same. While a handful of minor polishes has been added, theres almost all the core gameplay of AC3. The naval warfare has been greatly expanded, and you have a lot more options with targeting with ship to ship combat, and the boarding actions are well put together, and don't feel railroaded like they were with Connor. Another major improvement is the buildup of your stronghold and ship. It used to feel like you would put in five minutes of effort and have the remainder handed to you on a platter, albeit slowly. With ship upgrades and even cash, you're working every minute. Not hard, but you definitely will debate at points whether to up your guns or your ship armor, or should you get a mortar to attack the higher level fort. You'll also not roll over every sea battle either, and you'll want to pass by several fat prizes and jump on the man o' war way off in the distance because its the one that has the last 100 or so metal you've been scrounging around for, and every battle hurts, even if its just a little bit.Multiplayer continues to get its slow steady polishing. Aside from general gameplay balance upgrades that are apparent, theres not a terrible amount of difference between this and AC3. The best improvement is that you can now do solo wolfpack, meaning there's the option of doing multiplayer without having to wait for friends or rely on strangers if you just want to make level 35 to get a specific upgrade. The only downside is the story for multiplayer has been cut down to the marrow, and its basically vestigial.A whole bunch of nits abounded, which is what, graphical anomalies aside, kept this from being 5 stars. You're shotgunned in the face with collectibles immediately, which is annoying. You are also given the option to do Assassin missions immediately, despite not even knowing who the Assassins are at that point(this happens within 5 minutes of starting, so no real spoilers) I want a reason to collect the journal pag-i mean sea shanties, even if its just a token one. The Abstergo overlay is a tad offputting, as it feels like it gives away the game to easily. I really didn't want to know in the first 5 minutes of play that Havana has 7 secrets. Isn't that why they're... secret? I'd have liked to have an option to create a modern day character to not feel like a floating pair of eyeballs. The guards blend in to well with the populace, so its too easy to bump into them.Overall, this is still a great game. Entertaining story, good main character thats easy to slide in behind, and tried and true gameplay. Just some graphical issues and really jarring nits keep this from another deserved 5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2013"}

Arkham City starts after the first one, bringing Batman into Arkham City along with one of my fav Batman villans, Hugo Strange. Acquiring Bat-gadges is fun again, even with the addition of the new ones. Bane got less time, but Mr. Freeze, Joker, and Penguin are three big baddies that were fun to deal with.Arkham City is HUGE. There are side quests to gain additional exp. which is great, but going from one end of AC to the other, was BORING. Scarecrow was NOT in this one, which disappointed me greatly. Learning how to glide, dive, then use that to glide further took some time to learn. Ra's Al Ghul was cool to learn about and he is otherworldly EVIL. The same fighting style is back. Some thugs have weapons that must be countered with a combo or cape move so you can hit them, otherwise you take damage. Solomon Grundy was spot on as he should be. The Catwoman content was average, she was simply an addition to the story.Overall Arkham City was a fun game. I tried to hold back and not play so much at once after having picked it up on release day. NOTE: I am a very good gamer and while challenging, I found myself overcoming obstacles such as 30+ thugs, fighting bosses, or sneak/takedowns. For fans of Batman, a great purchase.

Puzzles are still fairly simple, but this is geared towards kids after all so that's expected. Great story, characters and level design make for some fun/addictive gameplay.Lots of good things to say about this game really, why the 4 stars? Well, simple the cost. To really experience all there is for the game you'll need additional characters - and they come at a cost. ten to fifteen bucks per character although you can save a little bit with 3 packs it can quickly add up.

C'mon everyone we already have the Call of Duty series and Halo games for that. It's great to have a game focus mainly on the single player campaign. I loved and enjoyed RTCW's single player story back in the day and this newest installment does not dissapoint. This new version has above par graphics. The story line is deep and engaging. You can do a lot of unique things. For example: Jumping onto to rooftops of buildings to get an advantage on youre target or find hidden treasures. The game has some open territory to explore. What I don't understand by th negative reviews on this page is that \" THIS IS WOLFENSTEIN \". It plays very close to the same as RTCW did for the original XBOX. It's even set up in a very similar and familar fashion. Wolfenstein has always been a singal player, first person adventure game at it's core. Who cares about the multiplayer aspect all of the time. Like I said earlier, we already have an overabundance of solid multiplayer games out on the market. It's time we got back to the good ol' day's of great single player extravaganzas! Even the violence and gore in this version is fantastic. The Nazi's die in a very dramatic fashion. I shot one and while he was on the ground dead I blasted him again and turned his face into hamburger helper.

{"product_name":"B003O6E1JS","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew C.","summary":"Best MK game yet","reviewText":"I've been a fan of the Mortal Kombat series since the first game came out in the mid-1990s. This new version is the best one I've played yet. It has a generous helping of characters (over 20), modes, moves, arenas, unlockables, and other things, and it all comes together beautifully. The combat is scaled well, so that you never feel like the AI players are cheating (at least not too badly!). The graphics are up to par with other PS3 games, and the sound effects and voice work are well done. I really like the new additions like the x-ray moves, tag-team matches, and such. The campaign is surprisingly engaging and polished. The game is just well presented and has high production values.I would have given this game 5 stars except for the cheap boss fight at the end of the campaign. While all of the other fights are scaled in a way that allows you to have a fighting chance against your opponents, the last fight is ridiculously tough. My son and I spent hours trying to beat this guy until we finally figured out a fighting pattern that was cheap enough to win. Aside from this annoyance, this is a superb (and brutal) game. I highly recommend it.4.5 stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003BE6OZ2","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"The_Scrutiny","summary":"A Feast for the Eyes","reviewText":"I'm reviewing this now because the third game's out and there might be some people who want to try this one first. I'll give the concepts and the pros first and then give the cons.Story:This is a nice telling of events all the way from the beginning of Shippuden to the end of the Pain Arc. I didn't watch the series for this part (I started to watch at season 10), and I got a ton out of the storytelling in this game. They do a great job of making you feel for the characters and you never feel like the story's rushed. In fact, I've gone back to watch a couple of these older episodes and the game does a much better job.Combat:Some people will love the combat, and others will hate it. I'm part of the former group. Combat is very simplistic in theory: Circle is attack, Square is to throw kunais, X is to jump, Triangle is to charge chakra and perform special moves. If you're used to fighting games with large lists of combos, you'll have to acquire a taste for this type of game. Things are shaken up a lot when the game throws support characters and chakra moves at you. Support characters are called upon with L1/RI during combat and perform a move before leaving the screen momentarily to recharge. They each have different combat roles you assign them to perform automatic actions later on in your match. By tapping Triangle, you can perform special moves like ninjutsus, dashes, and more powerful kunai throws. You'll have to use your best judgment during matches to decide when to unleash support and when to expend chakra for special moves. Thus the game is simple in theory and complex in motion.Gameplay:For the single player, you'll go around in a large game world and go to your destination to initiate fights. Most fights are standard, but a good handful are big boss battles with quicktime events. Don't roll your eyes until you've read this: the quicktime events are EPIC!!! When you succeed, your character will do the most insane things you've ever seen. The quicktime events really do justice for the series. When you're not fighting, there are a couple other things to do: doll hunting, building relationships with the other ninjas, collecting materials to unlock new items in stores for use in combat, and fighting side-quest matches. I thought it was plenty to keep me occupied.Graphics/Environments:Graphics are gorgeous and environments are breathtaking at times. You'll really feel like you're in the Naruto universe.Multiplayer:If anyone's still playing multiplayer, you'll quite enjoy it. Online matches are hectic. You'll have to know how your opponent fights so you can counter them appropriately. When you win, you'll gain points to advance in rank. Your rank, ninja picture, and title appear on your player card. It gives plenty of incentive to keep playing online. I was lost in this for about 2 months because it was so addictive.Gripes:When you're not fighting, moving throughout the game world is a hassle since there's no fast travel. If you want to hear the English voice-acting-which is superb and features the most appropriate voice actors for the characters I could have imagined-you'll have to deal with zero effort for lip-syncing. Multiplayer might be frustrating when you deal with spammers, which for this game, almost can't be helped. This means your physical attacks are rendered useless and matches are guaranteed to be kunai-and-jutsu fests.There you go; if you're looking for an incredible anime single-player experience, look no further. If you want an addictive but occasionally frustrating multiplayer experience, this is also the game for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0009WPZOA","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Make this your most wanted racing game","reviewText":"Need for Speed: Most Wanted sure is memorable. Electronic Arts has struck gold, as Most Wanted is one of the best games in the Need for Speed franchise. It's more of \"Cops\" and less of \"Pimp My Ride\", which makes for a much different experience. Humorous cinematics, fast-paced racing, high-speed pursuits, tight controls, and slick graphics make way for an overall package that is worth the $60 price point on the Xbox 360.Welcome, you're the new guy in town. Like any big-headed car tuner, your goal is to gain the respect of other street racers by pushing the law and becoming the \"Most Wanted\" racer in town. When you attempt to do this, the locals tamper with your fancy BMW and you're quickly in the hole, losing your pink slip to an arrogant, outspoken hotshot named Razor. Razor doesn't stop there, as he climbs to the peak of the Most Wanted list using your car. Through different races, events, and police chases your goal is to have another race against Razor to get your car back, but there are 14 other Most Wanted racers on the \"Blacklist\" and hundreds of races waiting for you before you get to him. The story is told through some ridiculously beautiful cutscenes. These scenes mix computer-generated animation, real-life actors, and a fancy color effect to make a look that you have to see to believe. Not to mention, these scenes are usually pretty funny, making them worth watching all the same.The different races leading up to Razor have the same simple goal; cross the finish line before everyone else as quickly as possible. There are standard Circuit, Lap Knockout, and Sprint races as well as the Drag races that were made famous with the Underground series. Those familiar modes stand next to new challenges that mix things up very slightly. Tollbooth races have you zooming through checkpoints as quickly as possible. Speed-Trap events have speed cameras set up around the course, and each camera determines your speed and gives you a score. The scores accumulate as the event goes on, and at the end, the player with the highest score wins the challenge. If I could say anything about the different races, it's that they're varied enough and downright entertaining enough to keep the gameplay from getting stale and moldy.When you're not racing in Most Wanted, you've got a free roam in a huge urban, suburban, and rural environment that is bursting at the seams with things to do. Whether you're upgrading your car's superficial aspects or tinkering with newer and better parts, exploring, or causing trouble with the police, there is a lot to do in this game. Speaking of the police, the pursuits in Most Wanted are one of the most exciting aspects of the game. You'll attract the attention of the local feds if you're caught speeding, causing property damage, or collisions on the road. These minor infractions can turn into twenty- or thirty-minute chases that are loaded with spike strips, road blocks, pursuing helicopters, and cop cars that range from your standard beater to Corvette federal chasers. Believe me, it can get nasty when you're taking out cruisers left and right while trying to find a way to shake the heat and end the pursuit. If the races weren't exciting enough for you, these chases should be. They're mostly optional, and the only time they're required is when you're trying to move up on the Blacklist.The racing controls feel very tight and realistic. The driving physics aren't as realistic as, say, Gran Turismo 4, yet EA managed to do a fantastic job on the controls. The sense of speed is pretty fantastic, especially when you go over a small hill and you're sent flying into the air, sparks and exhaust following you as you fly through the sky, landing with more sparks and a crash. Alongside the frantic pace of the races, the visuals provide quite a show while tearing through the streets. Particles fill the screen when you crash through a roadblock and the shine effect from wet roads or rain is breathtaking. On a high-def television set, Most Wanted is unbelievable. Alongside the visuals, the fast-paced punk rock and metalcore soundtrack and metal-crunching sound effects make for an expertly-presented videogame. The only potential problem that I can see is fans of NFS: Underground complaining that the game takes place mostly in the daytime rather than at night, like Underground and Underground 2 did. This time change results in a completely new color scheme and atmosphere that, quite personally, I preferred.There isn't much to complain about in Need for Speed: Most Wanted. The opponent racer A.I., unlike the police A.I., is a little too easy at first. They're not very competitive until hours into the game, but that's really the only valid complaint that I have. Most Wanted isn't a revolutionary title but it's something that is a blast to play and it's a great start for racing games on the Xbox 360. Pick it up if you're looking for a racing title or if you liked the Underground series, you won't be disappointed.(NOTE: I also have this review posted on GameFreaks365.com, where I write reviews on a regular basis.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2005"}

I have played the campaign and the multiplayer, and I am loving it.The single player pits you and a handful of other space marines (think futuristic Roman-empire-styled super soldiers) against millions of orcs.  There is plenty of gunplay with ammo pods and different gun pods strewn about the landscape.  However the real fun starts when you have to make the decision to reload, switch guns, or wade into the horde with your melee weapons.The melee combat is great.  A few simple combos X, XY, YB cover 90% of the melee combat.  But the reward is hugely satisfying:  Crowds of orcs fly, limbs are severed, and blood spews.The difficulty levels are well balanced.  For me, I get quickly frustrated if I cannot get past a certain point, Easy was fun.  I still died a few times, but I got to experience the campaign story (which a great tale of civilization fighting a desperate battle for control of a Forge World).  The harder levels get very challenging.The multiplayer mode is also lots of fun.  There is a good community (on xbox live) with plenty of players at a variety of levels.  As you increase your xp and perform certain tasks you will unlock additional weapons and armor.  There is a lot of customization possible.Warhammer 40k has been around for a long time, but this game was my first exposure to it. I loved it.  The Roman-styled futuristic super soldiers are very cool. I recommend this game for its hack n' slash game play and lasting appeal in multiplayer mode.

His wealth, which was once a source of pride, becomes his greatest foe. Now, Wario must scramble to recover his riches.Cranky CapitalistStep into an alternate world filled with quirky puzzles, swarming enemies and lots and lots of loot.

The game even has a wrestling game-ish feel, as you can string together combo attacks that The Rock would give his eyebrow for.Early on, you will learn the significance of special sticky balls that dot the landscape. Wario can cling to these balls to navigate tough spots, reach new areas, and even fight bosses.You can freely bash and manipulate your surroundings to discover secrets. For instance, you can pick up a stone pillar and swing it at your foes or spin a fallen monster to activate a switch that raises a gate.Perplexing PuzzlesThe side-scrolling action remains true to the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games that made Wario famous, but Wario's incredible range of motion gives him newfound freedom.Finding treasure often calls for flipping a colored switch, then searching high and low for the activated chest. Considering the size of the worlds and the plethora of hiding places, this can be quite a feat. When it comes to moolah, though, no task is too tough for Wario.Trap doors transport you to hidden worlds that offer mind-bending puzzles. Using your noggin' will yield some important items. A colorful band of fairies offers game info and advice throughout your adventure.GraphicsThe development team at Treasure have stamped Wario's Nintendo GameCube debut with colorful and vibrant graphics. Wario's signature look comes to life like never before. From his arrogant waddle to his purple trousers, Wario is immediately recognizable. Charles Martinet, the actor famous as the voice of Mario, brings a special zest to Wario's growls, chortles and guffaws.From gleaming castle walls to gloomy gravestones,Wario Worldis crammed with beautifully realized details.

The game is rewarding in terms of strategy, because you will NOT be able to get very far without some basic strategy (ie: learn to block and dodge, and conserve energy).The BAD:  The menu interface is a disaster.  One of the worst I have seen in 20+ years of gaming: it's cluttered, counter-intuitive, and the button presses sometimes register late.  There is no rankings list, just a vague \"popularity meter\".

For so long, I always had to stand by FFVII as my favorite one. But with it's slow start, and the occasional holes in its plot, it has fallen into second place, right behind FFIX. It's taken me a good six or so years to finally realize this, but there are many contributing factors.1. The challenge. It is neither so easy that anyone could beat it, nor is it so hard that only the most experienced RPG players hold a candle to the epic 4-disc quest this game puts you on. Though it leans more towards easy than hard, it is a pretty good balance.2. The characters. I never could have imagined designs that better recreate the look and feel of the old games. Every one of them has their moment in the spotlight, and they are quite colorful. Not to mention they bring back some classics: dragoons, black mages with pointy hats, designated healers and what have you.3. The music. Absolutely epic, full of emotion, it is just indescribably good.4. The story. This is, by far, the biggest driving force of my love for FFIX. The story of FFIX is like a masterpiece of literary fantasy you can not put down. It's like a series of Disney movies that are all in perfect continuity with one another, picking up right where the last one left off, and the only thing you can be sure of is that like all Disney films of this sort, a happy ending will come at the end of the final one. Filled with comedy, romance, action, adventure, drama, and the most beautiful heart-breaking moments you could ever imagine, it is not to be missed. In fact, I feel someone should novelize it under a name like, \"The Princess And The Thief (Based On The Story Of The Squaresoft Video Game Final Fantasy IX)\" and sell it so everybody can read it just to see how truly wonderful it is! Just imagine this: a reading of the story accompanied by a live orchestra and a monster LCD monitor broadcasting an Anime interpretation of the story to go with everything!...I am drifting a bit. Simply put, there is hardly a negative I can think of about this game. Perhaps if you are a very experienced player of the series and playing this for the first time, it might seem too easy. But at the same time, once the story takes off (which doesn't take long), you will want to keep playing regardless. The story part of the game reads well from cover to cover, and I simply can not get over how amazing it is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2004"}

Well let's get into shall we?Story - If you don't have a imagination to make the FFXIII story seem interesting at all to ya, then give up trying too understand it now. If you add (XIII) + (XIII-2) story together = um... what's going again now? The story here however is a little bit more accessible as in understandable than it's predecessor, which is good for people who didn't play or get XIII, but it now opens up a bigger problem, and that is a weaker/uninteresting  story. Overall view of the story goes -- Time travel - Reunite with your sister - Prevent humanity from dying, easy enough for ya? Good!Game-Play - You like XIII combat system? Yeah I didn't either, joking! I actually do like the combat, and there a couple of minor improvements which were needed that I like here. The Crystarium is more easier than ever to use now. There no branching paths to take, which could screw you from missing out on a crucial ability for boss fights for whatever Paradigm role you're playing, It just a one set path now for each role now. So less room for errors too be made.Paradigm no longer have a short animation pause when you change, which is good. There a easy mode now, so for all you Cid Raines crybaby's out there - your wish has been granted. And do you love Pokemon? Nope? Me either. Well they added a system close to it, and that ot basically replaces your 3rd 'HUMAN' party member as a Monster that catch by defeating it, which you then can level it up with a drop item such as seeds, or bolts based on what monster-type it is. And The monster leveling system is the same, so no worries. You can also buy all of those items + much more needed essentials from a annoying npc women name Chocolina that beats Vanille when it comes too the most hated/annoying character in the FF universe, which I didn't think was possible until now.Music - What do you get when you mix pop,rock,rap, and techno together? You get pure garbage. The music in this  FF sucks! Well the new sounding music that I mention anyways. The rock tracks don't even sound good at all in the boss battles, or by itself. I actually had too mute my TV, so that I can keep playing because it was just that unbearable.Graphics - To make this short. FFXIII has always been the king of graphics, and one the few games that actually show in true 1080p. No complaints here.Content - This is where the 3 stars for the overall game becomes justified. This game is SHORT! 40hrs! That including the fragments + all of the endings, but then I realize this game doesn't feel complete to me. Like this game is cut in halve, where this is Sarah + Noel game, and the other halve (DLC) will be Lighting, who is the poster heroine for this game, WTF! I hate when gaming devs do this crap. This DLC thing is getting WAY out of hand. I'm taking bets now, that my prediction of why this game is so short, and lacking, is because of it. SE is starting to become like every other devilish company out there, and that cut the game content in halve to make more money. I've been a strong advocate against EA about this, and SE gets no pass from me. Shame on you SE, SHAME!Conclusion - If you TRULY love FFXIII, then buy this game, because you won't be disappointed, which I promise you. Now if dislike FFXIII, and curious about this FF, then rent it. If you hated XIII with a passion though, then STAY AWAY. Because this game won't win you over. I honestly would've gave this game a 4, but this DLC crap seriously needs to be balance-out + they lie to me. Lighting isn't the main in this game...Overall verdict = solid rental.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2012"}

What a fun, great game this is.When your videogame has a pink-haired main character, there's something wrong with the culture. Noel Kreiss is supposed to be the male leader? He looks no different than pink-haired woman. I imagine fans of this game collect My Little Pony plushies, and since that's the 'cool' thing on the internet these days among the recluse anime-watchers, I'm probably right.I don't know when this happened to Final Fantasy - when it became this 'girly' - but it has to stop. Pink-haired main character? This still astonishes me. Seriously. Pink hair.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2012"}

Well i went to EB Games to get a PS2, hopefully an old one, and they didn't have any; only used ones. I went to EB Games for a NEW PS2 so it had a lower chance of breaking. Well, I got this PS2 instead since it was the only new PS2 they had.Overall it LOOKS great. It's tiny like a book, weighs at most 2 pounds I think, it's nice and small, portable, reads discs very quickly, etc.But looks aren't what matters most. I am a hugggge gamer and I play my games hours on end. Since this PS2 doesn't have a fan... well I can't really do it. The most hours you can leave this on without it freezing ( for me ) is about 4 hours. I can be playing a game, scratched or not, and it will simply freeze and I have to reset. It's happened twice so far and I've  had it for about 3 days. Both were on Tony Hawk American Wasteland, but I highly doubt it was the game. It happened once offline, and once online which tells me it was probably just the sytem overheating... it would be better if it was a tad bigger and had a fan!I would stick with the old PS2 if you don't travel a lot, but if looks, portability, and sometimes unreliability are what you like, take your chance with this PS2 design.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2005"}

Seven classic Sonic Genesis games PLUS Six additional Sonic Game Gear titles  Unlockable games and secrets  Re-design interface and extra bonus material","reviewerName":"Jeff Johnson \"Jeff Johnson\"","summary":"Nice compilation of 5 great Sonic games coupled with all the rest of the Genesis and Gamegear era!","reviewText":"To start off with, this is an old school Sonic game collection from the Genesis and Game Gear eras. After listing the games I'll have a very brief review on each.Genesis:Sonic The Hedgehog (9/10)Sonic The Hedgehog 2 (10/10)Sonic The Hedgehog 3 (10/10)Sonic & Knuckles (10/10)Sonic 3D Blast (2/10)Sonic Spinball (2/10)Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (5/10)Game Gear:Sonic The Hedgehog (2/10)Sonic Chaos (4/10)Sonic Drift (1/10)Sonic Labyrith (0/10)Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (2/10)Sonic Blast (4/10)SONIC THE HEDGEHOG > is a very good game, a classic most would say. This is your traditional 2D Sonic platforming game unchanged from when it debuted on the Genesis. The controls are basic, directional pad to move or duck and all buttons jump.SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 2 > is a very good game as well, more challenging than the first and more fun as well. You get Tails as a lovable yet death prone sidekick. Controls are the same, but now there is a spin dash if you duck and hold any button before releasing it. The spin dash helps a lot and it's a shock to play a game without it.SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 3 > has bright graphics, nice details in the background. The terrains change from course to course. There are more powerups that add some dimension to the game. It's very nice and it seems to tell a story in the later levels that builds up to Sonic 3.SONIC & KNUCKLES > is more Sonic 2D platforming but now with Knuckles! This was a continuance of Sonic 3.SONIC 3D BLAST > is a bad game. I'm sorry. The fake 3D effect looked like a gameboard. Its difficult to play the game because Sonic is meant for speed but you can barely see what's in front of him. Its also very boring and involves more search than fun.SONIC SPINBALL > is a bad and difficult game, and the graphics are dark and murky. This is a 2D platformer slash pinball game where you barely control Sonic because 99% of the time he is the pinball. It feels very tedious to do anything in this game. I can't believe this was ever $50.DR. ROBOTNIK'S BEAT MACHINE > is a surprisingly good puzzle game best described as a different sort of Tetris or Dr. Mario. Well worth anyone's time to play it. You play against characters from one of the TV cartoon shows. Match falling blocks of goo. Its just that easy... til they pile up and your opponent scores and piles more up!SONIC THE HEDGEHOG FOR GAMEGEAR > uh it's a 2D platformer alright, but it lacks Sonicness. You really only seem to go right. Not up, down or all around. Feels like a cheap cash in.SONIC CHAOS FOR GAMEGEAR > seems a lot more like a true Sonic 2D platformer. It feels like they worked on this one. The only downfall is that its for Gamegear and playing it at home on your TV doesn't look good and its not fun when compared to the other great Sonic games.SONIC DRIFT FOR GAMEGEAR > is an extremely basic one dimensional racing game. I'd compare this game more to Rad Racer than anything, but with worse graphics. You pick your driver... but they're all the same. Then you race. You can't go backward, you can only go side to side and crash. There are spring boxes and powerups on your way around the bland lifeless tracks.SONIC LABYRINTH FOR GAMEGEAR > is probably the dullest Sonic game there will ever be. This is more like Sonic 3D blast... yet its called Labyrinth. Figure that out. Everything is in fake 3D, it moves really slowly, the controls are terrible and is not worth anyone's time.SONIC BLAST FOR GAMEGEAR > is a better version of Sonic Chaos which is a 2D platformer... only with Knuckles! Probably the best of the Gamegear games, but its still nothing compared to the first three Sonic 2D games.DR. ROBOTNIK'S BEAT MACHINE FOR GAMEGEAR > is pretty much the exact game as the Genesis version, but with worse graphics. There is a challenge mode here that has you doing certain things to get to the next challenge. That is a nice mode that the Genesis version could have had.THE EXTRAS > are not worth it... but you're buying this for the first 4 Sonic games listed which are true classics. Dr. Robotnik's Beat Machine is also worth your time as well. There are comics, instruction booklet art, scenes from Sonic Adventure's opening scenes. There are also unlockables like playing as Knuckles in other Sonic games. There is the Blue Sphere game which is a game all about Sonic 3's bonus levels. Its extremely dull and tedious... good thing they made an entire bonus game out of it! Other games to enable are Flicky which is fun (for a while) 2D arcade game and Comix Zone a 2D sidescrolling brawler.WHAT ITS MISSING > some fresh levels for each of the original Sonic games would have been great... like a Sonic challenge \"game\" where you'd have a variety of new levels like Sonic 1 Green Hill Zone act 4. Or Sonic 2 Aquatic Ruin Zone act 3. That way you'd have the characters and gameplay mechanics from each Sonic game in the respective level and you can use set pieces and graphics from those games, but with new levels. That would have been nice.IN CONCLUSION > it's a great pack for the value even if some of the games are bad and needless to have on there. Anyone that likes 2D platforming should pick up this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2011"}

Avoid hot plates, electric shocks and inky turrets to create your own path to the impenetrable I.N.K.T. Fortress. Just remember that the struggle to reclaim Chroma City is to be fought on your terms. Remix the city in your own image using custom paints, patterns and soundtracks. Super-size your blob to attack larger and stronger enemies. Join the Color Revolutionaries to refine your skills while making a mess. The race to rescue Chroma City has just begun, and only de Blob can save the world from a black-and-white future.Gameplay: de Blob's Primary Goalde Blobis a 3D platformer where players use the Wii Remote/Nunchuck combo to maneuver their hero, de Blob. Equal parts amorphous blob of paint, struggling artist, revolutionary and juvenile delinquent, de Blob's goal is to replace the drab, lifeless gray coloring that the I.N.K.T. Corporation has imposed on Chroma City and its inhabitants, the Raydians, with a range of vibrant life-giving colors, all the while avoiding and battling the gray-clad forces of the Inkies.Players must acquire paint and hurl de Blob at the buildings, walls, statues, roads and skies above Chroma City. As de Blob bounces around, adding color wherever he lands, his supply of paint is depleted and he begins to dry out. As this happens players must collect more paint and rehydrate in pools and in front of hydrants scattered across the city. As the game starts access is limited to the colors red, blue and yellow, but these can be blended to create a number of other colors. Being able to create and apply these colors becomes important as Chroma City and its inhabitants come to life, and de Blob makes contact with a range of other characters known as the 'Color Revolutionaries' and receives an increasing amount of missions that charge him with splattering color all over town. Success at these mission gains the player point which drives the game forward, eventually leading to a direct assault on Comrade Black's I.N.K.T. fortress guarded by elite Inky soldiers and massive ink turrets.Key Game Features:de Blob- Flip, bounce and paint your way past the all-powerful I.N.K.T. Corporation to launch a revolution and save Chroma City from a future without vibrant color.Long Live Color!- Join the Color Revolutionaries in the resistance against the evil Comrade Black and his diabolical array of hot plates, electric shocks, and ink turrets.Free the Citizens- Free your friends from a black and white world by dodging ink cannons, flattening I.N.K.T. tanks and outsmarting Inky soldiers.Save your City- Remix Chroma City&rsquo;s towering skyscrapers, expansive bridges and massive landmarks in your own style using custom paints, patterns and soundtracks.Make a Mess- Super-size your blob as you splash, spray, and splatter everything you touch in sprint, race and combat challenges.Multiplayer- Compete for control as ink levels rise and wind cannons fire in eight multiplayer-specific gameplay modes.Plenty of Play Modesde Blobfeatures both a deep story-driven singleplayer mode where players get to dig into the Raydian's struggle against all-powerful I.N.K.T.

These multiplayer campaigns support up to four players, come with street and sewer maps and include four player split-screen functionality. Just a few of the multiplayer campaigns include:Paint Match- Paint as many buildings as possible and steal points from opponents by re-painting the buildings that they've already covered.Blob on the Run- A variation of 'Capture the Flag,' in this mode only one blob can paint and is pursued by opponents who attempt to slam him into submission and gain the ability to paint and accumulate points themselves.Blob Race- In this mode buildings can only be painted once and are indicated by in-game arrow.

They have picked up very appropriate elements for every color. When you hear new music for the first time as the color changes, it will give you a high kick to your brain. Very well executed game play with minute care to details.The basic structure of the game is similar to Katamari. You roll around, jumping and painting all the surfaces etc. etc. Open up more new section and add more colors. The game play never gets repetitive. As the levels progress you have to go from coloring every thing to coloring particular sections and mix and match things. The game play is always fresh.

The graphics are top-notch, and the facial animation technology employed by Rockstar is phenomenal.  The musical score totally fits 1940s L.A., and the sound effects are great.  There's nothing like hearing a victim's neck snap and crackle as you're twisting his head during the body investigations!!I sincerely hope that this game won't be the only outing for Rockstar.  Will there be a \"Chicago Noire\" styled after the Al Capone era, or how about \"New York City Nights\" following the Boss Tweed era?  We can only wait and see!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0001AVZ5I","reviewerName":"Helel","summary":"Another good Adult game from Rockstar.","reviewText":"It's pleasing when mature games are released, as there is such a plethora of titles aimed at the middle teen/child market. The warriors was a fun and worthwhile game.Set in 1979 it's a prequel to the events of the movie and in the last stages takes you through the events in the film. It feels very authentic and the areas are run-down and gritty just like in the movie. You play as various members of the Warriors gang who try to become major players in the inter-gang rivalry in New York.Missions usually involve beating the hell out of lots of people. There are no guns to use, it's pure physical combat and it's much better because of it.GRAPHICSThe graphics are decent and much like GTA, the characters all look decent and like their movie counterparts. It's very authentic in the way it portrays 1979 New York as well. Widescreen is included.8/10SOUNDThe music is again decent and suits the atmosphere perfectly. There are many great tunes here. The voice acting is excellent and nobody sounds contrived. It also has very realistic language that is guaranteed to offend many people. e.g\"Lets rumble those ****** queers\"!!\"Rip his ****** nuts off!\"\"Money, Clothes, pretty hoes, Big Moe can't be beat\"LolThis is great and is the trademark realism of Rockstar.8/10GAMEPLAYThe gameplay focuses mainly on the fight mechanics which enable you to do various moves such as fist combos, martial arts as well as ground and pound, throws, pins and the ability to use almost any object to hit the opponent. It's very satisfying to smash someone in the face with a glass bottle, all the hits really connect and feel painful. You get slow-mo effects when you do hard hits like bottles/bricks on the head and slamming someone into a wall.It also plays somewhat like the excellent Manhunt from Rockstar in that there are some stealth elements. Should take around 15-20 hours to complete and ther are a number of side missions you can do. You can also work out, take drugs (repairs health), mug people on the street, rip off stores etcThere are some flaws though. When in a crowded area such as a bar normal civilians can get in your way and they can act crazy - would you run into the middle of a 20 man gang fight? Also the controls are a little clunky and take some getting used to. The police are a little unrealistic as they are all wrestling experts and powerlifters. The camera isn't great and the auto targeting can often be frustrating.8/10OVERALLA nice release from Rockstar that plays well and is memorable thanks to it's realism and very fun fights. The characters are great, the other teams varied and interesting (An all female team!) and it's a decent purchase.8/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive.

{"product_name":"B003O6E800","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"It Stands the Test of Time","reviewText":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is by far one of the most critically acclaimed games of all time.  When it was released back in 1998 it garnered so many perfect scores that some have gone on to claim it as THE best game ever made.  It's gameplay in particular helped establish the action RPG genre.  To this day several video games still draw quite heavily (and fondly) from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.  As a result, Nintendo has decided to play it safe with this reissue.  You won't find a lot of new things here.  It's the same game you've always remembered.If you've experienced the game before you're going to know it like the back of your hand.  That's not to say there aren't a few gameplay differences, but they're mechanical mostly.  You won't find yourself going to any new dungeons or fighting new enemies.  But you will find that some of the control scheme is a little different.  For instance, inventory management is noticeably simpler here.  The action all plays out on the top screen while your inventory is on the bottom.  At the simple touch of the screen you can equip new items, view your gear and take a peak at the map.  It clears up the top screen so that you can view the gameplay and cinemas a lot better without there being a lot of clutter.There are, of course, no C-Buttons to set your items to.  Instead you can set two items.  One to X and one to Y.  It's not the same three, but you CAN set two additional weapons to slots on the touch screen that can be used fairly easily at the touch of a button.  It's a small change, but still effective.  The games controls transition to the 3DS smoothly and they're pretty tight and responsive.  The biggest difference to the controls is how it works in the 3DS's motion controls.  You can actually use the 3DS as a scope while you're targeting with your slingshot or arrows.  It's actually quite precise and easy.  If you don't want to use the motion controls you don't have to, and that's not really such a bad thing at all.The biggest upgrade, of course, are the graphics.  The original game used a lot of polygons to render Link and the denizens of Hyrule.  When playing Ocarina of Time 3D things have been smoothed over, but not unusually changed.  Characters such as Link, Zelda, Saria, etc. look pretty much exactly the same, but with less of the blocky and jagged edges and rather with smooth, round faces.  You're going to find a lot of 3DS games that look better, obviously, but the graphical upgrade isn't so bad in and of itself.  It's definitely easier on the eyes.  But that graphical improvement is pretty much all you get.  You won't actually get a lot more detail... just a lot of smoothing over.  It's more of an enhanced port rather than something that's been built from the ground up.  It represents Ocarina of Time's art style perfectly, but at the core it's still the same old N64 game.  You won't find areas strangely populated with more people, for instance.  And while a lot of the game looks better, there are still a few places that look as though they've been untouched.  So you won't really find a lot of additions.  Just a nice enhancement.The sound, however, doesn't sound any different at all.  Most of the classics tunes are in tact.  The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time has a marvelous soundtrack, but sometimes it's hard not to wish that perhaps there could've been an enhanced soundtrack as well.  Either way, it still sounds good.  The sound effects are also the same.  Link screams and grunts are the same, as is his sword and Navi's annoying presence.  Here, it seems like nothing has changed.In terms of new content, Ocarina of Time 3D is devoid of quite a bit.  You won't find any new dungeons or enemies or characters who have expanded tales or anything like that.  It's all the exact same game.  If you mastered the original N64 version there is nothing here that's going to be any different.  This might bum a few gamers out.  Especially because The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time has had a couple of releases already.  Two of them were on the Gamecube and there's one on the virtual console.  Veterans of the game are going to have to decide if a graphical enhancement alone is worth the price.That's not to say there aren't a few things added.  Just none of them really pertain to changing up the gameplay experience.  There is a Master Quest to tackle where the dungeons are slightly different and the world is mirrored.  You have to complete the game once to unlock the master quest.  There's also a boss challenge mode to tackle as well.  That's really about all you get with this package.  So once again it boils down to whether or not the enhanced graphics alone are worth the price.One thing to note, however, is that Ocarina of Time seems to have aged rather well.  The gameplay is still fun and immersive.  There are tons of places to explore and tons of sidequests.  Even by todays standards, Ocarina of Time is still well packed full of things to do.  If you've never experienced The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time before, this is a great place to do so.  If you have experienced the game before, it may be hard to command you play it again because of graphical enhancements and 3D... but it has still managed to age well, and it is still a lot of fun to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2011"}

After that you're looking for this missing Scientist named Malcolm Tedworth which you find out about this guy named Bernin that killed Tedworth. You get some car chases & driving levels & there fun. You have to chase this guy on foot the inforation that you get leads you to Pomerov. You go to Monaco where you run into this Jewellery Designer who is an informant for M  I  6 Nicole Hunter.  with her help you get to go around 1 of Pomerov's casino's where you are able to find out everything on him. Then M tells you that that Pomerov has a Chemical Refinery in Sibera. Bond poses as a body gaurd for Nicole as he goes around & you get to wreck shop pretty much. This level is kind of hard but you'll get through it when you learn everything. When you chase the train that Pomerov is in this can be ab  it  c  h. When you have to take down the plane Pomerov is in that can be hard too. It turns out that someone wanted Pomerov dead then you go after this guy named Rak. Bond talks to this General who is then assassinated. Then Bond goes to this club he knows the guy who runs it.

At the end of the mission you have to fight Rak he says that he can tell him who he is working with Bond tells him that he already knows. It turns out to be Nicole Hunter & the ending all as I will say is that it leaves it open for a sequel which I doubt there will be 1. I doubt this game soled well. I know I was vauge in talking about the plot for this game but I really try not to give too much away. I have some problems with this game like the driving levels can be hassle sometimes 1 time I got stuck in something in The Burma level. The aiming can be off sometimes. But this game has a classic Bond feel to it. The weapon selection is alright when you're using The Walther P  P  K it is silenced most of the timet would be nice if you could've picked if you wanted a silencer on it or not. The hand to hand combat is still there like in Quantum Of Solace I like the cell phone gadget it spots enemies out it & unlocks doors for you.

{"product_name":"B00420K18K","description":"","reviewerName":"pastapadre","summary":"The Show's revels in consistency...both the good and bad.","reviewText":"Any review of MLB 12: The Show is going to be quite similar to those done for past iterations of the series. There's a consistency to what The Show does well - just as there is with where it tends to falter. That certainly holds true with MLB 12 which delivers top notch authenticity, graphics, and depth while failing to provide an acceptable online play experience.POSITIVES*GameplayMLB 12 plays like The Show everyone is used and remains somewhat inaccessible in nature - it can be unrelentingly difficult at times. That's baseball though and The Show is as \"sim\" as they come. Hit variety has been enhanced somewhat due to better ball physics. It's nothing dramatic but a worthwhile enhancement that pays off over the long-term. The batter-pitcher battle feels strategically realistic and engaging, animations are excellent, and SCEA provides a number of options in controls, cameras, and difficulty levels to help each user tailor the experience for themselves as well as possible. Results always feel realistic and organic and that is the most important thing gameplay can offer.*AuthenticityThe Show remains the most respectful representation of a sport in gaming. The atmosphere, sounds, and pacing makes it feel more like baseball than a video game attempting to replicate it. Enhancements in presentation are subtle but notable such as cuts to a managers in the dugout. The biggest disappointment is that SCEA didn't get in the new 10 team playoffs or division tie-breaker games in for release.*GraphicsThe Show has been arguably one of if not the best looking team sports series this generation. MLB 12 is visually stunning with improved lighting, detailed stadiums, realistic player models and faces, and a wide variety of natural looking animations. The crowd is probably the weakest aspect graphically.*Depth of ModesThough little has changed with Franchise mode and Road to the Show they both provide immense value and combined with 'Diamond Dynasty' there is a commendable level of variety amongst them. There are some issues, like the game start times in Franchise mode, but otherwise they are solid as expected. For those who pick up the game on both the PS3 and Vita the ability to transfer Franchise and RTTS saves between the two systems is really well executed and beneficial.NEGATIVES*Online PlayTo the surprise of few online play with MLB 12 is excruciatingly bad. Debilitating lag often strikes, disconnects along with \"traffic delays\" are common, and being tied to servers with 'Diamond Dynasty' has meant results aren't always being registered. The lag favors pitching with even the best online players struggling to hit and produce runs. Adding insult to injury SCEA introduced an \"Online Pass\" this year which means it's now considered to be a value add-on. At this point if online play is important to someone it's well known that The Show will disappoint there. That it is still considered a premiere product despite such a huge portion of the game being severely deficient is a testament to how well it does everything else.*Lack of AdvancementSiphoning off development time to work on the Vita version could be costly for SCEA. There isn't much new with MLB 12 that will be readily apparent to anyone but the ultra hardcore crowd. It's the clear reason why the company avoided putting out a demo. 'Pulse Pitching' is notable for it's ability to make pitching more challenging despite its simplicity and differentiate pitchers better but it can be almost physically painful or nauseating to focus in on (that effect is lessened the more camera angles are distanced from the plate). 'Diamond Dynasty' is conceptually sound but poorly executed, commentary is dry and dated, collision detection between players is still absent, and loading times are still quite lengthy even with a larger hard drive install.SUMMARYThe Show is the most reliable of all sport gaming franchises. Consumers can know what to expect making it an easy purchase for those who have any interest in baseball - and though online play remains miserable even that has become totally predictable. While that confidence in the product is comforting the dwindling sense that SCEA is providing sufficient reason to buy year-to-year has never been more apparent than with MLB 12. Whether The Show has become a victim of its own success is arguable but those are the circumstances that must be accounted for going forward.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2012"}

It was easily better than any Mario game the SNES put out and really raised the bar for what side-scrolling games could do.  One can have hours of fun immersed in the DK world.  The only problem?  Hours of gnashed teeth will also be spent re-beating levels because of the stupid saving mechanism.The best part of the &#34;DK Country&#34; experience is that it is so unique.  It was kind of like playing a Mario game...but with new challenges and characters.  I liked how Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong both had unique abilities better suited for certain situations, making you (the gamer) figure out when to use each character.  The game is also quite challenging, but not to the breaking point.  After enough practice, most levels can be beaten before the hair-pulling stage.  It terms of gameplay and presentation, this is a 5-star effort all the way.The HUGE negative?  Having to beat multiple levels before being able to save a game.  Now, I realize that I have reviewed many NES games and never complained about the saving, but that was because the NES technology just did not allow for &#34;anytime saving&#34;.  By the time the SNES came around, though, one could have saved the game after every level.  However, the game designers decided to make you &#34;earn&#34; save points by beating a number of levels at a time.  In the beginning this is fine, as you whip through the levels and pile up the bananas/balloons without hardly a second thought.  Once you get to the ice-levels stage, though, the game requires you to beat 4-5 extremely difficult levels before saving is possible.  By this time in the game, the player is operating on more like a 4-5 turn basis per lifespan.  I realize the &#34;collecting bananas and trying to get specials&#34; argument for racking up multiple lives, but that isn't why I wanted to play the game.  I just want to beat each level and move onto the next without all the &#34;monkey business&#34; (pardon the pun).  This issue decreases the whole experience for me by an entire star.Thus, &#34;Donkey Kong Country&#34; is a classic in the canon of video game adventures.  A very frustrating save mechanism does put a damper on the experience for all but the experts, but overall it is still a fun game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0087OZ5FG","description":"","reviewerName":"Media Man","summary":"A quality wireless gaming headset, but a few concerns","reviewText":"As a DJ and avid gamer I'm always in the market for new and decent quality headphones. I've owned and used dozens of headphones over the years and there always seems to be something new for PC, gaming consoles and DJing. As I always enjoy testing out new headphones here are my thoughts on the PULSE wireless stereo headset - Elite Edition;Pros+ Superb sound and noise isolation. The bass is warm and rich, better than the majority of headphones I've owned.+ Set-up/pairing was extremely easy for my PC and PS3.+ Sits snuggly on your head (comes with a con see below)+ Microphone is built into the headset.+ Excellent bass boost/vibration/rumble effects.+ Plenty of audio controls.+ Multi-platform use (PC, PS3, PS Vita and other mobile devices).+ Solid construction.+ Wireless.Cons- Poor battery life of just under 5 hours.  I found this to be quite disappointing.- No charging cable included.  It's an inexpensive cable to include, especially at the asking price.- Instructions are severely lacking.- No Charging station/Stand, case or cover.- Earphones are faux leather and don't breathe well resulting in quite a bit of heat and sweat around my ears. Also, if you're a glasses wearer (like me) the headphones can really cause your cause your frames to dig into the side of your head. Rather painful. Unfortunately, this is very common with most over the ear headphones.- Controls can be troublesome to adjust in the middle of a game until you're used to the buttons.- Heavier than most other headphones of this size.- No Bluetooth.At the $150 range, the PULSE wireless stereo headset - Elite Edition is quite good, especially if you're a big console/PC gamer.  The main thing that I noticed right away was that the sound quality is absolutely amazing.  This headset will literally allow you to hear sounds you would never hear out of even the most high end speakers.  The build quality is very solid and it feels like the headset would hold up to rough users.  There are also plenty of controls that allow you to customize your sound depending on what you're playing/watching/listening too.  Despite my list of Cons (poor battery life being the biggest drawback) the PULSE wireless stereo headset - Elite Edition is an extremely functional and quality headset all around.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9YZK","description":"","reviewerName":"D. K. Malone","summary":"The strongest Playstation launch title in the console's history","reviewText":"I've been a Killzone fan since the first one was announced circa summer 2003. Back then when I was dying of Halo 2 anticipation/hype, the European press dubbing the newly announced Killzone a \"Halo killer\" instantly grabbed my attention. The moment I laid eyes on the first preview screenshots, the striking visual design hooked me and I kept a close eye on it from then on. A little over a year later it was in my hands. It clearly bit off more than the PS2 could chew and the game play suffered for it, the notion of it being a \"Halo killer\" was laughable. However I somehow managed to enjoy it enough to play through the campaign four times (once as each character) and a few times on top of that just because. Rather than running and gunning as a super soldier one-man army, it pit you as a four man strike team behind enemy lines on a secret mission. Killzone 2 outdid the first game in almost every way and is easily the top Playstation exclusive FPS, period. It played more like a classic WW2 game, with two large armies duking it out one battle field at a time... but in a surreal futuristic setting. Killzone 3 felt somewhat like a Killzone 2 expansion pack. It fell short in a few ways, most notably length. It did at least introduce some new environments, and it generally looked great. I enjoyed it a lot, while it lasted.Which brings us to Killzone Shadow Fall. Let's get the most obvious thing out of the way first: This game is a dazzling graphics showcase. Sweet, sweet eye candy. Even some hardcore PC gamers are able to admit this. Out of all of the next gen games I've seen this year, this is the one that screams \"NEXT GEN\" the loudest. It doesn't run at 60fps all the time, but it sure seems close to it a lot of the time. It certainly runs at more than 30, no doubt about that.The game play has changed, yet it still feels like Killzone to me. The pendulum has swung back from the \"WW2 in teh future vs. the Space Nazis\" and closer to the feel of the original Killzone. It's a futuristic cold war secret agent mission, where you're a one-man infiltration unit using some fancy gadgets. There are a few big battle set pieces where you're fighting along side a squad of allies, but they're few and far between. There are a few issues with the designers being typically stingy and thoughtless with checkpoints, and there's a particular section towards the end of the game that is one of the most frustrating sequences I've played through in many, many years. I have honest serious doubts that they even showed it to play testers, because if they had I simply cannot fathom how they could have approved it to be in the game. I'm not kidding, it made me fantasize about kidnapping and torturing some Guerrilla Games staff so that I could cause them the same amount of pain they caused me. (EDIT: this section was patched several weeks after the US launch, just in time for the EU launch... lucky bastards.) Still, a few rough bits aside, it's a very good single player campaign that, while very different, is on par with Killzone 2 in terms of length (about 10 hours, if you're not some freak who plays as if you're being judged on time) and fun. Even the aforementioned rage-inducing free fall sequence wasn't bad enough to merit taking off a whole star.Seriously, I would love for anyone to come up with any Playstation launch title since the console debuted in 1995 that's as strong as this one. I honestly can't think of any.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2013"}

Unlike COD and BF it doesn't have EXP points, instead it gives you a TO DO list that you need to do to gain skill upgrades and killing enemies give you Team Points instead.

I recall, when I first got a PS2, which was years ago (I had the big, black, old one so you do the math), I would rent games for it in the movie store. I saw Jak and Daxter and it looked exactly like my type of game. And so, of course I loved it. This game is flawless, the graphics are awesome (I adore the cartoon type graphics, it suits it so well), and the characters are loveable. I fell in love with Jak when I started playing as him (yes I'm one of those weird girls who thinks that guy characters are hot). As a pair, Jak and Daxter are awesome. I never and will never know to this day if Jak was a mute or not in the first game. Sometimes he acted like he was about to talk when Daxter cut in instead. So, who knows. It makes it all the funnier. I could complain about how the game seems a bit short but in all honesty I think it's exactly the right length for an adventure game like this. It really wasn't too short nor too long. Right in the middle. And after you beat the game you can go back and collect the rest of any power cells that you missed, which if you get lets you see a secret scene for collecting them. It's nothing too long but it makes you want to grabe the second game to see what it is. Not my favorite game in the Jak and Daxter trilogy but I still love nonetheless!

{"product_name":"B000E9TBRK","description":"Tetris DS is Tetris like you've never seen before! With six highly addictive modes of play, with single-player challenges & multiplayer matches. Each of the six modes of play features a theme based on a classic Nintendo game. It makes the most of the DS stylus and dual screens, and allows a Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to compete in two- or four-player battles.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Hey, it's Tetris!","reviewText":"Tetris is a fun addictive puzzle game which pretty much defined the genre.  It's simple to play, fast, and addictive.  It has a home on almost every console you can think of, and now it has a home on the Nintendo DS.  How does Tetris DS stack up to the fun, addictive Tetris games of the past?  Pretty well, actually, but that doesn't mean it's without fault.Tetris has come a long way in the past twenty years.  Tetris DS seems to be out to be \"different\" from the Tetris games of the past, and it succeeds by presenting you with various game modes.  Some are fun, some are torture, but they are, for the most part, what makes Tetris DS a good investment.Single player mode is divided up into six different gameplay modes.  There's marathon mode, which will challenge you to clear 200 lines, a line clear mode which pretty much lets you tinker around with the drop speed and how many lines you start with.Playing against the computer isn't so bad.  There are some different modes with them as well.  The standard versus mode of course, but also a push mode which puts an interesting spin on Tetris by having you and your computer opponent on the same baseline.Then there's touch style mode.  Here you'll use the stylus to rotate and set down all the different shapes.  While playing touch mode there's a puzzle mode to go at.  Puzzle mode is actually fun.  Giving you an endless amount of puzzles to clear.  You're given a limited number of pieces to clear out all the blocks.  It's a good challenge and will keep you on your toes.  You can also play a puzzle mode without the stylus, a non-touch puzzle mode.  It's virtually the same thing.Mission mode is the mode I had a few problems with.  It starts off all fine and dandy until you're presented with the game actually showing you just what to do.  They'll give you certain tasks, such as telling you to clear out three lines with a certain piece.  It sounds fun, but it quickly become frustrating.  Some of these missions are seemingly impossible, especially with how they set things up for you.The other mode that wasn't so much fun was the catch mode.  In catch mode you're a four block core.  Your goal is simple, to \"catch\" the descending blocks to form a four by four square.  It's pretty boring and just isn't much fun.However, where Tetris DS excels more than anything is the multiplayer aspect.  In Tetris DS it's not only fun, but also the best form of multiplayer I've ever seen in a puzzle game.  Best of all, only one person needs to have the game, the rest of your friends can join any time they want.  Up to ten (you heard me) people can play multiplayer at a time.  You can customize and set up your own rules as well.  You could have two teams of five or five teams of two.  There are also plenty of items to be had, such as being able to get nothing but the ever so helpful straight blocks.  It's just a lot of fun and it's really addictive.Unfortunately, I can't say as much for going online.  Online seems pretty limited.  It's nice to see Tetris actually is online, I just wish it had been executed much better.  For one, there's hardly any customization.  You can battle with up to four people.  If you can't find a fourth person you're stuck only battling one other person (this means three people can't play at a time).  It's kind of a disappointment considering how much fun you'll have with the standard multiplayer.  So while Tetris is online... it isn't a fantastic experience.Where Tetris seems to take a turn is also in the sense of what you can do with your pieces.  There's a shadow that shows you where your piece will fall to.  Don't want to wait?  There's a hard drop which instantly allows you to drop a piece into the desired spot.  There's also a place to \"hold\" pieces, which is more useful in Tetris than you could imagine.  If you're given a piece that just doesn't work for you, you can substitute it in for one of the pieces you're currently \"holding.\"  Unfortunately, this is pretty much all that's tweaked as far as gameplay goes.  In essence, it's still the same Tetris you played twenty years ago.Speaking of twenty years ago, this Tetris definitely keeps nostalgia in mind.  In many of the modes and levels you'll see familiar 8-bit NES style looks.  You might catch a glimpse of classic games such as Mario, Zelda and Metroid.  The music is also nostalgic.  If your level is decorated with Metroid, you'll have Metroid style music.  It's overall a good experience if you like nostalgia.The only thing that keeps Tetris DS down is the simple fact that it's another Tetris game.  Yes, the different modes are fun, but what it really boils down to is that it's the same game you've played for twenty years.  You'll want to buy it because it's Tetris, but you'll also want to leave it on the shelf because it's Tetris.  If you're still content with your copy on the Gameboy (or perhaps you've got a copy of Tetris and Dr. Mario for Super Nintendo), then you'll have to ask yourself if the extra game modes are worth it.  The answer is simply, yes they are.  It's not that big of a step above say... Tetris Worlds, but Tetris has undergone changes that make it unique, and still a fun addictive puzzle game.The Good+Plenty of different Game modes to play+Multiplayer is an all out blast+Tetris finally goes onlineThe Bad-Online play is overall disappointing-If you just don't care for the extra modes and classic style Tetris does it for you, then this game will most likely turn you away because well... it's Tetris, and you have to admit that despite how far Tetris has come, it hasn't changed much.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2006"}

Players looking for the full experience can use combat-like racing strategies to attack other karts with an array of dramatic weapons, while those interested in focusing solely on racing, can stick to racing in Pure Race mode.

Newberry \"agent_47\"","summary":"A Solid Shooter.A Completed Game Review.Normal&Hard settings","reviewText":"Brothers in Arms is a  First Person Shooter based on a true story.This game has authentic locations and weapons based on real life WW2 combat areas in Normandy right down to the square yard,even the house details are nearly exact.You could  visit these places in real life and see the same area you see in the game and even the wall you used for cover.You are a Squad Leader that eventualy gains control of 2 teams.One is a Fire team for Suppression fire,and the other team is an Assault team for closer up front enemy fire.Your job is to command these 2 teams effectivly.First by using your Fire team to suppress the enemy and then using your Assault  team to Flank the enemy .Basicly you Find Em,(suppress)Fix Them,Flank Them ,Fire on them.Your Enemies also use simular Fire and maneuver tactics and they will shift there defenses based on your movements,but they will never leave there fixed Machine Gun positions.To move your men.. you use whats called one button-context sensitive command system ,by pressing Left Trigger and moving hilight over desired area and letting go of left trigger.Its easy to do once you get the hang of the command system.You also use the d-pad for commands such as \"on me\" and to change fire teams.Also you can use white button to quickly change fire teams and issue order.It may take a few levels before you get it down. If you use your fire team to first suppress the enemy then use your assault team to flank and fire.You will mostly be successful.Its true that sometimes your squad will not do as well as you want them to and they would not be able to hit enemies sometimes ,I was able to pick enemies off easily but my squad werent the best targeters,but for the most part they do a good job,sometimes they even  find better firing positions,this is definatly one of the better command shooter maneuver games out there with relativly smart A.I. .On Normal and Hard mode your squad is never able to hit enemies while in cover but I was able to pick off enemies when they peeked up from cover.If I had to rate me compared to my squad as riflemen,My squad would get a 4 and I would get an 8 out of 10. Sometimes I would hilight an area behind a wall for my squad to use as cover and one of them would line up on the opposite side of the wall facing wrong direction as enemy would spawn in, I had to re-issue the command to get them behind wall.A nice feature is that if all of your squad gets taken out,you can still finish the level solo.The graphics are nice ,nothing spectacular but they do a nice job and the faces of your squad mates are nicely detailed .The frames skipped sometimes ,probably because of all the stuff goin on in the screen.There is a feature in this game called Situational Awareness View ,basicly this an overhead view of you ,your men,enemies,and the surrounding area.You get this view by pressing the back button to pause game then you get a chance to scout the terrain for possible flanking areas for your fire and maneuver tactics.In the real WW2 they used maps  before they entered an area , so this game also gives you advantage of knowing the surrounding area by using your situational awareness feature.There was some times when I wish my player was able jump over a fence to get a better flank position,(in the real world we can climb over 3ft fences )and I wish you also climb over small walls,But this game does give you,for the most part,alot of ways to Flank your enemy.This is definatly a well designed and fun game ,I noticed your men get smarter on the harder settings and there's more enemies and even an added tank that wasnt in the level on the Normal setting.I played the game on Normal setting and beat it in Two days.Im guessing maybe it was 11hrs total gametime to finish.After you beat the game on Normal setting ,two cheats open up in the menu section ,'Unlimited Ammo' and 'Old Movie Mode' old movie is basicly black & white mode.You have easy,normal,hard, & realistic settings.The realistic setting  is only available after beating the game on hard difficulty.Once you beat the game on Realistic setting a cheat opens up called 'Super Squad'.The game saves automaticly once you get to a certain point in the level,so there's no saving on the fly .It does seem to save in the right points,so no harm there.You have the ability to have the crosshairs turned on or off.The fixed machine gunners are tuff to beat but with the right suppressive/flank maveuver they can be dealt with.The Squad A.I. is  good in this game,it really depends on how good you are at picking the right suppresion and fire areas for your squad.Remember the 4 F's ..Find,Fix,Flank,Fire.Always try to use the Fire team to suppress enemies.And There is almost always a Flank opportunity for your Assault Team.The tactics used in this game are based on real life WW2 fire and maneuver tactics and WW2 veterans were on hand for help in designing game to make it authentic as possible.There were some things I wish they couldve added ,like the ability for your men to operate fixed Machine gun  positions,only your man can operate them.Also I wish You could drive the Tanks but the tank drivers do fight well ,but it depends on how well you command them.Sometimes there was some serious Lag in the framerates .But with all that said..this game is  fun  with  nicely done cinematics,graphics, sound effects,and good solid shooter gameplay.The enemies are tough but not too tough.But there are 4 different difficulty settings. There's also alot of bonus info after completing levels on certain difficulties,such as WW2 photos of tanks,personel,maps,documents,alot of real WW2 information.This is a good game ,a more hands on tactical shooter.Its definatly a FPS all the way around. Now that Ive completed game on Hard setting its not that different than Normal setting hopefully Realistic setting will be a challenge.I think its a little too easy  on Normal & Hard settings.But  Definatly worth playing.HINT:If you want this game to be harder turn off the overhead circles above the enemy ,they are the red/grey circles that indicate enemies positions and the status of there suppression.You can turn them off in the options menu.Without the red circles on,the enemies are tougher to spot.Also finish game on Hard difficulty to open up the hardest setting, Realistic mode. Good Luck.Thanks To All Who Serve In The Armed Services.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2005"}

Rhodes","summary":"It Should've Been So Much More","reviewText":"The Resident Evil games outside of the main series haven't really done too well.  Especially the first person shooter ones such as Resident Evil: Survivor or Resident Evil: Dead Aim.  And they performed poorly with good reason.  It's nice to say that Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles isn't bad, but it would've been so much better to say it was good.Umbrella Chronicles is not entirely a new game.  It only serves to show you the downfall of Umbrella.  You'll play through Resident Evil 0, Resident Evil 1 and Resident Evil 3.  Originally, I said it was a shame that Resident Evil 2 was not included in the package.  Well, since the original review was written, Darkside Chronicles came out and it does include Resident Evil 2.  You're getting quite an adventure and a nice trip down memory lane.  A lot of the game is narrated nicely by Albert Wesker as you plow through the game.You'll have your stock of weapons and ammunition as you go through the game.  Your standard handgun has infinite ammo and can be used to take down most of your basic enemies.  You'll also pick up other weapons which do have ammunition in limited supply.  Most enemies can be taken down quite easily.  Every enemy also has a weak spot you can shoot that results in a one-hit kill.  Unfortunately, it's not easy to hit these spots.Like the Wii Edition of Resident Evil 4, Umbrella Chronicles feels natural for the Wii. It's no problem getting acquainted to the controls.  You can look around a little with the nunchuck, and you'll use the wii remote to aim and shoot at your foes.  The game is also compatible with the wii zapper.  In addition to blasting your enemies you'll also be able to use your knife by swinging the wii remote.  In short, Umbrella Chronicles is easy to pick up and play.  The overall adventure isn't too hard either.You'll have some fun with the game because its really simple stuff, but it feels a lot like the House of the Dead arcade shooters.  In a sense, it feels very empty at times.  You have enemies coming at you left and right, but the gameplay eventually turns into something repetitive.  Throughout the adventure it just feels like something more could've been done with the game.  More variety in the gameplay would've been nice.  It's fun at first but there's just not enough thrown at you.  There are moments where you're reflexes will be tested and you'll have to shake the wii remote or press certain buttons.  This'll keep you on your toes, but it's still not enough to drive past the fact that the game grows repetitive really fast.Perhaps the most striking aspect of Umbrella Chronicles is that it simply could've been a better looking game.  The environments have the look of Resident Evil, but the textures are not all that smooth.  It doesn't look bad, but it certainly needed a bit of a polish to make it look better.The music is a little strange.  It's this aspect that doesn't make the game feel like Resident Evil.  The music doesn't carry that eerie tone.  It's not bad, though.  For the most part it has a good soundtrack but you can't help but think that you're playing a game that looks like Resident Evil but feels like something else.Umbrella Chronicles isn't a bad game by any means.  But it sure isn't good either.  Die-hard Resident Evil fans might like it, but it would probably be better to wait until the list price comes down for a game that would've fared better in the arcade rather than the home console.Pros:+Relive some of the best moments of the Resident Evil series+Simplistic and easy gameplay to grasp+Nice voice workCons:-Not enough variety in the gameplay-Graphics could've used a polish","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2007"}

Still a 9 out of 10 though!","reviewText":"First and far most, I finally decided to get the newest PS3 version to play great video games. A couple years ago with the high PS3 price and less great selection of games, I wouldn't think about getting PS3 yet. However now is a great time to get the latest version PS3 for the price, durability, more energy efficient (less heat should mean less chance of failure) and the great selection of video games out now. Here are just some of the great positives for the the newest PS3. 1. First time I used it, I was very happy to notice that it is so quiet. No loud fan or noise! I heard some older PS3 sounded too loud. This PS3 is good for watching movies without hearing noise in background. 2. My main reason to get PS3 was great selection of games such as Uncharted 2, God of War 3, Red Dead Redemption and the list goes on and on. And the prices for games are becoming very reasonable now. You don't have to pay $59.99. 3. It really is a great blu-ray and dvd player. It makes my regular DVDs look amazing. This is a big reason to get PS3 for its dvd and blu-ray capabilities. I will be buying a blu-ray remote though just for convenience. 4. It has built-in wifi, the internet and playstation network for free. 5. Put movies, pictures and videos on it but I really didn't even try that. 6. Stream netflix movies on it. Sure the netflix streaming selection is pretty bad but once in a while you can find some good movie on it. It is nice to have. Now, I will talk about the negatives. 1. I thought the internet would be better but the browser is set up weird with no website address on top (really?), slower and lot of sites have trouble showing up i guess to adobe flash as I tried to watch videos and the flash doesn't support this device. And because I don't like the internet on PS3 much, I won't waste money on a PS3 keyboard so I am stuck typing with a PS3 controller. Yes, it is annoying and difficult to type fast on a PS3 controller. Part of the reason why I can't even see myself having any decent conversation on Playstation Home. The Playstation Home simply isn't for me anyways but maybe it is for some other people. I would love to see the PS3 fix their browser to make it somewhat like a regular computer. I think the playstation store is nice to have but too expensive and small selection of movies. I will use the internet browser once in a while but don't think PS3 will replace your use of a laptop or pc. I still think internet as a \"bonus\" of the PS3 as I didn't get the PS3 because of the internet feature. I really got it for the great video games!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2010"}

However I didn't understand why they mostly focused on combat when mass effect is suppose to mainly be a rpg.What I didn't like was that they took out some of the characters I would liked to have on my squad like grunt, wrex and miranda and stick you with a muscle head like vega. Also it seemed like even though there were fewer characters you couldn't interact with them as much as you could in the last two games. The combat was good but the cover system sucks. Even when I was hiding behind a full wall I was still getting shot. I also didn't like the quest log and the way they took out all the interaction with the quest givers. You mainly just run by and overhear a conversation and that's how you get quests. Your quest log is pretty much a mess in this game and not like the last two where everything was nice and sorted. I was annoying with the planet scanning and reaper chase mini game. Plus fighting the same mobs over and over again. The last two had variety like krogan, asari, turain , human as well as rachi. In this one it mostly felt like I was fighting cerbus and repear mobs over and over again.That is just a few of the things I didn't like about this game. I could go on but everyone has pretty much heard about how it didn't seem like mass effect at all and instead just a rush job. All in all I would just recommend waiting until the price drops and all this mess about the ending and dlc passes by before you buy this game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2012"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest.

The new weapons are all worth using and some of the old ones have been tweaked to perfection. So why am I giving this game a 4? Well, certain parts of it simply feel unbalanced where the difficulty is concerned. What I mean is that sometimes the fight getting you to a boss is much more difficult than the boss itself. And some of the earlier stages are more difficult than those later in the game. You'd expect this sort of imbalance in the real world, but it just feels wrong when it shows up in a video game.

The kill cam is awesome and will probably have you wasting ammo just so you can keep hitting the guy.I only have two gripes with the game. One is that sometimes when emerging or entering cover you'll get stuck. He'll just kinda stand there and it sucks when it's in the middle of combat. The only way out of it is to roll. My second gripe is with the controls. In every other (recent) shooter game I've played the square button is reload. In Max Payne 3, reload is circle and square is to hide behind cover. I guess using square is hardwired into my brain so it usually causes me to get shot up some.I also find this game brings out my inner completionist. Those golden guns are quite epic. They stand out a bit but I think they make for a good change of...appearance I guess would be the word.So yeah, I recommend it.

John Woo's Stranglehold did bullet-time with slo-mo kills, Uncharted 3 did movie-esque adventure and action, and Mass Effect 3 did superb gun battles with droves of enemies....and the South American Favela thing has been done before also (and better) in Modern Warfare 2.  And, if you want to talk about the suspense that the storyline invokes....well, heavy rain does that too.All the aforementioned games (with the exception of Stranglehold) are actually better games that Max Payne 3...and Max Payne is not a tough-as-nails cop (as you'll see when he gets a gun taken from him in the game by teenage gangsters - wtf - and Niko Bellic from GTA IV would stomp the crap out of Max any day of the week), it underwhelms what Rockstar is trying to do with the franchise.While I understand Max Payne 3 for current-gen systems was probably on Dan Houser's to-do list before releasing another GTA game, he should have stuck to the age-old adage of \"go with what works, and leave alone what doesn't\".  While Max Payne is fun (both storyline and multiplayer), alot of people are going to forget all about Max in a couple of months and going back to playing as John Marston in Red Dead Redemption, Detective Cole in L.A.

{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A fine conclusion to an underrated series","reviewText":"Resistance 3 concludes the trilogy of sci-fi first person shooters from developer extraordinaire Insomniac in a very fine fashion.For the first time in the trilogy, you are not playing as soldier/Chimera Nathan Hale, but as Joseph Capelli, a family man who is one of the few survivors left in the United States after the Chimera have decimated the planet. Discovering a last chance opportunity to save humanity, Capelli leaves his family in the South, and begins a quest to reach what was formerly New York City. Resistance 3 documents his journey across the country, and this game contains some of the finest moments of the entire trilogy. In typical Resistance fashion, there are some amazing set pieces here that set the stage for epic battles with both the Chimera, and also against other human survivors who have been warped and corrupted by years of war.Fans will be grateful to see the return of the weapon wheel here, which is very welcome after the 2 weapon limit of the previous game in the series. And another reason to be thankful for the weapon wheel is the plethora of new weapons introduced, which add up to create the best arsenal the Resistance series has seen thus far. Another great improvement in the game is the weapons upgrade system, which makes its way over from the Ratchet & Clank series. The more you use each weapon, the stronger it becomes and the more it evolves, and given the great arsenal you have, it makes for a very enjoyable meta game trying to get all your weapons maxed out to the highest possible upgrades. Resistance 3 is also the best looking game in the series, sporting beautiful graphics that seem to have a tinge of cel shading, giving the game a fantastic, comic book style look. The same fun, tense gameplay from the previous two games is here in spades, and you'll be entertained for every minute of the 8 hour single player campaign.The one area in which Resistance 3 is a bit of a let down is with regards to the story, which is a shame considering that narrative was a real strength of the first two games. The story isn't necessarily bad, but it just feels a bit uninspired. Most unfortunate is the ending, which just seemed rushed, cliched, and completely anti-climactic. While the first Resistance game was a fantastic fusion of a World War II-styled shooter mixed with aliens and futuristic technology, and the second game was the sci-fi extravaganza, it seems that Resistance 3 was trying to be more humanistic and intimate, but it just doesn't pull it off very well, which is a shame.Regardless, Resistance 3 is an excellent first person shooter and a worthy conclusion to one of the best franchises on the PS3. I do hope Insomniac revisits Resistance on the next generation Playstation.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2013"}

Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"Solid, but not amazing","reviewText":"Maybe because I loved the first game so much I expected this to be Mass Effct 1, part 2, but the second game is quite a bit different. Some aspects were improved upon, some things are just mediocre, and some things were just bad.The good: The combat is more refined (and, for those who enjoy it, there is more of it in this game). Changing your ammo type in ME1 was a pain, requiring a few steps each time you come into contact with new enemies. Now changing ammo is as simple as using a biotic or tech power. Thumbs up for that one.The biotic and tech powers were, I felt, much more powerful in this game. And I'm glad, because in the first game they felt more like support abilities than a legitimate way to play through the game. New biotic and tech powers make it feasible to be purely tech or biotic and still come through battles okay.The atmosphere. The designers did a great job really making you feel that this was the end of the line, a real suicide mission. Laughs and jokes are few and far between, and it is a much darker story than the first. In this game, when you begin the final plot mission, you really do wonder how many of your team members are going to get killed. And it is unnerving. I thought that was done very well. Accompanying the atmosphere was the music, which is much the same as the first, but that's not a bad thing. The music is very good.The mediocrity: Male Shepard's voice acting. There is little range in it. I could go on and on, but it's nothing special. Not like Two World's bad, but it could use a lot of work (Female Shepard's voice work is much better).The cameos made by characters from the first game. Not just by your former crew, but of characters you might have saved as well. They were thoroughly underwhelming, despite the fact that one of the really neat aspects of this game was that you could import your character from the first game. It felt at some points like they were squeezing past characters in where they just didn't need to be.The weapons system. Gone are the massive stockpiles of weapons you can amass in ME1, replaced by weapons you slowly upgrade throughout the game. It is effective, but very limiting. I preferred the wide selection offered in the first game.The mineral collection. Luckily the Mako was scrapped, and you play a minigame where you use the Normandy's scanner to read inside the planet. When you detect an element, you send a probe to collect it. It is a slight improvement on the way you gather them in the first game (and also because you actually USE them in this game), but it is incredibly tedious and time consuming to build your elemental supplies by scanning planets.Your crew's backstory. Maybe I am just old school (a la Knights of the Old Republic), but I find it very wearisome having to traverse three ship decks just to talk to all of the members of my team. It takes a long, long time, especially when you spend seven or eight minutes apiece talking to them. There has to be an easier way.The Bad: The reception your character receives from (most) former crew members. A couple times I felt like they changed a character's personality to intentionally make sure they would be recruitable in this game. I didn't think they had to do it that way. I would give specific example, but I do not want to give anything away to someone who has not played the game.Maybe it was just me, but I found it unrealistic that (playing as a male character), I could bed any of the female characters on my team. I much preferred Knights of the Old Republic's take on relationships, where, if you go one way with one character, it pushes your standing with another in the opposite direction. As in real life. I found it trite that I could essentially push all of the characters to within one dialogue option of going to bed with them at the same time. And to try it out, after I finished the game, I went back to the character I had slept with, and initiated the same dialogue we had had previously to sleeping together, and declined her request, and instead went to another female character and accepted hers. I was disappointed in that aspect a lot.The game is Mass Effect 2, and it is solid. If I could give it 3 and 1/2 stars I would, but it just doesn't feel the same as the first game did. I will not judge the game on its graphics, because that is not the measure of a good game. Mass Effect 2 has many layers, and many people will love it, and I'm glad. Because the game could have been a lot worse. But I also think it could have been a lot better.My opinion is that even though it is definitely not the first game, it is worth buying. Because even though it is not another iteration of the first game, it is still much better than many other games out there.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2010"}

The music changes as what the act is like, like it changes to fast pace if u have to hurry to do somthing but most of it is japanese. It has the best multiplayer out of all of the MOHs because u can battle up to four people on the same team or against each other. U can even be by ur self on multiplayer but u r against cpus. U can choose how many and whoever u want on ur team or who u want to go against.

It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Catherine Review","reviewText":"In the game Catherine you get to act out a very dark and twisted soap opera of sorts. You will be playing the part of Vincent a man scared of commitment and yet in a long term relationship with a girl named Katherine. It isn't until Katherine starts pushing that the story begins, along with the nightmares. Soon after the discussion of marriage starts to heavily weigh into the conversation Vincent meets a beautiful blond at his favorite watering hole, the Stray Sheep. This is where the real fun begins. You'll have to deal with two combating relationships, as well as survive each nightmare filled night.Graphically this game doesn't have ot pump out all that much as the majority of the game takes place in only a couple of places, and most time is spent trying to get through another nightmare. That basically includes a lot of different types of blocks you'll have to work with to try to climb out of each stage. I do have to say I did appreciate the mixture of animation and in game graphics in parts, it definitely helped get the story along, and the characters all had a very unique feel to them and allowed me to relate to each of them as separate people.Music outside of the nightmare goes from your average background bar sounds, to some stressful music to help punctuate the moment. I'm a huge fan of voice acting, and there is going to be plenty to listen to in the game. The best part is that almost all is unique dialog so there's not a whole lot of rinse and repeat that you have to go through. You'll want to actually talk to as many people as you can in the bar to help get you further into the story.The controls are REALLY simple. You're going to have the d-pad, you could use the left analog stick, but believe me you're going to be making way too many mistakes that way. You'll also be utilizing the X button to use items that you either picked up or purchased, and then there's the A button, which is what really causes all the magic to happen. You'll be using that button to hold on to block to move them in the direction you specify.The true meat of the game is in the puzzle levels where you'll need to move blocks around so that you can accend up the level to the exit. Most of the time it is not a straight shot and you'll find that you'll have to backtrack in order to truly reach your goal. As you go through the levels you'll notice that more blocks are introduced, which will definitely spice things up. In most levels there's just a time limit that you'll have to combat with, but from time to time you might find enemies trying to stop you, or kill you, and then there are also those rare cases where there will not only be that but something coming up from below to try to take you out and make you really think on your feet. Overall this game had me from start to finish. Sure there were some more than frustrating deaths that happened because I screwed up somewhere or the thing(s) from below got me when I wasn't ready. My one issue with the game, though, was that there were times where you're hanging on to an edge of a block and you accidentally get behind the block and trying to get you to come back out, or perhaps pop out the side gets a little confusing with the controls as you get disoriented with the left and right directions.This game is definitely not for everyone, but for those willing to give it a try, you might find that this is just the type of game that has something so strange, being a romantic horror puzzle game, for one, that it latches on to you and the only thing you can do is continue to play it. I fully recommend this game to all who wish to play it, and with that being said I have to say that this game gets a 9.4 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

Mullins","summary":"Best Game of the Holiday season","reviewText":"Despite the months of hype and the incredibly high expectations, it looks like Mass Effect has lived up to them all. This isn't too surprising considering Mass Effect was created by Bioware, a firm synonymous with the best RPGs of the last decade. The story and interaction in Mass Effect is superb, and the freedom of action and choices it allows is amazing. The voice acting is amazing, it is at times more like playing through an interactive blockbuster than a video game. They story contains a good number of sci-fi clich&eacute;s but it carries them off so well you stop noticing very early into the game. Like a good RPG should, Mass Effect draws you effortlessly into the game from start to finish. The interactive experience is superb.The controls are rather easy to master, and while the AI and combat suffers at times, it doesn't grow old or stale. The ability to modify and customize your weapons, armor and characters is easy but rewards and keeps things fresh. The ability to move all upgrades from one piece of equipment to a new one is also a nice time saver. The difficulty settings are spot on. Almost anyone can play through the game on the easy setting without much difficulty, enabling everyone to enjoy the cinematic masterpiece. For the more hard core and combat intensive the Insane difficulty is a good challenge. I picked up Mass Effect not sure if it was even possible for a game to live up to the hype it has received. I was delighted to find that it not only lived up to it, but surpassed it. I recommend it highly to any fans of the genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2007"}

For instance, If you make a roller coaster, either its way too intense for the parkers ( people in park ) to ride on, or way too boring. This game is called RCT to RIDE rides, right? Well, you can't make your own roller coaster to have people go on it. To make people want to ride your coasters you have to make a premade one. I hate premades; i like to make them myselves. Anyways, this game had potential, but it didn't do what it was intended. A lot of cool new stands and landscapes and rides, but it seems that this game was rushed.

I gave this game a try about 2 months ago for about 15 mins and it wasn't fun at all. So the opening of getting you into the game sucks. It's already bad enough that it's a old  played out ww game. So after forcing myself to go back & play since I have a craving for sniping it was somewhat fun. So about 3rd mission the games picks up as they start throwing tons of enemies at you while you're at a sniping distant. The slow motion ground breaking bullet effects is awsome and never gets old. The parts where the game gets dull is when you at close quarters where you use your machine gun as it feels like you have to load a whole clip into a enemy to kill them. Then there's really no sneaking around as you could probably pull off stealth killing 2 enemeis but after that you usually run into a opening and boom the alarm goes off thus 20 enemies to snipe. So not much stealthing to get pass a level quicker, the only route is to snipe everyone, seriously. Another thing is when you die you're usually set back to a 5min behind checkpoint. Usually after each wave of enemies they autosave for you. The story, I really didn't care to much about it, all I know is he's trying to kill 4 high targets but as the game progress they pretty much make it clear of the 4 guys you're killing. It took me about 4 days to complete the game putting in about 2 hours a day.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2012"}

Survival horror as its never been seen before, The House of the Dead: OVERKILL is a pulp-style take on the best selling, classic SEGA light-gun shooter series. Back when the famous Agent G was fresh out of the academy, he teamed up with hard-boiled bad-ass Agent Washington to investigate stories of mysterious disappearances in small-town Louisiana. Little did they know what blood-soaked mutant horror awaited them in the streets and swamps of Bayou City.","reviewerName":"Tso Haven Hei Wan \"Havenough Dupont Randall-B...","summary":"B Grade movie fun all the way","reviewText":"Love Umbrella Chronicles and to be honest there aren't a lot of interesting games out for the Wii for me since that game. Therefore when I saw the new House of the Dead game, decided to give it a go.The game came in the form of a Bang Bang Box, with a graphic novel, and two AMS Gun accessories for immense shooting action. The guns are well made, and seriously feels more real life than the Wii Zapper. It is a bit on the heavy side but then that makes it feel more like a real gun. The details are also much better than a lot of other cheap accessories in the market. So with AUD$10 more it is well worth it.Back to the game itself, it is constructed around the concept of a B Grade Gore Movie Feast. So you can imagine a lot of bad dialogue and badly crafted scenes. But since it shows itself as like that right from the opening credits, you won't feel disappointed at all. The voice acting actually were pretty good and for the parents, the game contains a lot of swear words, so probably it is not the best thing for your kids. Also there are a lot of graphic gore scene and sexually charged scenes that will not be suitable for kids at all. So that's something parents need to think about before buying the game.Game control wise, it is a standard rail shooter so there aren't a lot to talk about. The difference is that unlike Umbrella Chronicles, you have unlimited armo, that makes things a bit easier than Umbrella Chronicles. However at the same time there are lots more hordes of mutants attacking you in this game. Adding to the standard shooting are icons around the dungeons that you can shoot - slow down enemies, additional bonus golden brains and of course medic pack and grenades. However, they usually show up at absurd places in the area and requires quite fast reactions as some of them only show up in split seconds. You can upgrade your weapons from cash you got from your bonus and unlock new weapons. A similar thing with Umbrella Chronicles.Learning curve wise, if you are a proficient rail shooter player, you won't find it too difficult to handle the game. The grainy B-Movie style presentation though sometimes posed visual disability on you as some areas are dark and grainy. There are some annoying enemies that will grab you or cause a lot more damage on you if they explode in front of you. They could be frustrating but not to an extent that you will get put off by them. Head shots are key to boost bonuses but with hordes of mutants ambushing you, sometimes it is hard to aim for the heads.Game replayability wise, the story is pretty short, but then you have an extra mutant mode for the main game and after you finished the original story once, you unlock the director's cut for more. However, all the weapons you purchased in the original story will be gone in the director's cut so you will need to work hard to get them all back in this mode. You unlock weapons during the game and you can purchase and upgrade them. Some are stronger than others, such as the assault rifle that has immense killing power. On top of that, there are a lot of other things to unlock, like Dual Wield mode, additional movie clips, soundtrack, concept arts and 3D models of different things. And of course to unlock them you have to achieve certain conditions, and some of them require a lot of time and effort, such as collecting all golden brains in the director's cut mode. So if you are into rail shooting fun, there is a lot in stock for you.Overall the game is a good surprise but this really came down to Sega's clever move of using the B-Grade movie genre to distinguish itself from the highly stylised Umbrella Chronicles. However, one thing you need to be aware of is that the game has quite a bit of bugs, and they are the most annoying ones - freezing frames and game hanging. During the course of the play through, the game hung three times on me and when I checked the forum, it is confirmed that it is a problem plaguing the game for everyone. It is very annoying when your game hangs on you while you are just before the boss fight or during the boss fight. I thought a company like Sega would have done a lot more bug checks before they release the game to the market. That is where it took out some of the fun of the game.  Nonetheless, if that doesn't happen, it is a real fun game for you and your friends, as you can have up to 4 players to shoot some good old mutants up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2009"}

I was just a kid then, but I was still able to maintain some stability with the cities, even though most of my zoned buildings ended up abandoned quickly.I played SimCity3000 for a few hours shortly after, and now close to 10 years later I've tried SimCity4 in earnest.It is frustrating.  Since the last time I played a Sim City game, I had spent dozens of hours in ancient city-builder games like Caesar III, Pharaoh, Zeus Master of Olympus, and Emperor Rise of the Middle Kingdom.  In those games, I am used to zoning housing, and building everything that is needed.I'm not sure if it has always been this way with Sim City, but a sizeable portion of the gameplay involves doing nothing but zoning.  I made the early mistake of thinking my people deserved good things like good hospitals, schools, technology, and such, only to discover I was crashing in debt quickly, and the people didn't seem to care.So to keep a stable city going, all you really need to do is zone.  Zone residential for 80% of the map, zone commercial nearby, zone industrial far away, but not that far.  Wait.  Zone some more.  Wait.  Zone.  Wait.  Wait.  Build some necessities (police, fire, hospital, education, utilities).  Wait.A full 50% of the game is just zoning and waiting for the zoned areas to develop.  The other 50% is staring at the budget and engaging in a constant battle to balance the budget, to maintain more income than expenditures.  Just like in real life, people are ungrateful little pigs who whine and complain about the slightest of tax increases to prevent your utilities from collapsing due to debt, then whine and complain because the water budget has been cut and now the pipes aren't as strong.Maybe it's too realistic for me or I'm just not used to it, but I found myself becoming infuriated with my people.  Not because they complain about tax rates, but because they seem to not be doing anything to help me help them.  EVERY TIME I zone commercial areas and they build up, the businesses have Crime: Low, Pollution: Low,  Customers: Low.No matter what, no matter how large the population, no matter how many roads (not streets) connect them, ALL COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES HAVE LOW CUSTOMERS.  No one seems to be doing anything to help these businesses, and they stagnate, never generating more tax income over years.  After enough years, the businesses go out of business and the buildings are abandoned.  Similarly, if I cut the water budget and some houses lose water for more than a month, the buildings are abandoned.Another big problem involves neighboring cities; the only ones you can interact with are the ones directly beside you in either directions.  You can't have business deals with a city two blocks away, or across the river, which is utterly ridiculous.Landmarks seem to provide nothing at all; things like the Living Mall don't work as malls, and they produce zero income, and zero bonuses to tourism.The Rush Hour expansion adds some fun features, like being able to drive vehicles directly in your city, and suffer the horrifyingly bad road and highway network you've set up first-hand.  You can do missions that actually affect the city-building aspect (such as foiling enough crimes to have the city support a Deluxe Police Station, or help a group of scientists so they establish a disease research center).Despite the amount of problems I have with this game, I always end up coming back, wanting to try and explore more, only to be reduced back to the monotonous schedule of waiting, zoning, waiting, and waiting more.  The budget is so damn fickle that I hesitate just to build anything other than Zoning because it will add more maintenance costs that the tax rates never manage to cover.Also the biggest problem with Windows 7:  The game randomly closes.  Doesn't matter what you do, where you are, what you're playing, the game will abruptly stutter for half a second, then apparently crash, or close down.  No error message, no freezing, no white tint and \"SimCity4 has encountered an error\" with the loading screen to submit problem to Microsoft.  It just closes as if you'd hit Alt + F4.  The game doesn't autosave at all, so if you don't save frequently, you'll lose everything.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2012"}

Simple.","reviewText":"Movie tie-ins are usually a rather tiresome affair. They sell bundles of units and are more often than not a large pile of mediocrity. The Godfather game is different. Obviously it's been made on the back of the unparalleled success of Francis Ford Coppolla's gangster masterpiece. And it will sell for this reason as well. However, The Godfather game has it's own place in the epic narrative.It would have been easy for EA to put the player in the shoes of Michael Corleone - the main protagonist in the movies. Indeed, it may have been due to the failure in securing a license to use Al Pacino's voice and likeness that forced EA's hand in creating a fresh perspective on the famous storyline. What we're left with is a new take featuring your good self; a narrative that sees you seamlessly weave in and out of events loyal to the film. For example, when Luca Brasi is stabbed through the hand and garrotted - at the start of the first movie - you look in on the event through a window, you're spotted and the scene turns into a revenge mission. It's expertly executed as you feel a part of a story that is genuine and loyal to film.The violence has been superbly recreated also. The realistic nature of the firearms in The Godfather makes for interesting gameplay. As you might be used to the rather `cartoonish' gunplay of Saint's Row and GTA, The Godfather might at first seem unforgiving. And it is. But it's realistic - take one bullet from close range and you're sleeping with the fishes... it's as simple as that. Conversely your own guns carry the same clout, so shootouts often become intense and challenging affairs, if a little frustrating. Where as in GTA's gun fighting success is dependent on how quickly you can change targets and get your shots off, The Godfather sees you picking your shots and timing runs between cover. It's obvious that EA's development focussed heavily on the walking and shooting parts of the game, as this is where most of the appeal lies.Driving however is a different affair altogether. Given the nature of The Godfather EA were limited on what is and isn't possible for the driving sections. The physics of the cars mean they are frustrating to play with. Most of the vehicles are slow and the faster cars seem unnaturally quick. The handbrake turns that work so well in GTA are irritatingly difficult to pull off, especially when being chased by the coppers. Cars bounce off kerbs but smash right through lampposts practically unaffected. Other vehicles, however, are seemingly made of concrete.Also, getting from one way point to another can be at times be tedious - GTA gets round this by the superbly scripted radio stations, but The Godfather doesn't have such ingenuity - you're instead treated to a violin-based soundtrack that is depressing once the novelty has done a runner. The valid excuse is that most of this isn't EA's fault - this is more or less what it was like to drive a car in 'them days'. There was no radio; the cars were lame, classic, but moved like pair of concrete boots. Where the violence is so real, so must the rest of the game be if only for consistency.As you would expect much of what you do is directed by the storyline. However there have been provisions for those who are more impulsive. Outside of the missions there are businesses to extort and rackets to take over. Doing as such will build your weekly wage, which you can then in turn spend on clobber and sorting your hair out. You have a respect bar that increases with each completed mission, but coolly this isn't the only way to gain kudos amongst fellow gangsters. Buying a nice wise guy suit brings in the plaudits and boosts the respect meter as much as whacking a guy. Each time your character levels up you get a point to allocate to his attributes. It's a bit of a weak RPG element, but worth thinking about when acquiring garments.Extorting businesses is tricky, but worth the effort. You'll usually have to take out two or three 'bad guys' before being able to get to the owner. When you do the situation requires thought. Essentially you need to scare the businessman into paying, and you do so by finding his or her 'limit'. So while some owners will agree to 'protection' as soon as you ask, others will have to be battered to the brink of death. Pretty sick, but then the life of a gangster isn't for fairies. Be warned though, going over the top or killing the proprietor will render the business inactive for a while and you'll get nothing but a bruised set of knuckles. It's a fantastic sidetrack to the main game that has to be taken seriously if you want to hire muscle and buy more powerful weapons for later missions.And so you've got two sections of the same game that sit paradoxically to each other. The superbly well balanced combat game play that forces you to be thoughtful and timely. And the very dodgy vehicle part that frustrates and bores more than anything else. It's difficult to review a sandbox game without making a comparison to GTA, although it's slightly unfair to do so with The Godfather given the rules imposed by the subject matter. At it's very best it delivers a gritty realism, but by the same realistic token, it can be at times terribly dull.It is difficult to dislike The Godfather as EA have been so faithful to everything we loved about the films - but this is the undoing of the game also. It would have been forgivable to exaggerate the gameplay in places in order to make it more entertaining. But The Godfather is a game for the purists and in order to please it has to feel genuine, The Godfather certainly is.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000R0URCE","reviewerName":"Ron Sullivan","summary":"\"Terrific\" Effort  ... \"Pretty Good\" Result","reviewText":"I was first made aware of 'Force Unleashed' about two years ago at a trade show. Lucas Arts had sponsored a presentation where they chose to show off the Pixelux created \"Digital Molecular Matter (DMM)\" and naturalmotion's \"Euphoria\" engines that were under development. DMM meant that, in the game environment, wood would break like wood, glass would shatter, and metal would bend, and so on. The euphoria engine meant that, to a degree, enemy AI would all act independently. Trying to throw a storm trooper over a railing? He's going to try to grab anything in reach to prevent him from being thrown. It was all wildly impressive stuff, and when applied to a theme of \"unleashing the force\" everyone thought this was a game that had the potential to be a real mold-breaker.So did Lucas Arts come through in reinventing the wheel? Well ... yes and no. Both the DMM and EE are every bit as impressive as we were lead to believe they would be. In the demo alone, I had a blast just running around breaking stuff. I can't even describe how giddy I was watching a storm trooper flail around wildly as i either flung him into another group of enemies or off of a bridge. Using force-blast to plow my way across a bridge or cat-walk will just give you a tremendous sense of satisfaction. 'Force Unleashed' is a terrific effort and there's certainly enough working here to absolutely make this worth checking out.I don't want to do anything to spoil the story-line, but I thought it did a great job of bridging the gap between the prequel trilogy and the original films (episode III-IV). I'd have no hesitation saying that I'd take the story in 'Force Unleashed' over the animated theatrical 'Clone Wars' abomination that we were subjected to. Although I felt the in-game romance for the Apprentice is a bit shoe-horned, in my opinion, the plot is one of the game's highlights.The look of the game is impressive. Levels are beautifully rendered, all the character's movements are all fluid, and the sound is vintage Star Wars. All of it looks and sounds like it belongs without a hair out of place.I liked the way you could use the in-game point's system for 'Force Unleashed' to customize how you use the force. Do you want to max-out your health or lower the time it takes for your force power to recharge? Decisions like this will effect how you attack your foes and provide you with a more unique gaming experience.As much as I wanted this to be a mold-breaking masterpiece however, it just isn't. 'Unleashed' made a few missteps that really cripple the game. Although your newfound force powers are immensely fun to control, the targeting system is terribly frustrating. The fact that the environment is so destructible and interactive is almost a blessing and a curse. While it's wildly fun to go into a room or a space and tear it apart, there'll be so much debris lying around it becomes difficult to target the right piece to force grip or the correct enemy to attack. The game will try and target the closest thing the CHARACTER is looking at instead of what the PLAYER is using the camera to look at. In my opinion, I felt this led me to having to adjust the camera way more then I felt I should have. In the middle of a battle, this is something that can become irritating rather quickly.Although I thought that level design LOOKED beautiful, they travel awfully linear. Every level is strictly a journey from point A to point B. You're never really given the chance to find your own way around. I go back to just how awesome it would be to travel an open-world environment similar to Grand Theft Auto. This is a common gripe of mine, but I also hate back-tracking through an already explored world. I'd say about forty percent of the back-half of 'Force Unleashed' is going to be spent in places you already feel like you've been.As cool as using the force is, the longer you play the game the more of a slashing light-saber game this turns into. It's as if Lucas Arts was never able to correctly figure out how to give you all these awesome powers to control without making the game too easy. In the final third of the game, I felt like you were running into too many enemies that were able to block all of my force powers. There's also a disproportion in the strength of the enemies you'll run into. The worst example is that I can take on waves of Tie-Fighters and rip a Star Destroyer out of orbit, and yet I'm running for my life from a few Dark Troopers? It just doesn't make a tremendous amount of sense. There should have been a much better balance here then there is.Some of the boss fights can be extremely tedious, especially if you're playing on higher difficulties. One of the things that drove me the craziest is the amount of \"cheap-shots\" that are allowed to be taken at your expense. Whether it's allowing a boss to hit you while you're laying on the ground, defenseless; or the way you'll be fighting one-on-one with a rancor, only to be randomly blind-sided.  There are a few moments that'll have you ready to throw your controller against a wall.I know these issues I have sound like a lot and I really don't mean it to. 'Force Unleashed' is no worse then one of the top three Star Wars games available on a next-gen console. In my opinion, I have no regrets about having paid sixty-bucks for it. If the price goes down, it's absolutely worth a purchase. It's just a shame that the game's reach didn't seem to match the ambitions it appeared Lucas Arts had for it. As it stands now, the original 'Knights of the Old Republic' is still king of the hill.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2008"}

I have been playing most games on it such as the Guitar Hero and Rock Band series as well as the Mario titles however I get bored of most of the games pretty easily.  There have been many times over the last two years that I filled a cart with the 'starter' pieces of both systems, and deleted the cart instead of pushing the button.In the end, I chose the PS3 for the following reasons:1)  More of my friends that had both systems were buying games now for the PS3 when the titles were on both PS3/Xbox2)  For the $349 price Point I get both online game play and wireless networking included in the game vs. an additional $150 at purchase and $50 a year afterwords3)  Bluray Movie Playing.Having got four titles with the purchase as part of my order I am very happy with my purchase.  I got 'kid friendly' games such as Little big Planet and Ratchet and Clank as well as some of the more mature titles of Call of Duty: MW2 and Borderlands.My only complaint is there is no mention that the HDMI requires some kind of copy protection crap to work.  If your TV is High Definition this doesn't guarantee it will work.  I've got a 2001 57\" CRT Projection HDTV that does up to 1080i and has a DVI port.  I've been using my satellite DVR and other devices switched through an Outlaw 990 Pre-Amp for years with on issues.  The PS3 fired up and gave me a nice big black screen with no error messages or anything.  It took me an hour of troubleshooting and web surfing to figure out that my TV doesn't have this HDCP copy protection junk so it won't work with my PS3.  Being one to understand digital rights protection concerns at the same time this is stupid and it should at least give you a message out that port to the display what is going on.  no picture isn't enough.Other than this I had no issues getting the unit up & running on the PSN and playing some games locally and online using my wireless network.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Shawn Bird","summary":"My Grand Theft Auto V Review","reviewText":"The Grand Theft Auto series is one of the biggest in video games and Rockstar proves that a franchise doesn&#8217;t need to saturate the market by having a new game release every year. It has been five years sense Grand Theft Auto IV and although Rockstar has made other games in that time, the world of GTAV alone feels like they have been working on this game that whole time.As of GTA IV, Rockstar went for more of a series tone with the franchise and it didn&#8217;t fit well with all the anarchy that players could get into. Now with GTAV the story is serious again and this time told in a more exciting way which lends itself to having some lighthearted moments that mix with the serious moments smoothly without feeling out of place for the most part. The story works well and that is helped by some of the best characters in the series and once again great depth to the world around you, but GTAV still leaves room for improvement with the characters as well as how things work in the world.Instead of playing as one character running amuck across town, this time you take on the role of three different characters. You are introduced to all three characters over the first few hours of the game one at a time, getting a small piece of their lives while doing so and learning a little about them. There is Michael, who was a career criminal that has now slowed down, retired from the life with his wife and kids in Los Santos, which is game's version of Los Angeles. He has been spending his time bored out of his mind sitting around his house drinking; meanwhile his wife and kids hate him. Then there is Franklin, who is a low rent gangster. He and his best friend Lamar are the more typical style for this kind of gang as they are doing basic crimes trying to step up to bigger things.Franklin and Lamar at the time though are working for a crooked car dealer stealing cars for him, which is what leads to the meeting between him and Michael. From there the main story really starts going as Michael takes Franklin under his wing and they start working together and making a name for themselves, at least enough to catch the attention of Trevor, who is an old partner in crime of Michaels. Trevor is your typical loose canon, basically his whole life is lead by acting out like when you get bored in a GTA game and run around causing havoc. He swears, drinks and kills as he pleases with little remorse. His main gig is running a meth lab operation in the country/deserted area north of Los Santos. Trevor has spent the last ten years thinking Michael is dead until now, leading him into town to see for himself that Michael is still alive. This leads to a shaky and uneasy relationship between these three characters.Rockstar has done a great job of making it easy to switch between these three characters, unless you are in the middle of a mission. Some missions are for just that one character you have selected, while others are for two or maybe all three. Most of the time you can switch to any of the three you&#8217;d like and be introduced to whatever is going on in their life at that time. You can switch to Michael as he wakes up screaming from night terrors or walking out of a coffee shop throwing his cup on the ground. You can switch to Franklin playing with his dog Chop or trying to keep his friends from fighting or you can switch to Trevor puking into fountains or in his underwear chasing girls out of the strip club. It is nice giving the idea that all three of these guys are out living their lives even when you are not controlling them at all.The mission structure is pretty standard for a GTA game. There is a letter on the map that pops up and you drive to it, have a little cut scene and most likely end up driving someplace else to really get going. Some missions have multiple parts to them as well. Those types of missions usually end up mixing it up with one or two of the other main characters from the game. For example there is a chain of missions were Franklin is boosting unique cars and Trevor comes in to help and they take off with the cars on the back of a truck down the highway and as Trevor you have to try getting away from the police that catch on. However you can&#8217;t shake them so the game has you switch to Franklin to climb into a \\car on the back of the truck, drop it off the back and shoot the police are that are in pursuit. There are other missions where the characters find themselves in a shoot out and you can switch between them making it kind of tactical when it needs to be.This also plays into the game&#8217;s special abilities and stats for each character. All the characters have a list of stats for things like driving, shooting and energy. Again for example, Trevor is better at shooting then Franklin. However stats like the shooting don&#8217;t make any difference seeing that there is an auto-aim that makes picking off enemies (or the police) just as easy for everyone. The only statistic that seems to make any difference is the character specialty ones. Each has their own, such as Trevor goes into a rampage-esque mode and takes less damage, Franklin can use his while driving and slows down time to make better moves on the road and Michael has the ability to become more focused when in a firefight, having kind of a Max Payne feel to it, but not as dramatic. These all come in handy, however when it comes to the combat oriented ones if you use the cover system along with the previously mentioned auto-aim you will easily make it out of most encounters with enemies.There are times that missions deviate from the normal style such as when your crew takes on different heists. These missions take some extra planning and happen at pivotal points in the main story. These missions usually start out by getting information on the building or area you are going to have the heist happen and then choosing a &#8220;Plan A&#8221; or &#8220;Plan B&#8221; and depending on which you decide on you will make plans from there. You can play a sloppy way that is more dangerous or a more laid out plan that is less risky and makes for a more smooth in and out situation. From there you choose a crew (outside of the main three characters). You will higher a shooter, hack and a driver. Some of these missions you won&#8217;t need all three, maybe one or two. You will choose these people on their stats and those with higher stats will cost more money that is received from the heist. If you choose a shooter that is not as experienced he might die during the job and the money he was caring is gone and taken out of the total at the end. However, whoever you choose and make it through the mission the stats can go up, but the percentage of their take will stay the same. So it is possible to use inexperienced people and keep from paying them more as they get better.Some heists will need extra steps to complete before starting the heist. Maybe the job requires masks, clothing and weapons. You can have one of the main characters go buy it all or have one of each do a few steps making it feel like it was a team effort to get everything set up. You will sometimes also need to get yourself a getaway car and find a good place to stash it for once the job is done you can get away easily and quickly. Sometimes the job will call for specific vehicles like garbage trucks or maintenance vans and you will have to steal those as part of the set up. All this is a nice and welcome changed from the typical mission structure of the GTA series and they come a long just in time to keep things fresh and different. The only complain about this is there should have been a lot more of these types of missions.So you have your story missions and heists and of course there are side events. Outside of that there are random events that pop up when you are cruising around, these are usually simply things like someone stealing a purse from a woman or stealing a car. You can stop these from happening and do one of two things, keep the money you pick up or keep the vehicle that you get from the thief. After all you are playing as one of three criminals in their own right. There are also missions referred to as &#34;Strangers and Freaks&#34;. These missions have little structure to them, but just enough to be something different. They are pretty typical for an open world game and each character have different events that unfold from them. Trevor for instance runs into some border control nut jobs in the desert bent on locking up whoever they assume is an illegal alien. Michael lets some random woman talk him into a footrace and Franklin gets mixed up with a weirdo that wants to get marijuana legalized. It is missions like this that keeps GTAV down to earth and brings in some humor. It keeps the game from feeling too serious all the time. There are also other things to do like street racing what not to do in the world, like any game of this caliber. Of course there is the simplest thing to do like joy ride around and see how long you can last with five wanted stars.As mentioned and of course expected there is a ton of driving that happens in this game. Unfortunately Rockstar still doesn&#8217;t seem to grasp the concept of gravity when it comes to the driving. The GTA series sense turning into a third-person game in GTA3 has had an awful time with the driving. Even now in GTAV it feels like you&#8217;re driving on icy roads while there is hardly any gravity. It is something that you do get use to, but really shouldn&#8217;t have to after all this time. I hate to bring it up, but the Saint&#8217;s Row series has had a better handle on driving the entire time compared to the GTA series. Also the flying is still a problem and like driving only becomes bearable after getting use to it. Although, when it comes to flying there is also the landing which is even more of a chore. Landing a plan in GTAV reminded me of trying to land a fighter jet on the aircraft carrier in Top Gun of the NES.GTAV is by far the best game in the series. Rockstar is so great a creating a world to live in and great characters to play as and they have out done themselves here once again. Driving is the only real downer about this game and even though you shouldn&#8217;t have to get use to it, once you do it works pretty well. There is also an online component to the game, but that is not out until October 1st. With all that GTAV offers though it is alright for Rockstar to take their time and get the online done right. There is no need to rush it with some much in the world already. GTAV might not be as surprising as it seemed like it would be, playing as more then one character and having such a huge open world, but it still makes it the best. I can see already other games trying to bring in the multiple main character aspect that GTAV has and they already perfected it as far as I am concerned. I just wish that GTAV came out earlier to help get through the summer drought of no game releases, but it is here now and worth picking up right away. It will also keep those afloat for awhile that don&#8217;t plan picking up next-gen systems anytime soon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2013"}

At first I thought stealth action would be very boring and stupid (just a bunch of running through shadows) but it's loads more, It' s the excitement of grabbing an unsuspecting guard, or using a terrorist as a human shield, it's also standing in the shadows 10 inches away from a guard. These are all the experiences of the Stalth Action genre, and especially Metal Gear and Splinter Cell.This game has AMAZING graphics, depth and concepts. First of all, the way you can stand 3 inches from a guard and not be seen is a gut-wrenching fun. This game is an emotional rollercoaster, mixed with fear, adrenaline, anger (because it's so hard at times) and amazement (coolness of the game).This game is a definate must for any gamer.  It's especially worth every penny of the $20 price tag.Here's a breakdown:Fun- 15/10 From hiding under the nose of a guard to eliminating one...it's great.Graphics- 10/10 You can react with just about everything, from shooting out lights to turning off a light switch.Difficulty- 15/10 So hard at times, you'll slam down the controller and storm out of the room...to come back a few seconds later of course :).Gameplay- 15/10 Tons of moves to do...one for almost every occassion possible...there are so many, ther are some moves you'll never use. Very simplistic and natural tough.Overall- 55/40What can I say...just a great, great game. It's really worth every cent. You should seriously invest some money into this game.Oh, if you do buy this game, don't expect it to be rachet and clank: Going commando long...it's rather short.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00005O0I7","reviewerName":"\"arxane\"","summary":"An interesting controller plagued by serious flaws.","reviewText":"With today's console war heating up, the pros and cons of each system are brought into the spotlight. One of the most important parts of a console is the controller, because it can actually increase or dampen the enjoyment of playing a game. So how does Microsoft's console's controller stand? Unfortunately, while the overall design is adequate, it's plagued by some serious flaws that might force some gamers to buy peripherals to hook up their Xbox with a Dual Shock 2.First of all, the design of the Xbox controller is remarkably similar to the Dreamcast's controller in size and location of the analog sticks. The D-pad is good enough, and the trigger buttons are also well-made. Gamers might have to strain to reach the black and white buttons above the four face buttons, but that's easy to get used to.The biggest flaw that many gamers, including myself, cite against this controller is its size. Some gamers with large hands might find this controller comfortable, but a lot of gamers can't use the Xbox controller without constant readjustment of the hands. Players sometimes have to strain thier muscles just to reach a particular button or analog stick, which can get really annoying. And while the face buttons are in the right places, they are so bunched together that pressing a wrong button is a frequent problem for some gamers. If Microsoft hadn't used up a lot of room on the controller for the enormous Xbox logo (as if players will need a reminder of what system they're playing), the controller would've been a lot better.Another problem are the buttons themselves. While playing games with this controller, I found that pressing the buttons sometimes didn't register a command in the game, as if the game didn't know I had pressed a button. This might be attributed to the fact that the buttons are pressure-sensitive, but the biggest reason is probably because the buttons are in a horrible oval shape that bulge too far out. If games can't register a decent press given to the buttons, the controller needs some serious adjustment. Coupled with the first problem mentioned, and playing a game can be quite frustrating.Overall, the Xbox controller is fairly decent but it could've been so much more. There is a reason why Microsoft brought the Japanese Xbox controller to the US and is making that the standard Xbox controller: the number of people displeased with the American Xbox controller was too big to ignore. If Microsoft had paid more attention to the sensitivity of the buttons and less attention to the ugly logo that takes up a lot of space on the controller face, the Xbox controller would've been the ultimate controller. As it stands now, it's only for gamers who found the Dual Shock 2 too small to use.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

When you throw to a receiver they can be wide open and still not catch the ball... Which is not a big deal..... Especially if you have a good offense. The only other negative thing I found is that sometimes the ultimate team mode can lag quite a bit..... Which can be frustrating at times.

But when I stopped playing the demo and put in the ZOE disc, I found a great game.  The graphics are just plain gorgous.  You can blow up just about anything, but I don't recomend it because you get a lower score if you do.  The sound is also great but the voice acting isn't.  It's not terrible but it just sounds like the actors are just reading it and not putting any fealing into it.  It doesn't sound like the charactors are actually talking.  The gameplay is fairly simple. You fly around shooting at the other robots, make sure you don't hit any of the buildings, and don't get killed.  The control is very well placed on the Dual Shock and it makes it very easy to control, which is good since there will be a lot of multiple eneimes.  When you're fighting, there's a very helpful zelda like lock on which makes killing things a breeze. Ok, now for the bad stuff.  The story is probebly the worst part of the game.  It's very short and simple.  I was expecting it to be like a Metal Gear Solid story, where there's lots of plot twisting, and it always keeps you interested.  In ZOE, I didn't really care what was going to happen to Leo.  He's too much of a wimp to be a hero.  The girl seemed more confident than he did.  Voices, as I said before, were not that great.  But at least they made an effort.  Since the story is not so great, it kind of makes you not want to play it anymore, but it's still kind of good.  I love the multiplayer feature thou.

To start off, the game has excellent graphics, very similar to Splinter cell. In fact, you can call this game \"team splinter cell\" with the high tech gadgets replaced with great weaponry! The weapons in this game will cause you to drool...All of the best assualt rifles, sub-machine guns, sniper rifles, grenades & grenade launchers, and heavy machine guns make it into the arsenal for rainbow.I am also amazed by all the team commands you can give to your other 3 team members. Entering a room has never been better.... such as blowing the door down, using a flashbang entry, frag entry, or just opening the door guns blazing. It's really cool! The single player campaign is similar in style to splinter cell, but it's a lot more realistic & believable and of course more action packed.Now the only gripe I had with rainbow were the controls. Placing the target on an enemy is a little difficult, because the joystick seems slightly sensitive on the xbox controller. But other than that, the game is near perfect! And that's just the single player! I have yet to play it against a friend or on LIVE. If the single player is this good, then I am more than sure the multi-player & online play is excellent. Definitly worth getting!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2003"}

There are 46 files supposed to be confidential to unlock and 12 videos that will show what abstergo are doing to promote themselves or something liket that. Then you can check your progress in game progression by looking to your rank, comparing with people in the world and friends.I really liked the new online menu, before it was kind a disorder, now is much more easier to go around and customize, view game modes, choosing sessions etc... really liked that. Much more friendly.As previous games, you are able to change your templars assassin's clothes, weapons, Abilities etc... use them to confuse other people and take advantage in the art of assassin your target and/or stun your pursuer.You can upgrade sets to your abilities like disguise, bombs, knives, perks and get bonus for streaks in streaks. You'll see crafting abilities too, but I'm not able to use them yet, so I don't know really about what's about.You can edit characters so there are much more things like tattoo's, more weapons than previous games, more clothes etc... each character has plenty of customization to unlock and upgrades, I found that great!Another think I really liked is that you can edit your player profile with patron pictures to choose, more you play and more level you reach, more pictures you will unlock.Then you can edit your emblem, I liked that and there is a lot to choose from and a lot to unlock as well. Notice that you choose your emblem colors as well. I really liked that, the problem here is dicide wich one to pick.the social part of the game is great too. You are able to compare your highest score with friends and see where they beatted you in each online game mode. if you played NFS games, it's kind of an autolog. But there are rewards too. There is an amount of points to reach between all friends in each game mode. That's based between the max points you earned in a game session. per example in wanted it tells me to reach 8500 for reward. Nobody of my friends, me neither played at wanted. If someone plays and get 4000 points. that means that if I play and I reach the 4750 we get a reward as we beat the 8500 points. The same goes in manhunt, simple deathmatch, deathmatch, assassinate, artifact assault and domination(don't know what it is, will update when play at it).The gameplay is super fluid, if you liked to play online in AC Revelations, then you'll love this game concerning online! a lot of more customization, rewards etc... I loved the different scenarios.This is one of the best online games I ever played! love it!AC III single player:The game is great, did not had glishes at the moment, but grafism disapointed me.In high sea, the water is greatly done, loved it. But when arrived to Boston, I realize that grafism did not changed. It's still the same as AC II, Brotherhood and Revelations. nature effects are the ones mostly changed.Thanksfully, the other games had great grafism, so it's ok, but Ubisoft should have done better as PS3 can do better than that.And concerning all the rest, its great! battle movements, weapons, AI etc...

Thanks to the power of Nintendo DS, all of the lush vistas and perilous paths of Yoshi's Island span two screens.","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"nothing like the first yoshi's island, but a quality attempt","reviewText":"First let's mention the not so pleasant news- Yoshi's Island DS is unfortunately nowhere near as good as the original Super NES Yoshi's Island.  THAT game is now considered a legendary game in Nintendo's long and rich history of gaming spanning over 30 years (and rightfully so).  The good news?  What made the original Yoshi's Island so memorable is *almost* up to par in this DS version.While my biggest complaint with the just-released Yoshi's New Island was the generic straightforward level design that does nothing the original Yoshi's Island hasn't already done significantly better, Yoshi's Island DS may go a tad overboard with the exploration while frequently making you feel lost while surrounded with bland level design.  The level design is less than stellar truthfully despite how much fun it might be to stomp and flutter your way through the many enemy-populated levels that make up most of the game.  I'm afraid I do sometimes get bored with the floating high in the air levels while riding the princess in particular.  These type of levels seem to feel nonsensical much too often.Most of the levels are rather simplistic and designed in a way that encourages gamers to speed along as quickly as possible.  Just running forward to the finish line is probably going to be on most peoples agenda since the game encourages you to do so.  Oh sure you still have the option of collecting coins, flowers and stars to 100% complete levels if you want to soak in everything the game has to offer, but it's now significantly easier and lazier this time with a clear emphasis on speeding through the stages due to standard design and easy to tackle baddies.  Nintendo should have worked on the game harder to fix this obvious shortcoming.If you've read that Yoshi's Island DS has the same levels as the ones in the Super NES's Yoshi's Island, well I honestly don't know where people are getting their information or why they come up with such blatant lies but that's flat out *wrong!*  These levels are completely different from the ones in the Super NES's Yoshi's Island.  Oh sure they obviously *try* to imitate the ones in the original Yoshi's Island WAY too many times, sometimes even stretching out similar ideas much too often like skiing and boulder pushing to name two examples- skiing was fun in World 5 in Yoshi's Island but now they take the same concept and repeat it a couple more times.  Same way with pushing boulders.  BUT!  These not the same stages as the ones from the original Yoshi's Island.  Let that be perfectly known.Now Yoshi can awkwardly swing on vines!  He brought along some baby friends on his journey.  The princess can float on an umbrella while riding Yoshi to newer and higher locations.  Donkey Kong can ride Yoshi as well, and swing across a separate type of vines.  You can ride a giant bouncing kangaroo which just screams children's game.  Wario is featured here and he has a magnet to draw in the coins.  Baby Bowser can shoot fireballs while riding Yoshi which is somewhat fun truth be told.  These are very trivial additions ultimately that do nothing to enhance the original version in the slightest.  These are only featured to add a little bit of unnecessary diversity.  You'll still wish you were playing as baby Mario on Yoshi's back instead the entire time (which is what you'll be doing most of the time anyway so it's not really a big deal).  Honestly Nintendo should have just left it with baby Mario and never brought in all these other characters.  But having them there isn't *that* much of an issue.The music is deplorable.  While I was quick to defend the soundtrack to Yoshi's New Island and I certainly believe the soundtrack to that game is underrated compared to the strong backlash it's been getting so far, unfortunately I can't do the same with the barely distinguishable notes that make up Yoshi's Island DS.  Simplistic, lullaby-inspired songs throughout the game, or weak hallow imitations of the themes from the original Yoshi's Island.  Boss fights are significantly worse too.  They're tame, uninteresting and easy to complete.  The game lacks challenge overall.  You can just speedrun through the game basically.I think the game has way too many auto-scrolling stages.  However on a couple occasions, such as level 5-1, this very well could be one of the most creative and exciting scrolling stages in the history of Mario.  I LOVE this level.  Also expect a bunch of maze-like levels to pop up often.  Remember that bonus stage in World 4 with the big maze in the sewers?  Well Yoshi's Island DS has a few just like that particular level, but inside caves.  I really hate how straightforward, unthreatening and unchallenging the castle levels are in this game.  They're *exceptionally* mediocre.  That's probably my biggest complaint.  For some reason Nintendo didn't work on the castles thoroughly enough so they feel underwhelming the way they are now.  Again the boss fights really stink.  The gigantic shy guy on stilts is painfully easy.  It is however, not uncommon to take a cheap shot from bosses and messing up your perfect 100% score.The balloon-popping or coin-collecting mini games you played (and probably enjoyed) with the bandits on your Super NES version of Yoshi's Island have now been replaced with less interesting games such as destroying shy guys, fluttering Yoshi as far as possible or riding a rocket around planets to collect coins.  The vehicle transformations that made the original Yoshi's Island distinctive are used significantly less here.  MUCH less.  However emphasis on actual platforming has increased.Yoshi's super annoying and dreadful howling basset hound fluttering chalkboard-scratching noises have returned much to my displeasure, and Mario sounds exceptionally cranky and cries faster and louder than he did in the first Yoshi's Island game.  These are two minor but ultimately unlikeable aspects of the game.However!  We can't ignore that the amount of content here is pretty extraordinary for only 5 worlds. Yes that's right, 5 worlds instead of 6 like in the original Yoshi's Island.  But now each world has TWO bonus stages!  When you add it up, you're basically getting almost as many levels as the first Yoshi's Island.  And the levels in Yoshi's Island DS have this way of feeling much bigger than they really are too.  The bad news is that the bonus stages are basically played out like regular stages in both level design and challenge.  This is slightly disappointing.  The bonus stages in the original Yoshi's Island were unique and went the extra mile to give us something we haven't seen before.However at the end of the day, we have to remember something very very important.  For those people who've never played Yoshi's Island on their Super NES, they'd have no idea that game is actually better overall.  If you take Yoshi's Island DS for what it is -which is why I'm giving the game a 4-star rating- we can't ignore that this game is flat out *fun* to play despite the many tiny noticeable flaws.  If we ignore all comparisons to the original Yoshi's Island, this game stands on its own pretty well.  Besides, due to Yoshi's Island being in a unique category of platformers, I'm more than happy to give this game a free pass.  An imitation is still passable when it's executed properly and this one is for the most part.  Oh and let's not forget the new enemies you'll encounter such as big bouncing chain chomp heads (VERY scary!), fire-spewing shy guys and hopping brown toads.It's amazing that after 20 years since the original Yoshi's Island release Nintendo STILL can't make a game anywhere as good, but Yoshi's Island DS is a nice attempt at giving us more of the same even if the game feels watered down in comparison.  Yoshi's Story was probably the closest in quality even though it was several notches down in terms of pure entertainment in comparison to the original Yoshi's Island.  Yoshi's Island DS suffers from bland and uninspiring level design with only so-so graphics and awful music that leaves me with this final message- pick up this game anyway.  Avoid Yoshi's New Island however.  Straightforward level design completely ruined THAT game.  Pick up the Super NES version of Yoshi's Island and it will be the best decision you've made in a while.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2014"}

The places that charge more than 20 dollars for a Wii points card are ripping you off.Still I have come to own more than 15 old games on my Wii thanks to the numerous Wii cards I've bought. My favorite thing about downloading these games on the Wii is that the Wii version's  audio quality is better than the original cartridges for the different systems. The original NES was mono( the Wii versions of these NES games can be played in full stereo), the Sega Genesis's audio cables could not be played on a stereo(the Wii's Genesis's games can and even though the Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64 systems audio cables could be hooked up to a stereo receiver the Wii versions of the same games sound twice as good.) The picture quality on all these games are better on the Wii as well. The graphics on the N64 games you can download also look better than the originals.The purpose of the Wii points cards are downloading old games. A credit or debit card can be used as well but the Wii points card is the most cautious way to buy them. Downloading is easy and fun but, also addictive. I buy the Wii cards simply because I want to watch my money.The number of NES,Turbo Grafx 16, Sega Gensis, Sega Mater System, Super NES, Neo Geo and Nintendo 64 games has been rising steadily and to own these games on one system is very convenient.You don't have to lose space in your tv room or worry about connecting and reconnecting a bunch of old systems to be able to play most of these games but the downfall is that there are still some great games for these systems that are not available for downloading yet.Here is a list of my top 10 favorite games available for download:1.  The Legend Of Zelda Ocarina Of Time(N64)2. Super Mario Bros. 3(NES)3. The Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past(Super NES)4.Sonic The Hedgehog 2(Sega Genesis)5. Street Fighter 2 Turbo(Super NES)6. Toe Jam And Earl in Panic On Funkotron(Sega Genesis)7. F Zero X( Nintendo 64)8. Super Metroid( Super NES)9. Bonks Revenge(Turbo Grafx 16)10. Super Mario World( Super NES)In closing I will state the pros and cons of the Wii Shopping Channel.pros: 1.video and audio quality has been improved for the downloadable games compared to the cartridges2. downloading these games is fun and takes a short time3. You can play most of your favorite classics on one system(Wii)  4. The deals are usually better for downloading(as opposed to buying the old cartridges for the most part).cons: 1. There are some great games from these old systems that are not available for download yet.Examples are Super Mario All Stars(Super NES),Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island(Super NES) and Sonic & Knuckles lock on cartridge (for Sega Genesis) to name a few.2. The rumble feature of the N64 games is absent on the Wii(although if you use the Nintendo Wavebird you can play them wireless which makes up for there being no rumble a little bit)3.

R. Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","summary":"If You're In the Market for a Premium GH/RB Controller, This Is It","reviewText":"I'll start by assuming that you've already decided that you want the most realistic controller possible when playing Guitar Hero or Rock Band.  So taking price out of the equation, how does the Logitech Wireless Guitar Controller perform?  Very well, although not quite perfectly.CONSTRUCTION & APPEARANCEFrom the moment you unbox it, you feel that this is no plastic toy.  It is larger than any standard-issue GH controller by the length of the headstock (the far end where the tuning keys are).  Note that this means that it will not fit in the GH gig bag, so storage may be a concern for some.  Made of solid wood, it is also quite heavy - you'd better keep a hand on this beast when turning around or else bye-bye lamp.  While the quality materials and solid construction are the foundation of the controller's authenticity, note that they also potentially make it a poor fit for younger kids.In terms of appearance, the pictures don't do its color justice - its body is painted with an aggressively day-glo orange gloss paint.  Everyone's tastes will differ, but this struck me as something that only a die-hard Cleveland Browns fan could love.  For the price, I would have rather seen a more traditional black or else even a multi-tone sunburst that further ups the look and feel of an actual guitar.PERFORMANCEThe performance of any GH controller begins and ends with the strum bar, in my opinion.  The Logitech's strum bar is top-notch, allowing for precise control during up- and downstrumming at any speed.  On the other hand, the buttons are not quite as responsive as I would have liked them to be - very good, but players looking to gold-star song after song may be frustrated.  This may be partially due to the size and length of the neck as well - I found that I had to swing the neck upward to properly position my wrist to reach all of the buttons (again, another issue for kids and other players with small hands).  I also have to take issue with Logitech's claim that the fret buttons \"don't 'clickety-clack'\".  On the contrary, they're among the loudest ones that I've ever encountered, but this shouldn't be very important to most players.Logitech continued to improve on secondary button placement with this controller.  For example, the start button is concealed as the bridge.  More importantly, the Star Power button is concealed as the pickup next to the strum bar.  More convenient than prior controllers, but still not perfect (attention guitar controller designers:  the obvious placement is on the back of the headstock so that you can use the thumb of your button hand).  Luckily, the sensor that feels when you tilt the guitar is the most responsive and accurate one I've ever used - finally, you can reliably trigger it when you want it but also won't have so many accidental instances, either.Left-handers are already used to the tremolo (whammy bar) being in the way, so that's nothing new to deal with here.  However, Logitech placed the XBox dashboard button so that it rests under your forearm when you're playing left-handed.  On more than one occasion, I've accidentally paused the game by pushing down a little bit too much.  Again, not a deal-breaker, but something to consider when making an investment like this one.I used the Logitech with Rock Band 2, The Beatles: Rock Band, and Guitar Hero 5 and found the performance to be consistently very good with each game.  RB fans should note that the hammer-on bar is not usable with that game (as has always been the case with all GH-branded controllers).CONCLUSION/PROS & CONSLogitech has a great track record creating PC peripherals and all sorts of gaming controllers.  This wireless Guitar Hero controller is no exception.  A few minor design issues notwithstanding, it's a fantastic controller, marrying an authentic feel with very solid performance.  Assuming you can handle the price tag, this is the one to go get.Pros:* Solid, quality construction* Great performance thanks to a top-notch strum bar and Star Power sensorCons:* Large and heavy for kids and players with small hands* Fret buttons aren't best-in-class reliable (i.e. the GH III Les Paul)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2009"}

New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Red Baron \"Rdeschain\"","summary":"A Must Buy butt Buyer Beware","reviewText":"Hey Don't get me wrong I do not like people who nit pick over little details and whine like little babies that being said, this game has a lot of visual glitches,  everything seems to flash all the time.  Hopefully this will not be an issue for long and all the good people at capcom will fix this issue.  That being said i would much rather be playing the game now, then waiting a month or two for a perfect version of the game.  There are some other odd gameplay things that are in the game.  You can quit playing say half way through and have a bunch of cool things to play with from the start of the game.  This is good and bad.  Because if your lazy you can just collect a bunch of money and grenades in the first chapter.  but not really all that important,  the lack of the guy who bought and sold things in the first game is sad,  and the item system takes some getting used to for a fan of the re4 version there is no suitcase and you can only hold nine items.I do not know why game designers take something as amazing as re4 and change so much for re5 but then again they think they know what they are doing and they got it 80% perfect.  Overall a very cool game graphics are good when they are not flashing or glitching but once again better to have the game now then to wait another month and it will hopefully be fixed soon.I can not imagine that players on the xbox 360 are very happy if the ps3 version has issues the xbox version must be painful.If your a die hard fan of four you may be disappointed but the positives far out way the negatives so you may be happy in the end.Happy hunting","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2009"}
{"product_name":"B007W8S2MG","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"A must have for Vita users!","reviewText":"Some people have already said that the Playstation 2 is without a doubt one of the best consoles of all time. I can agree with that statement as there were some great games released for that console such as Kingdom Hearts, Ratchet and Clank and even the Persona series. But that was back then and now the Playstation 2 has been forgotten about but the games still remain. Persona was a series that has spanned from the original Playstation all the way up to the PS3 and even arcade games. It usually dealt with teenagers who were able to call upon their psyche (called personas) to battle strange enemies. Persona 4 was one of the pinnacles of these games and now Persona 4 Golden is now available for the PS Vita. But will this game have you longing from the nostalgic playstation 2 games or is this a game you should skip altogether?Persona 4 Golden is not just a rehash of the Playstation 2 game there are new features that available on this game and nowhere else. The biggest difference is that you can unlock two new social links named Adachi and Marie who is exclusive to this version of Persona 4. And both of these social links can unlock various dungeons as well as new content for the stories and different endings both good and bad. There are also new levels of difficulty in this game ranging from Safety (or very easy) to Risky (or very hard). Also there are new areas to explore including a beach and a ski resort even Okina City which was only seen in cutscenes is now available to explore.One of the neatest features about this version of Persona 4 is that it incorporates wi fi to the experience. If your party is critical and needs help you can broadcast a call for help over wi fi for people to come to your aid. It is a very innovative feature of gameplay and can get your characters out of a tight spot when they need it.And that just scratches the surface of all the new features that are jam packed into this version of Persona 4! There are new ways to get around via motorbikes, the ability to skip cutscenes if you have played the game in the past and new events such as a skiing trip and Halloween! If you have either wanted to play a persona game or have played them in the past and own a vita this is definitely the game to get!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"Lee","summary":"It depends on who are","reviewText":"There are two major reasons that I got the Xbone and neither of those reasons are for gaming. For gaming, I still use and will continue to primarily use Steam. Anyways I've broken down my thoughts about the X1 into sections.[Good]Kinect:1) Improved Tracking: A lot of the old Kinect limitations with distance and brightness are now mostly gone.2) Fitness: Not even the new Wii U can lay claim to this. Steam and PS4 can't do this well either, nor do they really even try. In fact nothing but Xbone can touch this area or further expand on it. Workouts like P90X and Insanity are now integrated with Kinect. Future Kinect features like being able to track your heartbeat just push it further ahead. This is one of the major reasons that I bought the X1.3) (Future) Children's Apps: Yes there aren't any now, but the Sesame Street series was huge on the 360 Kinect. There are also apps from both Double Fine and Half Brick that were really nice for keeping kid's attention. These apps serve as either educational or great distractions for children which is priceless. (It keeps your kids and even other people's kids from running around your house and breaking things.) I am pretty confident that we'll be seeing more soon. This is the second major reason that I got the Xbone. Again in this area, I don't see either Wii U, PS4, or Steam even trying. Many people will retain their sanity around kids with Kinect.New Controller: I've heard the complaints, but I don't understand why. No it doesn't feel like it cost $100 million dollars to develop (lol this has to be the biggest marketing joke ever). However it is better than the old 360 controllers which were already pretty good. It's also still better than the Wii U's, PS4's controller (even though PS4's has more features), and probably than the Steam Controller (which will probably be worse than all of them).Silent: Unlike the 360, which sounded like a vacuum cleaner (or a leaf blower when you paired it with extra fans); the Xbox One is silent. It is awesome.Forza: This is an awesome launch title that really shows off the console. I don't care about Gran Turismo anymore.[Bad]Xbox Live:1) Unnecessary Paywall: Outside of games, NOTHING WORKS without an Xbox Live Gold subscription. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Facebook, Crackle, and a ton of services that Microsoft doesn't host are still locked behind the Xbox Live paywall i.e. you have to pay the $60 per year Xbox Live tax to get access to them. X1 is crippled unless you pay Microsoft's $60 yearly extortion fee. I can understand paying for multiplayer and maybe even for the Fitness Hub, but there's no excuse to extort money for the other stuff. It's free on Apple TV, Roku, Google TV aka Android TV, and even on Wii U and PS4. This really needs to be fixed and is the most broken thing on Xbox One. It's the one biggest ripoff for consoles. Aside from the $100 price difference, this will be another huge reason people get the PS4 and I don't blame them.2) Previously purchased games do not migrate to X1: All the downloadable games, primarily the Live Arcade ones, that I bought for 360 are forever stuck on the 360, a dead box. Compare this to Steam, where a lot of the games I bought I can play on Mac, Linux, and so far on every new version of Windows. My paid Steam games will still work if I ever decide to buy a nice new fancy PC in the future.  It's the 21st century and it's now the norm to expect your software purchases to migrate to new hardware. It's not even just Steam, the 800 lb gorillas iOS and Android do it too. If I can help it, I will never purchase downloads from MS again, disc only. In Microsoft's defense PS4 and Wii U don't do this either. This is yet another reason for gamers to go Steam.3) No point in buying download versions of disc games: The price is about the same and there's no great feature to really differentiate it like Family Share. O yeah Family Share is already on Steam. It's in BETA but it's active right now.Kinect Issues:1) It adds $100 to the cost. If you heavily rely on Kinect like me, this isn't an issue. However I don't think most gamers will be relying on Kinect any time soon if ever if history is a good predictor of the future. This is the first major reason that people will buy a PS4.2) Speech recognition works but it's limited. As with the old Kinect, Kinect doesn't actually process the speech, it only acts as a fancy microphone. The actual speech recognition is still done by either the X1 itself or on MS's Azure Cloud, so Kinect doesn't even offload some of the processing for it (so the underpowered X1 does even more work not related to graphics). Technically if you stuck a microphone on the controller, you'd get the same capability, if not better.3) Use in Gaming: As I've already pointed out, speech recognition doesn't count since Kinect doesn't even process any of the speech. Historically I can't think of any major games that used the Kinect's motion recognition ability in a great way. Why? Because it costs too much for 3rd party developers to really customize for one console as opposed to just having the same game on all of them. Only MS and its subsidiary game developer houses will be able to do it. Sadly even MS itself can't really figure it out, since Kinect games were absent from its E3 presentation. At launch there's only the Wii Sports knockoff and Forza still uses a controller. I predict Kinect will only be used for Dancing games, Fitness apps, and Children's apps and games. Real games will probably not use Kinect's motion detection. Then again maybe I will be proven wrong three years from now though I doubt it.It doesn't feel Next-Gen in graphics and just in general: PS4 doesn't either. This is apparent with both X1's 720P upscaling limitation and PS4 stuttering at 1080P. My two year old $426 PC with $149 video card does way better in this department in both quality and performance. It also doesn't help that the same games have awesome user created mods for PC. I'd say the major tablets will all catch up in hardware horsepower within three years.Game Prices: So far nothing beats the prices and the frequency of sales for Steam or GOG on the PC. Getting a new or used game is just so expensive for the consoles and they're the same games as PC. This is the other reason that a lot of people like me will continue to use Steam as their primary gaming platform. Buying games on Steam and GOG (and even Green Man) is just way way cheaper, especially if you just wait one to two months after release.For all the emphasis MS marketing has put on TV, TV integration isn't great:1) X1 softens the image. Many people won't notice, but a lot of techies will.2) X1 automatically outputs stereo, making your fancy surround AV system near useless. The good news is that there will be software fix soon.3) Speech Recognition is not good: It only recognizes some channels. If you have more than one HBO then you may have issues getting to HBO2 and HBO3.Lack of Good Exclusive Launch Titles: Ryse sucks. Dead Rising is so so.Horsepower: PS4 currently has a slight edge and it's a $100 cheaper. It's really a minor complaint since both machines are pretty weak.No Harddrive Upgrade Option: With PS4 you can replace the stock hard drive with anything you want like an SSD. With X1 it's currently not possible to upgrade the hard drive. Even if it were, you'd probably be forced to buy MS's overpriced hard drives.[Misc]I am lucky: Unlike many PS4 and Xbone owners, my unit seems to be free of defects (at least for now). Then again we'll all know for sure since the defects will surface within two years if they exist.Do not buy this from Gamestop, especially if it's a ripoff bundle. I say it's only smart to buy at  Amazon and Costco.[Verdict]If you just want something for games, I would at least give Steam a look. Upgrading a desktop PC that you already own with a decent graphics card (about $150 - $200) is also way cheaper than either PS4 or X1. Xbox controllers also work on PC. I know that if I was a poor middle school, high school or college kid, Steam would be the best thing since you can get so many games on the cheap (a lot of them are also console games), it works with TVs now (a lot of video cards have HDMI out too), and games on PC look and play better than on X1 or PS4.  Steam also has major sales every quarter, so a problem I have is that I have too many games than I have time to play. Oh yeah unlike PS4 and Xbone, you don't have to pay for multiplayer and you can share games with up to 10 people in your friends list. Steam works on Mac, Windows, and now Linux.If you're stubborn and you don't like trying new things and really want to go with console gaming, and you don't care about fitness, dancing, or kid's games; I'd say go with PS4. It's a better deal for console gaming since it's $100 off, it has slightly better specs, and most importantly it's not crippled if you don't pay for a yearly PSN+ membership.If you're one of the few old people like me who has money to blow, you care about hi-tech fitness, and something to keep little kids occupied and from driving you insane, then the Xbox One is for you. Still $500 for this is a bit steep.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2013"}

Lavished with the traits of an honorable dungeon-crawler, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance produces a flat-out aura of fantasy carnage.  Riotous battle-lust practically oozes from the controller.  The screen dumbfounds even the dullest of the dull with its fanciful schemas.  There is a top-notch cast of voice-overs from the brilliant folks of Soul Revaer 2.  An uncomplicated control scheme runs like child's play.  Vivendi Universal's achievement may not cede ground-breaking innovation, but chucks in the best of the hack-and-slash breed.  Don't get too excited yet, though.  Dark Alliance is not to be mistaken for being wholly unblemished.  Underneath its armor are a few perceptible dents.  An obstructing, isometric camera view can really fuel some frustration when two players thwart in accord.  Avid readers of The Forgotten Realms may even grit their teeth because Dark Alliance's plot is nowhere linked to that of the books, but is an entirely new narrative.An account of strife and escalating war extricates in the progression of blood-spattering cinematics.  If you spend your leisure on Fantasy novels, then Dark Alliance is highly urged with its grand craftsmanship of storytelling.  SquareSoft can take a seat and learn from Final Fantasy X's somewhat forced and yappy dialogue.  Nothing is more pleasing then seeing characters from books come alive, and Dark Alliance has several characters from Baldur's Gate play some quick or trivial roles.  If you eye a D&amp;D zealot grinning about, you'll understand why.  The quest itself initiates once the player selects which boots he shall tread thick and thin through.  Will it be Adrianna the Eleven Sorceress, Vahn the human Ranger, or Kromlech the Dwarven Fighter?  Whichever the player sinks duty into, well preparations is key with an assortment of magical weapons to slay the hundreds of beasts swarming about.  Dark Alliance is mainly focused on slashing through caverns and other regions awaiting to challenge the forces of good.  When gaining a level, the player selects a handful of points onto different attributes of his character, like increasing strength, intelligence, etc.  The plot  proceeds as the players progresses from town to town and collects information. Dark Alliance, in one word, is mayhem, limbs are cut off and sprays of blood flutter everywhere.  Story advancement takes place in 3 Acts.  2 players can fight in unison, ripping holes through the lines of monster hordes.  But if you're the solitary type, the game done alone is an even better undergo since the field map on 2P mode gets squashed in and identifying your character becomes tedious.  As a glut of graphically overbearing spells, hobgoblins, and heroes blast onto the screen, the 2P mode slows down dramatically.  But what's so great about the fluid combat, is that the controller works like a true architecture.  Every button is used and used often.  With Real-Time action and with each blade spewing blood and  throaty screams, Dark Alliance is as action-packed as a summer blockbuster.Represented in real-time polygons, Dark Alliance's animation plays with robust attitude.  Vivendi Universal  conveys their brute of prowess, fabricating an immense world of unending brilliance.  Relying profoundly on flesh, clammy monsters, and relentless battlegrounds, the sheer scope outstrips that of Diablo II on the PC.  Environments are juiced up, bursting with activity, and containing some of the best environmental effects.  Streaming helpings of aesthetics will not have any gamer yawn with gripe.  The unyielding action is smooth and breathes red hot gore.At its brim moments, the 15-hour quest was a very pleasing experience.  Not once did I found myself falling into the mess of grogginess, only jamming buttons while shouting slurs at the merciless multitude of enemies.  Even if Dark Alliance lacked mind-bending puzzles, which would have been a big plus, the RPG will still entertain those infatuated with of the hack-and-slash genre.  Hour upon hour,  helpings of flying flesh planted a firm smirk on my face.  If your soul is full of blood-lust and desired butchery, by all means get this and satiate that hunger.*NOTE:  This Reviewer is very violent and loves GORE*","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2001"}

Weapons of mass destruction, deployed with complete impunity razed the land in the blink of an eye. The dire situation forced the two opposing factions to negotiate a cease-fire and an agreement was quickly reached, but although the war may have ended, its effects remained. With the deteriorating environment, Earth's population was drastically reduced and those who survived lived a confined existence trapped in underground cities. Eventually countries joined together to form the Greater United Nations and turned their eyes skyward, to space. With the establishment of the USTA, the Universal Science and Technology Administration, man began to seek new worlds beyond the stars.AD 2087...The first year of the spacedate (SD) calendar.

Now it is SD 0010, and the first official SRF mission and your adventure has begun.CharactersPlayers ofStar Ocean: The Last Hopewill meet and interact with a wealth of characters from different parts of the galaxy, each with their own history and weapons of choice. Just a few of the more prominent characters to familiarize yourself with include:Edge MaverickAlthough generally possessing good judgment, this young Earthling commander of the maiden deep space voyage of the SRF ship the Calnus, can be reckless. His signature weapon is the sword.Faize Sheifa BelethA young Eldarian committed to etiquette and logic, and capable of astounding feats of engineering, Faize is always honorable of those possessing abilities he lacks. His signature weapon is the rapier.Reimi SaionjiThe kind and levelheaded navigator of the Calnus, Reimi was born in an aristocratic Saionji family and has a shared history with Edge back on Earth. Her signature weapon is the bow.Lymle Lemuri PhiOrphaned on her home planet of Lemrick long ago, Lymle is mischievous, but friendly and inexplicably retains the appearance of a young girl. Her signature weapon is the wand.Gameplay and CombatAlthough Edge Maverick is the main character inStar Ocean: The Last Hope, players will of course experience gameplay action in the form of a number of different characters and utilize the signature attacks assigned to each. The game features a real-time combat system which allows for up to four party members to remain active in battle at a time. Improvements to the game's combat system include 'Rush Mode,' where players can switch out active members of their combat groups for reserve members in real-time; 'Sight In/Sight Out' which allows for timed evasive and counter moves against enemies; and the BEAT (Battle Enhancement Attribute Type) system, through which players can change a character's fighting style at will. Other actions players will master through gameplay include piloting of the spaceship Calnus, a first in theStar Oceanseries; item creation in the form of weapons, healing items and accessories; and Private Actions (PAs), a cause and effect relationship between character in-game actions and the acquisition of new abilities and scenarios. Through the increased flexibility mastery of all these skills provides, players should be able to more easily increase their team and individual team member's combat experience and status, and so unlock more advanced combat styles and linked combinations.Key Game Features:Series prequel-Star Ocean: The Last Hopeis a prequel in the classic series, combining sci-fi and fantasy elements, spanning multiple planets and the vastness of space itself to recount the origins of the Star Ocean universe.Exciting Battles- Exhilarating combat expands upon the franchise's famous real-time battle system, including the amazing graphics and visual effects only possible on Xbox 360.Compelling Scenes- The game features breathtaking CG movies by Visual Works, the cutting-edge studio whose previous work includes cutscenes for the acclaimed Final Fantasy RPG series.","reviewerName":"MogwaiFearSatan \"MogwaiFearSatan\"","summary":"Say It Aint So, SO","reviewText":"Simply put this game is a travesty.

Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well.

But that is a good thing, because the way the game is structured allows for near-total freedom as you play it. Yes, like some people have said, you must beat the dungeons in a certain order, but there are about a million other things you can do whenever you want, and that just expands the boundaries of this game even more. It is truly the greatest game I have ever played, that is no exaggeration. The graphics and the sound are wonderful, the puzzles are NOT as easy as some people are saying -- the Water Temple is maddening! -- and the character development and depth of play is unmatched.Majora's Mask is almost as good, but what makes Ocarina of Time better, in my opinion, is the fact that it is sort of the &quot;ultimate&quot; Zelda game, meaning it starts from the beginning and recreates the entire story of Link and Zelda and Ganon, and it is a completely stand-alone and definitive game. Majora's Mask, on the other hand, takes place right after the events of Ocarina of Time and has a very different structure. The three-day cycle you must live through makes for an extremely enjoyable game, but the only downside is you can't take your time and relish everything like you can in Ocarina of Time.Either way, though, Ocarina of Time is a beautiful game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2001"}

IGN rated the Wii version higher than the PS3 / 360 versions for one reason:  using the Wiimote to simulate punches, strangles, swings and kicks adds more to the game.  The first time I tossed someone into a furnace by swinging my arms towards the screen, I laughed while my girlfriend stared at me in disgust.This game is far ahead of Scarface, even ahead of GTA 3.  The missions are compelling, they're all based on the movie and Marlon Brando voices the Don, but somehow Godfather seems more non-linear than any other GTA type game.  The sense of freedom from being able to choose from dozens of missions at any one time, or skip all the missions and advance the game by taking over businesses and fighting rival gangs, rob a bank, pay the police to help, call in backup from your own gang... there's just so much to do, and it's all your choice.  Being able to advance the game while not following the story is key to the sense of freedom.The RPG aspects are also a good idea for this genre.All in all, a great game.  I've enjoyed it as much as Zelda.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2007"}

D. Anderson \"Flying Gamer\"","summary":"Good game that has quickly grown on me.","reviewText":"I've been waiting for this game since Jason West and Vince Zampella left Infinity Ward a few years ago.  For those who don't pay attention to movements within the industry, this pair built the Call of Duty franchise (which has waned in their departure).  They hopped the fence and signed on with EA, and everything they've named since seems like a jab at Activision and the Call of Duty franchise.  \"Titanfall.\"  \"Respawn.\"  Like most gamers I had high hopes for this game and my take on it so far has been a mixed bag.  I will break it down into my initial impressions, since it just came out today.The graphics are pretty good, but definitely don't scream \"next-gen.\"  It's clear this was cross-generation development, and I'm feeling more strongly that we aren't going to get a true 'AAA' title built solely for a next-gen console in 2014.  The graphics are fairly detailed, but on-screen clutter causes things to blend together, namely campers and the background they are hiding in front of.The campaign:  there is one, but it is integrated into online play.  Honestly, it could have been completely omitted and I wouldn't have noticed.  As it is, you have some guy yelling at you to do things that you would be doing anyway in an online shooter...  \"Capture this objective so I can see the computer.\"  Sure, guy.  Whatever you say.  I have no idea what is happening with the story and couldn't care less.Music:  In the background during the menus.  As I write this I can't remember anything about it, so I guess it does a good job of staying in the background.Gameplay:  Fast and fun.  On day one people are already doing some pretty advanced stuff with the controls.  The game allows you to wall run, double jump, and wall hop.  It seems inspired by \"Mirror's Edge\" or more directly by parkour.  You can also cloak, which means finding people and effectively fighting them is difficult and quickly turns into a scramble.  I could see people becoming ninjas in a game like this, becoming virtually unstoppable just by how they move.  Once you get into your \"Titan,\" you slow way down.  It's almost a detriment to use the darn thing.Bots:  Not sure why they are in a next-gen game.  They are distracting when you are trying to fight the actual players on the opposing team.  They get in the way, but I guess it's to make up for the 6-player teams, which is also baffling.  This game doesn't seem to be pushing the hardware and BF4 runs just fine with 64 players.EA being cheap:  I know, I know, EA hasn't put instruction booklets in their games for a couple of years now.  I'm old-school, though, and this game would have benefited from a manual.Overview:  The game reminds me a lot of \"Lost Planet\" for the 360 and PS3.  Not just the mech bit, though, I feel that the gameplay is going to cater to a very niche crowd and will have a tough time catching on with the mainstream.  Those who get good at this game will get extremely good, which will turn-off/frustrate newcomers.  Those who become really good at it will defend it as the greatest game ever, because Titanfall does give you the pieces necessary to develop skills that other players will struggle to match.  As it stands, at this early state, I would recommend it to core gamers that are willing to invest the time to get good at it.  If you are a casual gamer looking to just check it out, rent first.  You might be disappointed.*EDIT*  Today is day three of Titanfall and I will admit that it has grown on me quite a bit.  The pace of the game makes it a lot of fun and I have gotten decent with the controls fairly quickly.  The game does a great job of keeping you interested in it, there are a ton of challenges and unlocks to keep you playing.  I've also gotten used to fighting in the Titans and have figured out how to use them effectively.  I added a star to my original score primarily for the fun factor.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}

I was not disappointed with this as I was with COD:MW3. DICE recreates a wonderful online multiplayer experience that really does feel like you are on the battlefield. The best part: there is more to do than just sprint and knife kill people. Players have a wide variety of vehicles and other weapons in the maps they can use. Watching destructible objects animate around you and that dread of running into the open really makes you feel like you are playing a good shooter. having multiple options for getting the objective done is a huge game seller to me. \"You mean I have to actually think and use other game mechanics instead of just sprinting and getting cheap kills for another cheap care package?\" The answer is a definite yes. Also leveling up is not as fast as MW3. That is a good thing.The best part about buying this instead of MW3? Dedicated servers and other offers like clan support all offered for free thanks to DICE. In other words, the way online FPSes should be.Single player is short and kinda dumb, but it does have an amazing theatrical feel.

Are you hero enough?","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Filling a niche void that was so desperately needed.","reviewText":"Filling a niche void that was so desperately needed.The year is 1962, the world is not politically correct, yet it has a charming innocence about it.  The cold war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is escalating, and a strange power: Energy 'X' is randomly unleashed from space amongst unsuspecting do-gooders and thugs transforming them into superheroes and villains.  Here the Silver Age of comics comes to life in an interactive metropolis known as Patriot City.Here you begin your quest as the Minute Man (clad in early U.S. colonial gear) and a linear story begins to unfold in a mission by mission campaign.  In order for the story to progress, you must meet primary objectives given to at the beginning of the mission and sometimes they change throughout the mission.Along the way you will fight regular street thugs and more powerful villains and eventually some rather unique bosses.  You will also encounter new allies who will eventually join your team.  As the game progresses you can have a full roster of super heroes, however, only being able to control up to 4 per mission.Each hero and villain has his or her own powers.  The animations are unique, and as you 'level up' (depending on the success of the mission, and hidden bonuses acquired) you will be able to customize your hero further.  Maybe add strength, or flight, or a new superpower.  There are literally hundreds of combinations to choose from making your Freedom Force experience very unique and different each time you play.  The heroes that will be 'revealed' to you also happen in a slightly linear fashion and your recruit them into your stable by spending prestige points.  Each new recruit has a prestige value associated to him/her depending on the strengths.  The pre-built characters are all fun and choosing which ones to recruit and which powers of theirs to develop is s strategy in itself.  You must make a well rounded team.Prestige points are given based on how successful you were on a mission with your characters.  Defeating the villain and apprehending the vile thugs gain you more points.  Protecting the innocent from harm, completing secondary objective and uncovering hidden bonuses also increase your prestige.  However, if civilians get hurt, you cause too much damage to your environment, or too much time elapses, you will lose prestige.  What really makes this game fun is that the environment is truly interactive.  Go ahead pick up that car and hurl it down the street, blast that side of the building and have it come crashing down, use your projectile beams to ignite gas tanks, wield a street lamp like a baseball bat.  You get the picture.  But remember, the more you tear up the city in the name of justice, the less the populace favors you and the less prestige you earn.The game visuals and sound are very campy, but great and make this game that much better.  Imagine playing in the universe of  Adam West's TV Batman.  Complete with cheesy dialogue, sound effects, outrageous plot lines, retro costumes, and 'bam', 'koff', 'blammo' balloons!!Game mechanics are pretty basic.  Though the game takes place in real time, you can pause at any time and change your hero's orders.  All commands are menu driven, point and click, and very intuitive.  My only complaint here is that there is some 'camera' issues.  You can zoom in and out, however, the camera sometimes forgets there is a building in the way and you temporarily lose sight of the action.The back story and individual secret origins (cut scenes) are great.  Again, any one familiar with the comic works of Jack Kirby will recognize his influence everywhere.Though designed as a single player game, there is a multiplayer component over the internet.  While it was great to include this, it seems its more of a free-for-all slugfest, city be damned attitude, with no real sense of objective other that beating the other player to a pulp.  Don't get me wrong, it's fun to have a super hero war in a city, but you're a hero to bring villainy to justice after all.What is also missing is a single player random scenario generator or sandbox mode.  The missions are pretty linear and its kinda hard to stray to far from the primary and/or secondary objectives.There is a decent hero generator in which you can create your own heroes.  It's really fun to pick and choose your strength and weaknesses and powers (it can easily become overwhelming at times), but don't make your character so invulnerable you'll never be able to recruit him because his/her prestige is too high.  The only draw back here is that there is very little costumes to choose from.  Maybe an expansion pack down the line?  You can download new skins from the net, but it is a chore for the novice to import all the parts into the right folders, so hopefully a patch will address this down the line.I believe there are 25 missions, all progressively tougher and a few with a couple of twists, but again, what stops this game short of 5 stars is an open sandbox mode or scenario builder in which you can use any hero available.  Other than that, bring on the villains.....freedom and justice are at stake!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2002"}

It's pretty pointless -- throwing the items is not only boring when it's the only thing you have to do, but it's also very disorienting to look at the screen and see the kart moving when you're not controlling it.Double Dash has 16 characters, while 64 had only eight; but since the eight additional characters have the same abilities the original eight had (i.e., Peach and Daisy both have the same abilities and are basically just different-colored versions of the same character), it's really not much of an advantage.On the whole, you'll be getting a more entertaining game if you buy a used copy of &quot;Mario Kart 64.&quot;","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2003"}

The backlit key have very good response and feel, but as others have pointed out, they are very dim. I've also noticed that some keys aren't evenly lit, or only partially lit. You can change the color of the keys which is nice, but a dimmer to adjust the brightness would have been more useful. The keyboard has a good amount of media and macro keys.

It barely makes a difference whether they're used or not. The G110 is a good keyboard. It has some nice features and performs well.

This Game however, has been beautifully restored with updated Graphics! Old-School fans BEWARE! Although the classic FF1 has been Restored, the FF2 That Old-School fans know & love is not present, WHY? Well, that requires a back-story, the game that was know as FF2 is actually FF4! Back in 1985 Japan, SQUARE made the game Final Fantasy for the Famicom system or as it is know in the US, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Although SQUARE believed that this would be their failing company's last title before they went bankrupt due to the sucsess of larger corporations such as CAPCOM. But to SQUARES surprise Final fantasy was a huge hit in Japan! Years & many sequils later, Nintendo of America decided to bring this popular game to the states, but by that time (1990) Five Final fantasy titles already existed in Japan. So instead of bringing all five titles to the US at once they only brought FF1 to the states, needless to say it was a huge sucsess! Nintendo wanted a sequil,but by that time they were all set to launch the Super Ninteno (SNES) so instead of bringing the old NES version of FF2,they decided to bring the latest Final Fantasy game FF4 for the SNES to the US. But if they called it FF4 this would confuse all of the gamers waiting for a sequil, so they called FF4 Final fantasy 2. So I warn all lovers of FF2 that FF1&2 dawn of souls does not contain the version that they're used to playing!Good Points: Upgraded Graphics, Updated sound, New Baddies & Weapons, and All New Bonus Dungeons, and an all new FF title!Bad Points: Although Final Fantasy 2 is good, it is not as entertaining as Final Fantasy 4.Update: A remake of Final Fantasy 4, (Final Fantasy IV Advance) was released in US stores on 12/12/05 for the GBA & GBM!Written by,Shadowmage (the game maniac)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2005"}

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Awesome, just awesome","reviewText":"On-rails shooters usually tend to end up becoming mundane and boring after a while, but as of late, the Wii has seen a couple quality ones, such as Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles and House of the Dead: Overkill.  Now from EA, we get Dead Space: Extraction, a prequel to the spectacular action/horror/shooter from last year that graced the higher powered consoles.  For the Wii, the Dead Space world has been translated from a survival horror game to an on-rails shooter almost flawlessly, and the game is packed with enough action, scares, and shooting action that one can't help but enjoy what they find here.  If you've played the original Dead Space, you'll recognize quite a bit of what you find here: from the areas and environments to the weapons, Dead Space: Extraction is simple enough to get into even for those who may be unfamiliar with the original.  It should also be noted that for being a Wii game, it looks simply spectacular, and the necromorphs look just as nasty here as they have before.  The game's story is enthralling and as you progress through the game further and unlock some wonderfully utilized motion comics, you just get sucked in even more.  The only real flaw with Dead Space: Extraction is that aiming isn't always quite as easy or accurate as you might hope for.  Still though, as far as on-rails shooters go, Dead Space: Extraction is one of the best around right now that you'll play, and even if you're unfamiliar with the original game, this is definitely worth your time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2009"}

For one thing it allows you to see the story progress all the way through the cell saga in a very short amount of time.  It may not seem that way but if you have seen the show you'll know what I'm talking about.  It's a good show but it can be, I don't know, a little SLOWPACED at times.  But that's another subject altogether.There are many different modes in this game, the regular story mode, the tournament mode which is where most of the replay value lies and the Hercule mode which can be unlocked after winning the tournament on advanced mode, I think.  The best feature is the ability to collect capsules and customize your fighter.The actual fighting is pretty good although the characters seem to move a little slower than I would like.  Doing the special moves can be a problem as well.  I would usually have to resort to using one move over and over again because that's the only one I could pull off.  But that is a problem with a lot of fighting games.  The big thing for me was being able to collect all seven Dragonballs but the prize for doing this seems somewhat underwhelming.  In the show the only thing the wishes ever get used for is bringing people back from the dead so what does someone wish for when no one has died?  Super strength?  Invincibility?  Nope, the only thing you can wish for is a capsule that will let a character be able to use every special attack in battle.  That is weak and lame, especially since I just noted I can barely pull off half the combos.  Thanks for getting my hopes up for nothing.Other than that this game is worth the money, especially now that it's on sale.  Pick it up!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2004"}

Frye","summary":"A unique and engaging first-person shooter.","reviewText":"I don't think I expected much from Brink. After all, I got it for only $10 in the used bin at Gamestop. However, once I popped it in, I was immediatly hooked on it. The game features fantastic objective-based gameplay, near unlimited customization, and smooth and intuitive controls. I wish there were more people playing online, but I still think this is a great game that is more than worth the current asking price.The story is that a floating city called the Ark is the last remain of human society in a future Earth ravaged by global-warmings effects on the globe. The Ark is split between two factions: the Security, who wishes to keep everyone on the Ark for their safety, and the Resistance, who want to leave the Ark to search for other civilizations in the world.Brink is clearly trying to set itself apart from other games in its story. I can say that it succeeds in its overall setting and premise, but there is still something missing from the story. First of all, there is no official campaign. Sure, the game tells you it's a campaign mode, but all it is is a multiplayer game with AI bots filling up the rosters. I was pretty disappointed by this. Also, all you get storywise in the campaign is a twenty to thirty second cutscene at the beginning and the end of each level that describes the mission's overall goal. That's it. Sure, there are your teammates talking to each other, but you don't know anything about them. Who are they? What is their job in the squad? You'll never know. I know this game is supposed to be multiplayer focused, but I still think the developers could have done a better job storywise.That isn't to say that I hated the story, because there is still a pretty good story to follow in Brink. Although the character development is sorely lacking, the story of the Ark is one of the most unique FPS settings I've ever seen. I was interested in what happened to each of the factions throughout the decent 10-hour campaign.In terms of gameplay, this is where Brink undeniably succeeds. An objective based shooter, Brink tasks you with accomplishing objectives spread throughout the map in order to win. Objectives are incredibly varied throughout missions, and the game is also pretty challenging. It takes teamwork to accomplish many of Brink's challenging tasks.So far, Brink may seem like just another shooter, but this is where the SMART system comes in. SMART (Smooth Movement Across Random Terrain) is a system that allows you to hold down a shoulder button and automatically jump and slide over obstacles with ease. How fast you can run, climb, and slide is dictated by your body type. A Light body type is able to reach high places that no other body type can reach, while a Heavy body type is only able to climb short obstacles. The lighter the body type, the more limited the weapon selection, so choosing the body type right for you is key.As for gunplay, Brink is more than competent. The SMART movement system adds a whole other dimension in combat. Running off a high ledge, raining down fire upon your rivals as you fall, landing, and then finishing them off with a melee attack to the face is even more satisfying than it sounds. There is a wide variety of weapons to choose from, depending on your body type. Light body types have an arsenal made up of light SMG's, while heavy body types have those guns, as well as assault rifles and miniguns.As for the actual game structure, Brink is an incredibly intuitive objective-based shooter. Objectives include detonating a charge on a wall to clear your path, hacking a terminal, protecting command posts, and much more. One of Brink's greatest features is the way classes work. In order to succeed in Brink, you must dynamically switch between classes. Why do you need to do this? Each objective requires a different class. There are four classes: Soldier, Medic, Engineer, and Operative. A soldier can plant charges on walls, and can share ammo with teammates. A medic is able to revive teammates on the field, and give health to others. An Engineer is able to plant turrets, repair objectives, and increase the damage of a teammates gun. An operative has a nifty ability to disguise as the enemy, and sneak into the enemy base and hack a terminal. He can also extract intel from an injured enemy, which shows enemies on the mini-map for a short time.Now, as stated in the introduction, Brink doesn't have that many players online. You may see one of two in a game every once in a while, but most of your games will be bot matches. That sounds like a game breaker, right? Well, don't worry. The bot AI is fantastic, and are efficient in almost every respect. They will switch classes, tackle objectives, and help you with objectives. Sure, sometimes they make stupid decisions (\"Defend me while I hack this terminal.\" Dead five seconds later), they are still really good, and better that AI bots in other shooters. I often forgot that I wasn't in a multiplayer match until I saw the ending roster.There is also a challenge mode, and it is incredibly fun as well. It features four modes of play to challenge your skills. Whether your in a SMART time trial, or achieving objectives while under heavy fire, the modes here are fun and challenging. By completing these modes, you unlock the games massive arsenal of weapons. You also unlock some cool attachments in the game as well, so the challenge mode is a good way to test your skills.All of these cool elements (SMART, unique gunplay, dynamic class switching, and fantastic bot AI) result in a truly special shooter that is easily one of the most accessable shooters this generation has to offer. Those looking for something different than your average military shooter should pick this game up.Graphically, this game is really good. Environments look great, and the first-person animations in SMART are really good (not Mirrors Edge, but still pretty solid). There is some texture pop-in though, and while the animations in SMART look great in first-person, they look awkward when you see other people doing it. Still, the game runs smooth, features some slick environments and character models, and visually separates itself from other shooters.Audio is Brink's weak spot. While the soundtrack is beautifully orchestrated, and fits the theme of the game well, voice acting is a bit of a mixed bag. The cutscene voice acting is great, but the in-game voice acting can be mediocre to cringingly bad. Teammates really don't need to tell me EVERY SINGLE THING that's happening in the battle. \"I'm going for the supply command post!!\" \"They're taking a command post. STOP THEM, BROTHERS!!!!!!\" \"I'M A MEDIC!!!!!\" This can take you out of the experience. Furthermore, the sound effects are fairly weak. The weapons sound bland, and don't have the kick you would expect. Something that really gave me a laugh was the grenade explosion sound effect. It doesn't sound dangerous at all. You'd expect somethiung like this: BOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is what you get: boom. The end. What the heck?The lasting appeal of the game is fantastic, though, The level cap maxes out at level 20, and while that may sound slightly low, you level up slower than in other games. The game also places an emphasis on replaying the game as a different character. Considering the near endless customization, you could create ten or more characters, all of them completely different. The lack of people online may disappoint some, but the game definitely has plenty of lasting appeal even without people to play with.So overall, buy this game. Even if people think otherwise, I still think you should get it. The $10 asking price is more than acceptable considering the $60 value in this package. Endless customization, fantastic gameplay, and unique setting all add up to make a game that should be in every shooter fans collection.Overall Score: 8.5 out of 10Story: 8.0The game lacks an official career mode, and character development is lacking, but the premise is unique, and the story is still quite interesting to follow.Graphics: 8.5I thought that some of the animations were disappointing, but the game still looks fantastic, with great looking environments and a slick overall look.Audio: 7.0The weakest part. The music is beautiful, but the voice acting is fairly weak. Sound effects lack punch.Gameplay: 9.5The game is an intense, objective based shooter, with an interesting SMART system, cool dynamic switching between classes, and addictive hardcore gunplay. The AI is fantastic as well.Lasting Appeal: 9.0Even without a dedicated online community, the game is bursting with content that is sure to keep you occupied for at least a month.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2012"}

They don't have a black one that I can purchase to match my black controller, so I got the next best thing. I actually got this in the bundle pack with a year gold membership card and the corded headset, for way cheeper than it would be separately.  As far as looks, just because it's white it still looks good connected with the black controller. So for any of you who don't know how it would look, it looks a lot better than you think, trust me.  Now on the the functionality of it. The keypad plugs/snaps in with ease and the fit is perfect. There is not any looseness, weird or unusual protruding pieces. It as if it was all one part. When typing on the pad, it is very responsive and easy to use. There are buttons for every function that you need and will be very happy with the setup. What's also nice is that the buttons are backlit  for those of you/us who play in the dark or low light and need to send some messages. In case anyone was wondering, this device uses the power in your controller so it doesn't need to be charged separately or needs additional batteries. One  other thing, if you use a wired or corded headset, you still can. Just plug it in to the back of the keypad.  I highly recommend this product and it's reasonably priced.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2010"}

I am a gold member of Xbox Live previous to purchasing this package. My subscription was running out early 2010 and I needed to renew. I got an email from Microsoft (M$) regarding an automatic renewal using the credit card I have on file with them. I like to buy the points to purchase DLC (downloadable content to those who don't know all of these acronyms yet). I am not a fan of auto-renew, not because of the ease, but because M$ is not the best deal in town for their own service.Generally, you can find 12-Month subscription cards for less than the $49.99 M$ will charge you. In fact, Amazon and Walmart (am I allowed to say that?) had a price war recently where the 12-Month card went all the way down to $30! So, I figured if I was going to spend that kind of money, what else can I get?I found this package and figured it was time to add to my xbox toys. I had a headset already, as well as PGR 4 (Project Gotham Racing 4, but the 12-month card and the text pad were new to the collection. So, I purchased the bundle. Overall, if you don't have any of the stuff in the package, it's a great thing to have. I am going to break it down piece by piece for future buyers:-12-Month Subscription - Xbox Live is great. I can't say enough about it. The only negative is the yearly price. Others do not charge to use their system to play games online. M$ does. I feel it's worth it still, but I have hopes that one day it will be closer to that $30 mark direct from M$. This is why the package did not get a 5-star rating.-Headset - This is the same headset you get with every console. It's your basic headset but it does the job. It's certainly not a Turtle Beach headset, but it's good!-Text Pad - If you have friends on xbox live, this is well worth it if you pass messages back and forth. I prefer this over voice messages. The text pad is great and allows you to type and use symbols quickly. Also, it's light and does not interfere with using the controller unless you hold it in the middle somehow. It's backlit too for those who game in the dark. Big fan!-PGR 4 - I would read a separate review for it, but for the price you get it for here, it is well worth it. PGR is one of my favorite series. It includes high end sports car manufacturers as well as motorcycles this time around. It also has a more arcade race feeling versus a simulator, which makes it more fun for those who like to drift and button mash their way to the finish line.Overall, 4-stars, but closer to 4.5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2010"}

For use with Xbox-compatible controllers only.","reviewerName":"Christian Wheeler \"Husband/Father/Gamer/Proud...","summary":"Sooner or later, you'll need one","reviewText":"Since the Xbox unit has a built-in hard drive for saving games (and music, if you like), one may assume that one will never require a memory card (an essntial for the PS2 and Gamecube). But if one packs too much info onto the hard drive, then load times on most games increases (which I have discovered, to my regret), and games which use the hard drive to pre-load levels (such as Halo) take even longer. The solution? Use a memory card to save games, and thus save wear and tear on your hard drive. Sure, the drive is durable, but I'd rather use a $30 card than risk damage or wear on a critical Xbox component. The card does have a few drawbacks, though. For one, it will not transfer music files (it wouldn't hold many, anyway), and it will only allow the transfer of character profiles and not saved games (which I discovered when trying it with a friend's Halo saves). I've also found it to be useful when downloading the pitifully few codes/cheats available for the Xbox system (though try not to put saves and codes on the same card; corruption of the saved games is always a danger when doing this). But the benefits of this unit seem to outweigh its drawbacks, and so I recommend it. I do not, however, recommend any of the off-brand cards available for the Xbox. My experiences as both a consumer and a retailer have taught me that the Xbox brand card is by far the best.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2003"}

In desperation, the Soviets created a time-travel device that they've used to assassinate Albert Einstein before he is able to develop the weapon technology the Allies later use to defeat the Soviets. Upon returning, they notice a new world, and there is a world war taking place between three groups for control of the world.Play As Three Different Factions for Varied game playIn Red Alert 3, you have the choice to play as the Allies, the Soviets, or the Empire of the Rising Sun. Each faction has its own story-line and distinct units with advantages and disadvantages that you have to master in order to win. The new faction to the series is the Empire of the Rising Sun, derived from Imperial Japan, with an all-new cast of units and characters.The three factions have many differences, exemplified by their wildly different types of units. The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas. As they've done with the series, EA injects humor into the game when possible, keeping a smile on your face as you wage war.Fight on Land, in the Air, and on SeaRed Alert 3 has land units, air units, and naval units, all integral parts of the game. Unlike most strategy games that don't bother with naval warfare, Red Alert 3 makes controlling the seas an essential part of the game. Controlling resources in the seas and mounting attacks from all directions are strategies that must be employed to achieve victory.Cooperative Mode Lets You Team Up with Your FriendsRed Alert 3 has a fully co-operative campaign mode where you and a friend can play together to achieve victory. This means that you have to develop a strategy together, as well as execute it in synch in order to win. If your friends aren't online, you can also choose one of several AI commanders as your teammate.Play Against Your Friends in MultiplayerWith the different units and play mechanics of each faction, you and your friends will have a great time playing against each other, perfecting different strategies to best suit the units you have and the maps you play on. And thanks to the balanced game play, no one will have an unfair advantage.For previous fans of Command and Conquer, Red Alert 3 will provide the same light-hearted game play, but with more units, more strategies, and more fun.

In the case of Red Alert 3 (and all PC titles coming out of EA), we will use SecuROM - the same copy protection that the EALA RTS group has used on our last three titles. This time around, however, the copy protection will be configured to be more lenient than we've supported in the past.I know this can be somewhat of a polarizing topic, and I thought it would be best to open the lines of communication with some facts:- We will authenticate your game online when you install and launch it the first time.- We will never re-authenticate an installation online after the first launch. In other words, no reaching out to a central server post-install to see if you're \"allowed\" to play.- You will be able to install and play on up to five computers.- This system means you don't have to play with the disc in your computer. Personally, I think this is a huge improvement over our previous copy protection requirements, which have always required a disk to play.- Life happens. I know it's unlikely, but for those unlucky few who install the game and have their machines nuked (virus, OS reinstall, major hardware upgrade, etc.) five times, EA Customer Service will be on hand to supply any additional authorizations that are warranted. This will be done on a case-by-case basis by contacting customer support.-You can, of course, play offline without impediment or penalty.Red Alert 3 is shaping up to be a world-class RTS game that will give you many hours of enjoyment. I think it would be a shame if people decided to not play a great game simply because it came with DRM, but I understand that this is a very personal decision for many of you and I respect that. As you might imagine, I'm a lot less respectful of those people who take the position that they will illegally download a game simply because it has DRM.Either way, we' re very proud of the hard work our team has put into this game and we hope you will all enjoy it when it launches.Message was edited by: EASmudge (C&C;)\"I am totally against DRM in any way, but at least this time they made it tolerable. If they HAD to put one in I would rather them use TAGES (like in The Witcher) but after the Spore fiasco, it is nice to see they are trying to learn their lesson.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2008"}

You've just begun a journey into the most immersive, heated gameplay experience ever offered. This combo offers the utmost precision.

In first-person shooters, the controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote.

First let me get the bad points out of the way: there are no outer-space battles, you cannot play as a jedi, the A.I. is hard headed, and the maps are too small for flying vehicles. It should also be noted that this is NOT a mission-based game like, \"Halo\", so stop comparing every game to \"Halo\" please! Battlefront plays similar to a Pc game called \"Battlefield 1942\", you CAN compare it to that game. You can win the game by capturing all command posts (territories) or killing all enemy units on the map. You play as a grunt soldier in the frontlines of all the epic battles seen in Star Wars films (including Tattooine, Hoth, Endor, Naboo and much more!) Before you begin battle you pick from four different army factions: Clones, Republic, CIS, and Rebels. Then you pick the soldier type you want to be: rifleman (rapid fire blaster), pilot (can repair and dispense medkits to soldiers), missle launcher (bazooka), sniper (long distance zoom killer), and commando (special unit). Most soldier class carry primary and secondary weapons and a couple of grenades. Everytime you get killed you can respawn and choose a different soldier type. You can travel by foot or ride in vehicles if available. Almost all of the vehicles from the Star Wars universe are in this game! Even the monsterous AT-AT! You'll be fighting alongside an army of A.I. controlled soldiers. There's lasers, missiles, and grenades exploding everywhere! The battles are intense, chaotic and a lot of fun! It looks and feels just like the movies! If you like FPS or wargames, BF 1942 or the Star Wars universe get this game! Its a dream come true!Pros:+intense battles+lots of weapons and vehicles+lots of maps+excellent graphics and animation+excellent sound effects+excellent music+co-op or versus gameplay+xbox live multiplayer+good A.I.

I have HDTV, and the Nintendo component cables, but found the graphics more blurry (less in focus), than other games.  I suspect this is caused by the need to have a tremendous amount of detailed graphics, of many different colors, in a very compact area. I do have my Wii and TV set to the proper resolution.  Other games, such as MLB Pro, and Super Swing 2 have great graphics, considering the Wii does not come in high definition.

What I mean by that is that it entices you to do mission after mission nonstop until you realize how much time you've invested in a day! So you can get a whole bunch of missions at once and you're free to go about which one you want to do. The fact that you have to level up is very unique although I can't say it is much different from any other open world games like Far Cry. I hear a lot of comparision between this and Fallout but I've never played it so I can't say for sure. Another OCD factor about this game is the amount of items you can carry is limited. You can upgrade to bigger inventory but they give you soo many variation of guns, shields, grenades, etc. that you really have to figure out what you like best. The game have over 17,000 guns because there is a program to generate different variations so you really have to pick and choose. Overall I like it cause it's addicting but I don't know why. I can understand why some like it and some don't. The graphics are not the best and the developers seemed very lacking on creativity with enemies. The plot is also very dry. You're a vault hunter looking for a vault with little story telling in-between. However, they make this up by incorporating humor into the game. Overall, the gameplay and sidequest will keep you playing and this is a pretty interesting 'weird' game. I like it. If you like good graphics and deep plots, this game is NOT FOR YOU.

C. Hill \"Nchill\"","summary":"A geographical space or zone around a territorial border!","reviewText":"Wow, this game surprised me, its damn good!  Don't listen to the negative reviews, they are wrong!  Borderlands is all about pure cooperative chaos and it delivers in spades.  I played a ways through the single player, just taking it easy and learning the ropes.  It holds up well as a single player experience, but when you jump into the multiplayer mix, thats when Borderlands truly shines! The storyline is nothing to get excited about really, you are looking from some ancient vault with lots o items to plunder and you meet a host of goofy characters along the way but thats about it. However, Borderlands is not so much about the story as it is about questing with friends and collecting loot.This is a first person shooter at its core with some light RPG elements.  You attack enemies and complete quests to gain experience points to gradually rise in level.  Borderlands sports a skill talent tree similiar to the one used in world of warcraft.  At level five you get one of 4 different action skills depending on which character class you choose and each level after that gives you one talent point to customize your avatar's skills.  As i said, there are 4 different characters to choose from, a brutish tank, a balanced soldier, a long range attacker, and a stealthy chick.  Each one plays a little different, my personal favorite being the berzerker.  Using his skill gives you increased damage resistance as well as augmented melee power so you can really get in the thick of it and pound some skags (they are these mutated coyotes looking things).  Everytime you enter the berzerker mode your character starts grunting and screaming like a mental patient which cracks me up everytime i do it.There are weapon drops galore and each one is random, so no one will have the exact same guns you do, unless of course you have one of the many unique items that drop from boss characters or you receive from quest givers.  Im constantly surprised by the drops, at one point i picked up a regular looking shotgun and found out i could fire rockets from it, which was flippin sweet.  Borderlands has some basic vehicle support allowing you and a friend to mount up and drive or shoot depending on which chair you jump in.  Money and experience are shared among party members but ammo and weapon drops are fair game for whoever grabs them first which can really bring my piss to a boil when im out of ammo and everyone else snatches it up regardless of whether they need it or not, but when im feeling hostile towards another player i can challenge them to a duel and then enter berzerker mode to pound them into the ground while i grunt and spit my way to victory.The graphics are unique to say the least, they make you feel like you have entered a comic book and im pleased that they changed the textures from the more realistic looking appearance they started with years ago, it just seems to fit well with the comical Borderlands vibe.  Anyway, i've had a fantastic time with Borderlands, especially when playing online, its a must buy xbox title if you like cooperative online games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2009"}

Going from level to level hacking and slashing, figuring out puzzles, and trying to collect everthing you need to progress in the game is way cool. If I had any gripes, it'd have to be with the graphics. Although they were better than any previous Gauntlet released, I still don't think they harnessed the true power of the Playstation2. I think they coulda been alot better than they were. One thing is for sure, though, the graphics didn't look like N64 graphics. They were better than that but they coulda been better.

And its up to you and your Resistance group to stop the Nazi invasion.You'll travel the east coast of the United States to repel the attack. You'll start off in a decent replica of New York (and at one point will see the Chrysler Building ripped in half and laying in the street), Washington D.C. to save some fictional resistance general from execution and the constitution from being burned (which is an achievement), in the New York subway system, and a few other areas. The environments look, for the most part, pretty good.The action is pretty intense and you can do these grapple moves where you run up and either use the Nazi as a human shield for a little bit or you beat the bajesus out of them in different ways. However, Turning Point is a very buggy and glitchy game, so the icon to indicate you can grapple the people sometimes does not show up until you are on the verge of death. You can run up and press the B button numerous times until you actually do grab the person. You get a bunch of \"modified\" WW2 weapons such as the \"new\" MP50, Gewher 45 (theres a new \"Vampir\" version that has thermal vision for oyu to snipe with), the M1 Garand, the version of the Thompson with the drum on the bottom of the barrel, the \"combat shotgun\", a multi-barreled Panzershrek, and the potato masher hand grenades.Again, this game is really glitchy. For instance theres this stage you go into near the end of the game...its a bridge. You walk out and theres enemies on EVERY side of you..they can actually hit you through the wholes in the bridge but you can't shoot them. Sometimes you'll go to aim down your iron sights, only to find you can't shoot or get out of the aim mode for a couple of seconds to a minute. Sometimes your grenades won't explode or sometimes an enemy can hit you from a mile away with the shotgun..a lot of time the game will freeze up, the frame rates will drop, and finally the sound will cut out sometimes.The AI is pretty bad too. Sometimes you can run right into view and sit there for about 3-5 minutes before they take cover and start shooting. Its pretty embarrassing for CodeMasters to have released such a terrible AI system upon the world.The music is pretty good though. Its mainly an orchestrated score to help you feel heart wretched or pumped up. Additionally, some power sets like the Chrysler building being destroyed will push any New Yorker (like me) over the edge and want to finish the game.The ending was somewhat believable. You board this Nazi Zeppelin that has a nuke on it, and you must disarm it before it blows up (I think) New York. Anyway, you kill everyone on the aircraft and reach the nuke. You take one look and notice you have 10 seconds left, and you attempt to stop it. The whole time your commander is telling you good job and what not but your character does not know how to stop a nuclear device. So, he sits down, shakes his head, and the nuke blows up in the sky. Your a casualty of war, but you stopped the missle from actually being launched at a target.Overall, Turning Point: Fall of Liberty could have been so much better if CodeMasters would have taken more time to work the bugs out and make the gun power more balanced. On a scale of 1-10, I give it a \"rent it first\" 5.5.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2008"}

Le","summary":"Deadly Assassin Crippled by Abusive DRM","reviewText":"Assassin's Creed 2 is a very well made game on its own and a vast improvement over AC1.  It provides a semi-open gaming environment with a well balanced mixture of exploration, combat, free running (Parkour), and a sort of pseudo-but-enjoyable stealth gameplay.To begin with, like its predecessor, the game does have beautiful graphics and well designed levels that let Gamers experience the Italian Renaissance in some famous the city-states such as Florence, Tuscany, and Venice.  Indeed, the level designs, although some what idealized, seem very authentic when compared against some of the pictures of the actual locales.  On the other hand, character design is a mixed bag.  The men generally look good, but not the women (what's up with that ?)Furthermore, although I am not qualified to comment on the degree of authenticity of the architecture and the attires of the period -  they sure look authentic to me - I can truly say that weapon designs are authentic (except for the pistol and the hidden blades which I don't know enough to comment on).  Edged weapon collectors and enthusiasts like myself will instantly recognize some designs unique to this approximate time period such as the Cinquedea (a dagger with very wide fuller) or the Schiavona (the Italian version of the Scottish Basket Hilt Claymore).  As a side note for the collectors out there, almost all of the weapons featured in the game can be found on The Museum Replica Limited catalog (I think this is actual source material for the dev team).  Bravo to the dev team for the extraordinary level of dedication to authenticity in weapon design.As for the gameplay, the constant reminder of the stupid `animus machine' that does not really achieve anything besides breaking the immersion of the game in AC1 is mostly gone.  Although it is still there in AC2, you hardly interact with it anymore.  This is bar none the biggest improvement over AC1 IMO since the rude interruption of immersion is what really prevented me from finishing AC1.Talking about immersion, the game also does a very good job of that.  Along with richly detailed level designs mentioned earlier, each city-state has its own distinctive atmosphere, and the in-game background music - usually with a dab of Gregorian chants - is also a nice touch that adds to the overall experience.Combat wise, it is nice to be wielding authentic weapons in a series of nicely animated moves.  However, in spite of the numerous moves, the combat elements is not all that deep; you only need to remember about 3 crucial moves (`disarm' and `counter-kill' is the best).  Free running is fun but can be very challenging on the side quests.  The story is decent enough to keep you interested, but the mingling of fact and fiction is what make it really interesting to me.In addition to some console features (such as having to approach the spot on the ground with the `twirly light' to advance the story) that slightly detract from the immersion factor, and the `Da Vinci' code wannabe decoding sequences, Stealth elements are incomplete - if not weak.  Evidently, this assassins does not possess true stealth of cover and concealment (remember the classic \"Thief\" series ?); his only meant of avoidance of detection is really speed and agility.  However, even when the gameplay seems to be absurd, it still somehow manages to be fun.  For example, being the only guy wearing a hood and standing in the middle of four prostitutes who are flaunting their `wares' ... is NOT blending into the crowd; but as you can see, this could be fun... I ought to try it sometimes.Also, in AC2, you have a villa and a walled town to call your own that you can maintain and improve (almost like the D'Arnise Keep style from Baldur's Gate 2) that, when properly renovated, will provides more cash income than you know what to do with.  You can also put on your own nifty touch by collecting famous paintings (but not sculptures) to decorate and add values to your family property.  Again, a very nice touch.In short, AC2 is a very good game that teeters on the border of being an exceptionally great game.  And although I wish to go back to the Holy Land and the Middle East again in AC2, I must admit that cantering around the rolling hills of Tuscany on horseback never really get old.  Regrettably, the happiness must end for the PC version of the game -- Even this deadly assassin is crippled by abusive DRM.Even though it is never explicitly stated, the primary purpose of DRM - especially the excessive and overbearing type of DRM, such as limited online activation, or in this case, online activation AND permanent internet connection -  is to *TIE ONE USER TO ONE LICENSE* by eliminating the sales of the actual product (since the actual product is protected by the First Sale Doctrine), and forcing the sale of a license only -- Everything else is secondary - piracy is just a convenient pretext to achieve this purpose.Evidently, Ubisoft is willing to go to any length to achieve this purpose - including deliberately insulting its Customers and their intelligence - with this type of extreme DRM.  It is rare when industry insiders and DRM/corporate sympathizers are openly speaking out against their own, but Ubisoft has really crossed the line this time. As is, my message to Ubisoft will be curt:  Revert to a more reasonable DRM that Customers can compromise with  - such as a disc check, or GET OUT of the PC Gaming sector for good.  You will NOT be missed.A message to my fellow Customers: However you choose to speak out against Ubisoft and this type of extreme DRM, please refrain from pirating this game.  It may seems like a good way to piss down Ubisoft's throat for now, but in the long run, it is not worth compromising our integrity as legitimate Customers for; no game - no matter how good - is worth this.If you must play this game - a good game from an excellent dev team misrepresented by the Ubisoft suits  - consider renting the console version, or buying the game *used* for the consoles so that the greedy publisher will see as little of your money as possible.  I was waiting for the PC version  - since AC1 PC version is superior - but I am somewhat glad that I bought  a used copy for the Xbox360  when the price drop to $26.  Had I known about the travesty of PC version, I would have waited even longer to buy a used copy for even cheaper.Final scores:  Four stars for the game.  Zero star for the product.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2010"}

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime.

And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"marc \"iLL .\"","summary":"a year later..","reviewText":"One year after its release, this game is STILL Phenomenal.

{"product_name":"B0047TLIBU","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"One location excitment!","reviewText":"Coming into this I had high expectations based on my enjoyment of the first game.  I was a little turned off by the styling differences that I had seen and some over the top game play that had been shown in videos but gave the game a shot based on my experience with the first game DA1 and the explanation from the developers that the scenes we had seen were based on another character telling a story with some embellishment.The style differences in my opinion are a step back from DA1.  This has a much more cartoon feel where the first game had a grittier feel.  The differences become a lot less noticeable as play time passes.  While I might have preferred them to have stuck more with the original style, the graphics were very detailed and well done.  As you explore the areas and look at the characters, each is incredibly detailed.The world revolves around one area for the entire game.  A single city and the surrounding areas.  Does that sound exciting?  In short no.  It was boring as heck.  Not only do they reuse the exact same places through each act but many of the dungeons and places to explore are EXACTLY the same.  They might tweak some textures, props, and bad guys but they are identical in layout.  The huge variety of places to visit was not expanded on from DA 1 but held down to just a small tiny level.Some places they made for a day and night version to give you some variety but again it is more of the exact same place. So if you explored the day, then make sure you explore the night because even though it is identical... it is totally different with enemies, treasure, and plot points.  When the acts change, you need to go out and explore each area all over again for treasure, bad guys, etc.  The obnoxiousness of this really comes out as the acts change and for fun you get to re-explore all the same places all over again with NOTHING changed!The story was fairly good but a major departure from the first.  So if you are looking to expand on the events of the first game... especially the Morgan angle then think again!  Not much to do with Grey Wardens, Dark Spawn, or the blight.  No, it is a new and original story set in the same world shortly after the first game.  I give them props for trying to expand the world to show other struggles and people but felt the story just deviated too far from the first.The first game talked about sooo many faraway lands and with the mystery of Morgan at the end they could have easily gone to one of these lands like Orlaris, Antivia, etc or done something with Morgan.  The first game was an epic, while this one is more of a foot note of something happening in a faraway land that is kind of important but not really to the rest of the world.Characters... BORING!  Each and every one except for Varric was about as interesting as watching paint dry.  The dialog options were minimal at best which further compounded this problem.  For example you can only talk to a companion when prompted by a big yellow arrow over their head.  DA1 had amazing characters for the most part with solid dialog options for them that really brought out the personality in each one... even if you did not use them a lot, you still knew each of your companions.  They did do a better job encouraging you to switch players out and try them in your squad since everyone gets experience at about the same level being in the party or not but you are still limited to 3 extra companion slots.  Again like the first game that leaves you very little room try others out as you have certain positions I consider `mission critical' which never change like a Rouge and Mage.One thing that bothered me at first with the Characters was that you could not tweak their equipment.  Just the weapons for most characters could be changed along with jewelry.  In the first game it was kind of a pain to keep them all up-to-date on equipment but really I just focused on the primary people I used.  Even with the simplified system, I still found myself only updating the players I actually use.Another issue with companions is they are spread all over the city!  So if you want to see if a dialog option is even available you got to run all over the place and sit through a dozen loading screens just to reach them.  Oh how I miss my `camp' where I could just walk around and see everyone.Equipment options were good and I felt I had a lot of solid choices to fit my style of play.  Enchantment returns but I held off until the end to use it since those gems are rare and can NEVER be removed from equipment once placed.  Many other items I was reluctant to use since resources are so scares since enemies typically do not re-spawn.  So if you are short on supplies, cash, or experience then you have no place to go grind or explore.  This led me to being a bit of a scrooge with my equipment and supplies as best I could... I was even hesitant to use health potions and sure as heck never bought anything unless I had to or it gave me some sort of permanent gain.  This problem was nothing new, as the first game had the exact same thing... if anything this was a slight improvement over the first game.  At least you get a storage chest at your main base!!!The combat system has changed a little to be more of a button masher.  Not really good or bad, it just is.  The combat skill trees however were well thought out and for the most part useful.  I thought the content of these trees were a solid improvement over the first game where you had several USEFUL directions you could go and really customize your fighting style.  Still there is room for improvement further where some trees could use more/better abilities but this was a nice step in the right direction and one of the saving graces of the game that kept me playing.While the combat is overall an improvement with the skill tree, enemies you fight are not.  There is a much smaller variety of bad guys to fight where MOST are either humans or shades.  I was surprised at the number of shades you fight especially.  Even the animations were lacking when you would finish off somebody, either it was an over the top bloody mess or just a death... no more use of the cool animations from the first game when you take down a troll or something big.  Again, here the game suffers even more from the lack of variety.  It was still fun to fight but when you play the same location a dozen times fighting the exact same bad guy in the same place... it gets old.  It was also frustrating that you could move into an area and be cautious to just have bad guys spawn out of thin air in the middle of your group for an ambush.  You basically have no control over where you will fight or any reason to be cautious no matter how smart you try to play.Overall the game is not bad but certainly not the awesome epic many of the professional reviewers gave it and is certainly not even close to as good as the first game even though there were several notably good improvements.  I had trouble even staying motivated to just finish the game, especially by act 3 and the reuse of all the locations.  If you are a fan of RPG's and even the first game then give this one a shot but be prepared that it is a bit different and may bore you to death with the lack of variety, locations, and lack of interesting companions while retaining many of the bad aspects of DA1 while not retaining many of the things that made it great.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2011"}

Similar to FFXII's Gambit System, there is a convenient suggestion system which will ask for your advise to heal, revive or perform special attacks for the other characters or do healing/reviving automatically, though this system is not as detail as FFXII, it serves the basic needs.The music score really suits the environment, though it is very different from Star Wars that uses serious classical orchestra.  The music are usually pretty epic, relaxing, joyful, sometimes with some classical flavours.  If you want to know more about the soundtrack, you can expect the music similar to Chrono Cross, Xenogears, and Xenosaga 1.  Why?  Because we got Yasunori Mitsuda for making the theme song!  We also get verious composers including Yoko Shimomura who made Kingdom Hearts 2.  Moto Sakurab from Star Ocean, Valkyrie Profile, and Tales of Series.Wait, I think I'm mentioning about the Rogue Galaxy Premium Tracks! Haha!The original soundtrack is mostly composed by Tomohito Nishiura who did Dark Cloud. Yayoi Ono for vocals, and Barbara Kessler for the ending theme song.For gameplay, you will see something similar to Final Fantasy 10 and 12 system to upgrade your character's special abilities.  There is something like a checkerboard and you have to use items to unlock new abilities called Revelation.  Also, unlike FF12, when you pick up new armors, they will be shown on the screen.When upgrading weapons, there is this very cute looking frog that can fuse two weapons with maximum level together.There are some mini games like Insectron which you have to set traps to capture insects and raise them like Digimon for battle!The item creation is pretty interesting too.  After certain point in the story, you will have a factory to invent and produce new products varies from items, materials and weapons.  You can then purchase these items from shops around the galaxy.Also later in the story, you can purchase hunting locations to defeat the beasts to gain certain rare item and hunter points.There are some dissapointment, your character cannot use another character's weapon.  For example Jester can only use a sword and gun, but you cannot use Lilika's Bow and dagger.  There is one level where you need to fight in two huge towers, that dungeon is very annoying and you might need to spend more than 6 hours in the dungeon with almost identical environment for each floor.I haven't played through the whole game yet, but it has already given me the impression of Star Wars environment.  If you like Star Wars, Digimon, Pockemon, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest or Japanese RPG, I'm sure you will definitely love this game.  Moreover, there aren't good PS3 games yet, so I play the Rogue Galaxy on my PS3 as a substitute.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2007"}

Hentze","summary":"Mediocre training games","reviewText":"As pointed out in most reviews, the Wii Play Games aren't very good. They're basically games to teach you how to use the remote. I don't find them as awful as some people, but they probably should have been included with the Wii console. They're basic but playable. I didn't buy the Wii Play for the games though. I bought it for the 2nd controller. At its current $45 price, it only costs $5 more than buying the controller alone. In my opinion, it's worth spending an extra $5 to get the 9 games. These games are also available without the remote for around $37. It would be insanity to purchase them without it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2010"}

Awesome!","reviewText":"It's been awhile since i've been so completely happy with a 1st person shooter game... and thanks to COD4 i can be happy again!Campaign Mode: I'm a descent gamer, maybe a little above average, but i found that COD4 is no joke. Run and gun does not work so well. Precise aiming and patience is a must. I really dont recall how long it took me to beat the game, but... it wasn't that long at all. The story was great though, sniper stage was great, and so was being an aerial gunner in the aerial gunner stage.Online Play: Is great. For the most part i didn't have any big issues. lots of challenges to complete. The maps are nicely laid out and the modes are fun as well.Graphics: AWESOME, AWESOME.... AND... AWESOME!Replay value: Great.I've always liked Halo.. and Halo 3 is a good game... but it doesn't seem to exist anymore in my living room...Call of Duty 4 is the only First Person Shooter in my mind right now =)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2007"}

Being able to upgrade your powers and jump around the city are very satisfying.  The story is generic but you aren't playing this game for the \"story\".  The missions are pretty repetitive so I took one star off, otherwise I would've given it the full 5.  Part of me thinks this would've been one hell of a Spawn game, and would've resurrected that franchise, and would've made story much meatier.
