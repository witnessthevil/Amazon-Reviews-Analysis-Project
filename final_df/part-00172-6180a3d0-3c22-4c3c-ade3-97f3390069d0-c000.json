{"product_name":"B006WQR3GA","description":"","reviewerName":"R. J. Gutt \"Tigercat\"","summary":"XCOM:EU X360 Full Review with Tips","reviewText":"XCOM:EU is a great game. I played the original and many other strategy games in the past. This is a full, long review. It may have minor spoilers. I will cover as much as possible. I give Objective reviews whenever I can, not Subjective. I will state my personal opinions when I can. This review may be more subjective for me as I really like this game. Bear in mind XCOM:EU has immense replayability as long as you like turn-based tactical battles. The strategy base part of the game is awesome as well.GraphicsUnreal engine, but they spent a lot of time on the graphics and they look terrific! Only a few minor glitches here or there. The Deco DLC is awesome, not yet available as of this writing (it was a preorder bonus).SoundThe sound is good, with voices for the soldiers. The music is not as eerie as in the original game, but it is still very good. When aliens are being fought the music picks up for the action. Very nice sound.Early thoughtsThe game is pretty solid, I've only had a few freeze ups. The base is very cool, and tactical is as good as ever. Bear in mind, the official Strategy Guide is NOT going to give tactical training! You need to become a good player by playing and figuring out the strategies, that is why it is called a STRATEGY Game. I will give a few tips where I can. I beat this game in two days, took roughly 24 hours, and I missed a lot of sleep.Difficulty - Easy/Normal or Classic/Impossible?If you are new to this type of game, and especially to XCOM in general, I suggest at least Easy mode. On Easy mode there will be less threat to deal with and more special missions to help you. Also, the alien timetable will be a little longer, so you will have an extra monther or so before fighting the toughest monsters. Aliens are not easier to fight though, they have the same health and stats as Normal mode.On Normal mode it took me 8 game months to win. I lost one country early on, Germany, mainly because South Africa asked for a Satellite they really did not need. Normal mode is just that, nothing differrent. This level of difficulty is the most fun in my opinion.Classic and Imposiible difficulties really crank up the action. More enemies in missions and all the aliens get upgraded. Most get +10 Aim (they hit you easier), +10 Defense (-10 for you to hit them), and extra health. Even Thin Men will have 4 health, not 3. This means Grenades are no longer 100% to get kills. Less starting funds, Start with only one base facility (Satellite Uplink), More enemies, countries give fewer scientists/engineers.Accessory slotYou get one accessory slot. The Support soldier can eventually have two. What should you bring to the battle? Early on you have no choice - Grenades. Useful especially if you are new to XCOM style tactical battle. To be honest, this is the ONLY time I use grenades.Scope or Grenade or Nano-fiber/Chitin Armor?Scope. Scope. Scope! Once you get the Scope, you should seriously think about all soldiers having one. Nano-fiber armor gives +2 armor, VERY useful early in the campaign when you only have Body armor (+1 armor), as Nano-Fiber's +2 gives a total of +3 armor and -may- keep a soldier out of the infirmary when hit by Sectoid/Thin Man pistol fire, although critical hits may still happen. Chitin armor is rare to acquire, and I use it on Assault soldiers. With the best standard armor and Chitin armor my Assault can have 9 life + 14 armor, which when combined with the Assault's Extra Conditioning skill will give a total of 27 health in combat.Scope or Mind Shield?Mind Shields are hard to get and thus rare, but take them in the Final Mission for your low-Will soldiers as much as possible.Early MovesEarly in the game you need to concentrate on gettng as many satellites up as possible. This will hopefully lower Alert levels in the country the satellite is deployed and will increase your monthly income. Countries covered will also give scientists and/or engineers per month. When deploying satellites, alert levels are Top Priority, not the continent or credit bonus of the country. Save your satellites until near the end of the month to help respond to Alien alert activity. This is very important as it will allow you to have the most flexibility to repond to Alert levels.The Alien Containment facility can wait. In my opinion, this facility is best built much later in the game. It takes up energy and resources better used for satellite facilities.Workshops are neccessary to raise your engineer numbers, but only so you can build more satellite uplinks. Laboratories are nearly useless, unless playing on higher difficulty settings, then they are useful because research speeds are much longer.One power generator + one thermal generator + one elerium generator, placed all in a row, will give enough power for the whole game.All facilities get the +1 bonus if placed next to each other, either horizontally or vertically.SQUADMy squad typically has 1 Support, 1 Assault, 2 Heavy and 2 Sniper. This is what I use but other players favor Assault more. Your squad composition is up to you.SupportThe weakest offensive unit but the most relied on for support. Eventually can have 3 Medikits. NOTE: All soldiers can carry a medikit as an accessory!AssaultTotal offense. I believe making the first enemy reaction shot miss is best, that way you can lead with this offensive tank. Can have up to 27 health, Awesome.HeavyI always go for +100% damage against Robots. VERY useful when facing the tough robot enemies. I also like Shredder Rocket and 2 Rockets. The capability to take 2 shots in a row is also very nice.SniperI like Squad Sight as it allows me to shoot at anything the squad sees. Less useful with Hover armor, but still a good skill. Double Tap is also awesome. I do not prefer the Sniper that can move and shoot, so I take +2 pistol damage.Tactical BattlesStay together but not all grouped up. If you can't Dash from one side of the formation to the other you are too far apart. Use two mini-squads of support/heavy/sniper and assault/heavy/sniper (different depending on your choice of soldiers or if main soldiers are in the infirmary). When getting ready to enter a doorway, have each mini-squad stand to the SIDE of the doors, never IN FRONT. You could try it the other way but there are certain encounters that may end Very Bad. Take high percentage shots. Sometimes the game will make you miss No Matter What, that's just the way it is.Move forward slowly! Use Overwatch as much as possible! Almost never Dash to move forward, and only Dash when near 100% certain the coast is clear. I cannot stress this enough. Tactical battles are long, patient affairs.Use cover as often as you can! Although soldiers in full cover can still be hit, get as much defense as you can. Defensive bonuses make harder to get hit, and you need every advantage you can acquire.InterceptorsEmp or Plasma? Well, there are two ships you will encounter that are Main Story ships. No matter what you do, these ships will still have a good complement of soldiers. You can always get more artefacts from other missions, squad survivability is paramount so go with Plasma or the late tech Interceptor weapon. Use the EMP until you get Plasma or Fusion.Grey MarketAlmost everything you bring back from battle is useful. Only sell useless items on the Grey Market. Do not sell corpses as almost all have a use. Eventually some can be sold. Early in the campaign it is ok to sell some things, but usually unwise. For example, in my current game I have 4 UFO Power sources and 4 Navigations left. I built several key units and have no more real need for these items. However, they would be needed if I lost Firestorms. And these numbers are for most of the game! If I had sold any of these items I would not have been able to build all the stuff I needed. Therefore, Be Carefull selling on the Grey Market!OVERALLXCOM:EU is a great game. I am certain I may not have included everything I wanted, but this review is very long. I hope it all helps.I LOVE THIS GAME!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2012"}

Dont hate on this review, but I bought a beast of a rig for Skyrim and decided to give it a test on Rage, so I dont have any of the issues many of the 1*s are complaining about. And with that said:Pros:Graphics - Everything is ultra ultra detailed. You can see the writing on cans and boxes around enemies when you zoom in on a sniper rifle. When you talk to people in towns, their movements are so varied and fluent. Paired with the voice acting, it provides an immersive experienceGameplay - This game has alot of side stuff to do, from hunting down bounties in your car to winning races to upgrade your vehicles, the main quest, side jobs and some REALLY fun weapons (looking at you windstick, and silvertip Xbow).Basically the game is about building up your character and his ride. The more races you wim the more credits you earn, which you can use for vehicle upgrades (cant buy them with cash).The job boards are side quests that net you some quick cash and most of them you can insta-travel to upon accepting the job (sniper jobs are the most fun imo).There's also a crafting system which allows you to McGuyver all the bits n pieces you find in the game into some useful stuffAI - Interesting. It will recognize your presence then rally others to your location. It know's when they have you pinned, when you're taking them out one by one. It tries blind fire, will try to escape or charge you, depending on morale.It's not an RPG but its way more than an FPS.Cons:Controls:  Felt just a bit too consoley. Constantly had to mouse over to the 'accept' key instead of just enter/esc out of stuff. Sounds small, wait till you're 4th hr of gaming, it will be in your top 5 pet peeves. There was some kinda tearing going on when I crouched in bandit hideouts, nothing too gamebreaking.Overall:I dont really have much more in the way of cons. This game exceeded expectations both in graphics and gameply.There are views io this game that looks like straight up paintings. When you talk to main chars (hell, any chars) the detail and facial animations are so detailed you'll swear you're looking at something from a cartoon.The best thing is the ability to switch to other activities when you get bored, outmatched in others.So all in all, it seems like nerdrage is fueling the 1 star reviews. In all fairness I have two PCs and I tried this on both;PC1- amd 2.8 /radeon hd5700/4GB ram Win7 32PC2- i5 3.5/ 2-radeon hd 6900xfire/ 16gb win7 64PC1- slow rendering if I moved mouse too fast, details not as crisp (5yr old machine)PC2- One recurring issue: Everytime I crept in hideouts, would get this distracting tearing thing going on.So for all your Skyrim zealots, let this be a hardware check for you guys.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2011"}

Rhodes","summary":"You Might not Be Willing to Chop That Long","reviewText":"Pros:+Improved control scheme+Lots of ways to take down your adversaries; lots of freedomCons:-Not a lot of detail, even for a Wii game-Fairly bad voice acting and presentation of the story-Poor AI from your alliesA couple of years ago, Capcom released Dead Rising on the XBOX360.  It was a surprisingly good game that really showcased what the 360 was capable of at the time.  Putting hordes of zombies on screen and giving you a million ways to play.  The game has now been down scaled for the Wii to give people a new way to experience Dead Rising.You play as Frank West, who has come to Colorado to get the story of a lifetime.  If he survives, that is.  You begin by being dropped off at a mall where most of the inhabitants have taken up residents.  The ones who aren't yet the walking undead.  After a series of events, the mall itself becomes overrun with zombies with few survivors to be seen.  You have 72 hours to survive and get your story.  But you're not just up against zombies.  Throughout the game you'll run into survivors who have gone crazy.The influence for Dead Rising obviously comes in part from Dawn of the Dead.  Just the same, however, you're not getting much of a story throughout the game anyway.  Most of the cutscenes push things along, and there are many things you must achieve in the story, but you're probably not playing the game for a compelling story.  You're probably playing it because you want to massacre zombies.  And there are a lot of ways to massacre the zombies you're up against.In Dead Rising, just about everything is a weapon.  From simple everyday CDs to a lawnmower, you can use just about anything you can find as a weapon to use against the walking undead.  The game gives some balance by making sure you can't exploit a weapon.  Eventually it breaks in some way and you can no longer use it.  But you'll rarely, if ever, run into a moment where you've got nothing at your disposal.  You also have guns for taking out the undead, but they're no where near as fun as mowing them over with a lawnmower or beating them down with a trashcan.  Noticeable for the Wii is that the shooting controls are much much easier, thanks to the Wii Remote.  It works exactly as it once did in Resident Evil 4.  On the other hand, some of the other controls can feel a little limited.  At the very least, however, it's a port in which the Wii controls don't feel tacked on.There's more to just simply killing zombies.  You do have a story to plow through.  You'll run into other survivors from time to time who you'll have to plow through certain segments with.  Unfortunately the AI of these survivors is pretty bad.  It's a lot more work to keep them alive than actually killing zombies yourself.  Unlike the 360 version, however, you don't have to worry so much about the consequences of failure.  You might remember that the 360 version only gave you one save file per save device.  The Wii actually gives you multiple saves to work with, and you might want to take advantage of it  at certain points in the game.You'll also run into crazy people, who serve as the games boss fights.  These are, for the most part, thrilling battles.  They can also be a bit tough, but gamers who played the 360 version will note that the difficulty has been lowered significantly in the Wii version.  It isn't nearly as easy to die as it once was.  If you're having trouble at any point, however, the game does happen to have a level up system where your health and power do actually increase.On the 360, Dead Rising showed people what kind of potential the 360 was capable of.  This isn't exactly true of the Wii, however.  It obviously doesn't look as good as the 360 version, and it would be unfair to compare.  But compared to other Wii games, Dead Rising could use a definite face lift.  A lot of the environments look bland and boring.  The game lacks detail overall, with blurry textures and details popping up every now and then.  You also don't get any sense of how much danger you're in because the Wii isn't capable of putting several zombies on screen at a time.  In short, Dead Rising on the Wii doesn't bring out the potential in the Wii.  You can find several PS2 and Gamecube games that look noticeably better.  Likewise, much of the voice acting and writing isn't all that great either.  Sometimes it gets things just right.  But many times some voices can feel a little overdone.If you already have the 360 version, you might want to keep that one instead.  It isn't exactly worth buying the Wii version just for new controls alone.  Along those lines the game also took out certain gameplay elements, for example, taking photos was quite an important aspect of gameplay before, but for whatever reason, Capcom took this out of the Wii version.  In short, the experience, despite some good shooting controls, just isn't as good.  What it does better, such as the shooting and the multiple save spots, is worth noting, but it isn't something that'll make you want the game if you've already got it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2009"}

The quest leads you on a massive fantastic journey through a dark world that is full of full of mythical monsters, such as mummies, gargoyles, and the grim reaper. This game is not what I expected, from the usual whip and holly water game. This game now lets you find and equip armor, new weapons, special items, such as the double jump and the running boots. It also incorporates spells, which can be mixed and matched to make different effects, such as giving you flame whips or more energy. This game is more like Metroid (NES + SNES), being that it is a side-scrolling quest. It is a big and sometimes tediously long game, because there are countless enemies after you, but it&#65533;s a good thing there are 150 different types of enemies after you or else you will get bored very quick. One of the more difficult parts of the game is the fact that there are several areas that look exactly the same, so you can get lost easily. There are incredibly detailed graphics to the game, but many people complain the game is very dark. This is true, so you will probably have to use your worm light (accessory sold separately).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2001"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYZ2G","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Kinect Sports Season 2 Review","reviewText":"Microsoft has come out with a sequel to their sports game to show off the Kinect. In this game you'll get to play Football, Golf, Darts, Skiing, Baseball, and Tennis. As you play the different games you're going to be able to unlock difficulties to increase the experience and also the challenge.Graphically this game looks exactly like the first, with the exception of the change in sporting equipment. Everything was clearly done, and the informational videos told you exactly what you need to know to get the job done in the game that you're currently trying to play.The sounds of the game were for the most part hit songs from different eras, when you did something good, and an announcer of some sort to tell you what's currently going on in the game.The controls of the game involved your body, but for some reason I felt that they were worse than they were in the first game. Trying to do the actions to serve a tennis ball, I could never get the Kinect to see exactly what I was doing, and as a result I never felt comfortable in that aspect. There were other games that suffered from the same disconnect I felt, but not to that large of a degree.So you have all these sports games, and to be honest there's only one that I would recommend coming back to, and that's Darts. The simplest one is the best one to play because you can figure out what the game is expecting and then play as if you're playing the real thing. Now for the other games.Let's start first with Football, it's anything but football. You have 4 plays to march down the entire field, there's no such thing as a first down. You're either going to have to score a touchdown, kick a field goal, or I'm guessing turn it over on downs. You're going to have these different passing indicators that will light up when its the correct time to throw it to a receiver, but I felt as if sometimes my throwing motions didn't get the ball going in the correct direction. There's also the fact that you've got to squat before each play, and sometimes if you squat too soon it didn't register. There's also the fact that you couldn't play defense in the game, so you were at complete mercy of the game.Now lets hit up baseball. This is yet another broken game. I do get that they wanted it to be cute and cool to have indicators tell you which type of pitch the batter was bad at hitting, but it makes no logical sense for a left-handed person to have to constantly pitch with both hands depending on the batter. There's also the fact that even if you got it right it wasn't going to equal to much. The fielding mechanic was also screwy. I understand that there's an achievement for bobbling the ball and then catching it, but I never felt comfortable with that mechanic. There's also the fact that its a severely shorten game when it comes to innings, which is probably for the best, as when I played against a human opponent the actual inning would take about 8 runs bare minimum before a change in sides.I've already hit a bit on tennis, but overall it just feels a bit sloppy. I do like the overhead slam feel, but other than that the game doesn't really like I wanted it to feel.The other games golf and skiing did what they were suppose to do, but once again I felt that the controls weren't tight enough to make them overly enjoyable. There are also some challenges to try to extend the game, but to be honest you can get through those rather quickly, and then you're left with the game again. A good thing that each of these games should have had is more options, more than setting the difficulty. I would have love to change up dart system, to change up inning numbers, to be able to play defense, to have more of a game than a bunch of half done carnival games. So with that I've got to give this game a 5.7 out of 10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

Metal Gear Solid 2 adds to the series with combat, stealth, strategy and intrigue. You are Raiden / Snake, part of a covert military group.The graphics in this game are just amazing. The movements, surroundings, lighting are very well done. You can peer around corners, crouch down, crawl along to sneak up up enemies.

The background music is moody and suspense-filled, and the ambient noises of footfalls and doors opening and closing all reallyd raw you into the game.The gameplay is great, in that it's not a blast-em-up button masher. You have to think about your surroundings and work to take out your enemies in the most efficient way you can. You can replay levels to find new and better ways to get through the level.Where the game drags is in the PLOT. First off, the plot is more like a soap opera, with all sorts of really bizarre twists and interpersonal conflicts. Second, this is supposed to be a stealth-trained guy, a la splinter cell. Instead, he gets these INCREDIBLY long discussions while he's in the middle of a mission! They should have had briefing sessions BEFORE each mission that you could skip, and then when you were actually in the mission you should just do it. There could maybe be an &quot;on line encyclopedia&quot; you could go to if you got stuck - but to keep deliberately interrupting the game for these dialogues was poor.Still, you can always have a book nearby to read while those dialogues go on - I hate to skip them just in case something important IS said in them. Usually nothing is, but you never know.If you can last through those cut-scenes, the rest of the game is really enjoyable and well worth playing. It's a lesson in patience!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2003"}

I will admit, I am a big time COD fanboy, but I still enjoy and like this game. Anyway...I think I am about 3/4 done with the campaign and I absolutely love it. In my opinion, the MOH campaign, story, and missions are a lot better then MW2. The battles are more intense and more realistic. I also like that there are plenty of sniper and stealth missions. I also liked the Heli mission, not much of a challenge, but it was fun to mow down the enemy with hellfire missiles. The one thing I don't like is that the AI is as dumb as a rock. This is true with both the enemy and your team members. Sometimes my team members will just stand next to an enemy and not shoot at him, I have to run up from my position and kill him. The enemy AI doesn't move from cover to cover, they usually just hold their position and you can basically run up and knife them. I play this on the hard mode and its still not much of a challenge. I think the ammo system makes this game too easy. You can get a ton of ammo from your team members. Its almost like having unlimited ammo. There are also some glitches and quarky stuff, but honestly, what game doesn't have that? All in all, I really like the campaign mode, there are a few issues but I thought the story was captivating and intense.The multiplayer seems fun, similar to BC2, but IMO better. I really didn't like BC2 multiplayer, but I had fun playing this one. Its doesn't even come close to being as good as the COD MP, but I like it. I only played the MP for a few hours and I sucked pretty bad at first, but I got the hang of it and starting getting some good kills. I still don't understand all the components of the MP, because I am still new to it. I wish that they had Free-4-all on the MP, kind of sucks that they didn't put one of the main components of MP. I only played team deathmatch and have not tried the other game types yet.Overall, this is a good game, not a great game, but good enough to enjoy to hold you over till Blackops comes out in about a month. I am getting really tired of playing MW2 and this is game will nicely fill the gap till Nov 9. I didn't buy this game, got it from Gamefly. I will probably keep it till next month. I am not too sure if I would buy this game. I don't think I would play this after Blackops comes out. So I would say, save your money and buy Blackops, but I would recommend this game as a rental.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}

The games effects, animation and voice cast are very good so the complaints aren't touching those areas but more on the controls and camera angles of the game which could have been a lot better.  The one major issue I had about the camera angles that another reviewer brought up was that it was annoying and frustrating to try and move around and target your enemies when the movement of the camera seemed slower than the enemies moving around as well as when you have a target behind you by the time you turned around you pretty much died and had to begin again.  Also it was sometimes annoying the multi-purpose control buttons they selected for you meaning that the X button would have your character sprint/roll jump/or take cover and for most games that's o.k.,  but this game seemed to be confused of the action you would want to do.  One explanation would be when your an a firefight with ten or more enemies and you try and get to cover but instead sprint past, roll jump or some other action you didn't mean to do and get killed off and have to start over again and again until the game read the action you wanted to do correctly or you just lucked out and killed all the enemies before you died.  I haven't had this problem with my other game Splinter Cell Conviction(Great Game for anyone) and considering the time they supposedly to make this game you would think it wouldn't have these kind of problems.  So at the end is it a good action game?, yes and for $9.00 dollars a somewhat decent price but expect a lot of frustrating situations and a few headaches along the way as well...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2010"}

I even think I like it more than the various and sundry Final Fantasy games I have played recently.  Granted, those games have better stories and more detailed characters but there is something about Baldur's Gate that sets it apart and ahead of the competition, for me anyway.  I think that it would have to be the ability to shape your won character.  In a lot of console RPG's you seem to have very little control of your character.  You only seem to be watching a movie that you happen to control and you sometimes don't seem to have much choice in the outcome, but this game allows you to choose many different paths and make many choices, some good, some evil.My favorite part of this game is building relationships with the non player characters that travel with you.  Not to mention all the various side quests that are in the game.  Each character class has different quests that are unique to each.  For example the warrior has an opportunity to inherit a keep and protect it from bandits and the wizard can inherit a tower and train apprentice wizards in the magic arts and then have them create magic items for him.  Because of these many sidequests this game has much replay value.  And that's without the expansion pack.  The throne of Bhaal adds another level to the gameplay.  I must confess that I still haven't beaten the expansion pack but I have gotten far enough to know there are many plot twists.  Another cool addition that wasn't in the first Baldur's gate is the ability for your character to fight with two weapons at the same time.In conclusion, this game is probably the best thing you could buy if you like old school rpgs.  However, be prepared to save often.  Like the first Baldur's gate this game is incredibly hard but that makes it all the more satisfying when you finally beat it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2004"}

I have an average sized hand, and ergonomically speaking, the G500 fits me just right, with curves that fill my palm without making it feeling too big or too small, while still allowing easy reach all the buttons.  It also comes with a tin of small, button-sized weights, consisting of six 4.5g weights and six 1.7g weights.  The pop-out cartridge in the bottom of the mouse can hold a maximum of six weights, in any combination.  Marry these two features together, and you have a mouse tailored specifically for you.Unlike other mice with programmable buttons that you never, or hardly ever, use, you're going to want to be able to reach all the G500's ten buttons. One word sums that up: macros! Yes, this is the first mouse I have used that is fully programmable with something other than single keystrokes. Tip: Although the G500 will work out of the box as a standard mouse, in order to unleash it's full potential you will need to download the latest Setpoint software, free from the Logitech website.For years, gamers have preferred mouse wheels that 'click' over mouse wheels that 'glide.' But we're not gamers 24/7 and there are uses for both. Usually, you'd have to pick one over the other, depending on your preferences and needs, and live with it, but not any more! The G500 does both! At the click of a conveniently located button just below the scroll wheel, you can now change, instantly, from 'click' (for precise increments) to 'glide' (for long uninterrupted scrolls). This is one of my favorite features.I also like that you can adjust the DPI on the fly. This, of course, changes the laser pointer precision, but the immediate effect you will see on screen and feel in the mouse is its travel speed. This is great for if you want to speed up or slow down your mouse movement without having to stop, look through menus, and reprogram your software. A click of the + or - buttons toggles the DPI settings up and down.You may be wondering how a mouse can store all this info. Well, it's because the G500 has its own onboard memory; it even has the ability to update its firmware! That has to be a first for a mouse. The G500 stores your personal settings as Profiles, so you can have more than one, like one for work and one for play. Genius!I have always preferred Logitech mice over other brands, and I think the G500 is a great addition to the line. With all it's features, I also think that although it's aimed at gamers, the G500 could easily benefit anyone who wants a fully programmable mouse.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2009"}

Wtf??\" For a while, i was on the edge of getting this game, but i eventually did (for free!) on playstation plus, and i fell in love with it.You could say Sleeping Dogs is a Sandbox/fighting game, with small little twists of genres here and there. This is a no spoilers review, so im not revealing synopsis, but the story is set in hong kong, and you-Wei Shen- an undercover cop, has to take down different triad gangs, as you were once a part of that lifestyle in the past.First off, the gameplay is where this game shines. It normally consists of big brawl fights, where you whack punches and kicks here and there, while pulling off sweet counter attacks. Sleeping dogs does a great job of mixing up the fighting by having different enemy classes, which makes you more cautious when approaching. As you progress through the game, you unlock points that give you upgrades for either melee or gunfighting(yes, this exists in this game), and you can unlock some pretty killer moves. If you're looking for more of a gta kind of game thats full of guns, this may not be for you, the game consists mostly of fighting, but there are missions where you have guns, but its easy to waste ammo, and guns are NOT plentiful in Hong Kong.The sound in Sleeping Dogs is very immersive, and the world feels alive with chatter of civilans, cars, and music that is in the radio.What can i say about visuals? Excellent! This game has a dynamic time cycle, which means that you will be playing through in-game hours, from day to night, and so forth. Everything is fleshed out nicely, i havent found any glitches or bugs yet though.As a general sandbox game, there are other things to do than main missions, you can do favors, find collectibles(health upgrades, money, melee upgrades, ect), and even karyoke(i think i spelled that wrong)!Yes, you can sing karyoke,even though Wei sounds pretty bad at singing lol.Overall, this game is very fun, and the story is interesting enough to keep playing. When comparing the \"M\" rating of this title to similar sandbox games, its pretty damn bloody, very profane, and disturbing(yes, im not kidding) at times, this hasnt bothered me, but just putting it out there for people who are sensitive of this kind of stuff.Cons:(only 2 that ive found)One gripe i have about this game is that the police AI is very skilled. If you like running around causing chaos and killing every living thing you see, be prepared to die, a lot. Once you piss off the HKPD (hong kong police dep.) enough, they will pull their guns out on you, and shoot you, with suprisingly good aim and damage. Its somewhat easy to flee from them, but if you're on foot, alone with no weapon and facing a few cops, its likely you'll die. This costs 15k \"HK\"s, which is the currency, and the  game will drop you at the \"nearest hospital\", ironically that is far from some objectives.Another small con that i found is the taxi system. First off, you need to stop a taxi, get in the right position, (AWAY FROM THE FRONT DOORS), hold triangle, and choose your location, before i go further, the game is a bit picky when deciding if you're in the correct spot to hail the taxi, otherwise, Wei will go ahead and  start hijacking the taxi, which thus scares the cab driver and disables that feature(at least for that taxi).now to the map- the taxi can take you to certain places, like mission starting points and garages, so you cannot ask it to drop you anywhere you choose.Besides the small anoyances in travel and criminal activities, this game is worth getting, especially if you have PS+, as i mentioned above. I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for something a bit different from your average sandbox adventure! Happy Gaming!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2013"}

Great Online Content.","reviewText":"Let's talk about the online experience first.  The servers are always down.  Forget playing online.  If you enjoy that, do not buy this game.  If you love downloading CAW's, the servers will make you want to hurricanrana yourself into a brick wall.  You will literally have to attempt to go online ten times before you get a connection.  Use that connection to view and download what you can for a couple minutes until the servers stop working.  Then you will back out and repeat the process.  This makes searching for content nearly impossible some days.  It makes downloading CAW's frustrating most days.  It makes going online a chore everyday.So, THQ failed to provide an online experience.  Failed terribly.  Failed like Saddam Hussein's army in the first Iraq war.  Failed like a kindergarten class in a bar fight against the NY Yankees.  Just unbelievably bad.So why is the game a 4?Well, the community that plays this game creates so many interesting new wrestlers and so many legends and other left-out superstars that the game becomes refreshing very often.  The WWE 13 players make this game an excellent experience, not THQ.As usual, THQ serves up a Legends cast that is severely lacking.  In fact, they want to force us to BUY most of the wrestlers that should be in the game already for free!  Current stars!  How lame.And Mike Tyson has ONE OUTFIT.  Give me a break.  The online community created a much better Mike Tyson.If you want Hulk Hogan, you got it.  Ultimate Warrior?  Got it.  Bam Bam Bigelow?  He's there.  Hardy brothers, Dudley brothers, Ultimo Dragon, Steamboat, and on and on.  Michael Jackson?  Yep.  Chris Brown?  Yep.  Psy?  Yep.A host of imaginative and detailed wrestlers and divas are created daily.  Many of the online creations are truly just as good as the THQ-made wrestlers, so that makes this game worth some time and effort fighting for some downloads from THQ's crappy servers.The game itself is basically the same as WWE 12.  Lots of moves too.  You can perform a few more moves in a few more situations, so that is nice.  The game is a superior fighting game, as usual.  Lots of fun.The Attitude storylines are annoying because you HAVE to do them to unlock content.  If you do not care about that era, you will be disappointed.  But the matches are a fun distraction with historical objectives you have to pull off to unlock stuff.Little has been added to the CAW options, so you are basically using the same resources as you did in WWE 12 to make your own wrestlers.Gameplay is smooth and fun.  The ref gets in the way a lot less than last game (so far).If you are a wrestling fan or a fighting game fan, buy this.  The fighting is fun and full of options.  Smooth animations and funny taunts.  Annoying commentary, but good sound overall.  The moves feel good.  A hard punch feels like a smash in the face, so the game has an element of realism that is enjoyable.I dedicate this review to Andre the Giant.  The only CAW no one gets right.  The only legend who deserves to be in every game, but THQ hates us and leaves him out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"4.5; That's a lot of fight to finish","reviewText":"Halo has a strange place in videogame industry now since it's become a record breaker as much as its become the target of much malign with cries of \"generic FPS\" and \"overrated\" often heard more frequently than car horns in the city. Now I'm one of those kind of weird guys that will admit sometimes even the best things can have a few imperfections so I'll say that the Halo series does as much things right whereas in other areas it is disappointing to see Bungie not learn from past mistakes. With ODST, the game presents a departure from the main series and it's hard to say whether it's an expansion or a full blown game but it's certainly different enough to set it apart, only slightly since that is the problem with ODST and in a way with the Halo series, they do things exceptionally well; they just rely on that way too often.Story: The story takes place in between the events of Halo 2 and Halo 3 when a Covenant ship does a slipspace jump right in the middle of the Earth city of New Mombasa. You play as the Rookie, an ODST (Orbital Drop Shock Trooper) who's separated from the rest of his squad members and wanders the streets of New Mombasa searching for his fellow ODST's but also the reason why the Covenant are so interested in New Mombasa and what lies under it. The game goes back and forth between Rookie's nighttime search and his teammates encounters with the Covenant during the day.Graphics: Halo 3 was one of those kind of games where from an art design standpoint it does look cool and even has a lot of unique qualities to it but it wasn't one of those games that really showed off what the Xbox 360 was capable of. ODST is simliar in that everything looks nice and things are animated well but there's also things that aren't that stellar. For example, the ship that slipspace jumped caused damage to the city but aside from some cars and UNSC/Covenant vehicles, it doesn't actually look all that devastated. One slight change is the new visor which makes it more easier to see in the dark as well as having allies and foes color-coordinated to easily tell them apart. Not a completely gorgeous game that I'm sure Uncharted 2 and Modern Warfare 2 will bring but works well enough.Sound/Music: Here's the big surprise, the soundtrack in this game is fan-****ing-tastic. The typical energetic themes that happen when things start to get more shoot-y are still there but there's also a tinge of solemn themes and melancholy with some...light jazz? Yeah, there's some piano here and it's kind of haunting and although to some it might not fit the tone of the nighttime scenes, that sense of loneliness is captured quite well. As far as voice acting, only ones that really do their jobs well is the main voice actors, especially Nathan Fillon (Mal from \"Firefly\") but your squad members are still the same boneheaded kinds, you know the \"hey, save some for me!\" kind. One thing I also loved was the sound design on the weaponry, playing on headphones they had such a nice kick to them.Gameplay: What sets ODST apart from the main series is the progression where it's slightly more open ended where the encounters with the Covenant are not as frequent during the nighttime but then the daytime shifts to the more epic encounters including vehicle sections. It's kind of a strange pace because the nighttime scenes are slow and light on action than poof, shootout galore but also it might feel slightly dull since there's not much to the Rookie segments other than the occasional shootout. Oh and the Rookie isn't the Master Chief not only in character but in skills. He can't jump as high, survive a high fall, his melee is somewhat pathetic on Heroic (my first difficulty setting, nicely balanced for once) and his health is similar to the first Halo where you have shields while you have a health meter you need to replenish with health packs. There's a bit more strategy into this now since you can't go in guns blazing now and even Hunters, which were a bit more \"sigh, these guys...\" to \"ohhhhh ****\". And like Halo 3, you can play the campaign co-op for all those who want extra help to tackle Legendary or at least just for kicks so the more irritating encounters are a bit more manageable.Added to ODST is \"Firefight\" which to put it in simpler, and I'm sure familiar terms, is the ODST version of Horde mode from Gears of War 2. Basic rundown is this: you and up to 3 others take on wave after wave of Covenant in hopes of surviving to the next round. After a certain time, the skulls get turned on which change around the tactics of the battlefield. One round you might have a skull where they love to throw grenades with reckless abandon while another has you having to melee in order to get your shields back up. The nice thing about this mode is that it's a bit more frantic since the maps are a bit bigger, the vehicles are added and all the goodies from the campaign are included such as turrets you can rip off and riding around on ghosts and even wraiths. There's 2 complaints I have, the first being the bigger one: there's no matchmaking. What this means is that say you feel in the mood for some Firefight and you want buddies well unlike Gears, you have to invite people in and set matches up which can feel frustrating when everyone's in their own game or not answering. The other complaint is that if one player leaves the game, it screws everybody up and matches entirely ended simply because one player got disconnected or left and while on occasion, gameplay resumed after a few slight hiccups, a lot of times we get good games going than poof, the game decides to end the match even though nobody actually quit or left.The other thing included with ODST is actually disc 2, which Bungie dubbed the \"Complete Multiplayer Experience\". What this means is that the entire multiplayer from Halo 3 is on disc 2 with every single map pack added along with 3 new maps: Orbital, Longshore and Citadel. Of course this is quite the benefit for players to now have 24 maps to play on but then...if you're a Halo fan you most likely already have Halo 3 in addition to all the map packs, paid for or free and having to spend additional money for a multiplayer you already have just for 3 maps is where all the ire is coming from in reviews and fans. Bungie probably could've released disc 1 separately and either have disc 2 a pre-order/limited edition bonus or release the map pack on Xbox Live. As far as the multiplayer is concerned it's the same as ever: fun with lots of maps and gameplay options and plenty of achievements yet just as much racists, homophobes and young, annoying kids as before. Guess that's the price you pay for a fun MP: have to put up with a whole legion of players who love to throw around swear words and racial slurs.Is ODST worth 60? (Price at the store was 64.99 but whatever). Probably not but is it at least worth a buy. I'd say so since Firefight once you actually start a match is quite addicting and for those who never played Halo 3's multiplayer will have a blast but for super hardcore fans, having a short campaign, a co-op multiplayer with no matchmaking and an MP you most likely already own might grind your gears a little bit.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2009"}

The visor mode is cool and I like the hub world that allows to play through the missions of your comrades and allows a more open world feel. I also like recordings of what happened to Mombasa that are scattered throughout the city that you explore.The Fire Fight mode is great but mostly only great if your able to have friends to always play with since there is no match making. If you don't have a lot of friends to play with than your stuck playing with yourself which this mode wasn't built for. Its great and very similiar to the Horde mode in Gears 2 but I find myself struggling not just find people to play with but getting people to play when I want to play it.Other than that, its great it offers all the map packs and 3 new ones on top of that. It still is a blast to play online and hard to imagine getting over but the game is too short for me to recommend as a buy. Everyone though should by the very least give it a rent but if you do have a lot of friends that have it than its easier to recommend as a buy because Fire Fight is the best part of the game and you will likely put more time than others who don't have the friends to enjoy it with.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2009"}

Most of the time this resulted in simply going brute force, -full auto-, where you'd have preferred a silent approach.

This means if you don't have an internet connection active; you can't play.  It also means that even though you may own this game, if Blizzard's servers go down for whatever reason, you can't play.  If it's your 1 day off a week where you can get time to play a game you were a fan of the franchise and Blizzard is having trouble with their servers? To ****ing bad for you. Complain on the forums? You'll be met with a horde of fanboy's and others who purely want to hate you for not loving whatever scrap is tossed your way after paying to own a game you are unable to play.Online features advertised as being part of the game are non-existant, or full of bugs.  Pvp is not available in game at this point which I don't get as it was advertised as being part of it, and yet it's a ghost.  The auciton house (gold) is constantly down or buggy. The real money auction house version has been pushed back for the third week in a row.  Again these are things that were promised as part of a game you own, not a subscription game, YET they are non-existant.  Do you buy a refridgerator and accept that the manufacturer says you can't use the freezer for a month? No, well you shouldn't expect that with a game that you are buying to own either. Don't like it? Blizzard nor their employees and fanboys don't care; see forum's for evidence of this.Online general chat is filled with chinese spambots trying to sell you in game gold for real money.  This totally destroys any sense of communication as it is a constant. These are big paragraphs that go by in clusters every couple minutes.  Chat is also filled with numerous people talking very dirty sexually, and making numerous violent and racist things.  Party chat is also filled with this.  This is beyond a M rating for the chat alone; no wonder online interaction is not rated.  The forums for this game are filled with these types of people as well. Just today i witnessed a forum thread entitled:  \"Kill Yourself.\"  The author was suggesting you commit suicide in real life if you had a problem with this game being offline.  Blizzard not removing such a thread says a lot for them as far as I'm concerned.In general I find the game very laggy which makes it difficult to play. I have encountered numerous people voicing similar complaints.Their are also many, many people who have had hacked accounts so early into the release of this game. It is scary to think of the large scale this is happening at already.  Blizzard as well as their fanboys and undercover employees place absolute blame on the individuals who had the hacked account.The game is very short in general.  If you are of moderate ability as far as gaming goes you can expect to finish the story within 7 hours at most. After that it's all repeat on higher difficulty. The story is poorly composed, and the gameplay is clearly targeting people of low ability as far as gaming go.Like many people say, this is a $40 game with a $60 price tag.  That 40 is only if everything worked, which it doesnt.Even when they get everything working I would suggest against making the transition onto Diablo's poorly made world.  Their are an ample supply of alternative games to choose from. You should pursue anything else.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2012"}

I loved the story and my quest for vengance but in the end, your stuck with a hard 3 way decision on what to do and how to end the game.  After the game ends, you can contiue to travel and look for the Legandary weapons and acheivements.  Game is not that hard but you earn experience on every fight.  The exp is uesed in different collors of orbs.  Each colore would upgrade a different ability or power and their are stors that sell potions for that quick exp.  You can max out your fire or choose to bring back more dead guys to help you fight.  All you have to do is power up to the max that you got and unlease the power.  The downside is that you can be attacked and so you have to be careful.  Their are different types of enemies so its not that repetative.There are side thing you can do like get married and recieve something nasty.  You can buy houses and remodel them, raise a famliy or two in two different towns, purchase weapons and on some you can add a crystal type thing to boost you sword power.  Their is plenty of money to be earned so buy as much protery as you can.  Its not just for the game but for online trading.  Trading you say...  Their is an acheivements to collect all 7 Hero Dolls but some poeple will only sell them for 7-10 million.  Crazy but if you go to xbox360acheivements you will be able to find people that are willing to trade.  The other reason is to trade legendary weapons or items that someone needs to get an acheivements like unlocking all the Demon doors.I think there have been 2 DLC's that have been release for the game and each with its own missions and new perks.  Get your dog back if it died and the ablility to change the type of dog you have.  Dalmation, Bloodhound, Husky or your old Mutt are the potions that the guy sels and there not that expensive.The co-op play is terrible and you have to share the same screen.  So if my and my wife wanted to play, the screen does not split.  If me and my friend from another sate wanted to play, you still share the same screen wich means you both have to stay close together within view range.  The online aspect is that if you wanted to trade with a friend, you will have to look for their orb.  Its in the setting menue and you can see several orbs running around and poeple asking to trade for hero dolls or weapons.  If you are trading with someone, you have to go up to the orb and trasfer certain items and the game will save after each trasfered item.The game is really fun and i hope this help you in what you need to know","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX3KG","description":"","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"Gorgeous and Fun, and yet...","reviewText":"it isn't without its flaws. Don't get me wrong. I'm right there in my excitement for this gem of a game, as much as every other reviewer here has been. To say this game is refreshing is an understatement. It's certainly a rarity to find a platformer with an audience as wide as this one has. The stages are perfectly paced, and the infinite lives will make this game perfect for even the youngest gamers. But hardcore platforming fans will find some of the most intense challenges they've seen in years here if they expect to 100% the game. Therefore, the game is really as easy or as difficult as the players want it to be.The art style of the game is also exquisitely realized. One really does get the feeling that you're playing through an oldschool Disney movie when playing.But I did mention flaws, so let's discuss them. While the screen never becomes so busy that it's hard to tell what's going on (the sort of thing you'll find in R&C;: All 4 One), the camera does pan out too far from time to time; making platforming accuracy difficult to achieve. The controls can also be a bit quirky as well. Jumps don't always go the way you plan them, you may fall from a swing with no clear reasoning as to why, etc. This can make speed runs more difficult than they need to be; drawing away from the fun of the experience. Also, while comical, the ability to hit other players will interfere with your progression more often than not, while playing with friends.Still, this is a near-perfect platformer not counting those drawbacks. And even with them remaining in place, you are still going to find yourself obsessed with this game if you can be counted as a fan of any other platformer on the market. The four star rating I'm giving is more like four and a half. I mention the flaws, so that you'll know to expect them. But DON'T let them keep you from playing this game. You'd be crazy to do so. For this game takes everything that made the original Rayman game great and expands upon it. This game is not just recommended. It is a must-own.

Link is to graduate from being an apprentice to a qualified train engineer so he travels to Hyrule Castle to recieve his certificate from Princess Zelda. The Spirit Tracks are disappearing. After the ceremony is over, Zelda asks Link to help her out of the castle so she can investigate the Tower of Spirits, where she thinks something has happened to cause the disappearance of the Spirit Tracks. On the way to the Tower of Spirits, the two are ambushed by Zelda's Advisor, Chancellor Cole. Zelda dies when Cole forces her spirit out of her body, taking her body with him. This is, essentially, where our story really begins and is it a story.Considering I went into the game with low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised to find out the game is about the best Zelda game I've played yet.Why did I go into the game with low expectations, when most Zelda games are top-notch games? Well, I was expecting it to be alot like Phantom Hourglass. Mostly everyone I know was disappointed with the game. My feelings were mixed, at best.I loved Spirit Tracks. It offered a new story, more puzzles, new in-game items, an interactive map functionality, a new mode of transportation and a new companion in combat. What more could you want in a game? Even the graphics were pretty awesome. Among the best I've seen so far for the system.The only gripe I had with the game was using the stylus throughout the whole game. It took some getting used to. I probably played through a third of the game before it started to feel natural all over again. However, once I got used to it--it wasn't so bad. That, I think, will probably be your only gripe with the game as well.Otherwise, The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks is a worthy addition to the The Legend of Zelda series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000WQWPOQ","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Boring, hard, and overrated","reviewText":"The Good: Fun combat, lots of different powers, huge skill tree, you can pretend your someone else...The Bad: ...Because Alex is an unlikeable protagonist, terrible storytelling, boring free world, repetitive combat, cookie cutter AI, unbalanced difficulty, outdated graphicsIf you have ever played The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction you will kind of get the idea of what Alex Mercer is going through in Prototype (or [PROTOTYPE] as SEGA thinks CAPS is cool >.>), just minus the green problem our Mr. Banner seems to be having. The reason I say Prototype is like Ultimate Destruction, and just a tad more ultimate with a hint more destruction, is because it uses a beefed up engine from the same game and shares some of the same mechanics.You play as Alex Mercer a confused test subject who wants revenge on his creator and to stop the infection spreading through out the story. I'd tell you more, but the storytelling is so terrible I had no idea what was going on and who was doing what or WHO! Constant flashbacks and pieces of the story told through consuming certain targets and watching stills isn't fun for your brain to digest.When you first jump into the game you'll be able to run up walls, climb buildings, and eventually glide, kick and consume your way to ultimate infected glory. Most of Prototype is a free roaming mode where you run from mission to mission, or side mission/activity, a la Spider-Man or any other hero you like that can run across a city in less than 30 minutes. The great thing about this is you can find hidden items such as extra experience, or little hidden things to unlock achievements (or trophies if you're a PS3 fan and are somehow \"accidentally\" reading this Xbox 360 review). While most of these (like in any sandbox game) are so spread out and so well hidden you won't except for the ones you run across on accident. Most of the free roaming is, unfortunetly, boring and bland. There are just people and cars and that's pretty much it. Once you get further into the game rampant zombies and infected people terrorize the streets, and it does get more interesting, but it just makes you want to stay off of them and onto the buildings. Most of the graphics in the game are outdated and kind of boring to begin with so there's nothing real \"eye-catching\" about the game at all.The meat of the game, really, is the fighting and this is where the heart of Prototype lies. You have a HUGE skill tree that extends from combat to stealth, to movement, to even yes you guessed it, powers. What kind of a game called [PROTOTYPE] be without powers? Well pretty boring since there are so many you have more than you handle...no really. Prototype has so many different moves and powers you will end up forgetting most of the littler ones and just use your most obnoxious ones. Your arm can transform into different weapons such as a whip, giant fists via The Thing, larger muscles for a mix of power and speed, a giant scythe (the one on the COVER!), and a few others. Accompanied with these you have some armor (can't glide or double dash though!...yeah shut-up Mario Kart fanboys), you can also shape shift into whoever your last consumed victim was (more on that later). The way you use these powers depends on the enemies your fighting. A huge mechanic is the grab ability since this is used to fling objects at helicopters, giant tentacle arms, and even the military soldiers, or infected monsters. Most of the time your mashing X and Y together to create a cool combo then you somehow unleash a weird power. That's why there is just too much in this game since you can't memorize all these combos and what each one does for what weapons. One of the next major mechanics is the lock on system and this is used to dash toward enemies and pummel them before they do something amazing to your infected self. I had a hard time with multiple enemies since you'd want to target one (say a guy with a rocket launcher up high), but the game would keep targeting someone else below.You can use actual weapons in the game that enemies drop such as machine guns, shotguns, and rocket launchers and these are essential in some missions. Not always will you have your weapons available and you'll have to use the environment around you. The also consists of many boss fights and this is where I concluded my play through. The game gets so frustratingly difficult towards the end that the game will throw so many hard enemies at you at once (two tentacles plus 5-6 hunters), while trying to protect something? Yeah right, but then again SEGA is known for doing this in their games. You'll end up trying to hit one enemy then another knocks you back, then you can't get up because another is smashing on you then when you do you get knocked back again. Yes, a lot of cheap deaths and hits and this isn't fair.Aside from the annoying main missions there are some rather fun and unique activities that utilize your powers. Some missions will have you using selected power to eliminate a certain amount of enemy in a certain amount of time, some are races, checkpoint races, and some even have you finding targets and consuming them for your Web (more on that later). While most of the these are fun some are impossible to get the target requirements for a gold metal and max amount of experience points to spend in the skill tree. Other skills are earned by consuming certain targets to fly helicopters, tanks, etc.The last element I should mention is the skill tree and this is filled by consuming certain targets and watching a series of stills and a brief voice clip to fill in the story (lame). So as you can see this may be unique (and ways to unlock achievements..yeah or TROPHIES), but this seems more like a cheap way to tell the story, or used as game filler.While Prototype is fun for awhile it quickly gets repetitive with it's cookie cutter enemy AI, broken storytelling, cheap deaths, and bland free roaming world. I recommend Prototype for a rental, but don't expect anything amazing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B007VJ06Q6","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Paslay","summary":"Fresh take on side scrolling","reviewText":"I've been playing video games for a long time. Some of my fondest memories are of when I was a kid and me and my friends would be at an arcade that had one of the 4 player side scrolling brawlers. Dungeons & Dragons and the Avengers are the two that stick out the most. I always loved those games but as time went on and as real arcades (not Dave and Buster's) have essentially gone away, side scrollers seemed to fade with them. When I initially read about Dragon's Crown, I was intrigued. It looked like an updated Dungeon's & Dragons and the artwork appeared to be phenomenal (it is.). I was still on the fence however. Side scrollers never had a lot of substance and without my friends next to me would this be worth my $40? That answer is a solid YES.I've put about 10.5 hours into the game so far and have a level 27 Wizard. Dragon's Crown is a side scroller and, as I had hoped, is essentially Dungeons & Dragons for 2013. The artwork and animation is STUNNING. The tutorial is quick and simple, easy to learn/harder to master. Gameplay is a lot of the button mashing you would expect but there are enough abilities in there that it's at least focused button mashing. 99% of the time I can honestly say \"I meant to do that.\" If you've been itching for a side scrolling brawler that isn't just an HD re-release, this is it. My concern was paying $40 for an hour of nostalgia. I was worried that once my appetite for the past had been satisfied, I'd be done with the game. Fortunately, Dragon's Crown is anything but just a pretty brawler.What you have here is a beautiful marriage of side-scrolling brawling with traditional RPG dungeon crawling. You pick from one of six classes; Warrior, Amazon, Dwarf (berserker), Elf (archer), Sorceress and Wizard. Each class has their own abilities and as you complete quests and gain levels you are rewarded skill points to customize your class. As in all good dungeon crawlers, there's no shortage of loot. Chests are scattered throughout each dungeon and enemies drop loot as well. When you finish the dungeon you are presented with a list of items you've picked up. All the information is question-marked out and you have to decide if you want to pay to have it appraised or just sell it. The item's description indicates what type the item is, which classes can use it as well as the quality of the item (S,A,B,C,D,E) and any level requirements. The information that is question-marked out is the damage, durability, name and any stat increases or enchantments it provides. You can only equip a certain number of items and spells (this can be increased by spending skill points), but when you get further in the game you can have multiple \"packs\" that have different equipment configurations that you can swap out at certain points in each dungeon. Money comes generously and I've never been strapped for gold.The story takes place in the form of quests. There is the primary story that exists throughout the game and then there are little side stories for the side quests. There isn't MUCH story taking place in the actual dungeons but occasionally you'll walk into a room and there will be a picture of an NPC and some story will unfold. However, most of it takes place either in dialogue in the various areas of the village or in the written requests you pick up from the guild hall. The side quests are cool because not only do you gain skill points, exp and gold for completing them, but you unlock a painting that is themed with the quest you completed and has a paragraph or two of flavor text that accompanies it. These are stored in your gallery for future viewing. I like this because it breaths more life into the world. Overall, the story is interesting and balanced well. You're not going to feel like you've been abandoned because you haven't been updated in hours and you won't feel like you're playing an interactive movie. You know what's going on in the world and what your role is.The skill system is really successful as well. It's not a tree like in the Diablo series. You have two wheels of cards that represent abilities and stat increases. One wheel is class specific, one is general and identical for all classes. Each card has a level requirement and costs a set amount of points. You can select the one you like as long as you meet the lvl requirements and have the points. Each card has a certain number of levels (i.e. Wood Golem 0/7 levels) and you can continue upgrading them (again as long as you meet the level requirements and have the points) if you wish or just unlock the first level and move on. With 1 point earned for each level and up to several points awarded for quest completions, character building happens fast. The wheel system, I feel, gives you more freedom to tailor your character to what you feel you need without being forced to spend your points on things you don't want to get abilities you need or level abilities higher than you would like. Every stat increase and ability I possess I have because I felt I needed it and wanted to spend my points on it.The dungeons are interesting and varied. The atmosphere is great. It's typical side scrolling where you will progress forward, be assaulted by several enemies, move forward, repeat several times, fight a boss, finish. The touch screen of the Vita is used well as there are false walls and treasures hidden throughout. There are secret rooms and side rooms that may contain chests or items to satisfy quests. It's not just hold the analog stick to the right and mash the X button. Paying attention is rewarding. Throughout the dungeons you will find piles of bones which can be resurrected in the village for a price. Once resurrected, you can add them to your party in the pub. These NPCs come pre-equipped (you can't change anything) and will be one of the standard classes. They allow you to build a party before you unlock multiplayer and once you have unlocked multiplayer, they allow you to fill in the gaps. This is a multiplayer game and you will find it difficult if you try to do the dungeons without party members. The NPCs are pretty intelligent and it's rare that I find myself cursing at them for doing something stupid. You also have an armory that holds your items you haven't equipped. Your armory is available to all of the classes you created so if you found an awesome S-quality bow while playing your wizard, just hold on to it and your archer can grab it the next time you play her.There are also attack mounts you will find in some of the dungeons. So far I've seen a sabre-tooth panther and a raptor. They are found either in a cage or they attack you and must be subdued before you can ride them. They work the same as other games in the genre. You just hop on with the triangle button and then you button mash. The sabre-tooth panther is melee and the raptor breathes fire.Once you reach a certain point in the game (probably about 5-7 hours in) you will be allowed to go online. Each dungeon will also unlock a second path to a new, more difficult, boss encounter. Multiplayer is handled locally and through the PSN. It is drop in drop out and either random or friend based. You can adjust the settings in the Pub when you assemble your party. You have 3 slots for party members, You can slot in the NPCs you have recruited, then you can select Join On or Join Off for each slot. If Join On is selected when you're in the dungeon, a real life player may enter your game and replace the NPC that was in that slot with their character. If they leave, an NPC will pop back in after a few minutes. If Join Off is selected, that slot cannot be joined. It doesn't appear that you can communicate with random players that join your game. I've only done this a couple times though so maybe I'm missing something. This isn't necessarily a bad thing since there isn't a lot of strategy to be discussed and it also eliminates the chance encounters with people who don't know how to conduct themselves in random multiplayer games. Either way it works very well. If you want to join a friend's game, you can select the option and a list will populate with your online friends.Overall this game exceeded my expectations in every way. It captures the nostalgia of the classic side-scrolling beat-em-ups while adding enough complexity and story to make it a full-fledged RPG dungeon crawler, not just an arcade experience. The classes are varied and each one is unique from the rest. The story is great and paced well throughout the game. The leveling is not a chore but works well with, and is a bi-product of, playing the game. Multiplayer is fun and simple. Dungeons are varied, each having its own style and unique enemies, and are not too long/not too short. All the customization of skills and equipment is handled simply and effectively. This game has a lot of opportunity for expansion down the road so I imagine I'll be putting a lot of miles into it. This game just does everything it set out to do, and does it phenomenally. It took what it needed from a couple genres and made a simple yet perfect experience. Get it!For those debating the PS3 or Vita; I think this game works best on the Vita. Save yourself $10 and go portable. I don't think there is any loss of graphical quality and the touch screen provides a distinct advantage over the PS3 controls. Having the same experience on a portable platform is much more desirable in my opinion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2013"}

I grew up slamming the single red button on my Atari 2600 joystick and winning free ships in games that rewarded fast reflexes. This means I'm not too good at doing complex button combos (that means YOU, Heavenly Sword) and I don't have much patience for configuring a racecar with 500 separate components (sorry, Gran Turismo).Burnout Paradise is, at its heart, an arcade racer. People like me can get started and slam through a few races without much hassle. If you are looking for a Totally Realistic Race Car Simulation, this isn't it.  As for me, I like how it's possible to play without having to earn licenses or pass skill tests.  All too often, driving games force players to go through a lengthy training period and wade through screen after screen of configuration options. I just wanna drive like a maniac, man!Additional thoughts:*Great graphics--Paradise City contains lots of areas to explore, all in stunning physical settings.*Online play is fully featured and well-designed, with lots of different challenges and activities for both individual and group play.*Fans of the two previous games in the Burnout series will miss the awesome (and awesomely fun) destruction of Crash Mode.*Something that is frustrating at the beginning is that it is incredibly easy to get lost. When you're in the middle of a race, especially on a big TV, it is impossible to drive and watch the radar/map display at the same time.*Something that is frustrating throughout the game is that the race finish lines are often in the middle of nowhere. That means a lengthy drive to get back to the start of a race. This becomes really tiresome when you're close to finishing the game and need to win just one or two more races.*The narrator's voice, attitude, and script is incredibly annoying. I wish there was a way to shut him up entirely.*What pushes Burnout Paradise from a four-star to a five-star game is the incredible amount of FREE updates Criterion has made available. If only more game studios and publishers realized that giving some decent content away makes players more likely to pony up for the paid stuff! Thank you, Criterion, for continually updating the game and for not nickeling-and-diming your customers to death.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2009"}

Like Grand Theft Auto, the biggest change you will see in this installment is that it takes place in an \"open world.\" What this means is that you are no longer limited to a specific track or route while racing. You can do whatever you want and travel wherever you want. While this seems like a great idea in theory and works great in a game like Grand Theft Auto, it's not such a good idea in Burnout. The main reason is that I found myself getting lost a lot. The game needs much better indicators of where the track is. A lot of you may say this isn't realistic, but when I am this frustrated, I don't mind a huge yellow arrow on the screen telling me I'm going the wrong way.One of the great things about the open world however, is that the city looks great. You won't find yourself passing the same repeated textures and landscapes like many other racing games use. The city is actually mapped out, with different buildings and scenery depending on where you are. The cars handle very well once you get used to the controls. Visually, the HD graphics are superb and the car models look better than anything I've seen yet from the PS3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2008"}

{"product_name":"B006VB2UO6","description":"","reviewerName":"D.L. \"generasian\"","summary":"I played this game last year...","reviewText":"Me purchasing an annual sports title from EA is about as certain as death and taxes. Regardless of how much I swear off buying future releases due to the flaming pile of disappointment I feel from the current entry, I just can't seem to help it.  I need my gaming and sports fix.When it comes to NCAA football, I don't care much about the bells and whistles that are added to each incarnation so that the developers can claim that they're being innovative.  Just give me good gameplay dammit!  And as I played my first dynasty game, I couldn't help but feel deflated by halftime.  Everything had an almost familiar feel to it-as if I'd never traded in my copy of NCAA 12 and it had magically reappeared in my Xbox360 disc drive.  Granted, they've added better tackling and DB/WR animations, but boy oh boy, it just feels too much the same as the previous title.  The lone bright spot is the revamped passing mechanic, which gives you total control of the trajectory and the angle of your passes.  It took me a little bit to get used to only because I was so used to the same outdated mechanic for years, but it's satisfying to thread a pass between two defenders and know it's totally because of you and not some predermined programming logic.I have dabbled in the Heisman challenge option which allows you to relive one of a dozen or so past trophy winners from their first game of their greatest college season to their last.  Along the way, you can attempt to mirror or exceed their statistics for that year.  This is good in concept but poor in execution.  For instance, I chose Andre Ware and instead of allowing you the option to play the entire game, you are limited to only when the player is on the field.  This is fine, but give us the option to play the whole game otherwise I'm simming half the time.  Also, there is no dynamic commentary.  They don't give us for example, any background information of the player or the particular game whether it's trivia or statiscs.  Instead, it's the same wooden commentary you can hear in the exhibition or dynasty games.  Also, the players are way overpowered.  There's no way from what I can see that allows you to change the difficulty settings so if you're Barry Sanders, prepare to run as if you're playing Tecmo Bowl, scoring touchdowns or running twenty or more yard runs on almost every play.  I did enjoy the interview videos with each Heisman winner that you could unlock after progressing through the season. You get insights on the mindset of each past winner and little tidbits like rivalries and funny stories.So after playing a dozen or so games just to see if my opinion could be swayed, I instead came away more and more depressed.  Playing NCAA used to be a great way to kill a couple of hours for a football fanatic as me, but instead this year's title feels pretty arbitrary and lifeless.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00012TIW8","reviewerName":"OmnilimbO","summary":"Most Innovative Game Ever","reviewText":"Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is the second game in a series of three (to date).  It is available for XBOX, Play Station 2, PC, Game Cube and Game Boy Advance.  This review is in reference to the Xbox version.The game is set in 2006: a corrupt guerilla militia attacked the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta.  They now occupy the building and have taken dozens of hostages.  This is where you come in, but not to save the hostages. There are top secret documents located somewhere within the embassy: you must find and destroy them before the terrorists have a chance to get hold of them.Building on the enormous success of the original Splinter Cell game, Pandora Tomorrow once again pushes the boundaries beyond expectations.  All areas of the game - the lighting & shadowing, animation, physics and sound design have been boosted to create an even more enveloping environment to play in.  The single player game is nothing short of fantastic: it boasts a set of new hi-tech gadgets for you to play with as well as new moves to help you evade and engage your enemies.However, the truly groundbreaking aspect of Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is the Multiplayer mode.  The only game of its kind, the Splinter Cell's multiplayer mode pits two on two in a very unique way; two stealthy, agile spies with third person perspective against two armed & deadly mercenaries in first person view.  You wouldn't think it would work as well as it does, but it's perhaps the most well balanced multiplayer game ever made. Mercenaries may have lethal weapons, but spies are faster, can climb, hang and break your neck.  Spies can move more quickly through the shadows, but mercenaries have an available motion tracking vision.  Mercenaries have motion tracking but spies have hidden routs to travel unseen, etc. etc. etc. - it is this type of counteractive system that is applied to every facet of the MP experience. It's extremely addictive and even more fun than it sounds.  A wide variety of maps are available to choose from, all of which are incredibly well designed.  Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is not a revamp of the original, but is an original itself.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2006"}

In short, just filling in the Enemies list, one by one, is entertaining enough, but these games have much, much more than that.

The real uniqueness to this is the soul absorbing system.  By doing this Soma gets over 100 new abilities that he can customize for the situation.

It is still a fun game.Story: Set 3 years before the events of the N64 game, the story is set in 2020, and Joanna Dark (AKA Perfect Dark) is a bounty hunter working with her father Jack and her friend Chandra. The group is given a job to rescue a scientist from a Triad crime lord. The scientist is killed before the rescue but he uses a brain device to implant all of his research into Jack's mind. Jack then gets captured by a mega corporation named dataDyne and you seek out to free him. The story continues with a double-cross and another agency that wants to take down dataDyne.Gameplay: First-person Shooter with some stealth. You traverse multiple levels using stealth, combat, and gadgets to accomplish your objectives. Some of the weapons include a pistol, sniper rifle, rocket launcher, rifle, plasma rifle, grenades, etc. You have 4 slots for weapons but some of the larger weapons take up multiple slots. Also, the more weight you carry, the slower you move. When using gadgets, it often takes you into a mini-game to complete in order to pass the objective.Multiplayer: You can play a split-screen campaign with a friend. Some levels are altered to include both players to reach objectives, such as opening doors. If one of you dies, the other player must locate and revive you. In some levels, the 2nd player takes an AI controlled character and may start far away from you. Aside from split-screen campaign, there is also a Combat Arena. I haven't played this much but it's a typical death match mode shooter with different options like capture the flag, defend a location, etc. You can play up to 32 players but I don't know if this is still supported today.Conclusion: the missions are fun and challenging. The controls are easily executed. There are 4 difficulties such you can try and beat it on Dark Agent after defeating Perfect Agent. Worth picking up. A solid 4-star game for the Xbox 360.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004L4G8UC","description":"","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"A great and surprising launch title","reviewText":"Well now, this one was a surprise to me.  When I first heard that a Ghost Recon game would be gracing the 3DS launch, I rolled my eyes and kept scouring the release day list in hopes of finding something, anything worth picking up day one.  Then, I stumbled upon some write-ups of Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars, proclaiming it to be the best bet on day one...which shocked me.  That's when I realized that Shadow Wars wasn't your typical Ghost Recon, first person tactical shooter.  Instead, it was a turn-based tactical game, spearheaded by Julian Gollop who fellow gaming geeks might remember as the lead designer of X-COM.  This news intrigued me and was the main decision to add it to my shopping cart on release.Shadow Wars will remind Nintendo gamers of Advance Wars and Fire Emblem.  It will remind older games of a modern day, high tech/smaller focused Shining Force.  There's some story here about Russian dictators but I'll be honest, the story isn't why you're playing and I felt got in the way, more than it helped.  So I won't really go into it.  The point is: there's bad guys, and you have to kill them.  Instead, the gameplay is where you should focus your attention.  You control a small group (up to six, depending on the mission) of Ghosts, each of whom have specific skills.  The team consists of a Commando (assault rifle/missile launcher), Sniper, Gunner (automatic weapon; think mini-gun), Medic, Recon (camouflaged) and Engineer (deployable turrets).  As you complete missions, you receive stars that you can assign to your individual teammates to level them up.  For example, giving a character one star normally gives them more hit points, while further upgrades might provide new equipment or abilities.  One thing that surprised me given the fact this is a release day game was just how diverse the missions were.  It seems as if the developers were really trying to add wrinkles to the missions so that each section isn't just killing all of the enemies on the field.  Missions will also change their focus, once you finish certain tasks.  For example, in one mission, you start out trying to reach a possible ally before the opposing forces kill her, but once you reach her, you end up forging a small alliance to help free her imprisoned friends.  Others will have you trying to evade the enemies as a medic, holding up in a house until support arrives, blowing up an airplane and then fleeing.  I appreciated this level design, as it gives you bread crumbs to follow but also switches things up in ways that affect the gameplay.Gameplay will be very familiar to fans of turn-based strategy games like Advance Wars or Shining Force.  Each character can move a certain number of spaces on a map and attack/perform an action.  The turns involve you moving and performing actions and then it's the enemies' turn to do the same thing.  Weapons have specific ranges and provide abilities, so part of the strategy is maneuvering your characters into range, but keeping them out of the enemies' range.  As an example, automatic weapons have an ability to counter-attack.  So if an enemy moves into range to attack someone, but doing so puts them in range of one (or more) Ghosts who have automatic weapons, then when the enemy attacks, they will be fired upon by any Ghost who is also in range and has an automatic weapon.  Conversely, this applies to you, as well.  Cover and elevation also play into the calculation.  Hiding in houses provides bonuses to characters, reducing the damage they take.  Trees, cars and other objects provide cover, as well.  This is counter-balanced by elevation; if you are overlooking the enemy, you receive bonuses for shooting at them and they have negatives for shooting at you (or vice versa, if the positions are changed).  As you progress through Shadow Wars, the game adds wrinkles and teaches you the little ins-and-outs.  It's a nice tutorial that helps ease you into the game so that if you are new to the genre you won't feel overwhelmed.Graphically, the game looks okay.  I don't really see anything that makes it look like anything other than a DS game.  Honestly, take out the 3D and the game would fit perfectly on the DS, from a graphics perspective.  That said, the 3D adds nice depth to the game.  Communications, objectives and other notifications pop above the action; meanwhile, trees, buildings, ravines, etc. all stick out from the ground, adding depth.  It's not as noticeable as some uses of 3D (i.e. nothing really flies at you or pops up), but the subtle effect really adds to the overall feel of the game.  It works really well and not once did I feel the strain of staring at it.Ultimately, Shadow Wars is a fantastic launch title.  It's probably the best title available right now with a very lengthy main campaign, some skirmishes and some light multiplayer options.  Shadow Wars is surprisingly awesome.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2011"}

Ironically, the improved graphics lead to two types of experiences - 1) the wow factor - when the graphics and scene really work - such as foliage in jungle, lighting and shadows in many scenes, depth of underwater scenes, overall improvements in many scenes...2) the disappointment factor - when the improved graphics make it really look cartoonish - such as many of the burned out cars, some building collapse scenes, and others...so it's a mixed bag, but overall, l still a cut above the 360 version without question...Audio - I think the audio is improved too - but, it might be console specific - the X1 having a digital out that I can specifically set DTS settings on, whereas the digital out on 360, didn't give me any choices (tho I did have the general audio settings set at 5.1)...Online play - markedly improved over the 360 version - I don't know if it was timing, or an update or what...but many of my complaints on 360 online play are resolved, such as weapon glitches, respawn, and others...Overall - I think this is a great addition to the COD story line - I really enjoyed the story line, using new equipment, and I really thought the underwater missions - and even the outer space missions - were very cool...in addition, I think the improved graphics over the 360 version make this a must buy for any X1 owner...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2013"}

The graphics are top-notch for an early PS3 title and the controls are intuitive. Since this is an \"Indiana Jones\"-esque title, there are, of course, puzzles and traps. The health meter is also inventive in that you don't have one, the screen slowly fades to black and white as you take damage. Many of the trophies are easily obtained since the majority are acquired through weapon usage and finding treasures. Now for the bad stuff. In the beginning, the difficulty is balanced. At about halfway through the game, it jumps when the enemies have unlimited ammo and the ability to cause head shots from very far away. This can be a problem when you are being swarmed. Also, many of the later puzzles can become needlessly difficult due to the camera, but once you figure them out you can easily finish them.

I eagerly picked it up on the first day of release and jumped right into it. As everyone will find out pretty quick it's relatively easy to play. There is a lot of depth to this game and you will find many ways to customize the car of your choice. The early skill level events of the game are usually easy to get first place in even if you have decided not to tune your car. Soon you will find yourself repeating the same 5-10 tracks over and over in an attempt to build up credits to buy new cars and new mods. While this does start to get monotonous it's fun to learn every area of each track to really hone your skills. Also you're going to need that kind of experience on each track as the level of competition and number of laps increases through the intermediate level to the advanced level. Eventually you will open up the endurance events, which in my opinion are the most fun and challenging events in the game.Pros:+Classic Gran Turismo controls and game play+Many cars and tracks+Pretty good music library+Responsive controls with standard and wheel controllersCons:-Shading and rendering of many vehicles looks unfinished-Tons of menu screens and loading times-Vehicle damage was hyped, but didn't deliver!-Grinding tracks 100+ times for creditsOverall this is a very fun game and excellent value for fans of the previous Gran Turismo titles or anyone willing to spend hours and hours playing a racing game. There are some glaring flaws in the visuals that you would have hoped that 5+ years of development would have fixed. With that being said I really enjoyed playing this game from the first race I completed in my 75 HP car all the way up until I stopped playing with 98% completion. Order today!EDIT 18 Sep 11So, its been several months since I have touched this game. After watching a few episodes of Top Gear I really missed playing GT5 so I thought I would give it another go around. Whats the first thing I see? I need to install the last 7 updates that I have missed since I stopped playing...BLAH! After the updates are finally finshed I start looking around at some of the new features and I gotta say, WOW! Buying/installing/uninstalling parts and tires can now be done on almost any menu screen. This may not seem like a big improvement to some, but for those of us that have spent numerous hours playing the game and have been frustrated having to back out of menus to fix the smallest details its completely awesome! Another improvement is to the placing/prize system for seasonal events. Before when you finished first place you would get the prize money, but if you raced and finished first on that same track again you would get nothing. Now instead of having to resort to grinding an A Spec track, for a weak $90,000 to save up to buy that new car you want just hop on your favorite seasonal event and grind it for sometimes up $400,000+ a race.Im really enjoying playing GT5 again.

I was never a huge Assassin's Creed fan before but I did think Assassin's Creed III was pretty decent. This game really takes it to a whole new level.Black Flag refers to a pirate flag and the entire game is pirate themed. It takes place in the Caribbean and there is, what seems like, never ending areas to explore. You start off on land missions that can be things like save fellow pirates or assassination contracts. There are rewards for each mission. You can use the money to purchase upgrades for Edward like better swords or pistols or even different outfits. You can also use money to throw down as a distraction because the crowd will go crazy chasing the money. Or you can use money to hire drunken pirates as back up or to hire female dancers to distract the guards.You will quickly earn your own boat that is called the Jackdaw. Once you have your own boat you can take to the seas any time you want or return to land whenever you want. There is a huge area that you are free to explore however and whenever you want. I love games like this that give you the freedom to make all the decisions on your own.Just like the land missions there are a huge number or naval missions too. The missions vary widely from attacking a convoy of ships to destroying a heavily armed fortress. Some of the missions will begin on the sea and will continue on land or vice versa. For example one of my last missions was to destroy a fortress and then it took me on land where I had to assassinate the officers and their leader. Once complete the fortress was converted to a new base of my own.You have the freedom to do missions in pretty much any order that you wish with a few exceptions. Some of them require something that you don't have access to until later in the game so you will have to wait on those types of missions. Some of the rewards are the same way and you can't get them until later in the game. There are plenty of ways to get rewards though from attacking other ships and stealing their cargo. You can even board the ship once you have disabled it. You can also find cargo or even stranded pirates floating in the middle of the ocean from ship wrecks or previous battles.It's almost like a pirate version of grand theft auto in a way because it's fun to just sail around and get into trouble attacking other ships. When you attack another ship their allies will often come to the rescue. Depending on what other ships are nearby nobody may come after you or you might have a swarm of ships come down on you all at once. You earn a wanted level after a while that will make other ships more likely to come after you. There are harbors that you can visit and pay a bribe and the wanted level will be reset. There are a variety of different ships from a small gun boat that can easily be sunk in a shot of two to a huge Man O' War which is a huge and extremely powerful ship that you had better be very prepared to attack. This ship can have up to 124 cannons and also has a barrage of mortar fire that they will launch at you. You will quickly learn to stay out of its way if you value your life.As you earn more and more money you can upgrade your defensive armor and your offensive weapons like which include various type and strengths of cannons. There are also fire barrels that you drop behind your boat and mortar shells that you can launch and hit your target from far away. You can even upgrade your ship's ram strength so you can charge and ram another boat and cause massive damage.I could go on and on for hours about all the aspects of the game but I think it's sufficient to say that the war system is complex and very challenging. Whether you are doing missions or simply exploring and trying to get into some trouble it's just a whole lot of fun.There is a side section of this game where you can hunt for land animals and harpoon sea life. You use skins and bones of various animals for crafting special items or you can sell excess inventory.I have been playing for about 3 weeks now and I am only at 18% completion so there is a lot of quality gameplay time in this game. Not to mention that there is an entire separate section to this game which is online multiplayer which has different modes and you can play co-op with your friends. Most of my time is spent playing offline but this style of play is fun as well. I will probably explore it much more once I complete the offline game mode.Finally I will mention that all aspects of this game are really awesome including the sound effects and the quality of the graphics and level of detail. The world really seems to come to life as well with a wide variety of weather from light rain, fog and thunderstorms with thunder and lightning and the whole nine yards. There are occasional waterspouts that you will run into and some really intimidating waves that can get huge. There is even the occasional tsunami that can sink your ship in a heartbeat. Everything comes together perfectly in this game to make an incredible game overall.  I would highly recommend this awesome game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2013"}

Turns out the meeting was with a group of Templars and thus throwing Edward into a world of Assassins, Templars, First civ stuff and so on. However, if you're expecting Edward to just become an assassin right away you're mistaken. Actually he isn't an assassin at all, even though he has all the skills of one. You're pretty much playing a character who is technically on the outside. His actions caused harm to a lot of people including the assassins and just wants to make amends. Kenway spends much of the game living as a pirate and therefore the game focuses heavily on pirate tasks, like robbing ships, looting booty, and so forth. This game is essentially a pirate game through and through. It feels more like adding the assassins were just a nod to the AC series more than it being an actual continuation of the story and order.Once again the series tries to follow the same formula of \"Protag must find X item that belonged to First Civ before the Templars do.\" and honestly that formula is beyond tired. Seriously, how many items and pieces of eden et al did these people leave behind? However, despite that, the game was very good and exciting and I enjoyed Kenway and even the story. My issue with the story however, is that it is extremely short, so short to the point where when I returned to the Animus after being forced out i was expecting to continue the story only to find that it was the freaking ending. The only reason why the game is long is if you focus on ship upgrades, making money using the fleet management system which works in real time, or if you are a completionist. Mind you, I enjoyed upgrading my ship et al but it seems to me as though these side missions are considered a part of the story as well and because of that the actual story is short.  We see Kenway's journey and how the Creed changed him but right at that moment the story is cut short. I understand that Kenway's story as an assassin is covered in a  novel, but I don't want to buy a freaking novel just to finish up a protagonist's storyline. It should be in the freaking game I'm paying for. That was a huge disappointment. The ending was bittersweet and yes it connects to AC3 but it felt lacking to me and I guess that has to do with me not reading up on Kenway's story in the novel et al which is stupid.Also the ending felt so disjointed because you're thrown out the Animus for a \"let's wrap up the present time story\" cut scene then when you return to the Animus to continue the story (after finding out that Kenway needed to go after another guy) the story freaking ends! Honestly, I've reached a point of not giving two craps about Juno, first Civ, or anything involving the present day events. It's so obvious by now that the Animus is just a gimmick, a good premise gone downhill with shoddy and halfa**ed execution.I'm tired of these silly reasons why someone needs to be put into the animus. I just want the animus to go away. No, hacking stupid computers is not fun. I honestly believe that the series would have been much better if they simply showed the historical storyline all the way through without any mention of an animus or showing present day crap, then at the end of the series (if there is one) let us in on that. Anything would have been better then this disjointed present day/historical storyline. I feel that the present day story is interfering at this point.  Before I wanted Desmond and his crew to fix the order, for him to use everything he learned from Altair and Ezio and fight Abstergo. But that fell flat. So I wish they would just get rid of it. I honestly have no faith that Ubisoft will deliver on that front. I bet that the next game will give us yet another reason why Juno can't escape the internet (or where ever the heck she is) and we will be given another pointless present day protag and now with the possibilities of looking into dna that isn't even your own will give us even more faceless, nameless present day protags.I know it sounds like I hate the series, I don't, I love it, but I have to admit that certain elements are very disappointing to me. Overall, I think that Black Flag redeemed AC3, it is a fun game to play and all the characters in the historical storyline are very moving and I was sad to see it end. The song \"Parting Glass\" by Anne Bonny truly captured my feelings and it was very tearful. But the game didn't redeem the series in a massive way for me because I cringe just thinking of their stupid present day \"storyline\".  If I focus solely on the past story then I would say the game did a great job even if the story was cut short. I do look forward to the next installment but I'm no longer the fan who would buy the games at release.A star was taken away due to AC's present day storyline and its interference with the historical one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2014"}

Claw your way up through the amateur ranks to prove yourself in the professional world of skateboarding.","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"This one will be hard to top","reviewText":"On the surface, THPS4 seems like a perfect sequel to a series widely regarded by skaters and non-skaters alike as one of the best in all of gaming. There's a huge slew of changes to the formula that aren't really evolutions in the vein of the revert and manual, but slight touch-ups on a formula that nears perfection. No longer do you have to repeat the same goals with all skaters: completing a goal with one pro completes it with all. Meanwhile, pro challenges, which are goals specific to each skater, will ensure you take all the skaters for a spin. Add in the elimination of the dreaded clock, an improved create-a-skater mode, and one of the best soundtracks in recent history, and this game seems like a sure bet, right? Well, yes, but it's not as great as all the hype and praise may lead you to believe. The biggest problem with Tony 4 is that the career mode, with 190 goals, is a great evolutionary step in the way of Aggressive Inline, but many of the goals have little to nothing to do with what made the series great to begin with. While the other 3 Hawks were more or less action games, this one seems more like a &quot;sit back, explore, chill&quot; kind of thing. It's still a good game, but I went in expecting a continuation of the series, and found instead a title that seems almost like a different one all together. One more thing of note is the intro of the spine transfer: there's no real use for it, and it seems like the move was thrown in along the &quot;we have to have a new move in this sequel, too&quot; line of thinking. Since this game is multiplatform, the differences should be discussed: While XBox does have cleaner graphics and custom soundtracks, the PS2 features tighter control and online play. It's up to you to decide which of these features is most important. No matter what version of the game you opt to buy, THPS 4 is a worthy sequel to a series that has stood the test of time. It just happens to be a lot different from the other entries.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2003"}

If there's one big flaw in how this game is laid out, it's that it's not as geared for kids as it is for adults who are serious gamers, whereas the original struck a perfect balance.  Like I wrote in my review of the original, an adult and a child could play Lego Star Wars (1) together without feeling like one was merely entertaining the other--whereas this one is practically a one player game for adults.Still it's a great Star Wars Game that would be hard to improve upon with a non-legos version.  And I'd put it up there with Tomb Raider as a quality and challenging experience to play.The graphics and environments are far more sophisticated, but with that comes a few bugs.  For instance, in Free Play mode there are a couple of spots where you can get stuck because you can no longer do what they had designed the level to do, and therefore can't proceed without starting over--very frustrating.  I wouldn't mind pointing these out, but I don't want to ruin those levels by telling what happens or how you should be able to get through them.  It's possible to not run into these bugs, but if you do just try to avoid them the next time round.  However, my wife did run into one bug after an hour of playing one special round--which you have to complete all levels in the episode to do--that there was no getting past, and that was unacceptable.I should really take a star away for these technical glitches, but I wont.Using your saved data from the prior version is awesome.  I like that you don't have to be a super player just to enjoy the game as a result of this.There aren't as many fun, silly extras as there are in the original, and that's a bit of a loss.BOTTOM LINE: I give this game five stars all around on it's own, but in comparison to the original I would take away one or two because much of what made the orginal funny and fun is missing in Lego Star Wars II.  This version is more oriented to the serious gamer, who really couldn't care less if the characters were Legos or not, whereas the original was a great game, funny, and just plain cute.I highly recommend Lego Star Wars II, but not without playing the original first for both fun and technical reasons.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2007"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

GTA IV was ok.  Crackdown and Saints Row had their moments.  Infamous is in another league.  The graphics are fantastic, considering it's an open-world, seemless game.  The plot is cool and easy to understand.  The \"motion comics\" cut scenes are a nice touch that gives this game a real super hero vibe.  Most importantly, the controls work very well and are intuitive.  It's just fun to play.I like how you can spend your XP on power upgrades (e.g. energy grenades, healing, low damage, etc.).  The quests are relatively short and entertaining.  They can seem a little repetitive (go turn on the power in this sewer, now go turn on the power in that sewer, repeat), but the fact that they are short allows you to get to something new in no time.I was sitting on the fence regarding whether or not to buy this game, but I'm glad I pulled the trigger and got it.

Might just be a bug or two in the engine somewhere that needs to be fixed, but still, if I can't run it full blast with this machine, what will the average user with a 2-year old computer be forced to run it at?Gameplay:Looking back at it, I would have to agree that the level layouts were repetitive but I honostly didn't notice it when I was playing.  The main thing this game has going for it is the absolutely fantastic A.I.  The enemies in this game are the best I've ever seen, not like \"aim-bots\" in terms of accuracy but in terms of how they move, work together, take cover, anticipate your movements and communicate.  By comparison, Halo 1 was super-repetitive not only because of the map but because the fights with bad guys just got old after a while.  The A.I. was good but not fantastic.  In FEAR, the A.I. is fantastic and no two fights were identical or felt boring.  They were still surprising me even late in the game not by cheap tricks but just by being sneaky.I also found the level design to be much more immersive, on the whole, than HL2.  HL2 really annoyed me with artificial constrictions and stupid-obvious \"puzzles\" -- like oh, here's a ramp I need to jump, but it's not at the right angle, but oh, lucky for me there's just enough barrels around that I can prop it up with!  Stuff like that is just an annoying waste of time to me and I'm glad FEAR didn't have too much of it.  FEAR does direct you through a linear game but at least it feels more natural.Basically, HL2 and FEAR have comparable engine technology but FEAR is vastly superior in terms of level design and A.I.Replayability:Ah, you know, the achilles heel of the FPS genre, this game, like most, doesn't have much singleplayer replayability.  I advise playing it through the first time on a reasonably difficult setting because you're probably not going to want to play the whole thing over again.  It won't be much different the second time.  You could take it online but here's where I have to knock off 1 star on the overall rating: I can't get it to go online.

The answer was yes to both of those. The Playstation move having \"controllers\" seems to make it easier for the system to pick up movement (especially in low light situations), I have also noticed that I can play the move in a small play space than the Kinect, works fine at 7 feet or less.Another benefit of the Move is that the Playstation Eye is much much smaller than the Kinect which means you can put it on top of a tv without a cradle or easily fit it between consoles on your TV base.There are only a few drawbacks of the move that I can tell, the first is that the Move requires controllers that need charging and the PS Eye requires one of your systems USB ports. Its pretty necessary to buy an external charge base for your move controllers ($15). The other drawback of the move is the selection of games. It appears the move has quite a few games where you wouldn't really need the move function and I'm sure they're fun; however I bought the move for games that involve a little more activity, unfortunately I haven't found many games that offer a good fitness aspect to them (other than the included sports champions which has gladiator fights), EA Sports Active 2 doesn't support the move like it supports the kinect for Xbox... If a good fitness game comes out then I would say the move's game selection is would be more adequate. The final drawback to the move i the glowing orbs on the controllers...

Needless to say, my expectations were met and may be exceeded as I play more of it.  I'm sure that the graphics would be better on a decked out PC but I am very pleased with the presentation and environment of the game on PS3.  Just last night I was playing and had a moment of awe; I was walking through the wilderness at night when I realized that there were northern lights in the sky.  Then I came upon a huge waterfall pouring out of a mountain.  Very beautiful game, I can tell that there was A LOT of time put into making it.  The improved two hand combat system is very fun and gives several different choices of fighting styles.  Fighting the dragons in the game is epic and very difficult at first but once you figure out a good strategy, you can be a force to be reckoned with.  The only negative thing I have to say about this game...too much James Woods...lol.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002BSA1MQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Shallower than a Kiddie Pool","reviewText":"This game has some amazing graphics and gunplay, but it is seriously lacking in depth and story. The game is apparently a direct sequel to the first Crysis, and Crysis 2 doesn't make any attempt to recap what happened or anything about the world. All you know is that New York is under attack and you're there to fight against the aliens. I really couldn't make heads or tails of the story, but behind all of the BS and plot twists you're basically just going on a bunch of gopher missions in an attempt to power up the suit, which when it's full powered spontaneously kills all of the aliens in the city. In reality though, I didn't expect an amazing story from a FPS, and what really disappointed me was the depth of the gameplay. They created a unique system with the suit's powers, but the upgrade system was much too simplistic and annoying. There are I think 4 upgrade trees with only 3 upgrades, only one of which you can equip at a time. The cheap ones are essentially useless, and the others are so expensive that you can only buy them near the end of the game. I would have loved to see more of an RPG upgrade system where you choices actually mattered, and you could enhance the way you chose to play the game.As for the actual gameplay, my biggest problems were with the suit powers. I understand the concept of active camo, and why it would require more energy when moving fast, but I can't understand why it would immediately drain all of the power if you shoot a gun, even if it was silenced. I understand this was meant to minimize people overusing the camo, but I found it very annoying and it brought me out of the game. Worse than that, once your camo is gone you're incredibly vulnerable from enemy fire since you can't use your shield. So most of the time that I died it would be when switching between the powers. I also thought that the jumping and sprinting powers were way too weak, I don't see how they would drain so much power. I feel like they should have recalled the rechargeable battery the suit uses. When you think about it, the whole reason for wanting an awesome powered suit, is to feel overpowered. I wanted to feel like a badass, and hiding behind a wall waiting for the suit to recharge doesn't seem very bad ass.In the end, there is some amazing stuff in the game, and you should try it out if you can get it for a good price, just don't expect a mind blowing game changing experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2011"}

The game doesn't provide anything over the standard Mario-type-smashing-crates-and-collecting-fruit game, but is still fun, nonetheless, and provides a good amount of play time. Many of the levels are too challenging for younger players. There are some levels where the player &quot;dies&quot; by missing a jump, falling into water, and drowning.

The core system lacks a few items that the premium has but it's still an xbox 360.  The core system doesn't have the chrome color on the CD/DVD-rom tray, it's just the white color as the system.  Again, getting a core you would have to buy an additional hard drive that is a must-needed.  Core systems will only come with wired controllers, but it's not too bad.It is a fun system, with the new browser feature to access content, music, games, settings, etc.  I have great times with the system so far, there are some draw backs to it.  At times some games would freeze or the system would freeze after hours and hours of playing ( I guess it gets exhausted and hot?).  But it still plays pretty good and is something minor.The graphics are great and good to watch DVD's on especially if you have a widescreen tv because it will automatically adjust to your screen.

This is surprisingly well fleshed out.Graphics are surprisingly goo,d but you never really get to experience them. Once you get used to the military coding for units, you have to pull out the zoom so far you only see symbols, and never get to enjoy the unit polishingThe combat is wonderfully contrived, but plain and boring. You simply rack up to the level that you are at the maximum unit limit, then slowly creep toward the enemy. There's no real single unit tactics, and you have to overwhelm anything you encounter. This is the most logical presumption, but the recommendations are pointless, as even attacking the enemy's \"weak point\" still requires a boatload of troops to pull off.The campaigns are only 6 missions long. This is novel, but annoying, as mentions are made to cool new items, but you never get to find out what they are.Overall, this is a great \"big picture\" RTS. The only downside is that the enemy bases are so dug it, every mission is an attrition war situation, and you have to know whats coming next, as you could have to build a second army to survive a future surprise wave.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2013"}

Since his breakout in the 1980's, he has been the most popular characters to have ever made it onto the video game scene. While many games and their systems have all come and gone, the variety Nintendo has pulled off with this plumber has been absolutely amazing. That also has gone the same way with the Mario Party game series as well. It has really made the feelings of mini-games, and the use of interactive boards as a popular tool for all games alike, and the latest in the series makes that case ever more known than before.Mario Party 6, for the Nintendo Gamecube picks up a better game than it was earlier. This has a amazing amount of video games to try out, and play to your heart desires. There are also several great modes like the welcomed Party Mode, for fantastic multi-player action, and a solo mode that you can play to unlock fantastic games, and try games that you've never played before. The graphics are beautiful, and really live up to the game very nicely. There are so many kinds of games to play, like Odd Card Out, Catch You Letter, and other great games. The system also includes a microphone which is really only useful in 5 games in total. The controls are also really very easy to pick-up on with all the games, and a little bit of practice as well. Yet, it is not really worth it for just one player, so get a partner to join in on the party.Mario Party 6 is really one of the best Nintendo Gamecube games out there right now. This is purely a must have for all gamers alike. I really suggest this one if you are a gamecube owner.

I have also played many versions of Doom, Unreal, and Quake along with spending many nights online playing Quake 3:Arena on a dial up connection (GASP!).I was a PC gamer until a few years ago when I bought a PS3 mainly to use the Blu-Ray player (got a great deal), and found that I throughly enjoy the pretty solid platform where if they make a game for it, it basically works.  You don't have to read the box and see if you have enough RAM and a good enough video card and all the latest patches, and, and........and.OK, so this game.  I played the demo months ago and found it to be interesting, but nothing made me want to buy it.  I just got it for literally $5 and tried it last night.I feel that this game is a great homage to the 90s FPS and all of the crude and lewd stuff that was totally hilarious and somewhat surprising to us in a video game when we played Duke Nukem 3D felt a little (OK a lot) dated.  If this game had come out let's say about 5 years after DN 3D (7 years ago), of course it would have blown us all away, but now, I just can not see myself spending anymore time on it.  I got frustrated and stopped when I was using my \"DukeVision\" in the tunnels and ductwork of the casino.  I just couldn't figure out how to get anywhere and I could hardly see what I was doing (my TV is a 46\" 1080p that displays other games excellently).Bottom line for me.  I have been playing games like Dead Space 2, Rage, Black Ops, and Borderlands and I just can't see myself missing out on all of the new capabilities and graphics just so I can pee in a video game and hear some off-color jokes and references.I am by no means offended by that stuff in fact I welcome it, but the trade-off is just too major.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"Regulas","summary":"Not a bad RPG, but I'm disappointed.","reviewText":"This RPG is good but it is not a Baldur's Gate II or Final Fantasy XII both of which are better. Only 4 characters at a time, why? There is a cheat out for the PC that allow more and I think they crippled the PC version to make it equal the kiddie console versions. The overall character variations is not there like in Baldur's Gate. It is not as bad as NWN where you became the jack of all trades. Too bad they did not stay with D&D; rules but I guess they did not want to pay the licensing fee.If I had to classify this game I would say it seems to be a cross between Microsoft Dungeon Siege and Neverwinter Nights 2, more like Neverwinter Nights 2 with more movies. Game play can be really tough, even at the normal setting. The body trauma inflictions are a real pain to manage all the time too.Some quests are big and you end up destroying stuff (no drop option) because you can not carry it all. There is a nice camp site but there is no stash chest. So if you want to keep a nice item until a party member can equip it you have to carry it making your inventory even smaller. A real pain, not well thought out unless they plan on selling one later as DLC which would be real lame.The Codex system is crappy, when you pick an item up all it says is new codex and you have to go look it up. It should have at least told you about the item then you could use the codex to go back for reference if you wanted.I have played it is very stable on my XP gaming PC, not one crash with a Nvidia card, can't speak for ATI.One of the coolest aspects is the Artificial Intelligence (AI), you can finely detail each character's AI to do certain tasks given certain conditions such as have your healer automatically heal party members at any level you want, 90% damage to 10% and anywhere in between. There are so many different AI attack and defence choices you can spend allot of time thinking of how you want it. When a new character joins your party he/she already has a nice AI set-up in place so if your not into messing around with it you don't have to but I think your loosing allot if you don't.The character management system is easy to work with for the PC, not sure about the kiddie console versions. There were a couple things that threw me such as how to open the mixing screen and adding poison to a weapon and had to get online to figure it out. There are some drawbacks when buying goods that make you exit the seller re-equip and re-enter the seller again that can be annoying.Final thought, for a third person RPG of this type FF XII was the best so far. This one (DAO) tied in my book with NWN 2.Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale are in a class of their own.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2009"}

Christianson \"ABC\"","summary":"Heard It Was Better Than FFXIII","reviewText":"It has some good fighting controls and like that it takes you through cinematic events that make you push buttons to keep you on your toes and reward you sometimes, but there's a few things that bug me.1.  Too much story.  Story is all good, but this game has too much talking and not enough fighting to make a good balance.2.  Too many enemy encounters... although if you're quick enough you can run away from it.3.  Too much repetition... the time travel thing is cool but a lot of times you end up in the same land, just different time, which makes things a little boring at times.  Although the snow on your head at the temple stage looks kind of cool.4.  Too many monsters to build up.  You build up one all the way using a lot of your stuff then another one comes along that you want to build up, but all your stuff is gone by then.I do like the fact that you can purchase your weapons from a person, though from the same Chocobolina person, but she's a hell of a lot better than that digital floating screen thing in FFXIII.  Plus she adds some personality to it.  All in all it's an okay game.  Just too much storyline and walking around the same areas.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2013"}

The story is much more interesting than Final Fantasy 13. The battles are faster and fun. There are tons of stuff to explore before and after completion of the game. There are various of mini games. (Generally fun but some of the puzzles are frustrating) The graphic is top on the shelf... Beautiful and long cutscenes. It doesn't require you to waste time leveling up. You natually get the max level in the progress of story and exploring. However, since it's a more open world, a walk through or guide might be needed. It's a really good RPG that I have been looking for for a long time. The only thing that bug me would be the ending which I'm not going to spoil. I can bear with it because overall the game deliver a fun experience. You should really give it a try!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2012"}

I finished Star Ocean Till The End of Time in 228 hours, over a few months.  Overall, I would call this a classic, epic Japanese Role-Playing Game (JRPG), with a great story, great characters, and an amazingly large level of detail in things like item creation, size of dungeons, weapons/items/monsters... this game is big and deep in all areas.Although the theme is somewhat outer space sci-fi, there is a significant portion of the game played on primative worlds, and the use of swords, armor, magic, etc., like we are used to in many RPG's is the predominant theme here.  If you are a big fan of Final Fantasy games, you will feel pretty \"at home\" here.  The story, without giving it away, is ingenious and will have you thinking.I loved the characters.  You eventually fill out your party with 8 characters.  You can use 3 characters at a time in fights, and between fights you can freely change your order by substituting.  Of your 8 characters, 6 are fairly automatic, and you choose the last 2 permanent members from 4 alternates.  This is good, because it allowed me to avoid having the two characters I disliked most in my permanent party, and it allowed me to keep my favorite character, Nel, permanently.  The voice acting for the characters is among the best I have ever heard on an RPG.  In particular, Nel, Fayt, and Cliff are suberbly done.  The voice acting for Nel is the best I've ever heard in a game.  The 8 characters include \"tanks\", spell-users, thief types, etc.There are lots of dungeons, lots of dungeon levels, and lots of monsters.  You will do a lot of fighting in this game.  The battle system is good.  It is real-time battle, and you can alternate the view setting between an active, moving camera perspective and a solid, stationary battlefield (I preferred the latter).  Like many JRPG's, combat is deep in detail and complexity, and heavy with flashy magic flashes and animation, but without the blood and gore you find on more Western-style RPG's.  Although the characters are drawn anime-style, I got used to that quickly and it was not distracting.This game involved some grinding for levels and for treasure.  A lot of grinding, in fact.  I enjoyed it, but if that is not your thing, you might not enjoy it so much.  The leveling advancement is fun, but it is also necessary to be ready for later stages of the game.  Grinding is also necessary to acquire the gold needed for item creation.Item creation is a huge part of the game.  You recruit and \"sign\" inventors, then create your own items and weapons in workshops around the world.  I found the item creation in this game to be complex and time-intensive.  It is rewarding when successful, and it becomes necessary enough that you can't really avoid it.  It is a time sap, though.  It gets somewhat fun when you get the hang of it, but wow, I did spend some significant time in the workshops.  This aspect is probably most appealing to those who like deeper games and more complexity.  If you prefer to tear through a game as fast as possible, the item creation will drive you batty.  I had already bought the BradyGames Guide for this game, and through the item creation alone, I did so much page-flipping, I ended up wearing out the binding and putting the pages in a three-ring binder.  The guide is recommended, although I'm sure there are online guides available that will work too.  This is a complex, deep game.The graphics, cut-scenes, and music are all very good.  Again, the voice acting and characters are excellent.If you are a fan of JRPG's, this is an epic classic that is not to be missed.  I am very happy that I played it, it is one of my favorite games.  4.5 stars - a great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2013"}

Rhodes","summary":"You'll be playing Till the End of Time","reviewText":"Star Ocean is finally here, the game that we've been waiting for and an RPG that sparks a lot of interest in ways unimaginable.  Surprisingly enough, the game is fairly addictive with the themes of a good RPG right off the bat, a good story, loveable characters and a grand battle system.Star Ocean is a more science fiction like RPG.  To put it simple, if you like RPGs and Star Trek, I don't need to tell you to get this game, chances are you'll already have it.Star Ocean begins with Fayt, a boy staying at a hotel resort with his parents and childhood friend Sophia.  Everything is going nice and well until the resort is suddenly attacked by starships.  Fayt and company end up having to evacuate the resort but ultimately Fayt is separated from those he loves.  Now he is stranded on an unknown planet to fend for himself and find his friends.  It starts off nice and simple but as the game goes on the story developes more and becomes a bit more complex than it sounds.Star Ocean is a little different from the traditional RPG.  It eliminates random battles and instead you can see all the enemies running around on the field.  Each time you touch an enemy you initiate combat and this is where Star Ocean is the most interesting.  The other interesting tid-bit is that its all real time battle, and free roaming.  When in battle you can run around as one of three characters freely either dodging attacks or blocking them. This makes the game more fun than it actually sounds.In battle, each character has a \"Fury\" gauge.  When at 100% the character can attack swiftly without fail, and block certain attacks.  The more \"fury\" you have the more success you'll have in combat.  If your characters fury guage reaches 0 then they can't attack.  Luckily, the fury gauge fills up very fast when you stand still.  You're also not limited to just one character.  You can switch from one character to another any time you wish.Each character also gets \"Symbology\" which is Star Ocean's form of magic.  The magic is diverse in terms of how much there is and what they do (stun enemies, deal wide areas of damage etc.).  Some skills cost more than others but its an RPG I'm sure you knew this.Battles are fun but the game is a challenge.  Especially bosses which can be unforgiving at times.  It's easy to pick up the battle system, but it could take a moment to master.  Dungeons are also overly populated with enemies.  This wouldn't be so bad if the dungeons weren't so big, and if the number of items you could carry weren't so limited.Star Ocean also has an \"inventors\" system.  Each character, playable and non-playable, create inventions based on what they're best at.  Some characters are best at cooking and make several different foods.  Others are good at smithing and create useful weapons.  When an item is \"invented\" it becomes available to buy.  Some characters will create some pretty useless things but it makes the game bigger.Star Ocean also features a system in which the characters have a hidden attribute as to how much they like you.  Depending on the decisions you make will alter what the characters think of you and will also give you a different ending.The game looks beautiful.  Not quite as good looking as previous PS2 games before it, but those who liked the look and feel of Xenosaga will feel right at home.  The games graphics look a little anime style with the big eyes and the multitudes of hair.  The game is simply gorgeous.The game also sounds really good.  The voice acting is top-notch for a video game and the character voices go along quite well at times.  The overall music isn't bad but takes a while to get used to.  Not quite as deep as other games but it suits the situation just fine.The game has A LOT of dialogue and the cutscenes are long but luckily you can skim though most of it without having to listen to each character word for word.  If you read faster than the characters actually speak you might want to just turn off the talking all together.  You can also skip cutscenes, but at least the game isn't as drowned out in dialogue as several other games out there (Xenosaga anyone?).Star Ocean is a pretty good game overall.  It has a few small problems but as far as games go, it stand above many out there.  If you're an avid RPGer you might want to get this game and try it out.The Good+Beautiful Graphics+Voices are pretty well done+Battling is more interactive and fun+Good music+Good storyline+The game will keep you busy for a whileThe Bad-Dungeons are ridiculously huge-A lot of talking, making the story pace a little slow-Most of the gameplay is spent leveling up your characters as opposed to actually advancing the storyline","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00008QOL6","description":"When it comes to first-person shooters, there are two schools of thought. One harkens back to the originalDoom--frantic action, scary monsters, big weapons, and story is given short shrift. The second school is best exemplified byHalf-Life: strong narrative, consistent real-world weapons, consistent monsters, and settings.Doom'sheirs up until now have beenQuakeandSerious Sam, but nowPainkillercomes onto the scene leaving bloody footprints, and &#x85; let the carnage begin!You play a man who dies in a pathetic car crash (he's distracted because he's holding his girl's hand) and has spent a long time in purgatory. He thinks this is unfair because, despite being well-schooled in the art of killing, he maintains that he's done nothing wrong. Heaven makes a deal with him. Take care of a little invasion problem concerning Hell, and our hero can enter those pearly gates.Weak storyline aside,Painkillerbasically amounts to a brilliant series of arcade-style levels and challenges. The settings include darkened monasteries, graveyards, a horrifying asylum, a medieval town under siege, and even H-E-Double Hockey Sticks itself. The level design is brilliant, varied, and jam-packed with enemies. There seems to be no end to the amount and variety of cool monsters to fight, and they each explode into chunks of blood and gore in a most disturbingly satisfying manner. At the end of each level is a challenge, such as collecting a certain amount of gold or killing a Boss within a time limit. Winning the challenge gives you tarot cards you can use to make the game easier. The different cards bring haste, double-damage, invulnerability, and so on. This simple mechanic makes the game far more replayable than your average shooter.The graphics are first rate, which means you need a powerful PC to run the game with all the detail settings maxed out. The only other problem is a CD-copy protection bug that makes the game unplayable for some (a patch is available).Painkillermay seem a bit silly at first glance. But the gameplay mechanics, replayability (full multiplayer is also available), variety, and brilliant level design make it one of the finest and most satisfying shooters ever made. -Andrew S. BubPros:Superb gameplay and game balanceExcellent level designStrong replayabilityCons:Poor, unnecessary storylineHigh system requirementsProblematic copy protection","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Prety good","reviewText":"There's something that really excites me about senseless violence in videogames. Whether it's a sign of built up aggression in need of venting is debatable, but the fact remains that when a good run-and-gun shooter comes along you know you're in for a fun ride - provided you can stand the mindless violence, blood, and flying body parts. The storyline in Painkiller begins with a married couple dying in a traffic accident. Your wife is sent immediately to heaven, but you unfortunately stop in what's said to be between heaven and hell, a place where your actions decide whether you go up or down. The man himself knows of your skills in the arts of kicking butt, and through a messenger you're given the opportunity to be reunited with your wife. The catch is that you're going to have to kill four of Lucifer's generals. You see, Lucifer is well aware of the strategic importance the area between heaven and hell has, and he's preparing to attack. Armed with the painkiller weapon and fueled by the desire to see your wife you start the hunt. Throughout the story you meet a couple of allies, who in cut-scenes help you plan your next moves. The hordes of hell come in many shapes and forms, so you'll be fighting nasty grey monks armed with axes, spiky dog-like creatures, samurai, drunken fat people, and a whole lot more. The game consists of about four chapters, each with up to six levels. The chapters tend to have a certain theme, such as contemporary buildings, swamps, old stony buildings, and so on. It's interesting to note that no level specific textures are used in more than one level. The textures themselves are also for the most part very crisp and clear, with only a few exceptions. The level design itself is pretty decent too, although maybe not so much so at first. As you play the game you typically have to kill a number of enemies in one area of a level, a red waypoint is then placed somewhere. When you move over that waypoint the game auto-saves and your health is usually set to 100 if it's less than that, and then new monsters start attacking. I think this is neatly done, because this way you won't be facing areas of the map where it's impossible to get past without restarting the map and being more conservative with the health. Painkiller doesn't have a whole lot of weapons, but the ones that are there work very well. Every weapon has a main and an alternative firing mode, which is cool in itself, but you can often combine them for added mayhem. Painkiller is the name of your first weapon, where the main firing mode is a spinning blade that does extremely good damage in close-quarters. The secondary fire fires the top forward, which in itself can be useful, but you can also let it stick to a wall, creating a fairly damaging laser beam. And finally, by first using the main mode to make it spin, and then fire it forward it'll continue spinning as it travels forward. Beyond the painkiller you have a stake launcher, which works in some ways like a slow rail-gun, but it also has a tendency to fix your enemy to the wall, or ceiling (think spear-gun in Aliens vs Predator). Its secondary mode fires grenades, which is of course required in a game like. Next up is the shotgun, which is extremely efficient against certain larger monsters if you first use the secondary mode, which freezes the enemy, and then blast it to bits with the regular buckshot. Another more innovative weapon is one that shoots what appear to be ninja stars in the primary mode, and electrifies the enemy with the secondary. It's really fun to see how both firing modes in each of the weapons can be great against certain adversaries, and pretty bad against other. You will need to change weapons a lot in Painkiller, but that just adds to the fun in my opinion. But of course, the opposition you face in the levels culminates in the boss-fights. Like in Serious Sam, a game Painkiller is quite similar to, the bosses are no less than huge. The first encounters in particular are especially fun, because you start by seeing something huge coming at you in the distance, and you soon realize that what you're facing is many, many times taller than you. To defeat these you usually can't just shoot like a madman. Some bosses require you to shoot them at a specific spot, while others are resistant to all weapons except maybe just one. Also, the use of the Havok 2 physics engine brings the game to life. Every enemy has ragdoll properties, many of the game's objects can be moved, and the environment is to some extent dynamic. This plays an important part during the boss fights too, because some may for instance tear down a wall and throw huge rocks at you. Painkiller is certainly not the first game to use the Havok 2 engine, but it uses it so well that I can't begin to imagine how the game would've been without it. The audio is also nothing to scoff at. The musical score consists of what to me sounds like only one or possibly two heavy metal songs. They get you in the mood and all, and sound good at high volumes, but only about the first ten times you hear them. There are admittedly a few other pieces of background music, which fits fairly well with the theme the developers were trying to create in the level, but heavy metal is what you'll hear the most of. The sound effects are also quite well done, but I do wish some of the explosions for instance had more bass. Most of the voice overs are used during the game's somewhat long, but interesting cut-scenes. They're done well for the most part, leaving not a whole lot to be wanted. And as expected, all of this is encoded to support 5.1 (and even 6.1) surround - which never hurts. The guys behind Painkiller have said their main inspiration comes from games like Quake1 (Quakeworld in particular), Quake 3, and probably a few more. This is quite evident when playing the single player mode, but also in the multiplayer. Painkiller has the typical deathmatch modes you'd expect, but also a couple of new ones, such as one where you're only vulnerable when you're in the air, meaning you have to blow someone up, and then shoot them. Unfortunately no bots are included, so you'll be hard pressed to practice against only the computer in multiplayer. A decent number of maps are also included; both for 1 on 1, larger deathmatches, and of course for the more specialized modes. The netcode also seems to be good, so there shouldn't be much of a reason not to give it a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2004"}

Afro has set out to try and avenge his father's murder by a man named Justice. Justice murdered Afro's father to claim the 'Number One' headband, giving himself the chance to rule the worldAfro Samurai is based on the popular and stylistic anime of the same name.View larger.with powers akin to a god. The only one allowed to challenge Number One is the person with the 'Number Two' headband, but unfortunately for Afro, the current owner of the headband, anybody and everybody can, and does, challenge Number Two. But never fear, as this new title includes brand new material and background for fans of the series and newcomers alike to enjoy.Loads of Stylized ActionAfro Samurai brings gamers a balanced experienced, with stylistic combat and acrobatic platforming combined with the ability to dynamically slice and dismember enemies in unending ways. While gamers can hack and slash their way through many foes by combining heavy and light attacks with just two buttons, accomplished players will master moves like the Deep Throat Killer, where they pierce their opponent's neck and rip everything loose in a crimson splash.Players will also need to learn the Focus maneuver with its bullet-time effect. This allows the user to slow down time and designate a specific strike zone, which with the right timing and skill can allow Afro to cleave an enemy in two or slice a limb completely off. And since characters are not pre-rendered you don't just get a canned scene when you cut through your enemy, giving you endless ways and means to cut your enemies down to size. This ethos is applied game-wide, as Afro is allowed to interact with anything and everything in his environment to help him on his journey.Star-Studded Supporting CastSamuel L. Jackson reprises his role as both Afro and Ninja in the game, and the same striking art style that made the anime series so popular provides the unique look and feel across beautifully animated open environments. And for those of you who are wondering, developers Namco Bandai let Jackson ad-lib a lot, so be prepared for his branded vulgarity and the M rating it helps the game earn.Meanwhile, Ron Pearlman and Kelly Hu continue on in their roles as Justice and Okiku, while RZA of Wu-Tang Clan fame has created all new tracks for the hip-hop inspired soundtrack. And thanks to an innovative gameplay system, the enemy AI and tone of the game are affected by the beat of the musical score, for a truly immersing experience.With its visual stunning graphics, and fluid and graceful movements, Afro Samurai will provide hours of entertaining, balletic action. Add to this ground-breaking elements like health that is represented by the blood on your clothes, or your enemies', and you have a game that simply can not be passed up.Slice and dice your enemies in a glorious number of different ways.","reviewerName":"Jaha","summary":"Bargain game garners a rental for most.","reviewText":"Bargain games sometimes change the criticism of a game in my experiences.  A game at [...] bucks can invoke ire and disappointment but the same game at [...] bucks may be good value.  Afro Samurai is hitting those bargain prices but honstly I still don't think it garners more than a rental.Fans of the show will be happy to see the voice talent is there, the style, etc.  The graphics, music, and sound are excellent in this game.  But this is also a licensed game tie in and we all know that these types of games are rarely great.  In the grand scheme of things, Afro Samurai is a 3-d action platformer.  Even the best platformers get repetitive and frustrating.  It's up to developers to work in additional elements to keep the game fresh.  I just don't think Afro managed that.  The game ends up being very stale once you cut through the all the style that is slamming you in the face.  A good comparison for this game in the newer ranks would be Tron Evolution.  Both are predominantly fighting games with prince of Persia esque platform elements and solid graphics, music, and sound.  But both games offered all style, little substance.Lets start with gameplay.Combat controls:I have few complaints about the combat controls.  For the most part the controls are intuitive and responsive.  Entering combos is easy and responsive.  Combat and defensive buttons are mapped well.  The two elements I did not like was having to depress the L stick to run and the much hated camera.I am wagering the devs just ran out of buttons and had to get running in.  But using the L stick is unreliable and uncomfortable.  The camera has been slammed in other reviews but it is a glorified pain.  It spins constantly in combat, often leaving you blind.  While you can block with R trig while you right it (as one reviewer pointed out) they belittle the fact that not all attacks can be blocked or that the parry function is vital in some cases and exercising a parry correctly is impossible if you cant see the enemy.The game offers a wide variety of combos for you to cut enemies up but most of the time you just mash buttons as fast as possible.  This is fine for regular enemies but in boss fights you can't just mash buttons.  You have to be precise.  The controls are fine once you get accustomed to them but it's unfortunate the game never \"trains\" you to prepare for bosses.For example.  You never really need to block much during the base levels but vs bosses you have to block most of the time.  Some bosses you can only hit if you use the \"parry\" command, etc.  This creates a disconnect in the levels.  Most players will just \"mash\" their way through the level only to struggle with the boss because the game never \"Trained\" or \"prepared\" them for the boss.  This is a result of bigger issues discussed later on.Platform Controls:Purely awful.  It's almost as if the Devs made this a straight combat game and threw in the platforms as a last minute addition.  Afro floats around the levels.  Turning is not very precise, jumping is inaccurate, wall running is a mess, etc.  Add in the wild camera and you are gonna die a lot.  The wall iteration is also pretty lame.  Afro can only interact with predetermined walls, but the player really has no idea which walls they are until you just go for it.I got about half way through the game before writing this and frankly I have never felt like I am really in control of Afro.  He is just not responsive enough to generate any feeling of fluidity.  Worse off many of the environments are difficult to see your path in.  This poses a problem because you can't always see where you are supposed to go or where the platform is, etc.  Afro acting drunk the whole game doesn't help.As platformers go this game is pure garbage.Story:  The game is told in an interesting manner, kind of like Kill Bill.  Unfortunately there just isn't much of it though.  About 75% of this game is combat.  Just mindlessly mashing buttons to slay the same bad guys over and over and OVER and OVER.  Then after maybe 50 baddies you get a small cut scene for a few seconds, then another 50 bad guys come running.There really isn't any clear reason for most of the fights either.  Enemies just materialize out of nowhere for little reason.  In one level you actually have to run around the same paths over and over just to keep triggering more and more of these monotonous mini battles.  You never have much of a clue as to why you are doing this especially when the goal of the mission was to end up right where you started!If the story was better I think the game could have been saved some negative press.Difficulty.  This is a sliding scale.  For the most part the game isn't terribly difficult on the basic level crawling.  Instead of adding more challenges in the form of puzzles or more difficult enemies, the game just pushes you by throwing more and more of the same bad guys on you at the same time.  The game is primarily just a grind of going from one room to another just to fight the same group of 25 bad guys over and over.  Worse, some of these baddies take forever to kill.  Fighting isn't overly challenging it just takes a while.  Its a war of attrition.  The the bosses are actually very challenging.  Sometimes based on pure challenge, others out of frustration.I got through about half of the game in my first sitting and I am pretty much bored of it.  My hands get tired from just mashing buttons and the platform sections are few and frustratingly bad.  Pure and simple, this game gets boring fast.  I would love to finish the game to see more of the story but it's just not worth the frustration or time commitment.  I would rather read a book or go for a walk.I find it odd that the game doesn't have a difficulty level.  Instead the game has a set level and if you beat the game you can unlock the \"hard\" difficulty.  I can't imagine this will matter to most gamers.  The game is so monotonous and repetitive that I can't see most gamers playing it over.  I would think an \"easy\" level for more casual gamers (I have never been a big fan of most action platform games even though I was raised on Mario.).  had that Easy level been there I think the more casual gamers like myself would have found the game more enjoyable.  But alas as it stands the game is just stubbornly frustrating.So if you have to play this game and are a bargain gamer like me, pick it up as a rental.  You will thank me.  I wouldn't recommend spending more than 10 bucks tops on this title.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2011"}

Think along the lines of God of War II; it has different fighting styles and blocking system,  but it also incorporates the same \"mini-game\" type of play: during boss battles, etc. The fighting styles have a ranged attack, fast style, and strong style. To block all you have to do is be in the right style. If you're having arrows fired at you, go to the ranged stance to send your blades whirling around you to deflect them.I showed this game to one of my friends recently and he had a blast. Using the Six-axis was a nice addition when doing \"Aftertouch.\" For instance, when the 2nd character that you play uses her \"bow\" you fire the arrows and then guide them with the PS3 controller. This takes some getting used to, but is fun. The main character of Heavenly Sword can use Aftertouch when throwing things (or firing from a cannon), which includes bodies.The voice acting and cutscenes are great. You can tell that they really put a lot of work into it. There are a couple annoying characters that I could do without, but the main villain is hilarious.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2008"}

A brand new IP from developers Ninja Theory that promised lots of action, interesting characters, and one of the best graphical presentations on the PS3 to date.  Some have even compared the game to Sony's other famous action series God of War and referred to the main character Nariko as the female Kratos or \"Goddess of War\".  Does Heavenly Sword deliver?  Let's see.The first thing I must discuss are the graphics.  Simply put, Heavenly Sword is beautiful.  Not only with it's cutscenes but also with the gameplay.  There were times where you would literally have hundreds of enemies on screen at the same time but the game didn't jump or skip, nor did they let up on the visual quality.  At its time of release, Heavenly Sword boasted the best graphics on the Playstation 3.The gameplay is very similiar to your typical action game.  It's mostly hack 'n slash with combos you can do for more damage.  The only major gripe I have is that for some reason the devs decided to strip Nariko of the ability to jump.  One amazing feature that sets the gameplay in Heavenly Sword apart from other games is its use of the Sixaxis tilt function.  I'm usually very critical of this feature in games because it seems like a tacky afterthought rather than a useful function, but in Heavenly Sword it is executed perfectly.  Using Nariko's friend Kai (the other playable character), you are able to fire her arrows and direct them with the sixaxis tilt function.  In fact any objects you throw in the game can be guided with the tilt function.  This makes Kai's missions among the best in the game.I won't go into the story for the as I do not want to spoil it for anyone.  I will say that it's very well told and I actually cared about the story and characters in this game.My only major complaint with this game (like many others), is the lack of replayability.  Notice I didn't say length, I said replayability.  Seasoned gamers know that action titles have never been very long so I don't take points from Heavenly Sword for being only 8-9hrs.  The problem is that after you beat the game there isn't much incentive to play it again.  Other action games have unlockable costumes, game modes, challenges, etc.  Heavenly Sword only includes a higher difficulty level \"Hell Mode\" for those who want a bigger challenge.Overall Heavenly Sword was a very enjoyable game.  It was well presented, well excuted, and well designed.  Though it lacks replayability, it's a game that all PS3 gamers should play at least once.  Whether you want to buy or rent.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2008"}
{"product_name":"B007FTE2VW","description":"","reviewerName":"JWink","summary":"EA ruins another game","reviewText":"SimCity offers up tantalizing delights for the would-be city-builder, but encases them in an infrastructure that feels at odds with itself.On one side is a brilliant, vibrantly realized reboot of Maxis' classic SimCity franchise. After a 10-year break, here is a game that presents the modern city builder with nearly every possible tool one could hope for to build the bustling metropolis of their dreams. It is gorgeous to look at when properly taken advantage of with the latest PC hardware, artfully designed for minimal user interface turmoil, and just exquisitely charming across the board.On the other side is a stricter game than the one franchise fans have come to know over the years, one more dedicated to a single-minded way of cooperative thinking. In this SimCity, a single city cannot survive without another nearby to pick up the slack. Multiplayer is heavily encouraged, to the point of insistence, and yet the safeguards that aim to prevent problematic behavior on the part of others are minimal, and frankly unreliable. Which is to say nothing of its overall, online-always infrastructure, one which has, at times already, hamstrung the entirety of this new SimCity's lush, yet disappointingly underutilized region.You start off with a nice patch of land, but you'll be surprised how quickly that space fills.Understand, SimCity is extremely capable of being the grand reboot of the series it aims to be, at least in spurts. The core act of city-building, which has been using most of the same basic ideas since its inception nearly 25 years ago, has rarely been more elegantly realized. The tools to build with are numerous and overwhelming. Of course you will start out your new city by laying down zones for residential, commercial, and industrial, perhaps by building a couple of city services, plopping down (to use the game's parlance) a power plant, and then a water tower, and then a garbage dump, and it just goes on. Every building option you have comes with option upon option underneathHalf the fun of SimCity is just trying to figure out the best, most efficient ways to build everything. And this SimCity often scratches that itch wonderfully. It even offers tremendous flexibility in the design of your city, both from a geographical standpoint, and in terms of economy. To the former, roads can now be curved, built in circles, perfect blocks, really whatever you like. Roads are upgradable too, so a small avenue can become a large commercial one later on.More interesting are the city specialties, special economic focuses that allow you to build, say, an oil pump or two if your land is rich in fossil fuels. Or perhaps tourism, if your interest pertains to building famous landmarks (some of which can be bought via the game's DLC store). Or, if you just like making money, there's always the gambling route. These specialties provide an extra layer of challenge, in that you kind of have to build your city around them, as opposed to just deciding on them later. Otherwise you'll spend a lot of time bulldozing and rezoning things as you try to figure out how to squeeze an ore mine into a residential neighborhood.There are graphs upon charts upon data screens to play with, all giving ample information on every aspect of how my city is running. It's beautiful stuff, though it's also occasionally bogged down by sloppy data reporting. Often times fixing problems within my city, like sewage outflow issues or power outages, would result in continued displeasure from my citizens for quite some time. This can sometimes make it difficult to judge whether you've actually solved the issue or not.Far more problematic than any of that, however, is really the other half of SimCity. It is the multiplayer, the skeletal structure in which the city building meat of the game has been somewhat awkwardly stuffed into. At the outset of every game, you are asked to pick a region. Right from the get-go, you can choose to join an already existing region, which has been started by another online player, or create your own. Once in a region, you can choose to be the mayor of as many of the city plots as you please, but there are always multiple plots, and to leave a whole region unused puts a burden on your city that the game isn't designed to alleviate through single-player play.Essentially, SimCity doesn't really want you to have one city that has all available services and resources. As with the city specialties, there is significant financial and strategic benefit to having one city that's, say, more apt to house polluting industrial factories, or garbage dumps. Such a city might not have a huge residential population, nor much potential for high land value items, but it can make money by housing jobs that citizens in other cities can commute to, and even by housing other cities' garbage.This cooperation becomes crucial, as there really isn't enough money, nor space to allow one city to bear all the major burdens at once. That last point is a particularly stinging one. Regions are broken up into squared-off city areas within a larger area of land. In between the cities are vast zones of dead space that essentially just exist to make the region look more natural. While it certainly can take a while to fill up an entire plot of land--especially in areas rife with mountains or plateaus--you will eventually fill it up. The game goes out of its way to try and help you build using the most efficient layouts possible, even offering a road guide that shows you ideal places for streets and avenues. But even following the guides stringently, you'll eventually run out of room, leaving you to try and squeeze whatever zoning density you possibly can out of every little corner you own. There is probably a very good technical reason for why you can't use any of that extra land, but it is nonetheless a terrible tease.Yes, it is entirely possible to play SimCity on your own, without any other players, but this is not really ideal. If you're managing multiple cities in a region, that turns an already intense time suck into a more stressful endeavor. I did not enjoy the act of trying to balance multiple cities in a region by myself. Don't get me wrong, I'm generally of the mindset that games like SimCity should be played in tomb-like isolation, but that isn't how this SimCity is meant to be played. It's meant to be played with friends. To try and fight against its multiplayer is to fight against the very nature of this game's design.The thing of it is, if you can get a group of enthusiastic players together, the kind you know won't do dickish things, like polluting your region to death, or harboring scads of murderers in their dilapidated hellhole of a town, SimCity works. As weird and awkward as it seems at first, the more you play it under ideal conditions, the more clear Maxis' vision for this game becomes. It's almost like a kind of social experiment in cooperation, albeit one that is perhaps a bit too open to exploitation. While you can't just go in and wreck anyone's city wholesale, there are smaller, more insidious things players can do to royally screw up someone's region, and don't think there won't be those people. Of course, you can always set your game to private, making sure that only friends and likeminded individuals can join. But if my experience has been any indication, those safeguards aren't terribly reliable right now. I had one early region set to private, and then after a bit of server wonkiness, it had become infested with unfamiliars.The biggest issue that seems to be with EA's servers, and this brings us to the biggest flaw in SimCity's design. SimCity is an always-online game, meaning if the servers are off, everybody's game is off. EA calls SimCity's multiplayer asynchronous, and that's partially correct. There's nothing that requires players to be on at the same time to play. However, we do all have to be able to connect to EA's servers to play. Yes, even if you just want to noodle around in your own city and don't care what's going on in the larger region today, you can't load up your city data if the servers are down. And the servers have been down. Several times, in fact.  The underlying principle if everyone can't play, then no one shall play, is a troubling one.It is therefore difficult to completely reconcile a game like SimCity. This is a game with startling clarity of vision, but that vision often feels narrow and intractable. It knows precisely what it wants to be, and in most key ways, executes on those ideas with precision. But in setting that course, it all but dismisses the way in which many played SimCity sequel after sequel. The game feels more like a really thoughtfully designed multiplayer mode for a larger, single-player capable game that, sadly, doesn't exist.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

Note I installed the patch.The save system was unique in my experience.  There is no manual save.  It automatically saves your progress as you go.  Just quit the game at any point.  When you start playing again, your character, equipment, quest progress is all there.  The only thing not saved is your location.  It always starts with you in the last station you visited.Overall thoughts - (from the perspective of a role playing fan)  What the developers did is very well done.  The problem for me was not enough variety.  For the most part you just go to an area and kill everything you encounter.  There is no real feeling of exploration.  After awhile it feels more like work than fun.  It is addictive though and I played it for many, many hours before moving on.  It is worth a look if you can get a used game at a reasonable price (under $10.00).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"W. C. Bryant","summary":"The initial fun and novelty waned for us, but it's still a worthwhile new direction for the music game genre.","reviewText":"(This review is based on a demo version of DJ Hero which included a wired turntable and a disc with a limited collection of mixes.)I was (and to a degree remain) excited about the 'music game' genre reaching into new areas.  The notion of being able to mix tracks seemed, conceptually, to be a lot of fun.  That's not really what you're doing here, however.  Much the same way missing notes in Guitar Hero or Rock Band just means you're missing part of the song, so too is the product of your efforts on the turntable an effort to simply hear existing mixes, where the only real variation and unique creativity you bring is the background noise you select when you hit the bonuses.  Of course, as incapable a Guitar Hero or Rock Band guitar controller is of actually producing music, so too is a turntable controller appropriately limited -- and it's with a nod to that reality that we can move on to accept this game for what it is.  And that is simply a different platform for the same old (but still fun and challenging) task of syncing your own actions with the cues from the game.  Rather than pressing buttons and strumming, you're pressing buttons on the turntable, moving a slide back and forth, and sometimes 'scratching' by rotating the turntable itself in one direction or another (or both, depending on the level of difficulty you choose).  But it's not, by my experience, as capable of fooling you into feeling immersed as the other games (and controllers) within the genre are.  Little things make this so.  While you scratch, the scratching sound occurs in the track, but there's a complete disconnect (for example) between how fast and slow you scratch and the sound produced.  Even in areas where you might be able to bring a little of yourself into what's playing out over your screen and speakers, you're just not given the opportunity.It's this lack of immersion (and I use the term loosely) that prevents this from being as addictive as the other games can be.  While the developers were smart to include a DJ+Guitar mode, this never really can be the same sort of group or party game that the others have become.Nonetheless, it is fun.  It is good to hear artists and tracks represented that you're just not going to come across too often in the other games.  The controller is well made and just plain fun to goof around with.  But for us, it hasn't held up as something we really wanted to play again after the first couple of times through.  How much of that is due to being limited by the demo version?  How much of that is the game itself?  That's hard for me to say.  What I can offer is that I've seen the different game modes, and if I had a full game disc with which I could go back in and play other tracks, I just don't know that I'd bother to do so.This is a winner conceptually, but as a first generation effort I felt it fell a little short of the mark set by later generations of the other games.  Here's hoping there will be a DJ Hero 2 that provides a little more interaction and (as a result) immersion.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2009"}

One of the games that made every kid want to own one is none other than Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  An excellent Playstation title and there's no doubt in my mind that it's the greatest Castlevania game on the face of the earth.  Don't believe me?  Too bad, now read on anyway:THE GOODYou play as Alucard, the son of Dracula, and he's improved over his Castlevania III(NES) version.  The whole castle environment is done in the same vein as Zebes was in Super Metroid; in fact, the whole game borrows from Super Metroid!  You might think that's bad, but the gaming geniuses at Konami utilized that tactic and made it worthwhile.  The soundtrack kicks...especially Richter Belmont's theme (speaking of which, he's also a playable character).  The graphics were state-of-the-art for the Playstation's debut and they're very stylish and, of course, in the Castlevania style.  Also, being a huge fan of Super Metroid and Castlevania, this game not only throws in its own goodies, but has that good ol' \"old school\" feel to it.  This game also has items GALORE and you can collect cards to cast magic spells and use familiars.THE BADAside from the ending credits song that grates on my nerves (\"I am the Wind\"), I find absolutely nothing wrong with the game.  If you do find something wrong, consult your physician.OVERALLSome might claim this as the best game of all-time; I can't claim that, but it's certainly the best in the long-running Castlevania series.  I doubt there'll be a Castlevania that will beat this one (for all you 64 lovers, Castlevania 64 and Legacy of Darkness AREN'T that great!).  Its superb gameplay and style marks this as a great game and it should never be forgotten.  If you've never played a Castlevania game before, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU START HERE.

The dulled clang of armored feet rings falsely in your ears, an obvious trick of echo that could lead to a mistake your training would never allow.  Your exhilaration rises with the jangled din, an opportunity you will not allow to pass.  At the critical moment, you spring around the corner, grab your unsuspecting victim--muting his tell-tale screams with your swathed hand--pin him against the rough wall, and swiftly stab your sword into his caved throat, silencing all struggles. He slumps to the floor, a sightless, disgarded husk.*/illustrative story*And this only describes the heart-racing feeling one should feel when performing a stealth kill!  Imagine what an all-out brawl would inspire...this game, a work of deadly beauty, gaming bliss.  I could describe the game mechanics in detail, but the synopsis already here does this well-enough.  So I decided, \"why not try to describe to people actually playing the game feels like?\"  Though I slightly exaggerated my description (in-game sound does not work in so sophisticated a way, but one can certainly imagine), I sincerely felt this way when playing.  This game allows one to enter the body of a true brawler, one very capable and quite impressive to play.The gameplay never became boring because the player has numerous weapons at her or his disposal and areas to explore.  In this respect, I felt the game's short length actually worked to its advantage:  how can one become tired of an excellent game that only lasts about 8-10 hours?  The developers included much without having to resort to game-lengthing repetition.  Though I desired more, this left me craving and only feeling residual sweetness...nothing marred my experience.  This says something strong, I believe.Considering this game's reasonable price, I highly recommend all who read this purchase it.  I found it for $30, and never once regretted my buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2003"}

HODT 3 is also fun with much improve graphics, but I bought it for the classic arcade HODT 2.  This is the one I played in the arcade; this is the one I played with my son many times.  Cheesy language and acting are just part of its nostalgic appeal.  Was not that scary and even somewhat funny at times. Resident Evil and even Doom II is much scarier in my opinion.  You can also change the blood color to green to reduce the gore if you want.You cannot go back where you left off, you really don't need to as the game is not that long.  Every time you die you get more and more power that soon enough you get power-ups and items that will help you defeat the game.  Some of the best items are infinite bullets and infinite credits.It is more fun if you play 2 players with a friend. Although you can play this with a gun in each hand if that is what you want.  Not an ideal party game as you cannot play with more than 2 players.  The game can be played with the Wiimote alone, but you will enjoy it better with an accessory that feels like more as a gun.  The 2 most popular are the Perfect Shot by Nyko, and Wii Zapper by Nintendo.  I prefer the Perfect Shot as it looks more like a real pistol while the Zapper is bulkier and longer.Too bad, I wonder why they replaced the concept and instead included much cursing and F-bombs on the 4th sequel, HODT: Overkill.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K956","description":"","reviewerName":"jomojomo","summary":"Excellent Value","reviewText":"Here is why I bought this bundle:1) A top of the line blu-ray player, seriously this is one of the best blu-ray players on the market.  Some of the A/V review sites I've read use the PS3 as their reference player, it really is that good.  However, some may have problems with Sony's aggressive Cinavia implementation.  I do not as all my blu-rays are retail.2) A decent gaming system with some nice exclusives.3) And, imo, the best motion controller set up available.  The things I hated about the wii and Kinect were the imprecision, the lag, and lack of 1:1 tracking.  With both systems, the movements on screen do not mimic the movements you make.  For example, wii boxing can be played sitting down with little wrist flicks.  In fact, it is much easier to win that way.  With the kinect, you have to use trial and error to know what movements the kinect wants to see.  And like the wii, the movements you need to make to win bear little resemblance to what happens on the screen (see my 360 review for a more detailed discussion).The Sony Move, while no where near perfect, comes closet to delivering lag free 1:1 motion control.  Killzone and The Fight: Lights Out are the best examples and are absolutely must buys if you're going to get the move system.  The move is the only system that lets me get into the action.The problem is that I cannot say how many games will eventually take advantage of the Move as there are only really 5 games right now that I'd recommend with this system.  But since I was buying a PS3 for the blu-ray anyway, I'm glad I spent the extra couple of bucks for the move bundle.btw, you will want to get an extra controller, as some games require 2.  The nav controller and blu-ray remote are nice optionals to get as well but not 100% necessary like the second move controller.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

Rhodes","summary":"An Homage to an Era Long Gone","reviewText":"Back in the late 80's and early 90's the idea of traversing 3D worlds was mostly just a fantasy.  And the stories told in that era were mostly simple stories that usually lacked a lot of the depth that you see today.  3D Dot Game Heroes is mostly a game that serves to be a throwback and homage to that era.  In particular, The Legend of Zelda is by far the most obvious inspiration for the game.  This is a game made for those who may have possibly enjoyed the 8-bit and 16-bit era a great deal.  That doesn't mean those who missed out on those eras are going to be lost.  The game can be enjoyable for them as well.3D Dot Game Heroes takes place in the land of Dotnia.  A realm where a hero long ago sealed away an ancient evil in 2D.  When the land of Dotnia went 3D, however, the orb that the ancient evil was sealed away in was stolen and the threat rises once again.  You pick a hero who happens to be a descendant of the ancient hero and go out into the vast world to find the six sages who each hold an orb and provide hints and tips on where to go next.  The story, as you can imagine is ripped straight out of Zelda.  Those who enjoyed the original Legend of Zelda on the original NES in particular, will be dying of nostalgia.  It isn't just The Legend of Zelda that is a big reference here.  You'll see plenty of references to other games such as the Final Fantasy series and the Dragon Quest series.  There is also a nice little Easter Egg thrown in there for fans of Demon's Souls.  The game also pokes fun at some aspects of this era such as a king telling you straight out that answering \"NO,\" to taking the quest won't advance the story.There's actually a large amount of character in the game.  The denizens of Dotnia are ripe with character and humor.  There are also tons of sidequests to be done that are mainly initiated by talking to other characters.  In the end you'll be amazed at just how big the game really is.  The story isn't really there for any other purpose than providing nifty references and jokes, but they also provide tons of jokes about the world it takes place in.  It's an amazing experience.  Especially for those who grew up with a NES and SNES.The most obvious inspiration from The Legend of Zelda, however, is easily the gameplay.  You'll travel an overworld map filled with lots of critters to dispatch.  As you progress through the game you'll have to go to dungeons located on the map.  Crawling through each dungeon you'll need to find keys to progress further, destroy walls and move blocks.  It should sound very familiar to any fan of Zelda.  Likewise, you've got a life meter that expands any time you find four \"life shards\" (or defeat a boss and get a whole one) and a magic meter below.  The references are laid on quite heavily, but it's nothing to be alarmed about in the long run.  The developers here were obviously big Zelda fans.When your health is at its highest your sword is enormous and goes more or less across the entire screen, being able to kill enemies from a distance.  Get hit by an enemy and it becomes a sword of normal length and the game rises in difficulty that way.  The bosses in particular can be tough if you don't know what you're doing.  Luckily the game is more than willing to provide hints for you via a Navi like fairy (that isn't quite as annoying).The experience is robust and is enhanced by the presentation.  It's a pretty game, but you'll need to take a bit of time to get used to it.  3D Dot Game Heroes doesn't push a lot of power, but it's made a world that has characters.  Everything is made of tiny pixelated blocks that form characters.  And they look pretty good when you settle in to the aesthetic design of the game.The audio is hit or miss.  The soundtrack itself isn't expansive.  It's not bad.  You'll find tracks that are clearly inspired by other games (in particular Zelda and Dragon Quest) but it can get repetitive fast.  There are nostalgic moments to it, but you're not likely to be humming a lot of the tunes any time soon.If you were a fan of the original Legend of Zelda or enjoyed some of the action RPGs of the 8-bit and 16-bit era, then playing 3D Dot Game Heroes is worth a try.  The jokes are hilarious and the presentation is great.  If you missed out on this era, there is still reason to play, as the game is still a lot of fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2012"}

What he does care about is delivering a quality product that sells well, and that is exactly what Black Ops brings to the table.What you can expect:- A 8-10 hour campaign of Michael Bay explosions and \"Tyler Durden\" plot twists mixed into a diabolical story line- Completely inaccurate portrayal of weapons and technology during the 1960-1970 Cold War- Coop zombie multi-player modes, 2 maps with the regular edition and 4 with the Hardened.- 12 Multi-player maps filled with the quality and level of intensity many fans have come to expect from the Call of Duty franchiseWhat I liked:If you play Call of Duty for competitive online matches, you will probably be dropping Modern Warfare 2 for this one.  Not only is the online game more balanced and regulated than its Infinity Ward predecessor, it has a community of developers who have devoted their attention full-time to making sure the community is listened to. The multi-player is addictive, and leaves much to strive for if you are a long-time player of Black Ops.  Prestige modes now bring you into a higher level of competitive game play.  Wager matches are not for the feint of heart when dropping in-game currency.  The best addition to the series was Combat Training.  This mode allows you to experiment with different perks and kill streaks, without the worry of affecting your precious win-loss or kill-death ratios online.  The recent matches option also lets you look at your past matches, much like in Halo 3s theater mode.  This is a welcome addition for those who want to watch good players which stick out on the leaderboards, and \"borrow\" their tactics for their own play style.  These are all options which the community wanted for their next Call of Duty game, and like a champ Treyarch provided.What I disliked:It's starting to feel like the campaign for shooters nowadays is simply for game reviewers to gawk at, and for casual players to use as training for the meat of the game: multi-player.  While I did think the campaign was adequate, on veteran difficulty it was downright annoying.  Enemies respawn and storm right back to take the position of the guy you just shot within 5 seconds. So if you don't move up, you die.  Cowering enemies can't be picked off from their foot sticking out, or head slightly shown either.  You must wait until they decide to shoot at you before you can fire back.  The campaign really didn't flesh into its own until the latter half of the game, and even then it just felt like a sequel to Modern Warfare 2.  Perhaps when Black Ops gets a sequel (probably set in the 1970s) and Chuck Norris comes into the fray we will see a campaign more memorable, but for now just expect to follow a very linear story line with little ability to deviate from the main path without getting killed.Like I said before though, you don't buy games like these anymore for the story, you buy it for the competitive aspect.  This game literally has something for everyone from the hardcore to the casual looking to jump on the bandwagon of FPS players.  Shooter fans expect the best from their games, and Treyarch delivered a knockout.  You might as well join the craze now, because Activision is going to milk this franchise every year until gamers get bored of it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2010"}

You can easily adjust chat audio without taking your hands off your controller and add game audio by connecting directly to your controller, console or TV.","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Lerch","summary":"Does what it is supposed to","reviewText":"If you are someone who feels this capability should have come out of the box for the Xbox One, then the review is one star. Part of me is there, though the other part of me says I need to rate the merits of the device and it's functionality.The Stereo Headset adapter worked perfectly for me. I've been using optical out with my Turtle Beach and SteelSeries H headphones for a while, and using Kinect for chat. Now I don't have to bother with that.Before you can use the adapter, you MUST update your controller's firmware. According to the manual, you are supposed to take the batteries out, plug in the included micro USB cable (very short cable, kinda worthless using it for anything else), plug the adapter into the controll and then power up the system. Problem is, it doesn't work the way the manual claims. Doing this means the controller powers up, but doesn't do anything else. If you do this, you have to go into Settings -&#62; System -&#62; Update controller and then follow the onscreen instructions. I'm not sure if this works if the system is powered on, you are logged in and then plug the headset in as I don't have other controllers to try.The other important part to remember is the update process for the controller came down with the March Xbox One update. If you don't have this update for whatever reason, you can't use the adapter and will need to update first.Once your controller is updated, plug the included 3.5mm to 2.5mm cable into the audio port on the adapter, then plug your headset in. Assuming you don't have any of the issues of some of the other reviewers, game chat should work, it should work well and do exactly what you expect and want. I can't speak for anyone else's experience - my experience, other than the update process detailed in the box, was faultless.If you don't want to invest in ANOTHER gaming headset, then this MSRP $25 adapter will save you some money and bring the functionality you've been wanting back to the Xbox One.Recommended if you need/want this capability.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2014"}

Although they've had that opportunity with games like Dance Dance Revolution, they haven't yet been able to Rock Out Loud!!! With the success of Guitar Hero I & II for the Playstation 2, and Xbox 360, Wii gamers have been going absolutely mad, waiting for the chance to see the feeling of the guitar strings go wild for months now. Now, they finally have that opportunity with the latest sequel in one of the most electrifying music franchise games of all time, but does it really deliver or miss the mark that the other game systems caught on?Guitar Hero III for the Nintendo Wii, finally enters the latest phase in Rock n' Roll gaming. The gameplay is just like what it was with the Xbox 360, and PS2, but the gameplay is more exciting around this time. The game includes the same modes from before including co-op mode and multiplayer action, but what makes the gameplay shine now is the battle mode, where you can rock out against foes to help unlock new songs and characters to rock with. There are also a lot of great songs here this time that are truly to the hard cores of metal and hard rock that range from Rap like The Beastie Boys classic Sabatoge, Guns N' Roses classic Welcome To The Jungle and the debut of The Red Hot Chili Peppers on the game series with Suck My Kiss from Blood Sugar Sex Magik, to 70's legendary songs from Alice Cooper on School's Out and the great Santana with Black Magic Woman and the Kiss party anthem Rock & Roll All Night.The game also comes with a specialty guitar that is wireless and works great for Wii gamers who've played the earlier ones for PS2 or Xbox 360, but what makes this one shine so bright is the multiplayer action. The game works well even more to the Wii fanatic, as now you can battle against gamers online through Nintendo Wi-FI connection which works flawlessly. My only gripe though about the game is that I wish they could've made it a little less expensive, consider Guitar Hero is finally on the Wii.All in all, it has been about time Guitar Hero has finally made its way onto the Wii, and this edition makes a great grand entry to new gamers young and old alike. I absolutely think you'll definitely rock out loud to this latest edition of Guitar Hero III, and young and old want to party everyday.Graphics: B+Sound: A-Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B+ for solo; A 1/2- for multiplayer actionOverall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2007"}

Game physics are similar.  That is, first person perspective and you will be interacting with the environment in an extended way; pushing or pulling doors, drawers and other objects by moving your mouse rather than just clicking on them. I think this actually enhances the gameplay. if you liked Penumbra you will probably  like this more. For maximum enjoyment it is important to play the game the way the developers intended, that is, dark settings on your video and a dim room.Overall:Graphics are good and lend themselves to the atmosphere but they won't blow you away 7/10Sound is excellent and very creepy. 9/10voice acting is quite satisfactory. 8/10Interaction via keyboard and mouse is a little clunky, but again, it enhances gameplay.6/10The story line is acceptable and certainly gruesome enough. 8/10A few minor bugs that won't affect the game. 9/10Recommended for any thinking gamer who likes a good scare. 9/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2011"}

He's possibly the deepest character Ubisoft has yet to release, and the most interesting.  The world responds to him.  You can play as hero or villain, and the people will see him differently, and respond differently, depending on your choices.  In that it has a little bit of the TellTale games flavor.  You drive the story, not just follow it along.The hacking is fun.  You can get data or sometimes cash from a passing person's phone.  You can trigger this or that to distract a guard.  You can control traffic lights (turn them all green and cause a nice gridlock situation).  You can find and stop crimes.  You can hack into cameras and kind of jump from camera to camera to find your destination.As with Assassin's Creed, stealth is important.  You can play this as a shooter--and you certainly get enough weapons for that--but it's a lot more fun to sneak around.The only thing I hate, hate, hate is the driving.  Cars just don't move like that.  I tried to do a K turn and reverse sometimes moves the car, not backwards, but sideways.  Like the tires were turned 90 degrees to the axle.It's a massive open world with so much to do.  It's about as big a world as Assassin's Creed 4.  I'm loving that.So far, this is my favorite game this year.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2014"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"A slow start to a promising rebooted franchise.","reviewText":"Castlevania Lords of Shadow is simply put not a Castlevania game. Yes there are nods to the previous series but this is a reboot not a sequel. That shouldn't scare anyone away though as this is a great albeit flawed beginning to a new saga.First we'll start off with the presentation. The graphics and music are top notch. The diverse and beautiful environments look amazing. The graphics are only topped by the sweeping musical score that adds a lot of intensity to the action. There is however one complaint that I have in this department and that is Patrick Stewart. I love him as an actor but he added way too much drama to his character and it was way too over the top. I hope that he can redeem himself if he is in any more games in the franchise.The gameplay overall is solid. Yes it does play like a God of War clone but the core combat is without complaint. You unlock new powers and combos as the game progresses to keep your interest in the combat. Though it does lack variety the first few hours as the game developers kept most of the cool weapons and combos for later in the game. You have two rage modes that can be used at any time and are replenished by killing multiple enemies in a row without being hit. One of them fills your health bar with ever crack of your chains and the other simply does more damage.Another main part of the game play is platforming. The game seems to copy Uncharted here and does it pretty well. Yes there are times when you don't know where to jump to and others when you can't seem to land on a platform correctly. These times are not that frequent but the platforming is certainly not that responsive or intuitive at times.The Boss battles while epic are mostly your run of the mill block, dodge, and counter attack type of gameplay. If you think that sounds bad wait until you hear what the other type is. There are four or five bosses that require you to crawl on them and hit critical areas to take them down. Now this is pretty common in GOW style games but the enemies shake ever ten seconds and you have to hold the R2 button to stop from falling off. It gets really frustrating when you have almost beaten a boss just for them to knock you off and you have to do that last part over again.The puzzles in the game range from fun and challenging to ridiculously hard. I had to look up a few myself and I normally stay away from walkthrough guides. Sometimes they simply don't give you enough information to complete the puzzle unless you use trial and error. In the end most of the puzzles feel like a road block instead of a fun distraction.The final piece of the puzzle is the story. The game comes out of the gate quickly and you invest in Gabriel's plights, but then after the first few hours the story really drops off and not much character development is made until the final chapter. When I read about this game I thought this was going to be its strength but it turns out to be its biggest weakness. Yes I loved the ending and I wanted more after the game was over but the middle section of the game was downright boring at times and I had trouble keeping interest.  As a result Gabriel was not really that developed as a protagonist, and I hope that they change that in future installments.Overall Lords of Shadow was a fun 15 hour campaign, but it also left a lot to be desired. The story was never really that strong and the game play was not brilliant or original enough to completely save the game. If you like GOW or hack and slash type games then pick this one up when the price goes down. It is a fun game but without a story to keep you hooked I had trouble staying interested.Rating 3.5/5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"I've had Wii U since it launched and it's easily the most disappointing console I've ever owned","reviewText":"Speaking as a collector who owns many console duds, the Wii U is by far the worst of the lot. Since I liked NES, SNES, N64, Gamecube, and Wii, I was prepared to enjoy the Wii U, but that's not the case.First things first, the games are of Nintendo quality but show absolutely no ambition whatsoever. Instead, though, Nintendo has relied on their tried-and-true properties such as Mario, Donkey Kong, and Zelda. All heavy hitters, no doubt, but what we've gotten, while good, isn't what we should be getting. Super Mario 3D World is like Super Mario 3D Land but bigger and expanded. With that said, I liked 3D Land more. Donkey Kong Country Returns: Tropical Freeze is like Donkey Kong Country Returns but expanded. I'd put both the original and Tropical Freeze on the same level in terms of overall game quality. And Zelda is a remake of a Gamecube game. While not bad games and actually quite good, they're just more of the same, lacking ambition and creativity. And according to sales, people aren't exactly impressed with these games enough to go buy a Wii U. Nintendo desperately needs to innovate their existing brands and create new intellectual properties before it's too late and their console market crashes & burns. Now with all of that said, we did get one original game with The Wonderful 101, which I did enjoy, though it could've been a whole lot better. In terms of sequels, I am excited for titles like Bayonetta 2 and X, but that's really all there is on the horizon to get excited for. Mario Kart? Again, decent game, loved by many, but ultimately more of the same. Smash Bros.? Never a personal favorite of mine. Fun for a while when I was a kid playing it on N64, but it's a game best played local and not online, and since I'm no longer a child and don't have buddies over to play Smash Bros., I'm not exactly excited for it.As for the console itself, it's the least powerful of the current gen, and Nintendo's games haven't exactly shown what it's capable of, but it is a reliable console so I'll give them kudos for that.Now for the controller, I hate it. The Gamepad is, quite frankly, awful. It's big, has a terrible battery life that'll run out in a week if you're not even playing the Wii U, and its ergonomics just aren't comfortable. With that said, I like the Wii U Pro Controller a whole lot.Overall, Nintendo's worst console to date. Stay away until they right their wrongs.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2014"}

After the Joker plummets to his death in an attempt to kill Batman, Gotham's criminals quickly escalate their schemes to gain power. Batman discovers subtle links in these seemingly unrelated crimes, but is forced undercover after being framed for an attack on Commissioner Gordon. Hunted by the police, the Dark Knight must pinpoint the unseen enemy weaving this sinister web before Gotham City falls to a fiery demise.Batman: Vengeanceintroduces the most versatile 3-D Batman game yet, with more than 500 animated movements, special fighting moves, and a multifunctional cape with its own AI. For the first time, players can journey through a fully rendered 3-D Gotham City with Batman's sleek weapons and devices at their fingertips, including the BatGrapple, BatScope, Batarang, BatLauncher, flash bombs, and more. There is a huge array of gameplay modes: exploring, fighting, first-person shooter, driving, flying, freefall, and puzzles.The Gotham City environment, reconstructed in full 3-D, contains 19 playable maps, including the rooftops, Gotham Industrial Research, and the Batcave. There are also more than 40 minutes of cinematics featuring the original voice cast of TV'sThe New Batman Adventures. The game's original story line was written in collaboration between Warner Brothers and DC Comics from the files ofThe New Batman Adventures. The Dolby Surround 5.1 Sound soundtrack features original music inspired by the television series.","reviewerName":"Tex \"dionysus_olympus\"","summary":"Good game but has some serious flaws","reviewText":"This is a fairly decent remake of Batman and his adventures in Gotham.  The plotline attempts at Metal Gear Solid, but the story is far too predictable.  The controls are slightly awkward and sporadic.  Batman moves similarly to Lara Croft in Tomb Raider: Chronicles, and you have to constantly adjust the camera with the R1 button.  But Batman is more hyper than Lara and runs exceptionally fast.  You have to control his movements with finesse. The music in the game is also well-selected, and gets you into the whole Batman episode that you are attempting to defeat.  The action of beating up thugs and bosses is actually fairly decent, but the whole jumping puzzles are plain annoying.  And, please be prepared to do a lot of jumping puzzles in this game.  Another major flaw is the control of the vehicles, the Batplane and Batmobile.  The Batplane is like flying a simulator (e.g., Ace Combat, Star Wars: Rebel Assault, etc.).  However, the Batmobile is just plain clumsy.  The Batmobile can only drive within specific streets, and you don't have the ability to explore Gotham. The sound effects are also done pretty well, with the thugs sounding like the show.  Furthermore, the save feature could be worked upon.  There is really no in-game saving (like Metal Gear Solid).  Lastly, you really don't have the freedom to explore the city as I expected.  In this way, the freedom of the game resembles Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider or any of the other action/adventure titles out there.Although this game isn't great, it's worth [money].  The cinematics are well worth it with the voices of Kevin Konroy and Mark Hamill.  Even the lip-synching of the characters are well-done.  Although this game is no Spider-Man, it does fulfill the Batman quota -- barely with very little room to spare.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2002"}
{"product_name":"B000MK694E","description":"Take2 Games BioShock 21962 PC Games","reviewerName":"Timothy Lovett","summary":"Bioshock - Fun, Unique, Interesting","reviewText":"First I want to respond to the paranoia surrounding the game installing a rootkit. It's not true. They create a registry key for copyright protection (which is still annoying) but do nothing besides that. If you don't believe me just check out the Symantec Security (Norton) Weblog, they have a message about this very issue.That said, the game itself is fun and unique in the sense that you're granted several abilities to use but you could just call it 'magic' and it wouldn't be all that different than other Action Shooters. What really sets this game apart though is the whole feel of the environment. From the very beginning of the story you instantly get the feeling you've been thrown back into the 50s. Every ounce of the environment helps reinforce this as well.The general story of the game, without spoiling much, is that you've crash landed in the middle of the ocean and found this underwater Atlantis like city created by a rich, anti-government, and very intelligent entrepreneur of the early 1900s. However, obviously based on the nature of the shooter genre, something went terribly wrong.The minute you arrive your ability to leave is destroyed so you must venture into the city. Throughout this very linear environment you read clues as to what has happened and have to make choices of how you want to behave (which affect the ending sequence but don't do much else in the long term). You also find out about plasmids which are injectable fluids you can use to gain the powers such as freezing things (why a city of people underwater would ever need the ability to freeze things is beyond me but it's nice for killing things).What's really interesting about the game is how it can be pretty scary at times. I remember one scene, I'm knee deep in water, walking through a shadowing corner, I see a shadow above in the light source of someone, boom! The lights cut and I'm stuck in the dark with something I can't see and I can't move very well. You will also find that you'll run out of ammo very often (which adds to the experience) so that can also lead you to being on the edge of your seat as well.The game is also visually beautiful assuming it doesn't crash on you like one of the other reviewers had. I'm not sure why that was happening, likely its the games interaction with his video card or the fact he only has 2 GB of RAM and is running Vista (which eats a lot of RAM).Generally, I'd say it's worth the money to buy and it's pretty fun and fast paced but the general fighting is somewhat repetitive so while it's fun to get new abilities it gets boring at times. If action shooters are your thing though this is a solid game to add to your collection. It's no Half Life but definitely is an experience you'll remember.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00006GEX2","description":"From the makers ofAge of Empirescomes a strategy game where the line between history and mythology has been blurred. InAge of Mythologyheroes do battle with monsters of legend, and the gods intervene in the affairs of mortal men.Age of Mythologyplayers wage war as leaders of a Greek, Norse, or Egyptian civilization with a customized pantheon. Players use human armies and diplomacy, progress through development ages, enhance military and economic performance with improvements, and manage economics through resource gathering and trade. Mythology enters the mix when players call upon the gods to act on their behalf or reinforce their armies with more than 20 mythological creatures such as jackal-headed Egyptian warriors or mighty minotaurs.Age of Mythology's revolutionary 3-D engine provides the game with gorgeous environments featuring lifelike rolling terrain, beautiful waves and water, realistic sunlight, and lush forests. The units roaming these environments are incredibly detailed, move naturally over the terrain, and come to life through hundreds of fluid animations. Amazing special effects change the look of this beautiful world when the gods get involved: all grows dark as an eclipse takes effect, funnel clouds twist and grow as a tornado sends buildings spinning toward the heavens, and meteors streak in from the heavens to send people and armies flying.An entertaining tutorial, an intuitive interface, and logical game rules allow anyone to quickly and easily learn to play. Once started, there is a lot to explore: an epic 36 scenario single player campaign, easy-to-use multiplayer gaming online, single player games against the challengingAge of MythologyAI opponents, more than 15 different random map types that help make the game infinitely replayable, nine highly differentiated civilizations, multiple difficulty levels to allow players of any skill level to have an enjoyable game, and a fully functional scenario editor.Age of Mythologyoffers something for everyone: a fun game for any playing style or skill level.","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"What is the purpose of such a massive game when Myth units dominate all others?","reviewText":"Looking like a 3D Age of Empires with three separate races almost as different as to be like Starcraft, Age of Mythology had potential to be a great game.Despite being an old game of only 1.5 gigabytes or so, the game ran smoothly, with units moving in formation automatically, looking quite smooth and small.  It is still gratifying to see villagers hit a tree with a few axe hits, then see the thing keel over and stay on the ground until it's been fully chopped, or to see dying units stay on the field, gradually disintegrating into corpses, then into nothing.There's nothing wrong at all with the engine or the animation or anything.  It was fun and highly entertaining.  The thing that drags this game down is where all strategy games should shine their brightest: combat.A single Greek Hoplite takes up 2 population points, with each house providing 15 population points, each town center about 15-20 (I forget) and you receiving a limit of 10 houses on a map, and only as many town centers as there are villages on the map (which as as sparingly placed as gold mines), so you're never likely to have an army bigger than a few dozen units at a time.But you're never likely to get 50-60 or even 100 units on the field at once.  The higher up you progress on the unit scale, the more population each unit eats up.  None of the units is particularly effective against other units save to bash at them for a minute or so before their target dies.The mixing of mythology and reality in the game is almost seamless, but there's still a sense of disbelief to it, and when even the most basic Myth unit overpowers some of the toughest Human units, it pretty much becomes a literal \"Age of Mythology\"Battles will be decided mostly by myth units.  It doesn't matter if you've amassed an army of hundreds of basic infantry, because a wave of Colossi, or Dragons, or Anubites, or a spell like Meteor, Lightning storm, etc will wipe them out in minutes if they are in big enough number.God powers are another thing that are grossly overpowered.  While it's absolutely beautiful watching meteor strike smack into an enemy base and leave giant craters while temporarily flooding the area with light, it's a bit much to see almost the entire selected patch of an enemy base crumbling before a single meteor strike or earthquake or whatever.  Granted, you can only use this godpower once per level, but who needs to use it more than once?Myth units get progressively stronger as you upgrade and select different Gods to worship and gain their respective powers, upgrades, and myth units, but in the end all infantry and cavalry are rendered useless before the might of the myth units.  The same problem that plagued Red Alert 2 plagues this game.Goods:- Simple, yet smooth and beautiful graphics make the game fun to watch.- A complex array of units awaits those who wish to fight with humans rather than myth units.- Units speak their native languages (Greeks speak ancient Greek, Egyptians speak ancient Egyptian, Norse speak some sort of Scandinavian).- Easy and steady interface makes it user-friendly and not a mad rush for resources or a mad rush for infantry.  Slow and steady could actually win you the race, if you're playing wisely.Neutral:- Myth units are a bit garish in their style and size.- God powers can be used only once, which is good for some (like meteor or earthquake) and bad for others.- Buildings can take a long time to break down, requiring siege equipmentBad:- Myth units are grossly overpowered, and render human infantry useless once into the midst of the game.- Strict population limits and high unit population cost means combat will be limited and no more than 80 units can be fielded by one side at a time.- Repetitive nature of Myth units and God powers makes replayability a myth in itself.- God powers are souped up superweapons, with an earthquake capable of leveling an entire enemy base of all its buildings save for town centers, fortresses, and other heavier buildings.All in all, it was a fun game to play at first, but replayability is not a realistic thought.  Myth units dominate the game (which some would argue they should, being as the name of the game is \"Age of Mythology\", but it does so at the cost of human infantry entirely).  If myth units are designed to be the elite in this game, why bother with so much work on an extensive and quite complex selection of human infantry/cavalry?That appears to be my only major problem, but it's a big one.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2002"}

While the game mechanics and platforming control is great, and the game is relatively easy. There are a few parts (I've come across 2) that are absolutley horrible. You can only take 2 shots, and at times will have like 5 dudes gang raping you with machine guns, and you're expected to do the most complicated acrobatics while this is going on. Or you may just need to jump up to a ledge, but there's a dude with a machine gun standing where you need to jump, and if you are lucky enough to subdue the guy, there's another dude a few feet away wailing on you with more machine gun fire, and it takes like 5 seconds to go throught the take-the-gun-away-kill-the-guard-animation and that while time you get hit like 50 times by the other dude, that's 48 more times than you can survive. Some REALLY bad level designs bring thing game to a screeching halt. Luckily there have been really few situations like this, but they suck the fun right out of the game.

However for such a highly touted title as this I really expected more. GTA IV follows the story of an eastern European immigrant to Liberty City named Nico Bellic. He and his cousin Roman start off with small time crime and then Nico moves to more serious stuff such as grand theft auto, arson and murder. All the previous mainstays from the original GTA III are present here, massive city, immersive story, a good amount of weapons and tons of cars.Gameplay 6/10There is not a whole lot different in GTA IV from previous GTA games in essential terms. You can jump in any car, truck, motorcycle or van and steal it. You can: run over anyone you want, run into anything, beat up anyone and do all of these things with little virtual and no real consequences (well most of the time). However there are a considerable amount of minigames within GTA IV. You can go to cabaret shows, play darts, play pool, go to strip clubs, go bowling and even use the internet in cafes.Also you are given a cell phone which helps you keep track of your contacts, text messages and allows you to call people up to get jobs or just to hangout. The phone also serves as the cheat interface. This is one of my favorite features. Instead of having to drive to the person's house or wondering if you were supposed to talk to them, you can just call them up on speed dial. They will also occasionally call you to see if you'd like to do things. It is akin to The Sims  in this respect, because you'll get a thumbs up or down based on how the date or whatever went. Also, you are able to meet women whether on the internet or through other friends.There are a ton of missions. From what I can tell you just work your way up through small mobs up to larger ones. This is what happened verbatim in the previous GTA games. There is more story here though and I'll get into that in the story section.Overall the gameplay I felt was good, but nothing new or revolutionary. I've played other games with minigames such as these and I played GTA III when it first came out. The sad thing is that Rockstar managed to set the bar so high with GTA III that it would be difficult to top it. I was expecting this really over the top GTA IV that would just have so much stuff to do that I wouldn't be able to quit playing. Instead they ended up on the other side. In my opinion the gameplay is bare bones and in terms of pure fun it really falls short. Another thing that is very apparent after playing for a few hours is they wanted to create as realistic of a game as possible. In the process they made the game so realistic it has many of things that suck about real life. When I play games, I want to escapeCity 9/10I must applaud the attention to detail and realism the game designers took to create Liberty City. From the slums to the high rises, you really feel like you're in a metropolis. Graffiti, misshapen fences, partially lit up buildings at night, dirty old carnivals, trash and variety of buildings are just some of things that add to the masterpiece of the city. You'll actually run into traffic on the tollway bridge. People will talk to you as you pass them by. There are four areas and you are only able to get to the other parts once you have completed certain missions. It is referred to as a terrorist threat in the game.I think what makes the game truly realistic is the minigames and side quests or activities. The ability to get on the internet in a web cafe and go to something like 40 websites is astounding. The time to create the content for this must have taken weeks to come up with. Even the police vehicles have a database where you can look up people and the most wanted in the city. In terms of realism, this city is by far the best recreation of a city and by extension the closest thing to virtual reality. The only problem I have is that you can't get to the other parts of the city until later in the game (without immediately becoming public enemy no. 1).Cars / Vehicles 4/10I'm sure plenty of people will have a problem with my take on this, but I really feel this is a weak point in the game. Granted there are tons of vehicles-something like 200 in total. My problem is not with the variety, it is purely with the controls and drive of almost all of the cars in particular. It seems as if all but 10% of them are is severe disrepair or are in need of maintenance. I've never seen so many sloppy turning vehicles in a videogame. There is so much body roll in many of the vehicles that you can go around a reasonably normal curve and easily flip a sedan. This harkens back to the realism.Unfortunately, they developers based few of these on actual physics and attempted to show that normal cars can't take a turn at 75 mph. They can however take them at 45 mph without flipping. Oh and yeah there was an invention a couple of decades ago called ABS. I had some rather high end cars skidding for half a block. If you don't believe me try it for yourself in the game and you'll find it to be true. My qualm with the cars is directly related to the fact that they are obvious replicas of some very common cars. If the cars resemble the real thing, they should drive like the real thing.The engine sounds are ok. The V8 engines don't sound bad, but the 6 cylinders have very little variance between cars. The cars also seem very slow, even if they aren't. The Comet and Turismo are a couple of the top end cars which very closely resemble some German and Italian carmakers. The only difference is acceleration can be felt between a car and a dump truck. You can always go back to the argument that they are just artificial and this is a moot point. I don't remember how the car's drove in previous GTA games, but I know they were somewhat easier to drive and much faster. It makes it considerably more difficult to run from the cops when you have a dog of a car that has a high chance of rollover, can't turn properly at over 15 mph and will slide on DRY pavement.By far the worst part is that there are only a few special vehicles (as far as I know). There is a speed boat and the Annihilator - some sort of military helicopter. The only thing I can think of here is marketing. Rockstar planned on selling better vehicles (and weapons) on Xbox Live in the near future. It is brilliant, but I'm one of those crazy people that think for $60 you should get a good amount of extras built-in.Controls 5/10I'm not really sure what they were going for here. Controls are clumsy, slow and hardly intuitive. The jump button is X? Your character actually leans when you turn while walking or running. I don't know many people that do this. The part I like the least is that Niko does everything so incredibly slow. He walks as if someone laced his drink with Ketamine. Running is not mush faster. Going along with that, if you happen to get thrown off your bike or out of your car while chasing someone you lose at least 10 seconds getting back into the car. In essence there is absolutely no point to walking if you don't have to. Controls for the cars are not bad. The triggers are the accelerator and the brake.Weapons control is ok. You can lock on to people with guns, but you also have to lock on to people with a grenade. How exactly does a grenade lock on? It takes a great deal of time to cycle through weapons if you have more than two. The helicopter is a joke. To speed up you hold the trigger and you'll simultaneously raise altitude while moving forward. You need to push the nose down to get it to go faster. This is all well and good until you try to land it. It is nearly impossible to land as you can't get the thing to stay in one position for any length of time. I almost always trash the blades. There is hardly anything different from previous GTA games. Controls are mediocre at best.Graphics 6/10The city graphics are really breathtaking. They are very detailed and quite well done. Everything looks very crisp and believable. The water especially has amazing reflective qualities. The cars look decent for the current gaming generation. There was obviously a good amount of time spent here. More importantly it is hard to fault the designers on the visuals of the vehicles because there are just so many of them. I was considerably impressed with the movement of the vehicles on the suspension.Character detail is average at best, maybe even poor. Even the main character has a very unrealistic graphic quality to it. The faces remind me of Halo 2 from the original xbox which was about four years back. The clothes look really lame. It appears as if the people are wearing construction paper. Everything in general on the people leaves a lot to be desired. They look polygonal and don't have much human quality. Despite this, the animation as always is very smooth and realistic, which I don't understand. If you are going to spend that much time on the animation mapping, why not spend more time on the people's faces.Story 8/10I was pretty impressed with the story from GTA IV. It has the makings of a good criminal story. Niko-a former Russian (or eastern European) sailor with an infamous past comes to Liberty city to get a new start and for revenge. Without giving away too much information: Niko plays the role of saboteur, hitman, hired gun, lackey, car theft extraordinaire and just all around criminal. The story follows him and his cousin Roman who owns at cab service. Along the way you'll meet new people who will have various \"jobs\" to do and some of the story will overlap with other parts of the game.Each mission has a rather lengthy movie attached to it; probably about five minutes on average. This was the only downside I could find to the story. Other than that, the movies are very informative and give you an insight into the character's personalities and life. The writing was very well done and a lot of the movies had hilarious jokes in them. I will admit I skipped a few however.ConclusionAm I happy with my purchase with Grand Theft Auto IV? No, but I was kind of expecting this. With the current trend in games moving towards ultra realism Rockstar was following suit. They are catering to an older crowd which demands more of a top notch entertainment experience instead of swing a remote at a TV. However, I'm a pure gamer and to me any of the previous GTA games is better in relation to exhilaration, which I just don't get with GTA IV. The first day I played the game I became bored very quickly after realizing there just wasn't much to do if you don't play the mission.Unfortunately there seems to be a divide between these ultra realistic games and one that are purely for fun. GTA San Andreas I felt had a great mixture of both. Sure you can still steal any car, run over people, shoot people, beat them up, but the game just falls flat on its face when it comes to heritage. Where are the insane vehicles, where is the innovation? This game is not revolutionary in any way in my opinion. In fact, when you put this up against current games on this system it is quite inferior in most ways except for playing time. But if you're bored while you're playing who cares how long the game is? Grand Theft Auto III was. It is an ok game, plain and simple and I'd give it a 6 out of 10 overall.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2008"}

In Assassin's Creed 3 you take on the role of Desmond's ancestor and Altair's descendent Connor; a half Mohawk Indian half British assassin who goes on to play an important role in the American Revolution. Honestly, Connor is definitely not a very interesting character. He comes across as wooden and very foolish as he seems to be a pawn for everyone who throws the word \"freedom\" around. As for the gameplay it leaves much to be desired. Sneaking is no longer as \"fun\" as it was in the other Assassin's Creed games. Enemies are everywhere and hiding places are very scarce. Combat isn't as fluid as it was in earlier games either. The story overall is very short as well. Probably one of the most annoying bits of the single player as well are the Desmond missions. Which really take away from the flow of the game as you are forced to perform boring missions with little to no information on what your supposed to do to begin with. The game is also full of bugs and little glitches. During fights you'll find enemies who start stretching around the screen as though they were made of rubber, bad enemy and ally AI, the occasional button command that doesn't work, or when audio doesn't seem to work properly. While its understandable that a huge game would have some hiccups there are other games that seemed to do it better. Red Dead Redemption felt a lot more bigger and more interactive than AC3 but didn't have any where near as many glitches.Enough of the negative now, as there are some redeeming qualities to the game. Main one being the naval missions. They could have probably made the whole game about this and it would have been pretty good. In the naval missions you are put in command of a ship and engage in naval warfare against pirate vessels or the British navy. A lot of these missions are challenging and fun. While the main story is short there are still a lot of side missions that you can do which I found more entertaining than the main story itself. You can build up Connor's frontier estate by helping out other settlers and trading/making certain goods, which works like a 18th century version of Harvest Moon. There are all sorts of other assassination, liberation, and hunting missions that you can do in the country side or in the major cities. Graphically this game looks very good as well. Especially during the naval battles, and wandering around in Boston and New York really does give a pretty authentic look at 1700s America. In the end Assassin's Creed 3 is not a bad game but not as fun as it's earlier predecessors.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2013"}

All of a sudden it appeared at the Video Game store.  I must say that I typically enjoy the products Black Isle puts out and I got quite excited when I saw they had released something in the Planescape setting.  I'm probably one of the few die-hard Planescape fans out there.  I own all the AD&D; books and supplements, as well as the Collectible Card Game. Also, my friends and I are slowly working through playing them all!Anyway, as for games, my favorite genres are First Person Shooters and Role Playing Games.  Once and I while I'll find a good game outside of those genres, but those typically stay my favorite, though there are naturally some flops as well.  I am pleased to say that Planescape: Torment is not the latter.  In fact this, even after these near ten years since it's release, remains as one of the top RPG's I've ever played, but that could just be my Planescape bias speaking.For those of us out there who have gotten into playing D&D; 3.5 probably won't recognize what Thaco is for, but you have to remember this is based on the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons rules.  Regardless, it still doesn't really take away from the game play, if you're a fan of the new rules.  As far as this compares against other RPG's, I was shocked that it comes with a pre-made character.  Now you do have to choose the class, so you have options in that right.  At first I was a little skeptical, but as you go into the story-line you get really into it.The story-line is what really makes the game.  Basically you don't know who you are and you interact with a world that you have to essentially rediscover because you have some sort of strange amnesia.  You awaken in the mortuary of Sigil, because the Dustmen thought you were dead.  In Planescape Sigil is basically the fulcrum city for access to everywhere else.  You get to visit many other planes in this multiverse setting and graphically it's all very impressive.  I thought this game really captured the essence and majesty that is the Planescape setting and they really put it together down to the very last detail.  I imagine this was immensly difficult considering how large this setting actually is.  Naturally it doesn't have EVERYTHING, but it captures the major points at the very least.  You come across other characters through your adventures that decide to join you in your path as well and you eventually grow a pretty strong party to face the higher levels.  So the game is partially a mystery, but there is a lot of action sequences where your character can choose to fight his way through.  In this the script is also very well written, which was something else that really impressed me about this game.This is one of the closest games I've come across that's very similar to a true D&D; campaign.  The negatives that some users might walk away with is that it really is only a single player game, so you can't join forces over the net like you can in games like Diablo.  Also you're limited to being the Nameless One and once his story line is over, it's pretty much done.  However, the ability to play in different classes throughout the game sort of makes up for this factor.  It was honestly a small negative for me because I tend to play through games only once then start a new and totally different game.  There are only a few games that I will play multiple times over and over.In the end this is an absolutely enthralling story.  I logged a lot of hours playing this game and it easily kept me occupied for a few months.  I don't play games all day for long periods of time, rather I tend to play for a few hours each day, so it takes me a long time to complete epic games of this magnitude.  If you are a die-hard Planescape fan, like me, then this is absolutely a must buy and if you're also quite the connoisseur of RPG's, then this is definitely a game to look into.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2008"}

Sounds a lot like the late 90's horror movie \"Event Horizon\".  And while that's not necessarily a bad thing, the game just didn't give me much satisfaction.  While visually a terrific looking game, and featuring sound effects realistic enough to scare your dog from the room, the gameplay is what I felt was lacking.  In between the pieces of familiar yet interesting story, you're tasked with finding this, switching on that, and shooting the two enemies that would attack from the front, and the one who would inevitably sneak up from behind.  This seemed to be the trend in every new area - the \"two in the front, one from the rear\" formula.  You advance the plot and right on cue, the music would take a sinister turn and voila, enemies would burst out of the vents.  The scares were fairly predictable and I never felt overwhelmed by the attackers.  You shoot off some legs and stomp on their heads and that would end the wave until you met the next objective.  Maybe I was expecting more due to some of the Bioshock comparisons I had read on Amazon.  The only things Dead Space and Bioshock have in common are great visuals and audio.  While not horrible, I found Dead Space more compelling due to it's story than gameplay.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2008"}

Much has been made of Dark Souls' difficulty--and rightfully so. While most games hold players' hands, this role-playing throwback drives a spike through the player's palm. This follow-up to 2009's Demon's Souls is a literal dungeon crawl--one that forces would-be adventurers to venture cautiously, fight deliberately, and explore methodically. Dark Souls sounds like work because it is. But like the brutal role-playing games of yore, Dark Souls bestows a profound sense of accomplishment upon the dedicated.If you are a fan of Demon's Souls, I should inform you that Dark Souls comes with some concessions and big changes. Gone are the hub world and having to traverse the underworld to re-inhabit your corpse to press on. In their place, respectively, are a massive, seamless world and the addition of bonfires, which function as checkpoints. However use of the checkpoints revive every enemy in the world you fought so hard to kill. And in a game where every encounter usually results in your death, you're forced to consider whether it's worth replenishing your health when you might turn a corner and get flamb&eacute;ed by a sunbathing dragon.However, having said all that, I'm not sure that Dark Souls was more difficult than Demon's Souls, not that Demon's Souls wasn't punishingly difficult. Much like Demon's Souls, there are literally areas in this game where you can get killed in less than a second from enemies that ambushed you from a small alcove; but now you can also be cursed so you only have half your total HP every time you spawn until you find the cure vendor; then be reborn as a hollow shell of your former self. It's as if From Software listened to people's complaints about Demon's Souls being too easy, and threw absurd mechanics into the game just to make it harder. And yet, I felt that many of the final bosses were quite easy toward the end of the game. With the exception of Ornstein & Smough and the Four Kings, I honestly didn't find the bosses post-Chaos Queen to be particularly difficult. Also, I didn't feel that there really was much strategy involved with the boss fights, most are simply won by rolling behind the monster and hacking away at their back. I thought that some of the bosses in Demon's Souls required a bit more strategy, but I could be mistaken.I've seen many reviews claiming that the game is \"fair,\" but that isn't necessarily true. There are plenty of cheap deaths against \"bosses\" like the Bed of Chaos, the archer area of Anor Londo, or at times the path leading immediately to a boss fight, such as in sections like the Demon's Ruins or in Anor Londo.All in all, I found the overall experience of Dark Souls to be a more difficult in terms of getting into the game, but less enjoyable (and for some reason less accessible) than Demon's Souls. I personally missed the hub world, but enjoyed the level design and atmosphere. I can't imagine this game being enjoyed by the masses; but if you're a glutton for punishment, you may get even more out of Dark Souls just because of the difficulty, and extended length.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2013"}

(I updated the review through several days)","reviewText":"AC3L Review Update: Nov 1, 2012After spending enough time with the game, I can say that the complaints are true. AC3L is the buggiest, glitchiest game that I have ever played.. None but one of these glitches are game breaking though, so I'm still having a hell of a good time with it. The biggest glitch I encountered occurred during the 2nd chapter in the Bayou. The frame-rate slowed to what I would assume is below 10fps. I don't know the technical terms, but the game was completely unplayable for about 30 seconds.  For a while I thought the system would crash, but it eventually worked itself out and I took back control. Other bugs I've experienced include:1.) A guard turning into a different NPC completely.2.) Going through a roof as if it wasn't there.3.) The game completely shut down once while I was playing. There may have been external factors (the room I was playing in had a heater on so it was really hot), but seeing as how much of a glitchy mess Liberation is, it could be just another bug.4.) Twice while loading the story mode, the system shut down completely (this was after I applied the patch). It could be a bug or I may have a defective system. We'll see.5.) The PS Vita's screen went completely dark at the beginning of a Bayou mission. Aveline was still controllable, but nothing was visible. I had to restart the mission to bypass this glitch.6.) There is an especially aggravating puzzle that requires you to tilt the PS Vita back and forth and to the sides to maneuver a ball through a maze. It is very unresponsive. When I neared the end of this tedious puzzle, the game glitched and the ball went through the walls of the maze and back to its starting point... I was pissed!7.) Many have reported save data corruption on multiple occasions. UNACCEPTABLE!For those who may be deterred by the glitches, there is a patch available that fixes a good amount of them. If you're hooked up to a wifi network, a yellow icon will appear in AC3L's launch screen. Click on that to apply the patch. This patch was a good effort by UBISoft, but it isn't good enough. The game is still infested with too many bugs. UBISoft needs to release a new fix because this is just ridiculous. I hear that the PS3's Assassin's Creed 3 also suffers from many glitches. UBISoft, get it together!Let's move on to the gameplay:The action is so satisfying. I don't know how it compares to Assassin's Creed 3 on the PS3, but Liberation's fighting is violent, sweet and best of all, easy to control. It sometimes feels like you're playing a movie during the fight scenes, especially when you're taking on multiple enemies at once.The stealth is really well done this time around. It felt forced in Bloodlines for the PSP, but the larger environments in Liberation make for so much more freedom. Take out one guard with your gun, chase another and take him out before he knows what's happening, then jump from a roof to take out the final one silently. Awesome stuff!AC3L Review Update: Nov 2nd, 2012There, I finally finished Assassin's Creed 3: Liberation. Honestly, I'm a bit conflicted. The game as a whole is pretty good. No doubt about that, but I still feel UBISoft failed in the execution of Aveline's character and her story. Its as if UBISoft just wanted to make an Assassin's Creed game with a female lead. We don't know how Aveline became an assassin. There is very little to engage the player. The story's final twist (who the company man was) didn't leave me feeling anything... at all, even though it had to have been very traumatic for Aveline.Story grievances aside, AC3L manages to shrink a console size game into a 5' screen. Seriously. This game is huge. New Orleans is very populated with a lot of side-missions to carry out and business/houses to build, and then the Bayou. Jesus christ I love the Bayou map. It is gigantic and it also features one of the best viewpoints of Liberation.  There are other great locales as well but this review is already running a little too long.In conclusion:7/10 - Very good game but I think it could've been handled with a little more care. The bugs don't kill the experience completely, but the amount of glitches that are present in the game makes you wonder who the hell was in charge of quality assurance. The story though presented well is uninteresting. The gameplay is very very fun. Overall I would recommend it, but be aware that you WILL come across many bugs. The game would be an 8/10, perhaps 9/10 were it not for these glitches.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"aka TRAP","summary":"Amazing story, OK gameplay","reviewText":"This was my first time playing a Mass Effect game, which I wouldn't even be able to say if my friend hadn't bought the game and let me watch him play it.  It looked like it could be fun, so I gave it a few runs while he wasn't playing.  Luckily for me, he went home the past weekend, allowing me to take his 360 into my dorm room and finally finish the game.For those that don't like reading long reviews, I'll summarize it for you.  The storyline made me want to play the previous titles.  The gameplay didn't.Mass Effect 3 continues from the events of the last game.  That's about all I can tell you story-wise since I don't want to spoil the very little I know.  However, I CAN say the storyline is a very-well written one.  There are many different twists and turns in the plot (granted the ending is very disappointing if you don't believe in the Indoctrination Theory.....Google it), and anytime a game makes me Google bits and pieces of the story to gather more information, you know the story was an amazing one.  The style of the story-telling isn't as good as Uncharted in my opinion, but I still enjoyed it very much.What made the game less enjoyable, and a times a bit of a drag to play, was the many glitches and how it played.  There were times where Shepard's powers simply didn't work, no matter how many times I pressed the button(s) I mapped them to.  Because of this, I would, for example, try to do a Biotic Charge to replenish my shields, only to end up dying because the game isn't responding to my inputs.  Another thing that bothers me is some of the animation of the characters.  Too many times will a character turn around, but their head will decide \"Nah, I'm going to stay right here\", to the point where it looks like the motion of their body broke their own necks.  It doesn't happen once in a blue moon, either.  There will be times where the voices simply won't work if you skip cutscenes too quickly.  For example, if I skip a couple of the cutscenes on the final mission, the ambient noise drowns out the actual dialogue, even though the subtitles are still telling me what is being said.The gameplay feels like Gears of War, but made by amateurs.  The movement feels a bit sluggish to me, and is not as fluent as even the first Gears.  There are times where Shepard will try to vault over an object, but won't make it over (a la Battlefield 3 before the recent patch), sometimes I'll latch onto walls when I'm trying to pick up something, while looking directly at it, and it's also not painless to get away from cover.Overall, if it weren't for the story, I would've given this game a 2.5.  I think it's very disappointing that we still have companies that can't avoid simple bugs in games and it's 2012.  It's almost as if developers are going to the publishers saying, \"The game is playable, but there still are a few bugs that we have yet to fix\", and the publisher responds, \"PERFECT!  Start shipping the game\", eagerly waiting for their bank accounts to increase.  It's not a horrible case in Mass Effect 3 (I'm talking to you, Resistance 3), but that doesn't mean I'm willing to let it slide.  But because the gameplay isn't horrid, and the story is simply amazing, I can't help but give it four stars.  If you're new to the series, I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I do; even more if you're a fan of RPG games/games with RPG-elements.  I'm not a huge fan of them, but I still really like this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00004SVYE","description":"Sequel to the popular Legend of Zelda game, by Nintendo, for the original NES console.","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"The Failure of Link?","reviewText":"Zelda II: The Adventure of Link* is the black sheep of the Zelda franchise.  One of the most controversial games of that era, players sent a clear message to Nintendo, saying the sequel didn't live up to its predecessor.  People still bought it, but the general consensus was it was not as good as the original \"Legend of Zelda\".  The biggest controversy of this game was it was a 2D scroller, instead of an overhead game like the original was.  You navigated in an overhead view.  Then the battles and actual dungeons are in the side scrolling format. Another big factor is this game is HARD.  VERY HARD.  It's also the only Zelda where you collect lives.  If you run out of lives and continue, instead of starting back at a particular dungeon's beginning, you begin at the very start of the game.  When we're talking about trying to beat the Great Palace, this turns into a nightmare.  There is also an unwieldy magic and leveling up system.  The magic continued in the Zelda series.  The leveling did not.  But because it was such a radical departure, and not wholly successful, Zelda II is viewed as a flawed, if interesting, game.The Zelda name does great damage here, because people come in expecting overview.  Zelda II tries to be innovative with an uneasy hybrid of side-scrolling and overworld.  Had it been released as just a fantasy game, I think Zelda II would be something of a cult classic.  As it stands, people constantly judge this game on the Zelda name alone, instead of giving the game a chance.  That's what really hurts Zelda II.Zelda II is a misunderstood game.  The true question, which cannot be answered, is this: \"What would the public think if this had been released first, instead of The Legend of Zelda?\"  Who knows?  No one does.  People expected the wrong things from this game.  People wanted traditional Zelda action, and this game didn't have that.  It's a hybrid of overhead and platform gaming.  This was one of Nintendo's biggest missteps in its history.  They had misread the audience.  All this has forever damaged Zelda II.  It will always be viewed from the perspective it is not as good as the other Zelda games.Without Zelda II, the structure of this seminal series would be drastically different.  In terms of lessons learned, this is by far the most important game in the series.  What if Nintendo hadn't done this game?  It is possible they might have tried the hybrid on SNES version.  Nintendo learned from its mistake, and never tried this again.  In the Zelda context, that is a good thing.Zelda is a great series, and without this under their belt, Nintendo might have put out a disappointing Zelda game at a much more crucial time in the series' evolution.  It's a great game in and of itself, and had it been redesigned in terms of story and not making it Zelda, it would be considered a classic.  But for Zelda it doesn't go with the others, and Nintendo learned what the public wants in a Zelda game.  In terms of sticking to the formula, this is the best thing that ever happened to Zelda.  If they had not released this game on the NES, they might have tried the hybrid experiment on the SNES game, and instead of getting what is arguably the greatest game on the SNES, and in the Zelda series, we would get a game like this.  Then, we wouldn't get a  game for the SNES comparable to Link to the Past.  If Nintendo had not made this game, they would have made this mistake (remember, it's a mistake only in context of the series) at a much worst time.What about Super Maria Brothers 3?  Although Zelda II was viewed as a disappointment, I think it had direct influence on SMB 3.  SMB 3 is the game Zelda II could have been.  SMB 3 successfully combined a type of overview world, but then you moved and played the stages.  Of course, the world in Zelda II was much more expansive.  The SMB series was already a side scroller.  It is hailed as one of the greatest NES games ever released.  And yet, earlier when they tried the same thing with Zelda II, it was viewed as a disappointment because Zelda was not a side scroller to begin with.  Nintendo took the hybrid idea into Mario, of which it was much more suited.  Mario was not an overview game to begin with.  When they did make the hybrid, they stuck with the basically formula of side scrolling, but they had a little overview too.In this view, Zelda II is out of balance.  In the series' context, they should have made more of the action overview, instead of all side-scrolling.  Some main parts of the game should be like that though, but then there should be more old-school Zelda overview.  As it stands in the series, its out of balance.  But without it, we might not have the hybrid of the overview/side scrolling found in SMB 3 and Super Mario World, which both are great games.  Independently, Zelda II stands proud.After all these years, Zelda II still occupies that weird uncle status in the Zelda family tree.  I personally think that it's a great game.  It stands as a failure in the context of the series.  Had it been released without the Zelda moniker, I think history and players would have been much more receptive to this charming (if entirely too difficult) game.*An interesting note about its title.  This is the only Zelda game it incorporate the numerical sequence into its official title.  Its also the only title in the series that does not have \"The Legend of Zelda\" in it.  Its just \"Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.\"  It sounds better than \"The Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link.\"  Too long I guess for those days","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2004"}

It was impressed with the look and feel of the game.  Ace Combat 5 effectively helps me to relive the same enjoyment I had playing the first game.AC5 does a fantastic job of putting you in the pilot's seat of a fighter jet.  The realism is astounding.  Plane models look just like real jets, with good detail and believable movement.  There are multiple viewpoints available both inside the cockpit and out that can be adjusted.  The landscapes in certain missions are stunning to see from 2000 feet in the air.  Finally, instant replays with adjustable angles appear after the completion of a mission (or in the event of the player's untimely death).  They're reminiscent of the cool-looking replays in Gran Turismo 3.The music is movie-quality and suits whatever action is taking place.  As for sound effects, I don't think they could have been any better.  For example, the farther away you are from an enemy when it's destroyed the longer the sound from the explosion takes to reach your ears.  If possible, use a 5.1 stereo system with AC5.  It sounds awesome.There's a nice variety of missions, and none are excessively long.  Once the campaign mode is complete you can replay any mission from that mode singularly.  With 50 models of jets to unlock and use there's plenty of reason to keep playing.As if all these pros weren't enough, AC5's story isn't bad either.  How rare to witness a well told, positive moral in a video game.  Communication between pilots during missions adds character depth and makes the gameplay more involving.  Some players have complained about the audio chatter being annoying but I didn't find it bothersome.At it's core Ace Combat 5 is a game with heart.

The horse takes a while to get used to, but once you have the hang of galloping and using cruise control, it's very smooth. The open world of the wild west looks incredible on HD sets, the sunset, stars at night, a lot of things are done right in this game.There seems to be a lot to do in the game in the beginning, sidequests, shooting/skinning animals, breaking horses (lasso & ride), playing cards, and a 5 finger knife game. There are outfits to be unlocked, guns to be purchased, and properties to buy, all the standard GTA type of things. After getting over the first few hours, the game gets pretty boring with the plot filled with good voice acting but boring storyline. This is when the realization hits that shooting the same skinned bandits feels tired and the towns are almost all the same except some being in worse shape than others, while the missions lacks the hilarity and mayhem as the older GTA's.The online mode is fun for a short time but the 3rd person online shooter gameplay is better developed by games like Warhawk and Uncharted2. The game modes feature something like team deathmatch (gangfight), free for all, and capture the flag with the gold bags. The online mode is a nice addition to the game with a unique free-roam system that reminds me of Burnout Paradise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2010"}

Dean \"John\"","summary":"Absolutely outstanding, stunning in every way","reviewText":"I'm an avid gamer, have been since the space invaders and asteroids when I was a kid.  I do a lot of gaming, and have three different types of consoles (three xbox 360's, a PS3, and a Wii).  It's a great way for me to relax from work.  So I've done a lot of games, and written many reviews on them.  But most end up falling short somehow, no matter how enjoyable they are.  It may just be the control layout, buttons used, or SOMETHING.  Something that really detracts from all the other strengths.  It's incredibly rare to get one that just is absolutely perfect on every single level, but once again, these folks seem to have done it.Oblivion was one of my all time favorite games on the Xbox.  I played it to death, got all the DLC, and kept playing long after I \"won\" the story lines.  Just such an immersive environment, so enjoyable to sink myself into.  So I had high hopes for this title, and they certainly delivered.Graphics are fantastic.  Granted, I think the new Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 had nicer overall graphics, so there ARE games out there that do better, but in this instance, in no way a detraction, and I may not have even noticed it much except I had played COD 3 nights straight after it came out to win it before this title was released, so I had just spent many hours in COD immediately preceding playing this game.  But while they may not be as good as COD, they exceeded the graphics from Oblivion and are just smooth and breathtaking.  The vistas from on high, the mist, the smoke from things, it's just a visual smorgasbord.But where they excel, always, is gameplay.  Smooth combat, and I think the best control layout and options since Halo 1...  There's never a time that I complain about the controls because the layout is so good that it just feels natural.This is also the first time I've played a game on its release day and had so many hours into it without any lockups or bugs.  It wasn't until about 40 hours of actual gameplay that I finally found one - an autosave point after I won a big boss battle, and going back to it was flawed because I'd fall through the floor into a previous level that was not locked out because of how the door closed and sealed once you entered the final boss room.  So I was stuck and couldn't go anywhere to complete things.  I just reverted to the save I had before the boss battle and won the fight again, this time saving it manually at a point that my character wasn't just completing a fighting move.  No issues since then.The customization of the character in the beginning is again about the best one I've come across, and the most detailed.  Let me get a character looking exactly how I wanted it.The storyline is pretty sweeping as well, and easy to get caught up in.  And the amount of area to wander is just mind boggling.  I haven't even hit the \"you cannot go here\" message yet, and I've gone incredible distances in all directions.The challenge even at the middle difficulty setting is pretty astonishing as well, some of the big bosses just annihilate you within two or three seconds of hitting you.  But usually there's a way to stay alive (using trees or rock formations and such to keep between you and the big boss while you snipe at them around the edges) and the only time there wasn't, I had to actually wimp out and drop it down a difficulty level to get past it.  Which is another nice thing they have, is how you can adjust the difficulty level in the middle of something without having to restart.  Then when you're past whatever you couldn't get past, hop it up again.  I'll come back to this fight later (I keep all my major save points) and see if I can eventually do it without dropping it down.The choice of weapons is nice, and the ways to modify them and customize your own really adds that immersive touch to the game.Interactions with NPC's isn't as bad as most other games of the genre, and the fact that you can hit the button to jump them to the next line of conversation is a lifesaver for people who don't want to listen the sometimes longwinded speeches given in response to a question.The new way of choosing your perks is pretty neat, a great visualization of constellations for each of your skills.  It gives a great instant visual overview of where you're strong, where you're weak.It took me just a couple nights of playing COD after hours to win the game, but I've been playing this one for nearing or passing 40 hours now and I'm still nowhere near done.  I'm not rushing through it, since there's so much to do on the sides, but that's one of the things that their games really excelled at - playability.  It's not just a linear \"go here do this\" every single step of the way.All in all, one of the most solid games I've gotten in years.  This one will definitely be one of the top contenders for Game of the Year, no question.  And it would certainly get MY vote.Edit 11/28/11:  Took one star off - game is still awesome, but I'm just very frustrated and tired of the lockups that finally happened.  I was very happy that it appeared, for the first 30 or 40 hours of gameplay, to finally be one of their first games that didn't lock up on me, but after I hit about 40 or so hours, it locks up regularly, forcing me to hard power off the Xbox and back on again to get it working.  Save your game often, you never know when you're going to get hosed with a lockup...  From what I see in the forums, there are a LOT of people with this issue so hopefully there's an update at some point to address it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2011"}

Need a new CPU? How about some more RAM? You're going to need it with the revolutionary CryEngine 3 that powers Crysis 3. Graphics are the first thing that people think of when a new Crysis game comes out and will their rig run it. Note to console gamers: The PS3 and 360 versions don't even come close to the maxed out DirectX 11 version on PC. It looks great on consoles, pushes them to the max, but looks like crap compared.You are Prophet or Lawrence Barnes. The story picks up right after Crysis 2 where the Alpha Ceph is trying to harvest and annihilate all of mankind. It's up to your and the ex-nanosuit wearing Psycho to stop them. You have the help of rag-tag rebel resistance who are all but helpless without you. The first thing that Crysis 3 fixes is the linearity and confinement to the city. It's a mix of both here. It's not as open as Crysis 1, but you have large open areas where you can decide if you want to go stealth or shoot everyone up. You can use your visor to tag enemies which is one of the best tactical elements you have in the game. This time around you can upgrade your nanosuit by giving yourself longer cloaking time, dampen bullets, increase stealth kill damage and various other things. You can still customize your weapons and there are quite a few of them.The best addition to Crysis 3 is the tech bow. This thing is just awesome and lets you kill people without reducing your energy for cloaking. You can choose your draw strength and ammo type. Each arrow is an instant kill and feels satisfying. You can also hack this time around so an enemy turret can wipe out a small force for you while you hide. These small things make Crysis much more enjoyable than the near bore-fest of Crysis 2. The game was solid, but was lacking in gameplay elements. The hacking, tech bow, and upgraded tactical visor really make the game more intense and fun. The AI is also improved and the game is much harder. Towards the end of the game I was dying left and right. The new Ceph enemies are tough as nails, but by the end you get to feel the ultimate power of the nanosuit. By the end of the game you can supercharge your nanosuit and become invincible for short periods of time. Don't think this is cheating, it feels great after sneaking around and feeling vulnerable all the time.When it comes to the story you will be completely lost if you haven't been following along, even people who have will be a bit lost. The story doesn't really add anything or make it more interesting. Honestly, I had no idea what was happening half the time and I played all the games. The story has a lot of potential, but just isn't fleshed out like it could have been. At least there are some more scripted cinematic events which is part of why Crysis 2 was boring. There still isn't enough though. After a while you feel you are just trudging through wave after wave of Ceph and Cell troops.The multiplayer is a little more fun, but not something you will come back to a year from now. Multiplayer is solid, but it isn't much different from the second game. Honestly, after Crytek pretty much abandoned Crysis 2 shortly after release I really don't want to devote much time to multiplayer. At least the game only had a few bugs and has more graphics settings unlike the second game. The graphics are freaking amazing with water tessellation, ambient occlusion, SSAA, and various other DX11 effects. Even with everything set to low it still looks pretty damn good. There is no DX9 mode though, it is strictly DX11 on PC so make sure you have a GPU that supports it.Overall, Crysis 3 adds just enough to make it feel really solid and go out with a bang. There are a few fun scripted moments, the tech bow is awesome, and the graphics will blow you away, but in the end it doesn't do a whole lot different from Crysis 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2013"}

We were looking forward to seeing what this new Rabbids game had to offer and how it took advantage of the Kinect system.There are two main modes of gameplay.In the first mode, you play either by yourself or with or against a few friends. Each game has its own settings in terms of whether you can play it on its own or with others. That is, a few games need to be played with others and can't be played alone. But most can be played alone.The games are nicely varied. In some games you're whapping with your hands at rabbids as they stream by in trains. In another you're pretending to swim like a fish in a stream. You stomp on the floor as rabbids pop up. You hide from search lights, pose like insane bodybuilders, play pong with your body, and even play air guitar.In the second mode, it puts you into \"party mode\". You can have HUGE numbers of friends all create temporary profiles complete with their photo and catch phrase. Each person goes up one by one, spins a wheel, and takes on an activity. Sometimes the player can drag another person in to compete with or against them.There's also a screen where you interact with a rabbid, but this mode is fairly weak - all you can do is put hats or glasses on the rabbit, or get them to do silly things. Half the time the rabbid is off the bottom of the screen and you have no idea what they are doing.On one hand I enjoy some of the games - but you would think at this stage in Kinect's life cycle that they would be much better about developing to work with it. We had numerous problems with the games.In one game you're pumping with one hand while shooting orange goo with the other. I appreciate that the game tries to \"auto sense\" if you are right handed or left handed in terms of which hand is shooting and which is pumping. However, when you play with two people, it mixes up the players and tends to randomly swap pumps from side to side, making the game challenging to play.In the game where you're stomping the rabbids in the floor, even though every other Kinect game we play has ample floor space, for whatever reason this one tried to put the rabbids UNDER our futon and we couldn't stomp them.This kind of issue was present in several of the games.Also, the loading screens are rather extreme. It seems every action you try to take ends up resulting in a 30In addition, I am not very keen on the party section of this game, which is marketed at kids, being a \"drinking game\". I realize they call it \"carrot juice\" in the game - but they're still talking about \"take a drink\" and hammering that point home. I don't like the idea of training anybody to take drinks while playing games - whatever the drink is - because it is a mentality that too easily translates.Still, those points being made, some of these games are still quite a lot of fun. I love the posing game and the make-the-shadow-shape game. The air guitar game is fun as well. The benefit of this kind of mix-of-games situation is that every person can choose their favorites and replay them.So I'll give this 4/5 stars, with the caveats that I think the Rabbids team should have done more testing to work out some of these issues before release.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2011"}

They are all indistinguishable from one another - all involve saving the world, all involve similar tactics, and 10 minutes into such a game, you have a firm, \"been there, done that\" vibe. I played and greatly enjoyed Bioshock 1 and 2, because they were set in a very unique and atmospheric setting, and had a great story-line as well.By the time of this review, this game as long been out and reviewed to death. Still, I wanted to throw in my two cents because I have now played through the entire game and feel it deserves every bit of critical praise heaped upon it.You play as Booker Dewitt, an ex-Pinkerton sent to a city in the clouds to rescue a girl. It is set in the early 1900's. You have plasmids (like in Bioshock) but they are called Vigors here. The story is quite good, the voice-acting is outstanding, and the action is fresh, with plenty of action. About half way through it started to feel a bit repetitive, as most shooters do, but once I understood that I needed to be upgrade my Vigors, I started using them more creatively and the combat finally clicked for me.The graphics and colors in this world are stunning. It was amazing how much detail and thought went into even the smallest details, details you would miss unless you were looking carefully. The game ended, and I found myself searching the internet to see if others shared my interpretation of it. The overall story is quite thought provoking - something I expect from a book or good movie, not a game. Play it yourself and see. I don't want to risk spoiling anything, but if you love a good story in an FPS (think Half-life 2, or the original Deus-ex) this game is worth a look. At first blush it may seem more of the same, but it isn't. This is a modern day masterpiece - an overused phrase but once that applies here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00005MI42","description":"Some things never change and for us, that's good news. For example, Mario's archrival, Wario he's looking good on the Game Boy Advance, but he's still the same money-crazed hooligan who starred in some of the greatest handheld platformers of all time. This time around, the story of a golden pyramid is enough to send the big blowhard racing off to the nearest jungle. Sure enough he finds the big brick triangle, but before he can collect the loot he'll have to undergo a brain- and body-bending series of challenges. Four guardians stand jealously over the four sections of the pyramid. Wario will either have to defeat each guardian or activate a switch and escape before time runs out. No longer invincible, Wario will have to replenish his health meter by gathering pieces of heart. Wario will have to undergo even more dramatic transformations before the big showdown with the head honcho of the golden pyramid.","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"Wario Land 4 Lives Up to His Name And the Standards","reviewText":"Get your greed face on and let us muster gluttony for the precious riches within a mysterious pyramid.  Mario's flipped persona arrives in his latest installment that is Wario Land 4.  Perusing through a newspaper and driven to the untouched riches of a recently discovered wonder, the ever so dogged Wario is oblivious to the demises of earlier attempts.  Up for the thrill and as money-hungry as America's lovable politicians (ha-ha), Wario seeks out the pyramid.As 2D side-scrollers go, Wario Land 4 lives up to the portable gaming standards.  Using the incredible power of the GBA, a whole new height of action is consigned for players.  Squeezing high results, their new disposal consists of Wario's truckload of expert moves like his mighty butt stomp, the decisive bash, the swift slide, and much, much more.  With his new array of techniques, the overtly fat Wario earns a thumbs-up for his trickier side of side-scrolling gaming.  Besides collecting items to complete the stages, Wario must now go deep into guarded enemy territory and keep his guard on his health.  Wario's life, now embodied as heart containers, must be sustained by dodging attacks.  If the containers drain clear, the player is tossed back to the stage's entrance and as a penalty, loses all items found.  Some areas in the pyramid are to be advanced by the help of enemies.  Wario must proceed towards certain  enemies and imitate their special property.  Wario goes through a type of metamorphosis if successfully in contact with an enemy.  There are also quite a few screen-filling bosses the players square off against.  Clever ways of attacking them must be utilized in order to defeat the overgrown menaces.  If the player has any snag, he can simply purchase power-ups at a shop then vanquish the colossal brutes.  Lastly the three dandy mini-games such as the home run derby, match the face game, and doge the whizzing objects, add to enhance the replay value.  Difficulty-wise, Wario Land 4 proves to be as painless as old-schooling gaming can get.Wario Land 4 is a great 2D platform and shows with its bountiful stages.  Fast, smooth, and clean gameplay is generally found everywhere with the gaudy graphics.  Let's face it, there is no other finer side-scrolling on the market right now (other than the Castlevania one), and this is a portable title gone the extra mile.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2001"}
{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"This is one...massive game","reviewText":"After the massive success of GTA III and Vice City, Rockstar has come back with a different spin on the story and created a massive playing field. This game to call it huge is just simply understatement.  Not all is well in San Andreas and I'll get to that.Story: Instead of mafia, it's more gang/mafia oriented. CJ skipped town after his brother and mother were gunned down. 5 years later, he returns and decided to step up and take control. He'll be taken to no less than 3 cities and meet interesting characters along the way.Graphics: I don't know what Rockstar was thinking. You have 3 cities, a plethora of options and minigames...all on one disc? Star Ocean 3 and Shadow Hearts 2 both game with 2 discs. Why didn't Rockstar do the same? To show the power of one disc? If so, it succeeds and fails. Graphics looks meh and there's slowdown but still, traversing big area with no load times? Nice.Sound/Music: Like any cities, you have control of 8 radio stations, each playing different music. But they could've picked better songs cause unlike Vice City where any station was worth listening to, here I'm only choosing 2 to 3.  Voice acting's nice with Sam Jackson, James Woods along with some others supplying voices. One thing: there is a LOT of swears and I don't mean S or A words, I'm talking F, n**** and loads others.Gameplay: I don't know why developers think that a difficult and annoying mission is \"fun\". Some are 3 part missions: one mission I had to drop off a ho, then gun down someone beating on a ho, then go save another one, THEN shoot down 2 cars taking off with one of them. And if you've been to message boards, the mission \"Supply Lines\" is probably one of the worst I've seen. There's 3 things in your way: 1)your plane can't drive worth ****. You got 5 couriers to shoot down, all spaced out, and 3) you have fuel which means by the time you actually do all that, you probably don't even have enough to get back to the roof.As for the rest of it, there's welcome and not-so-welcome changes. Now you got stamina, muscle, fat, sex appeal and skills to worry about. More stamina, more time running without getting tired. Muscle means stronger melee attacks. Fat's just there so that your muscle doesn't go down when running/training but the fat instead. And sex appeal gets you chicks. One mission way later on makes you take a girl on a bunch of dates to get a keycard and it takes awhile. Control's schemes roughly the same with some changes.This is a game that has unbelievable hype behind it and you play it and you notice some things that bug you. For me it was mission tediousness(they're usually fetch quests: go kill him, go pick this up etc) and some graphics issues but nonetheless definately give this a try but prepare to die/fail...a lot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2004"}

The game throws you into battle with little intro and the way you fight is unlike any other game out there.  But, if you are patient with yourself and learn the controls, and like a challenge, you'll very likely enjoy the combat. It is worth mentioning that the combat is only partly turn-based.  Once you start shooting with a character, you are fighting in real time until that character's turn has ended.  I prefer a more carefully planned turn-based combat.  The real time combat involves a certain amount of luck and perhaps a bit more luck than I would like.The framerate is solid.  There's normal mapping effects on everything to make things look shiny and shimmery. It is distracting rather than good looking.The story is darker than usual for a JRPG which is fine with me.  The world isnt very interactive though and you'll see the same characters roaming the streets of the towns over and over again.I would have liked more choices about how to build the 3 characters (since this is an RPG) but there's actually little one can choose except mods on weapons.  That sounds fun but you quickly realize there isnt that much complexity to modding a weapon.  In fact that's my only real complaint:  There's exactly 14 weapons in the game and not a lot of meaningful choices for modding them.  There's different bullet types but those are expensive and basically meant for boss fights.  None of the 3 characters have special abilities to make them different from each other short of some hit point differences.  So basically it is a great combat engine, but there's not a whole lot of \"rpg\" going on.  The fights occur in a variation of the same place every time:  there's some destructible walls and boxes but that's all you'll see in the fighting areas over and over again.There's some repetition and grinding along the way to level up -- that's pretty standard in a JRPG but here the characters dont get new abilities along the way and the comabt for all of its fun, starts to get old.Overall it is a solid JRPG, but more like a B+ than an A-","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2010"}

It even comes with a demo for Resident Evil 3 Nemesis! That said, this is not Resident Evil. It has similar controls and a story a little too silly to understand, but that is it.The game is dependant on your ability to craft darts or find bullets to kill the enemys of the game. You will never have enough ammo to march through the compound and kill every enemy. You will need to run, close doors, operate lazer gates, and ect to get through this game.There are puzzles as well, none that I can immediately remember except for the puzzle where you move cargo holds to make a path.The enemies are excellent. This game has dinosaurs that look and feel like Jurrasic Park dinosaurs. The raptors are vicious and terrifying, the pterradactyles are a situational enemy but they are a thrilling challenge, the dome-headed dinosaurs show up and kick your can, and the Tyrannosaurus Rex is simply great. The enemys are so well used in the game that they are completely plausable. They take a great deal of damage and are fast and strong enough to rip you apart.I give this game praise for going away from the zombie threat and replacing them with something exceedingly more violent and threatening. I love zombie games more than the next guy, but this was just good. The story was B-Movie, just like in Resident Evil, and the enemys were terrifying and threatening.

It isn't, however, going to put Wizards of the Coast out of business. Here is why.The Aurora toolset is powerful- very powerful. Probably too powerful, as it is difficult to learn and slow to use. I'm a computer programmer that has also acted as a pen and paper Dungeon Master, yet I still haven't quite worked up the urge to delve into all those tutorials and menus. The main problem with building your own modules is that you have to pick and place everything, which takes literally forever. Also, the editor has some odd quirks and limitations, and if you use hacks or scripts can screw up the game very easily. You are well advised to backup everything before you do anything.The single play campaign is very long and quite challenging. The plot is good, and the characters have more than one dimension. Unfortunately, it shares some of the elements of the only other 3rd edition D&D; CRPG- Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor. That is to say, there are way too many dumb 'Fed Ex quests,' and the graphics seem squarish and get very repetitive. It is still a good deal better than that game, however, as combat is actually fun and the NPCs do more than just tell you to go somewhere and find something.As for stability issues, if you don't hack there probably won't be too many. However, once in a while you might encounter inexplicable and often serious bugs. For example, sometimes items vanish or stop working for no apparent reason. I've also seen savegames get corrupted, which is bad but not impossibly so, since you can export and restart a chapter. It's advisable you keep several saves and update them at intervals in case something breaks.Aside from its flaws, NWN has a great look and 3rd Edition feel. The rules aren't nearly as faked as they are in Pool of Radiance, though some spells and feats are modified to be workable with the real-time system. That said, not all of the rules are implemented, but quite a few are. I have to admit I was astonished at how thorough a job BioWare did... although my opinion might be skewed due to having played through the entire Pool of Radiance game (still can't believe I did that). As is to be expected, the spells look fantastic, and combat is generally exciting and fun. You'll encounter scores of different monsters, and they each look unique and well done.The interface is easy to learn, especially for veterans of Baldur's Gate or similar games. As with its 2-D predecessor, you can pause the game to issue commands. You do not control a party any longer, however, and can have at most three followers (a henchman, familiar/animal companion, and summoned creature). The followers' artificial intelligence is passing, but not too great. Perhaps the community or BioWare will improve on it with future patches. If there's one thing at all that hasn't changed in the makeover from Infinity engine to Aurora, it has to be the path-finding. It's still horrible, and despite the fact that I like NWN in general, I can't think of an excuse for this. It's as if BioWare has been deaf to player's comments for the last few years... I hope they remedy it somehow.Despite its pitfalls, Neverwinter Nights goes a long way to addressing the need for a customizable computer D&D; experience. It is definitely a revolutionary step up from Baldur's Gate in terms of this aspect, and it has a great deal of potential. I am looking forward to seeing what BioWare is going to do with this proprietary engine in the future. For now, all those who enjoyed the Infinity engine games or wish to try out a D&D; CRPG are heartily encouraged to get a copy of Neverwinter Nights.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Dave","summary":"Excellent Game Online Detracts","reviewText":"This game is amazing, and I hate to give it less than 5 stars but bear with me.First the good: It's a massive game, vibrant and with graphical improvements over GTA IV that will make you wonder how they can do that on the exact same console. The sounds and sights are great, the range of vehicles, sub games and activities is massive. There are far less friend interactions and dating and such than GTA IV, but there's still plenty to do.The controlls are excellently refined and easy to use. It makes having three characters to switch between not only an easy experience, but also a lot of fun. Got stuck? Switch characters and come back in a couple game hours. Want some extra fun, leave one character at a block and switch to another - drive back to that block and watch them interact.Remember the witch hunt for the hidden/unfinished/unpublished sex games in GTA III? Well guess what - GTA V makes up for some lost time with nudity - male flaccid and female breasts in single player. There are some good side quests with additional sex content as well.The game is more scripted and plays a little bit more like a movie. It is over quicker than other GTAs I thought.It's a little less &#34;realistic&#34; for many things than previous games. The violence is a little muted, cars don't damage as easily and handle better than other GTAs.The downside is they are prioritizing development for the online side of things. If you like the online experience then you're in luck and that's probably a 6th star instead of a subtraction. If you're even just slightly not thrilled with it, then you realize quickly that you are losing out in single player mode. You have access too fewer updates, fewer cars, less content. And of course they want you to pay extra money for the online stuff. Not a reason to not buy the game, but it is disappointing if you're happy playing single player and start to realize that until the next paid DLC, you're out of luck.Also, this game really isn't for 12 year olds. The fact that you hear them playing online all the time is really disappointing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2014"}

I'll admit - so was I.I was impressed at how well the steering worked.  Now, renting it, we didn't get a wheel, but I was glad to see that you can hold the wiimote flat - buttons up - and tilt it side to side just as well as you can hold it buttons-facing-you and tilt it.  Once I learned this, it became more comfortable to play.But it didn't become more fun.  There seems to be some argument over the value of the game as a single-player.  I can say first-hand that we had more fun playing together than either of us did on our own.Mario Kart Wii just bombards you.  You can be sitting in first place, minding your business, just driving along when a Koopa shell hits you.  You fly into the air, land on your wheels, your character shakes his head, and WAM - some \"POW\" block goes off, sending you flying into the air again.  You land, shake your head, and WHACK - another character smacks into you, forcing you to wait while the car spins in place - shake your head AGAIN - and finally drive off.  You're now last place, and have sat there for probably 10 seconds while shouting \"Come on!!!!\"This doesn't happen ALL the time, but you can be confident that when it does, you'll be restarting the race, or quitting altogether.  Sometimes you can get out of this - the best (and really only way I've seen so far) is if you're carrying a Koopa shell yourself - you can launch it backwards to thwart off the first attack.  However, with the POW block, the ink-squirting squid, and the homing \"blue shell\" that's been mentioned elsewhere, you're pretty much S.O.L.  The only good thing is that with some of the attacks - like the POW block, the lightning bolt - it affects everyone around you.  So unless the second place character launched it, you probably won't lose your position.  But in general it becomes frustrating, and I don't think that randomly generated \"frustration\" equates to what some might consider a \"challenge.\"Now, I don't want to hear any of you Wii-addicts start going on about \"Oh you have to have the skill.\"  I've said it once and I'll say it again - you're controlling a little cartoon character in a go-kart by tilting a piece of plastic.  There's little skill involved.  I drive a 2000 Dodge Viper GTS coupe - I truly understand the art of \"driving skills.\"  Mario Kart Wii is nothing like driving a Dodge Viper!  :)I think the game would be fun with a lot of people - when it's more of a free-for-all, and not the computer SEEMING like it gangs up on the human player.  But I played it for maybe 2, 3 hours, and I'm done.  I won't play it again, and I won't miss it.  On a good note, it's presentation, control interface, and playability is better than most Wii games to date.  My demerits are more against content and gameplay than anything else.  It works very well - it just irritates you in the process!I won't say skip it.  It might be just your cup of tea.  Just maybe rent it before you buy.  These days, it's very easy to waste money on video games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2008"}

It is a franchise that demands more than cookie-cutter remakes that many game developers have been putting out as of late.  It is easy to create a lot of hype over a game and then have that hype kill the game when it doesn't meet the insane expectations.That said, Mario Kart Wii meets all expectations and even goes a little beyond.One of the first things I was looking forward to was the unique interface that the Wii puts on just about everything.  The steering wheel was what I was looking forward to the most since I thought I would get complete control of the character.  I must admit, the wheel is VERY responsive... almost too responsive.  It is very easy to any beginner or even a veteran to overcompensate and steer into a wall, especially if they're not used to a free-floating steering wheel.However, we did find that the wheels were critical if one wanted to use the Wii remotes accurately.  It is a real pain to steer without a wheel attachment.  We literally had to go out and purchase three more wheels because the remotes felt so awkward without one.  We later just threw down the remotes and ended up using the gamecube controllers (which you can use) since we're not only used to it but it seems to have much better control.The next thing I was looking forward to were the new menus, characters, vehicles etc.  I was really pleased with the motor bikes included in the game and their exclusive features.  I personally found the Flame Cycle with Waluigi to be my personal favorite.  It was great they brought back all the old characters and, more importantly, they took out all the unfair advantages some had over others.  Now, everyone is not scrounging to play as King Boo or the Plant thingy.  I thought it was awesome that I was able to unlock my own Mii to play.One of the things that really impressed me was the reinvention of retro courses from classic systems including the gamecube, the SNES, Gameboy Advance etc.  It was nice to see old courses that I was familiar with.  I kinda wish they would've brought back Baby Park from the Gamecube since that was one of our favorite places to do battle.The items were kinda iffy.  We were really annoyed at the Bloopers, that shower your screen with dark ink so you can't see temporarily.  It was cute at first but then it got really annoying.  The \"hot potato\" lighting cloud is probably the most annoying; it would tag you and after a certain time, detonate.  You could pass it off to another opponent by bumping them but if you're in first, alone or otherwise far behind you are screwed.  This item, they could've done without.The menus were the next iffy part.  It took me a while to figure out how to switch the 1st player mode from the Wii remote to the Gamecube controller.  You are also seemingly limited to how you team up with friends.  Granted the team battle and team races are one of the best changes Nintendo made, but I wish they would allow two-players to partake in the Grand Prix.  The menus just don't seem all that user-friendly.The internet feature is interesting.  I'm not accustomed to playing any Mario Kart online (save for the DS) but it was a very nice setup.  No more are we limited to annihilating our friends in the privacy of our own home; now we can do that but annihilate world-wide opponents in the privacy of our own home.  Not a real fan of online play but loved it anyway, way more than Smash Bros. Brawl.Lastly is the graphics; the Wii doesn't go beyond 480 resolution so one shouldn't really expect anything grand.  The Wii is made for innovative gameplay, not graphics.  If you want graphics, get an XBox360 or a PS3.Overall, despite some small issues, the game is superb all around.  A 96% to be certain.  Buy it if you find one!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2008"}

Warcraft 3 is a good old-fashion real-time strategy (RTS) game, with a somewhat outdated resource collection model and base-building formula.  It also aspires to be a roleplaying game (RPG), thought it is only partially successful.  Overall, if you like RTS games, this one is worth a try.  However, I found it not to be as good as some of the more recent games, like Rise of Nations and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War.Gameplay: Warcraft 3 is remarkably like Warcraft 2 in a lot of ways, which is both good and bad.  On the good side, it's fairly easy to learn and quite fun for a while.  You choose one of four races to play (which are all distinct); gather gold, lumber, and food; build structures and units; explore the map; and conquer your enemies. It's a very typical 1990s-style RTS game.  However, Warcraft 3 adds hero units to the mix, which greatly impact gameplay.  These units can gain levels as in a RPG-style game and have special abilities. You really cannot win a game without them.  Each race has a choice of 4 heroes to choose from (with The Frozen Throne expansion loaded) and there are neutral heroes that can be recruited.  The hero model works quite well with the single-player campaign, since it weaves them into a broad story.  However, it makes skirmish games a little awkward, since you are required to both build bases and find creeps (random monsters) for your hero to fight in order to gain levels.The single-player campaign is both quite long and well done.  Actually, it seemed a little too long once I played through the original campaign and the Frozen Throne expansion.  The story is the typical good vs. evil theme, which gets really hard to follow by the mid-point.  However, the missions are generally well done, with a good mix of RPG-style adventuring and a heavy-dose of base-building and conquest.  The missions are designed to allow you the chance to play all four races, and I didn't get the sense that they were just practice for multiplayer online games.  That is, for solo gamers like myself, Warcraft 3 has a substantial amount of single-player content.Warcraft 3 is good, but does have some issues.  Some of the single-player missions are quite hard and will require much reloading of saved games in order to complete.  Still, the AI can be a little lame.  There were countless times that my base would be invaded, and my units would not automatically move to fight the enemy.  However, AI enemies do fight smart, often first attacking your units that can do the most damage to them.  Rather surprisingly, the game does not have a pause feature so that you can look around the battlefield and give orders while pausing.  And unlike recent RTS games, Warcraft 3 limits you to very small armies.  You'll be lucky to have 20 fighting units at any given time.  Additionally, the game just seems behind the times in other ways.  The camera doesn't really zoom, graphics are cartoonish, and the micromanagement can be burdensome at times.As with every other Blizzard product I've played, the game was perfectly stable and well polished, and I came across no bugs or typos.  In addition to a single-player campaign that will last around 70+ hours for the average player, there are a large number of skirmish maps included, multiplayer capacity, and a map editor. The Battle Chest itself includes a lot of reading materials, such as instruction manuals and hints/tips guides.  As usual, Blizzard has supported the game well with patches and new official maps that are downloadable at their website.Graphics: The typical Warcraft visuals.  A bit cartoonish, but with a lot of vivid colors and diverse environments.  Spell effects look convincing, and there are day & night cycles that give the world a living feel. The game is actually cute in many ways and is probably supposed to be that way. The graphics will not win any awards, but they do serve their purpose.  As with Diablo 2, Warcraft 3 has some of the best cutscenes I have ever seen in a video game.Sound: There is a lot of great voice acting in the game.  Some of it is very funny.  The music is also well done and appropriate to the mood of the game.Overall, I recommend Warcraft 3 (plus the expansion) to anyone interested in RTS or fantasy games.  It's a well-made strategy game with lots of challenges, a epic (though rambling) story, and an RPG element in the form of heroes (which, again, can be a plus or a minus). If you can get past all of the micromanagement that the game requires and some other outdated elements, Warcraft 3 should provide many hours of entertainment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0009ENA2W","description":"In Meteos you're the last line of defense, in a bad case of planetary overload. As blocks drop down on the lower screen, you must use the DS's stylus to match up blocks of the same color. Once you have enough blocks connected, they'll shoot back up into the sky to form planets on the upper screen.","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"3 to Launch","reviewText":"What a silly game. But it is fun. And it did make me want to play it more.But it's 100% luck. I considered myself way too old to ever be able to learn and master any game well enough to \"finish it\". But that's exactly what I did in my second round of Meteos.The object of the game is simple. Each level starts out with 3 rows of apx 15 - 20 blocks. The blocks have different designs and colors. When the game begins more blocks rain from space and start piling up. If any columns in the rows get to the top of the screen, you're annihilated. You can only move the blocks vertically. So you need move blocks in a column up and down in order to get three in a row either horizontally across in any row or vertically in a column in order to launch the stack(s) of blocks before they reach the top of the screen.There's all this talk in the directions about lining up 3 like color/designed blocks to launch the blocks into space. And that indeed is what needs to be done. But if you just take the stylus and keep swiping it quickly and randomly over the columns, pure chance pretty much guarantees you an eventual launch. So much so for me--and my kids--that the game can easily be defeated.Even after raising the difficultly we all had the same success getting through the levels of play. So, the skill set required to play Meteos is minimal. But it's darn fun.Therefore, if you own this and you're struggling by \"playing fairly\" and actually trying to match up 3 blocks. Give the quick/random method a try. As I said, it's still pretty fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2007"}

Like with most Zombie games your character starts off by him/herself and a secured(For now) area and is awaken by an apparently helpful person who gives advice and information to keep you alive as the city's undead search for a new meal primarily you.  The game uses the abilities of the WiiU tablet pretty well from scanning an area or room to keeping your inventory and stock in check.The zombies are relentless in their hunt and while expected there seem to sometimes be a glitch once and awhile though not too many times, when you take down a zombie and as far as it seems you've finished it off just to hear a noise and turn around to see it right in your face attacking you again.While these are the undead the game itself says that once the head is pretty much taken care of the zombie is no longer a threat so why is it that sometimes it proves to be false?Still the game is a good addition to the zombie game franchise and with the exception of this glitch that happened at the maximum of four times(Seems)  there really wasn't any other problem with the game.  Of course this is not a game meant for the younger children and if you have kids in their teens you might want to check on the info and gamesite reviews of the game.  For other WiiU owners I'd say this one is worth adding to the WiiU game library as a good hardcore zombie game that equals to that of Resident Evil,Dead Rising and Dead Island.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2014"}

The main new feature is that, when the buttons are pushed, the controller can register how much pressure is being exerted. This adds a completely new dimension to sports, racing, fighting, and more games. Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience. Two convex analog thumb pads and two force-feedback solenoid rumblers round out the features.

It was fun, and the main character, Ratchet and Clank, have more variety up their sleeves in terms of movement, weapons, and other things.  Additionally, this game advances in such a way that you are not constantly frustrated.  In other words, this game is designed for the casual gamer (most of us) who just want to have fun (unlike Jak 2, which has a lot of good ideas running but the game in of itself is incredibly difficult).  In this game, the weapons immediately upgrade by themselves unlike the original Ratchet and Clank, but you have to buy upgrades in the armor department.  This time platinum bolts (akin to gold bolts of the original) aren't really that important.  Even your ship can be upgraded entirely, and you can choose the color of your ship.  I like Drek Blackheart myself, but there are others.  The graphics is very similar to the first and the environments overall.  The controls are dead-on as always, and the camera is nearly perfect.

{"product_name":"B007VFHGZ4","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Superb gameplay undermined by railroading and quick-time events","reviewText":"Tomb Raider is a fresh reboot of the series of the same name, discarding the continuity built up over the previous eight games in favour of a fresh take on the premise and the central character of Lara Croft. Croft was very much a child of the 1990s: ballsy, confident, arrogant and a bit cartoonish. Her fresh incarnation is younger, constantly doubting herself and doesn't know how to chamber a round, let alone how to dive around dual-wielding pistols and shooting tigers. This is, much as it pains me to say it, a 'gritty and more realistic take on the character'.Tomb Raider is a curious hybrid of several game types. It's a third-person action game with a linear story, but which keeps the map open, allowing you to revisit previous areas to find more resources and new locations, once you have unlocked new equipment later in the game which allows you scale previously-inaccessible cliffs and blast open hitherto-invulnerable blockades. It isn't an open-world game - the island is portrayed as an interlocking series of explorable zones, not a wide-open space like the recent Far Cry 3 - but it throws in enough nods at an open world structure to make for an interesting hybrid. The semi-open-world structure makes for a curious incompatibility with the game's storyline, however, which is almost always urgently demanding you rush to the next objective and complete the next mission. This urgency is diminished when Lara decides to spend 2 hours painstakingly combing a forest for GPS trackers and magic mushrooms. Doing these side-objectives is important as it gives you more experience points which you can use to improve Lara's abilities, and also gives you more salvage to upgrade your weapons and equipment with.Lara is a fairly athletic character, able to scale vertical walls with the help of an improvised pickaxe, jump large distances and shimmy all over the place on rope bridges, some of which you create yourself by using a bow and rope-arrows. The game signposts where you can use these tools - literally by using a special view mode which highlights all usable objects in an area in bright yellow - but it can be fun seeing your destination and working out how to get there using the tools at your disposal. Tomb Raider is at its best when you have control for long periods and are given objectives without being hand-held through the whole thing. This is best exemplified by the optional tombs, which Lara has to explore (or 'raid', if you will) through her own ingenuity. Unfortunately, these tombs tend to revolve around one puzzle each and most of them about about 50 feet across in size, making them more like the 'dungeons' from Skyrim that consist of one winding passage and two rooms than substantial locations in their own right. Still, the idea is good.There is also quite a lot of combat, initially against animals (though, sadly, not tigers) and later on against human opponents. The gaming media has gone rather overboard in praising the scene in which Lara overcomes her first human opponent, kills him and then expresses realistic feelings of shock, panic and revulsion at having to do such a thing. All of this is effective in the moment, but undercut by Lara blowing away hordes of attacking nutcases literally a minute later without any qualms at all. By the endgame, in which Lara has to taken on an entire army of attackers in a temple forecourt spanning multiple levels and featuring tons of explosive barrels you can detonate to obliterate half a dozen foes at a time, this moral disconnect between story and gameplay has become absurd. Entertaining, certainly, but the game's musings on the desensitisation of killing and possible symptoms of PTSD ultimately feel like a sop to critics of videogame violence more than any real desire to explore the issues in depth (something else it shares with Far Cry 3).When the game stops wangsting about this stuff, it's often excellent. The freeform stuff is very good. Unfortunately, the main storyline is corncheese. It starts off trying to be grim and gritty and realistic, but by the end it's become an out-and-out fantasy involving undead creatures and spirit beings. Major story beats are transmitted through either cut scenes or particularly tedious Quick Time Events. The game's use of QTEs is obnoxious and over-the-top, taking over from the proper gameplay all too often. So do cut scenes, which are not differentiated from the gameplay either, often with the camera retaining its standard position over Lara's sholder, meaning (particularly in the first hour or so) that sometimes they end and the player has no way of knowing they're back in control until they die. Also, the game's moment of victory is in a cut scene rather than through player agency, which is a completely unfathomable decision. The less said about the supporting cast - Lara's fellow castaways who are only around to get rescued or provide awful dialogue about why Lara's next plan is going to fail despite her last three working fine and saving all their live - the better as well. From a technical standpoint, the graphics are excellent (despite the odd glitch), the controls are smooth, responsive and fully customisable (and you can remap the Enter key, which is awesome and inexplicably rare these days) and overall the game is fun to play.The problems prevent Tomb Raider (***) from achieving its full potential. The game's curious mixture of Far Cry freeform jungle stuff (including hunting and skinning animals), Prince of Persia style puzzle-solving using the equipment available, enjoyable combat (including one of the best and most natural cover systems I've seen in a game) and tons of bonus objectives all makes for an excellent gaming experience. But that experience is undercut by the game wrestling control away from you all too-often for indifferently-written cut scenes and repetitive Quick Time Events. When the game lets you play it how you want to, rather than how it wants to, it's superb.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2013"}

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!!features a total of 13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in thePunch-Out!!series. Each have their own backstory and patterns of attacks to learn and learn to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.","reviewerName":"Margaux Paschke","summary":"WORTH THE PRICE","reviewText":"This video game is worth the price paid.  It's a good game for adults and kids but it might prove very frustrating for younger players.  It took us a while to figure out how to use the wii controller properly and be able to defeat the first couple of fighters.  The difficulty rating goes up with every game won.  This is not one of those video games that you can finish in a day or even a week.My husband loves this game and it is played on a weekly basis.  Our youngest boy is not as thrilled with it because it's much harder for him to win (7 y.o.) but he still loves playing it.  The boxing characters announce their jabs, etc. to start but as you get better, so do your opponents.  As a mom, I'm okay with the boxing since it's not graphic and it provides a great workout for the kids.  You will break a sweat while playing this game.If I'm going to pay $50 for a video game it better last a while (not be easy to finish) and keep my family's interest and this game fits those requirements, easily.  I have even tried it as a substitute for the wii fit boxing and I think this game is a better workout and more exciting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E6NE","description":"","reviewerName":"dancinhomer","summary":"Good, but not great","reviewText":"POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!!!!Anyone familiar with the Bioshock series should know what to expect graphically, and this game does not disappoint.  It is a *gorgeous* game.  Certain gameplay elements of the first two games remained, particularly the &#34;vending machine&#34; concept.  There is also a fair amount of handholding in this game, as you are given specific objectives and have a handy virtual arrow that will send you in the right direction whenever you need it to (although there are a couple of times that the arrow won't tell you to leave a situation when you have to in order to advance the story).The &#34;hacking&#34; element of the first two games is notably missing.  When faced with an automated foe, previous versions allowed you to try and hack it, but your options in this game are to either use a &#34;vigor&#34; (a super-power) to temporarily possess it or simply get to shooting.  And, unlike its predecessors, this version doesn't have you face one particular foe (like a Big Daddy) every so often.It's all very subjective as to how the game actually compares with the previous versions.  Personally, I preferred the underwater world of Rapture and felt the characters were better developed in the first two games, but that's simply a preference and many folks wouldn't agree.My one grievance with the game is that I felt a bit suckered by the vigor situation.  In the vast majority of the game, vigors were a convenience, but I rarely encountered anything that couldn't be resolved with firearms.  So, I would spend my very-limited income upping my firepower.  SPOILER ALERT!!!!:::: And that served me fine until the big final battle, at which point vigors are (at least, to a player of my skill level) critical to keep the baddies from defeating the &#34;defend&#34; objective (in other words, you can keep yourself alive, but that will do you no good if you don't have the vigors to repel your enemies from that which you are defending), lest you lose a war of attrition.  And, to further twist the knife, you don't realize this until you are (without any warning from the game that I can recall) at a point of no return with no access to vending machines to correct this deficiency.  This creates a spike in difficulty that finally resulted in me simply reducing the difficulty level (painful to do at the end of a game) so I could at least see the ending.  And that soured the experience for me a bit.As to the story, particularly the ending, opinions vary wildly, so I'll just call it &#34;ambitious.&#34;  I hit the Internet to really understand what I had watched and liked it much better when I read explanations of what happened.  Then again, it would have been more fun at the time had it made sense as I was seeing it, but again... &#34;ambitious.&#34;So, is it an improvement?  It's hard to say.  Is it a game worth playing?  Certainly, if you like FPS.  The atmosphere alone is unique enough to warrant a playthrough, there is some variety in the weaponry and vigors (dang vigors!) and the character of Elizabeth is one of the best non-player characters I've ever seen.  So if your hopes aren't too high, you'll find something to enjoy here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2014"}

AC3 is my favorite of the bunch, surpassing even the debut of Ezio in Renassaince Italy three years ago. Though some \"sandbox\" fans may lament the fact that the game keeps you on a rather tight leash for the first few hours, I feel that the story is so stunningly presented, and your missions so riveting to execute, there is little to complain about. You'll soon be given the opportunity to either stick closely to the engrossing narrative, or to roam about in the fascinating sandbox (and in true AC style, there are a few surprises revealed during those early hours that are a thrill to take part in).The setting of the Revolutionary War is fascinating, particularly for fans of early American history. I found the story to be highly engaging, and I couldn't wait to see what came next. The game controls beautifully in every aspect, from free climbing to combat. Controls are so responsive and intelligently implemented (following the AC pedigree, but refined to their best incarnation yet), I'm generally not even conscious of the controller in my hand. From a technical perspective, the graphics, sound, and voice acting are among the best of this console generation, if not the very finest. A great attention to detail can be seen in elements such as the shadows, the snowfall... even the pores of characters' faces are realistically rendered.But there's more to AC3 than the measurable assets. There is something about the way in which the entire package comes together to create something intangible, something truly rare. In the shoes of Connor (and others), I hear the snow crunching beneath the soles of my feet as I traverse this wilderness of the northeast and the textured surface of Boston's cobblestone streets. Far beyond that, however, I can FEEL it... this game has so thoroughly immersed me, it is as if I have been transported to another time, another place, and into the shoes of other human beings... I feel as though I have truly assumed the role of the characters, embarking upon an incredible adventure.I realize it's fiction, of course, but I feel as though I am actively taking part in one of the most remarkable events in the history of mankind, shaping the world as we now know it. The goal of games is to create experiences for the players that would otherwise be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve in reality. In that regard, AC3 is a great success. I have been able to lose myself in its experience, and every moment spent in Connor's shoes has been enjoyable. It is one of the finest games I have ever played, and the scope of its vision and ambition has left me stunned.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2012"}

The graphics made full use of the Dreamcast's capabilities, and even now it is one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen. The combat moves are fluid and based on real martial arts...there is even a martial arts display mode where you can see all the characters doing various weapon katas! It is a good game for both button mashers and pros. There is no \"blood\" which makes it a bit unrealistic when you see someone getting hacked with a huge axe and not bleeding; but that doesn't detract from the experience because this isn't that sort of game. The abundance of modes allows for a high replay value. The only thing I would knock is the end-stories, which are a bit corny and considering the animation in the gamplay itself, it feels a bit like a copout to see the endings as just still life.

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar.

So whats the final verdict?  The system works great for me. I had no trouble setting it up or recovering my xbox live name. So far the Kinect has also worked great although if you have a ton of background noise, i.e. another tv running in the background it interferes with the voice commands but with just running the xbox itself I had no problems with the Kinect. The controller is probably the biggest reason I chose this console over the PS4, well that and i'm not a big fan of the sony exclusives other than uncharted. The games I have played Dead Rising 3, Assassins Creed 4, Battlefield and Killer Instinct all run smooth with the exception of Dead Rising 3 which is a major dissapointment even if I never was a dead rising fan to begin with. Right now I would recommend the xbox one based more on the future than anything else.

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

Way too many cutscenes","reviewText":"Metal Gear 2 is a remarkable game that entangles you in its story from the very beginning. This latest installment seems to utilize the capabilities of PS2 to the maximum, as the graphics alone leave one in awe.The environment is responsive to the character's actions and the game overall leaves an impression of a very well polished work of art, complete with a beautifully done story. The guards have multiple &quot;hit points&quot;, which means hitting them in the arm, hand, chest or head yields different results. Glass is breakable, lockers can be opened and climbed into, etc...I've followed this game pretty much from 1987, and having played Metal Gear Solid (PS one), I'm glad that Kojima didn't rehash a classic again for this one (those that are familiar with Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake for the MSX will probably agree that the PS (one) game was basically a 3D rewrite of the latter).My only &quot;beef&quot; with this game is the amount of cutscenes. I don't think I'd be exaggerating if I said that the cutscenes are basically 50% of this game. Which, if you've beaten it once already, is quite annoying, given that you can't disable them either. Two smaller issues I have with the game are a) cliche character comebacks (Ninja) and b) the obvious (poorly made) reference to titanic and &quot;jack and rose&quot; (diCaprio is one of my least liked actors, hence my dislike for Titanic).The game's replay value isn't too far up the chart (mainly because I can't find any cheats for it), and sorry, but collecting tags isn't incentive enough for me. Also, you can't just prevent cutscenes from being displayed, you have to wait until they start, and then stop them.Overall, however, the game is worthy of ownership. It's a great game, at the very least you owe it to yourself to rent it - you'll do yourself a favor if you actually go out and buy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2002"}

In brief, it is glitchy. The game crashes regularly on my PS3 (an issue that was carried forward from the last installment of Fall Out as well as Morrowind). The game adds a couple of features beyond the first Fall Out by Bestheda, but doesn't really push the series to any new places. You can now craft items, mod weapons with a couple of attachments per weapon (for example, scopes or silencers), and the allies functionality is improved over the last Fall Out. However, it is worth noting that my allies both went wonky in a sewer and I can't seem to get them back. One is trapped between a door and some water and won't dislodge herself despite reloading, while the other (Ed-E a floating Robot) has simply disappeared in the sewer as well. I assume he is trapped somewhere, but don't really want to put the time into trying to locate the little guy. Really frustrating and inexcusably sloppy for a game of this calibre. The game's graphics are on the dated side and look exactly like the original Fall Out 3 which was released a couple of years ago. This probably should have been an expansion pack on not a full game. I probably won't bother finishing this title even though it has many hours worth of game play. I don't have the patience for this as it is so glitchy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2010"}

I find it so much fun playing battlefield online. If you want to know about the single player well it is horrible. I have gotten platinum in this game and I can say the ost enjoyment came from the online trophies. The multi-player is ridiculously fun. I find enjoyment out of driving around the objective area in a humvee running people over dodging RPGs. Aside from that there is so much more to do, you can change your class at any time and basically do anything you want on the battlefield. Fly jets, drive tanks, run in on foot put C4 on a tank and blow them to hell!! Its fun at how epic the game can get at times as well as how frustrating. This game is loads of fun and I find my self back on it even after I got the platinum which is rare for me. I hope more people pick this one up because it is just as if not more addicting then COD. On a side note if you pick this up do not be thinking about call of duty when first playing this game think of a different game.

{"product_name":"B0050SXI6K","description":"","reviewerName":"Some Guy","summary":"Great looking but some lost opportunities","reviewText":"If you're already a fan of the R & C series, then you already know how much fun they are.  After all this time, reviewing the games themselves is fairly pointless.  Suffice it to say that unless there's something specific about R & C that you hate, these are first-rate, tons of fun games.So far I've only played the original R & C, so please forgive that I don't know what's coming with the 2nd two games yet.  I'll update as I play them.Now, what of the PS3 release?  I think I'll go with the good and bad route:Good:Graphics and sound, of course, are much better.  But keep in mind this this is a high-def upscale of original material, so Ratchet isn't as finely detailed as on the most recent PS3 games.  Still, beautiful colors abound and and the older graphics hold up well.You get all three games on one disk.You get your saves on the PS3, so no more memory cards.Bad:They skipped the opportunity to update the controls on the older games to a more modern control scheme.  I mean, who uses the O button for \"fire\" these days?  I wish they would have remapped the controls to a more modern setup and then given you the option to choose it or play the classic way.Why didn't they more completely remaster the video like, say, the God of War high-def releases?Where is \"Deadlocked?\"  It was something of a diversion in the R&C; realm, but still big fun and the commentators are hilarious.Quite frankly, the PS2-era R & C games deserve much better than this.In summary, certainly nothing is lost.  But R & C really deserves a more comprehensive high-def redo than this.  It isn't the great leap I was hoping for, like the God of War games were.Stay tuned for Going Commando and Up Your Arsenal...***Updated now***Going Commando and expecially Up Your Arsenal show just how quickly the R & C games improved.  Frankly, I found the first game kind of annoying.  These two were genuinely a blast to play again.  Their age is absolutely no factor at all and the improvement in graphics is all you could hope for.  Although they still don't look quite as good as the PS3 entries in the series, you have to consider the older source material.I'm still mad that they didn't include Deadlocked, so I'm only going to up this from three to four stars instead of five.  Deadlocked is an incredibly fun game and had it been included, this would easily be a 5-star collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2012"}

Personally, I've taken interest to the changes Capcom has tried, but personally, I think that the attempt to bring the series to 3D was the worst experiment ever. But still, it's not a bad game.GRAPHICS: Outdated, but still kind of cool looking. The only thing I hate is that the character's mouths don't move when they talk. That was laziness.MUSIC/SOUND: It's okay. Nothing special or memorable.VOICE ACTING: In a way, it's just as bad as X4. X, while not sounding like a girl, now sounds like a whiny fourteen year old. Zero sounds like a wannabe Spike Spigiel, but not as cool, and Axl is voiced by a girl. However, you can switch it to Japanese.GAMEPLAY: Okay, here's where they screwed up at. While it still has the basic Mega Man formula, they have made changes that have drawn some backlash from fans.The only new thing I really like is the ability to Tag Team.Perhaps the biggest change is the transition from 2D to 3D. While some parts are 2D, most are in 3D, especially the bosses. While it is not bad, I still prefer 2D.Second, rescuing Reploids is a pain now. Anything kills them now, unlike X6, where you just had to worry about Nightmares.Third, and another biggie, you have to unlock X. X is going through a whiny pacifist stage, and the only way to unlock him is by rescuing so many Reploids. Until then, you have to play as good ol Zero, or a new character, Axl, who, while has potential, is left in the snow after X is unlocked.Fourth, when hurt, the character falls down, which can cause some cheap midair deaths.Fifth, Alia's calls are complemented by a \"Can you hear me...(insert character.)\" It gets annoying.There are other things that are annoying, but I don't feel like listing all of them right now.BUY: Despite the flaws, it still is a fun game. I found it for only 5 dollars, so it might be worth a buy if you love X and are not cheap. Check it out. It's worth at least a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2009"}

Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"4.5; a classic period or a classic for its time?","reviewText":"Ever one day out of the blue feel like playing a game or watching a movie you haven't had in years? Fond memories of experiencing it and how it made you felt at that time seem familiar enough to maybe warrant a revisit? It's used time and time again with ports and remakes but what about playing the original? Does it still hold up or does it seem...odd now? Recently I had a strange inkling to revisit Perfect Dark so taking out my old N64 with thankfully my Expansion Pak from Donkey Kong's packaging, I thought I'd check it out and while I can nitpick it to death about \"dated this and that\", it still wouldn't mask that it was a great game through and through.Story: Special Agent Joanna Dark is an operative for the Carrington Institute who gets involved in a conspiracy involving the Institute, another corporation known as DataDyne and 2 warring alien races. At the time, the plot was rather ambitious, moreso than Goldeneye which followed the film nearly to a T. Now of course it's quite silly and the single player isn't as developed or as memorable but it still works to a certain extent now.Graphics: Back then these graphics were through the roof. More realistic lighting and textures, a bit more emphasis on art design and decor as opposed to the bland levels of Goldeneye and character animations are smoother. The framerate did take a hit occasionally but not enough to make you curse that its so jittery. Now it certainly has aged though you can appreciate it for what it is now and what the game did at the time but if you're going to play an old game, be prepared for old looking stuff.Sound/Music: The soundtrack to Perfect Dark largely consists of a more futuristic Bond-style music where it's a bit more ambient and mysterious with moments where it gets really exciting and cinematic. The voice acting however can be a bit sketchy since it's not really overracted but rather it sounds rather flat at times while other times it works or its comical.Gameplay: It's strange to revisit an old gameplay system since it's familiar enough to know what to do but it's been so long and you've played several different types that it feels...alien, no pun intended. Essentially, controlling Joanna dark's movement and vision is the Analog stick and the C-Up and C-Down, while the other 2 are for strafing or more correct turning. It took some getting used to since I've had to use dual analog for a long time and eventually I got around to it but it still felt odd. Missions are broken up like Goldeneye with several objectives before you can finish the level and in a neat feature, the objective can be different on different difficulty settings. One mission might require you just to do one or 2 things while on Hard, you'll have to do some extra stuff to pass.One of Goldeneye's memorable features was the different guns from handguns, automatics, shotguns and even miniguns and rocket launchers. PD's weapons go a bit beyond that and you'll have stuff like CamSpy which is like a tiny motorized camera/spy vehicle to alien weaponry and things like night vision. It's easy to get into and it's fun to experiment though the more accurate precision of games like Halo or Bioshock kind of make it initially problematic to get used to.The N64 became a bit of a party machine around the house here with the Mario Party games, the WWF/WCW wrestling games, racers and of course, Goldeneye. PD adds even more customizable features and just generally a lot more stuff but to access it all you need the expansion pak and of course the more people, the bigger the knock against the framerate. Most of my family and friends would just pop in Goldeneye for multiplayer so it's hard to say how it would stack up.With games like the 2 Zeldas and Perfect Dark, the N64 was a very capable machine at delivering solid play though techwise it wasn't the most advanced but if you can track it down or even still have it, it's worth giving the game another go.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0050SY77E","description":"","reviewerName":"Night Lord 40K","summary":"Excellent !!!!","reviewText":"This game is just amazing from start to finish. This series shows advancements in every new installment they make just like good sequals should. From the first Crysis to Crysis 2 and now to Crysis 3 you will find advancements in gameplay and graphics. The story in the first two were top notch and Crysis 3 is no exception.Graphics : If you thought the graphics in the original Crysis were great you had to be blown away with the graphics in Crysis 2 and the same is true with the graphics is Crysis 3. Everything looks simply amazing. You can tell by the detail in this game that the developers treated this game like a work of love. You wont find any muddy graphics or screen tearing in this game , it runs smooth as butter. I cant think of any other game that looks this good, and as much as I love Halo 4 even that game cant stand up to the graphical excellence in Crysis 3. If you are having a bad experience with graphics it has to be with your TV , Console , or your connections because this game really pushes the limits of the current consoles.Gameplay : This game is no slouch in the gameplay department. You will be thrown into action from the very beginning. You can play this game in stealth using your camo cloak ability or go in guns blazing , its all up to you and how you like to play. There are only two areas I can recall that you really cant use the cloak and need to just shoot em up and both of those are boss fights. the same is true for the two previous games as well. Also if you have the bow equiped you will not break your cloak ability when you fire and will remain unseen. I thought the addition of the bow was a very positive addition to the game. In the two previous games all you had were your guns and as soon as you open fire you would become visible to the enemy , but not with the bow. After you shoot someone with the bow just walk over the body and collect the arrow from the ememy you just killed. Obviously you wont always be able to collect all of your used arrows but dont be dismayed as you will run upon more soon enough to refill your supply. The game starts some years after the events in Crysis 2 and things have changed alot. I wont give specifics because I wouldnt want to ruin anything about this game for anyone but just know that the game will keep you engaged from start to finish. You will not want to stop playing because you will have the feeling of what is going to happen next , and you will find yourself loosing hours and think it has only been about thirty or so minutes. This game is just that good.Multiplayer : I have not played the multiplayer much but it does seem to be very enjoyable. This mode also requires an amount of stealth because if you run into the open guns blazing you will most likely find yourself dead as someone in cloak with a sinper rifle will take you out. Like I said I have not put much time into the multi. because I buy these games for their gameplay and great story , but for what I have played I can say you will find enjoyment in this as well.Summary: I know this review was a bit short but I just wanted to add my few cents to the reviews and wanted to make sure everyone knew what a great game this is ( in my opinion ). So if you are on the fence about this game just come on down and pick it up because I dont think you will have any regrets. Have fun and happy gaming everyone.Note: If you havnt played the first two you can pick up the first on Xbox Live arcade and the second as well. I like to have a hard copy so I bought Crysis 2 on disc. The only way to play the original crysis on your Xbox will be to download it from Xbox Live arcade because it was originally made for the PC and not consoles. The two prior games are well worth your time and money and I think you will have a better understanding of what is going on if you play them in order. dont be afraid to purchase the original from Xbox live because the graphics , story and gameplay in that game are much better than most things released today.Crysis [Download],Crysis 2","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}

There are 23 characters to play as in all...spanning from the beginning of DBZ to the end of the Cell series (unfortunately, that means no characters from the Buu series). The button layout is simple but effective (punch, kick, guard, and energy), and the action of the in-game fights match the frantic pace one would expect from DBZ. The problem lies within that each of the character's moves vary little from each other. In other words, each character's moves are almost identical with the exception of a few special techniques tagged onto the end of the combos. Another bothersome feature is that you can't perform the large energy beam attacks outside of a combo. On the positive side however, there are several different game modes to help add variety. While the average player can plow through the entire story mode within 2-3 hours, there is still the World Tournament and The Legend Of Hercule modes to clear. The skill editing feature is really just a gimmick, but is a welcome addition nonetheless. So if you are a Dragonball fan that's looking for another way to enjoy the series, Budokai is definitely worth a look. Those simply looking for a great fighter with lots of depth can afford to pass this one up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2002"}

I found the actual gameplay to be surprisingly different from what I expected in the many reviews.  It is certainly true that you will die a lot, and often unexpectedly.  However, there are many ways to actually exploit this for your own benefit.The plot itself is vague, perhaps purposefully.  But generally you select a player class, and then try to hack your way through various levels of foes, culminating in eventual boss battles.  Along the way, any foe you defeat will result in \"souls\" -- the game's equivalent of gold or Zenny -- accumulating in your pocket.  The souls you gather are used to buy, repair, or upgrade equipment, or eventually purchase stat increases for your character.  However, you gain souls even for enemies you don't kill yourself.  In 1-player, as far as I can tell, any time any hostile foe dies anywhere on the level, you get their souls.  This is true no matter how far away you are at the time, if you had nothing to do with their death, or even if they somehow managed to kill themselves.  This is a neat feature, as I'll discuss further below.The rub with soul-gathering is that if (and when) you die, you lose all the souls you gathered and typically reanimate at a respawn point at the beginning of the level, with all your non-Boss enemies revived as well.  You'll also be a \"ghost\" with 1/2 or 2/3 (if you have a certain ring) of your regular HP, making things a bit more challenging.  If you make it back to where you died without dying a second time, you may recover your soul loot, but often you don't and it is lost forever.  Sounds painful, right?  Well, anyone who has played Diablo II or Borderlands or the like is already sensing the good times:  this means that once you die the first time and are a ghost you can farm any level you feel like for souls.  Nothing stops you from only clearing 1/2 a level, taking the souls back to the Nexus to buy more equipment or stats, and then rinsing and repeating all you want.  You don't lose any of your equipment, only your \"soul\" money, so if you don't have much money at the moment there's little actual punishment for death.Better still, any friendly NPCs you free that remain on the levels will often be there when you come back, and will wander off on their own killing foes for you -- and you get all the souls.  And even better yet, there are often many different ways to kill your enemies.  The environment itself is often a tool.  Keep an eye out for traps you can trigger that will destroy foes for you.  You can also exploit the violent tendencies of your enemies.  Only a fool will charge straight into a group of enemies -- instead, use narrow stairways and blind turns as chokepoints to take them on one at a time.  The elaborate 3-D environment of platforms, open staircases (think Mines of Moria-ish), switchbacks, and other devices provide both cover and ways to stage extremely gratifying ambushes.  The very first level (known as 1-1) consists of an elaborate castle with one area guarded by an extremely powerful, red-eyed knight with a spear.  He's almost impossible to hurt, let alone kill, at low levels.  So why do it?  Instead, just lure him past the trebuchets into the adjacent tower, which has a huge open air staircase descending many stories.  Harrass him from a distance on the corners, and eventually he'll charge at you, miss a turn, and fall to his death.  Bam, 2000+ souls.  And he'll respawn just like everyone else if you reset the level.Another great thing about Demon Soul's is that the designers were not completely heartless.  It is indeed challenging to push into new, unknown areas and then die far from help.  But often you will find switches that will open gates, start elevator devices, or make other structural changes to the level that are permanent regardless of respawns.  These often establish short cuts through the level, so if you die later you can just go through the newly opened gate instead of tediously hacking your way the long way around.  Given that you have effectively infinite lives if you don't mind losing a few \"souls\" from your money stash, you can even make mad banzai charges towards switches or gates when you have little to lose.  If you do get out of your depth, you can try to retreat as far along your path as possible before you die, making it easier to get back to your body on the next try.If you go into Demon Soul's with a Conan the Barbarian me smash style, you will be humbled a lot and probably give up on it.  But if you adopt a more Lord of the Rings-y approach to the plot as well as a healthy paranoia, you will keep your shield up, peek around corners before taking them, and keep a close eye on your surroundings to watch for potential ambushes, traps, or switches.  The game soon becomes extremely satisfying, if never easy.  You have to think both strategically and tactically, and there are often ways around an \"impossible\" problem (such as plugging a resting dragon full of crossbow bolts so he doesn't show up later to burn you to death on an exposed walkway).  The game is a nice mix of typical RPG features such as using healing items and finding new and exciting loot, and more adventure themed games that are not hack-and-slash.  In a way it reminds me of the old ASCII games like Rogue or Angband in that you have to be very careful about how you push into new levels, and need to maintain discipline at all times.

Both Spyro fans and those who didn't play the first game will revel in the  exploratory greatness that isSpyro: Ripto's Rage. Gone are the impossible tasks,  unbeatable enemies, and fragmented game flow. This game sports superior controls, more  colorful and faster graphics, a tighter story, achievable goals, and plenty of gameplay  variety.Don't be fooled by Spyro's cuteness--this isn't a kid's-only game. With multiple goals  and side quests, a fantastic soundtrack by ex-Police band member Stewart Copeland, and  a veneer of understated humor,Spyro: Ripto's Rageis highly addictive. The  playfulness of the main character comes through in the exploration of the otherworldly  levels using the new moves, including super high jumps, rapid underwater swimming,  and extended flight and hovering maneuvers.Determined explorers are always rewarded--sometimes with an ice hockey match or other  sub-game, sometimes with riches enough to learn a new move or uncover a new area.  Simply put,Spyro: Ripto's Rageis one of the best action/adventure games for the  system. Despite the fact that this game is a sequel, it manages to bring a fresh new look  and feel to PlayStation gaming.--Jeff YoungPros:Massive, fun levels are completely navigableCute and quirky sense of humor will appeal to all agesResponsive controls are an extension of Spyro's upbeat and exacting personalityCons:Camera angles can be problematic, but are completely adjustable","reviewerName":"vicki","summary":"game","reviewText":"Fun game to play.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"J.

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"GamerBoy","summary":"Modern Warfare 3 = Fast Pace, Exhilarating, and FUN","reviewText":"From start to finish Modern Warfare 3 has me hooked to the story and the fast paced improved multiplayer. The Campaign is very exciting and it is very long too which is something I love. It is 17 missions to be exact. If you have played Modern Warfare 2 you need to at least rent this for the campaign because this might be the last Modern Warfare. The campaign has a certain feel to it that no other game is able to match. The slow-mo shooting, the \"OMG\" moments that makes your jaw drop, and the wonderful graphics that are hard to say are better than Battlefield 3 but have at least improved to a satisfying point that any Call of Duty fan will love. The multiplayer is much better with new game modes, kill streaks, maps, better servers, and very addicting. The guns are very different from MW2, BF3, Black Ops, it is something completely new. The guns are much better, cooler, and updated. The only gun to come back is the UMP and it is 1 of the guns you start out with and will probably want to end with if you used it a lot in MW2. It is probably the best sub machine gun, but not the best gun. The new thing that I absolutely love is guns ranking up. Every time your gun ranks up you get something new. An attachment, a perk for the gun, a camo, it makes the game better for people who stick to the same gun. The perks are mostly the same except for overkill which allows you to have 2 primary weapons which is good for someone who snipes cause he can also use an assault rifle or any other gun they want. The maps range from very small to large and they are all very fun and easy to adapt to. It seems kills are easier to get in MW3 and it is much faster than MW2 or BF3 but that is a plus for me. The new kill confirmed game mode is extremely fun for people who hate snipers camping. Every time you kill someone you get xp, every time you pick up a dog tag you get xp and a point for your team. It is a very smart idea and is very fun. Overall this is a great game and is a must play for people who love fast paced multiplayer games with lots of kills, quick scoping, and a exhilarating campaign.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2011"}

Malone","summary":"Sub par entry in an already mediocre franchise","reviewText":"I don't play multiplayer or co-op so this has no bearing on those. I am strictly a solo campaign player.FEAR has never been one of my top priorities. I was fairly excited for the first one, because about a year or so prior to its release there was a very long demo video that showcased some incredible combat and enemy AI. Those have always been the series' strong suit. Likewise, the FEAR franchise has always seemed to go out of its way to have very dull and mundane level design. The first FEAR took place almost exclusively in office buildings and industrial concrete basements. FEAR 2 \"really shook things up\" by adding a couple of ruined city streets and an elementary school. And now F3AR (ugh) has made the wonderful contribution of a megastore (a la Costco) and some suburban homes. Be still, my foolish heart. All in all I thought it was a step down from FEAR 2's level design.The combat, for the most part, remains as fun as ever. But it was the same 'ol same ol'. 90% of the time you're up against wily commandos intent on taking you down, or insane civilians who might as well have been zombies lifted straight out of Left 4 Dead. Occasionally you'll have to face a mech walker or a helicopter or two. The worst sequences of the game were those in which you had to face a swarm of leaping feral monsters, I was never really clear on where they came from or what they had to do with anything. It's possible the story explained it, but if so I missed it. Not that I mind. The story and the \"horror factor\" in FEAR have always been very minimal and completely beside the point as far as I'm concerned.All in all, I was ready for this game to be over before I actually reached the end. One of the few games I will never, ever replay. I mean, as tepid and mediocre as FEAR 2 was, at least it was good enough that I played it twice.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2012"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which isNew Super Mario Bros.

Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies &ndash; or their fellow players.In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"Are You Ready For Some Old-School Mario?","reviewText":"I always enjoyed Mario video games whether it was Mario kart, Paper Mario, Mario Galaxy...well you get the point. But my best memories of Mario games are without a doubt the old school Super Mario Bros 2-D scrolling games, it seems they weren't as graphically impressive as today's video games are but they were perhaps more fun than any other games. I've followed Nintendo and the Mario character for years now and I'm glad that Nintendo returned to their roots with Super Mario Bros Wii in a classic side scrolling adventure. But it doesn't end here, Nintendo made the game a cooperative one, the real value of the game is that up to four players can play at the same time, it's not just a multiplayer mode it's a multiplayer adventure! The plot line of NSMBW? Why even bothering asking! Of course princess Peach has been captured for the 100th gazillion time (she's pretty good at that) and it's up to Mario and his friends (if there is more than one player that is) to save her once again. Guess you didn't see that one coming!New Super Mario Bros Wii is everything an old school gamer would like and at the same time a game that will enjoyed by younger gamers as well, everyone can enjoy it, it's truly a game for the whole family. You can play solo of course but why not share the fun? 8 worlds of fun await you plus bosses. Is the game long? Well it'll take quite a few hours, I've played it for days regularly but no constantly and it took me about a little more than two weeks because I'm not a really hardcore gamer. Is it a game that will be fun replaying? Of course it will be fun to play again, especially if you play with someone it will be fun. Once you're through you will still want to play some levels you've done before. It's not an incredibly hard game but it can be challenging! All the iconic characters form the Mario universe are here, the original ones at least and they look great on Wii. There are also the coin battles and free for all games besides the main game which are pretty fun to play.There isn't much that is really new with Super Mario Bros Wii, is it the same as a classic Super Mario games? Well yes and no because while it keeps the same idea and logic there is a \"new\" and \"old\" feeling to it as well because it's sort of an updated retro game in some ways. The controls are old school as well because you play the game with the Wiimote on the side and move with the arrow and use 1 and 2 to jump, run and throw things. It doesn't take full advantage of the Wii controls that's for sure but it's better that way as it gives a better experience and keeps the feeling of a classic Mario game. I thought a really fun aspect of the game was that you can ride Yoshis, it's just so much fun riding on those dinosaurs and they can be used as good weapons as well! There are mushrooms and fireballs just like you may remember but they Nintendo added ice fireballs suit and jumping suits (sorry I don't really know the names) add new things to the game as well they enhance the game and are a great way to explore it.My rating for this game is an absolute five stars. Bringing classic Mario back to the Wii is an amazing experience for gamers of all ages. I wish there would be more games like this for the Wii, an adventure in which more than one player can play at all times (I'm not counting online games here!), the multiplayer factor is the best thing about the game. If you own a Nintendo Wii you should really own this, or it could make a perfect present for a Mario fan, chances are if you know someone who owns a Wii they already own New Super Mario Bros Wii or is on their \"to buy\" list. It's a fantastic and highly enjoyable game for the Nintendo Wii.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2010"}

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Allen","summary":"A unique system","reviewText":"I recently purchased a Wii and I am very pleased.Out of the box, you get a Wii (with about 512 mb of built in storage for game saves and downloads) with one controller, a standard a/v line, and Wii sports. If you have hdtv, you'll have to buy the component cables seperately which can cost an additional 20-40 dollars depending on the brand.The one thing Nintendo does well is making unique systems that appeals to all ages. Wii is no exception; it's small, affordable, and the primary method of control is through motion sensors. I remember when my parents bought me a NES console back in the 80s and I remember the most unique thing I have ever seen would be the light gun. I thought it was so awesome and thus far no other system has given me that much excitement until the Wii came about.I am surprised about the motion sensor. It's very well. The included game, Wii Sports, include a verity of games that you can play. The one that stands out to me would be the boxing. It's quite amazing to see your character bounce around on screen responding to your motion. It's quite fun, and exciting. The best way to describe it would be to stand in front of a mirror and pretend to box with yourself.The only problem with the Wii sensor is that it doesn't seem to respond to how hard you hit and it doesn't exactly know if you are in fact doing the motion correctly or not. So basically, you could be sitting down on your couch and just doing some weird lazy motion and the game will work. I don't know why people would do this though.If you buy a Wii, I highly recommend making a lot of room for movement. It's quite fun to play tennis and running back and fort in front of your TV.The built in 512 mb is a lot of space for people who do not go online. I have purchased about five games in total, and the space is quite useful for just saving games. I don't go online with the console, but I would imagine that if you did, you would probably want to purchase a 2 gig memory card with your Wii which can cost about 20-30 dollars extra.The up coming game library sounds wonderful. I won't get into games, since this review is mainly about the Wii console. However, I found I like games like Mario Galaxy, Super Swing Golf 2, MLB Power Pro, Smash Bro, Zelda, and countless others. A very good set of library to play with and there are a few Mature rated games on the system as well for those looking to play M-rated games.For those with Gamecube games, fear not. Wii is 100% backwards compatible. All you need to keep is your controller, memory cards, and of course, games. You can pretty much play any game from Gamecube on your Wii. I have a small collection of Resident Evil, Zelda, and a few other titles from my Gamecube. They all play without a hiccup on the Wii. If you have a third party controller or memory card, it may not work on your Wii.Overall, I am pleased with Wii. I am a bit surprised that it's hard to find, though. I went to my local game store, asked for one, and they pulled it right out brand new, in the box sealed. If you plan to buy this product, what I heard is that you should go to your local game store every Friday around noon to see if you can get one. I know it's quite hard to find and that it's beyond the control of Nintendo, but I hope people don't pay too much for the console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0053BG26C","description":"","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Quite Fun","reviewText":"Just Dance 3 for the Wii solely tracks a single controller in one hand while you dance along to a collection of songs. As simple as it might sound, it's actually quite a lot of fun!I've played and enjoyed many dance games over the years. I still have a PS2 set up in the basement with a bunch of Dance Dance Revolution games, to play with those. We also have Kinect and a PS3 move. Each system has its benefits and flaws. The DDR games of course only care about foot stomping. Kinect can see your entire body, and doesn't need you to hold anything! This Wii game falls somewhere in the middle. You dance with your whole body, but the sensor is only in one hand, so it has no idea what the rest of you is doing.On one hand I like how they have each dancer and scene customized to the song. A 50s-feel song (Crazy Little Thing Called Love) has a pair of kids dancing at a drive-in. Boogie Wonderland has a quartet of boogie-dressed dancers doing choreographed moves. You've got an undersea mermaid, \"Respect\" complete with 60s landscape, and much more. It really is quite fun, and the characters movements are incredibly smooth, too.Each song even has dance moves appropriate to the song and era. You don't have random clapping / kicking / etc. that happens to be in time with the music. The moves really do \"feel\" like they would go with the song and era.I'm also appreciative that the load times are quick. So many times when you're playing a dance game you have to wait 1-2 minutes between songs, which gets frustrating very quickly. Here it's nice and quick moving from song to song.They have a great range of songs, so that young kids will find songs they like, and adults will have some as well.So there's a lot of good. What's the flaws?First, as mentioned, all the game senses is a single arm. They don't even have you holding a controller in each hand. So the game only knows what one arm is doing.Next, I wish they at least gave you a few options amongst era-appropriate characters. Maybe different colors of skin and hairstyles.Most importantly, though, the screen layout is not optimal. You have your character in the middle that you're supposed to match. You have a small shape in the bottom left which sometimes - but not always - tells you what to do next - you have to interpret its rather cryptic clues. Then you have an indicator in the top left which lets you know if you did an action well or poorly. It can be frustrating the first few times through a song because you have practically no idea what to do and you can't watch everything at once to know how you're doing.So it's important to know that up front. Expect a learning curve for each song. You'll have to watch it a few times to figure it out and get the hang of it. Then once you can do the dance simply from memory, you can mostly watch the top left indicator to know if you did each move well enough to count.I also wish they offered more feedback on WHY you didn't get a perfect score. Other games have a variety of ways to do that which is quite helpful. Here you're sort of on your own.Still, the game is a ton of fun, a great way to stay healthy and boost your mood. It can be played alone or with friends. Well recommended!We purchased this game with our own funds.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2011"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization.

{"product_name":"B000VBFW7E","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"'Gears' Grinds to a Halt on the PC","reviewText":"I realize Gears of War is the darling of the gaming industry, and there's some great reasons why the X-Box version of Gears of War deserves that acclaim. For the PC, however, the customer truly gets the shaft. Most of the problems with Gears of War for the PC have been a complete showstopper for many, many users out there.  I put the game away for a year.  When I re-installed it last weekend, it was because I had hoped the last round of patches would make things better. It amazes me that here we are, years later, and still this game is plagued with problems.What problems?1) Installation may take 2 hours or more. Something in the system (signs point to DRM) throttles back installation of the product. I have no idea why it does this, but I've witnessed it on more than one machine. This same issue may be what causes the game to take 2-3 minutes to launch every time I go to run it.2) After installtion, the game will not be able to launch without patching. It will accuse you of having tampered with the code and tell you to re-install the game. Don't bother reinstalling, because that won't change anything. Instead you have to patch the game. There was a server certificate issue that Epic/Microsoft fixed after it broke a lot of users' installations. The workaround involved moving your PC's calendar to a date/time before the problem (which, by the way, can cause other bad things to happen with other programs). I ended up rolling my clock back, patching, then rolling forward and rebooting to properly get the job done.3) And speaking of patches...the patcher will often crash. Thankfully, it finishes the job before dropping dead; the last patch crash I witnessed appears to be the patcher attempting (and failing) to launch the game for you.4) The Windows Live account creates problems of its own.- First it needs to be updated in-game: having the latest version of Games for Windows Live on your machine will not do because Gears of War cannot figure that out; it has its own installation of the program.- Second, you cannot log into Games for Windows Live outside of Gears of War and expect Gears of War to run; it won't understand this and it will prevent you from accessing content without explaining why. Leave the game, log out of Games for Windows Live, close Games for Windows Live, and re-launch the game.- Third, other Games for Windows Live titles that can't detect a separate install of Games for Windows Live--like Halo 2--really don't like it when you bounce from one Games for Windows Live game to another.  Updating Games for Windows Live in one game doesn't update it in another. You should probably know that after you agree to letting the game update Games for Windows Live, it will then tell you that it may decide to restart your computer. I wish I could know that ahead of time, before I agree to a reboot I can't control.Why does Games for Windows Live matter? For the same reasons that I have now played Gears of War two-thirds of the way through, about 8 times:- Your saved games are dependent on Games for Windows Live.- Your saved games will randomly disappear, or become corrupted and you have to start the game over.- You definitely cannot access your saved games if you haven't logged into Games for Windows Live, and- You may also find that your saved games won't transfer from one machine to another: I've had a message that my saved games do not exist \"on this machine's hard drive\".- If you're buying Gears of War for its Multiplayer capability, you should know that you will not be able to access the full benefits of Multiplayer without a paid Live subscription: you will otherwise get limited features and no achievements.Graphically, Gears of War offers an extremely well-rendered experience, provided you have some hefty hardware for it. I run the game on a dual-core AMD (4400+) machine with 4GB of RAM and dual 8800GTS cards in SLI.  I need to throttle the settings back to medium/low for everything (and I still have tearing problems and framerate drops with V-Sync enabled).The concept of Gears of War is relatively simple, and it forces you to change your thinking from \"run-and-gun\" to \"duck-and-cover\": everything you do requires you to hide behind cover, move to other cover, and blast the living hell out of anything that gets in your way. Blood fountains, bullets fly by the thousands, the enemies die splattingly and \"on the ground\" camera angles put you in the middle of the action. There are decision paths along the way that provide slightly different experiences, depending which direction you choose. There is some small amount of strategy: close the hole in the ground, lure the monster out into the open, etc. Everything is tied together into a larger story that is told through cinematics. Sadly, most of these gorgeous cinematics contain little dialog or plot development beyond military grunts sniping at each other, and hints that no one else really likes your character.If you want to take a chance that you'll be one of the lucky few who have a minimum of problems, Gears of War for the PC may offer you the same experience enjoyed by the X-Box crowd. I still wouldn't recommend paying full price for the PC version, if only because of the many headaches you'll most likely be in for.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2009"}

{"product_name":"B006ZPAYD2","description":"","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"Same LEGO Fun, w/ Troublesome Multiplayer & Design","reviewText":"It's easy to write off these LEGO games.  They're still the \"break-em-down build-em-up collectathon\" we've been playing since the original 'LEGO Star Wars' made a surprising impression presence in 2005.  However, I've played every single one of these games and you know what?...I still think they're fun to play through.Everyone is probably aware of the premise: Batman & Robin team up with Superman and some titular DC Super Heroes to take down The Joker and Lex Luthor.  Don't try to justify it logically - just go with it.  Thanks to some surprisingly strong voice-acting and humor, 'LEGO Batman 2' has an entertaing narrative.  If you're looking for a more dramatic experience, play Batman's \"Arkham\" games.  As for Superman, this is the best game he's ever been in (a backhanded compliment, yes).  For what it's worth, my wife is pretty impatient when it comes to videogame storytelling, while I like complexity & depth.  We both got a good share of laughs at the plot.  Seeing Batman despise Superman is a pleasure you'll get to enjoy again and again.  One minor criticism -- You don't the see any heroes besides Batman, Robin, and Superman until about Level 14 out of 15.  It's not a deal-breaker, but don't expect to see these extra heroes until the last couple levels.  The DC Super Heroes are meant for unlockables only, I guess.There's probably no point in explaining the gameplay, except to say that it keeps the action & pacing of the previous 'LEGO Batman' game from 2008.  The changes made to the levels themselves are mostly positive.  It can be a little tricky to control Superman - because he can do just about anything, he uses almost every button.  But if you loved the beat-em-up format of 'LEGO Batman' over the other LEGO games (which focus on swords, sorcery, and/or shooting), then you can't go wrong here.Graphically, the game looks as good as others in the series.  Occasionally I read that players are disappointed that the worlds are photo-realistic, instead of being completely made of LEGO blocks.  But I think that setup would be more confusing; I prefer to have my LEGO blocks only for breaking & building.When it comes to LEGO games, each new release tries something new, often with mixed results.  'LEGO Batman 2' attempts an open-world concept that's more in tune with a 'Grand Theft Auto' or 'Arkham City', although not nearly as refined.  Thanks to a map and Alfred's pop-up tutorials, you won't get lost like in other LEGO games where you lost track of all the secrets you were finding.  But unfortunately, these LEGO games have always needed more polish, and there are times where the open-world design doesn't do you any favors.  Characters can get stuck in places, and the framerate doesn't stay smooth when you're exploring the world.Now, I can forgive 'LEGO Batman 2' for not being as polished as other open-world games, because the simplicity in the gameplay means that almost anyone with two hands and full sets of fingers can play.  However, the 2-player action in 'LEGO Batman 2' is more troublesome than usual.  Ever since 2009, the LEGO games have used a splitscreen format for two players, so that players don't get stuck because of the camera.  However, this time the splitscreen really doesn't work well.  For starters, there are times where it will begin splitting the screen even if there's no reason to.  Because of this, both players will have to communicate more clearly than you might've in previous LEGO releases.  Also, there's more of an emphasis to hold the ATTACK button and use the analog stick to target a specific object.  Because of the overzealous splitscreen, my wife or I would literally have to Drop Out or just stand still so that we could break that one tiny object at the top of the screen.  But the WORST use of the splitscreen is definitely the open-world.  Although the screen stays vertically split, my wife and I found it extremely difficult to navigate Gotham City.  Superman is tougher to fly, the waypoint system is inconsistent, the framerate chugs...frankly, I would only use the open-world if you're playing solo.  Otherwise, ask your buddy to take a break unless you find a secret that requries two of you.To be fair, my wife and I aren't patient with each other when it comes to co-op experiences, so I might be overreacting to the camera setup.  But just for this review, I revisited the other LEGO games I owned that used the splitscreen feature --- in my opinion, 'LEGO Batman 2' does it the worst.To clarify my overall experience, I still enjoyed 'LEGO Batman 2' as much as other LEGO games.  It's a shame that the presentation still needs some fine-tuning.  But people who love this series (especially the first 'LEGO Batman') shouldn't hesitate before jumping in.  It's reasonably-priced (as of this review), and it attempts to acheive more than the bare minimum.  There are still some technical hiccups, especially with the multiplayer.  But at the end of the day, 'LEGO Batman 2' is one of the most addictive and entertaining games in the series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2013"}

Even after all this time I really enjoyed playing the game. Sure there are a few things with the gameplay that frustrate but overall the game is still one of the best fps games you can play. The graphics still look amazing even by todays standards. Games today are still trying to look as good. The gameplay is very satisfying as well. Using your suits powers to tackle a situation is incredibly fun. The only complaints i have with the game are with the gameplay however. They are small. At the first of the game you are set in an island and given freedom to tackle the objectives the way you want to. that's great, but trying to find equipment to tackle that objective can be sometimes hard and frustrating to find in such a massive level. Also the enemies can take way too much damage before dying. I was just on the normal setting and i would sometimes load half a clip into a guy before he died. However, this is still one of my favorite games to play. I recommend it to any fps fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2012"}

I've even been featured in EGM magazine several times. I never in my wildest dreams thought that a platformer could come along that was as fun to play as a Mario game and I still might not be convinced that there ever could. (Just to clear up, I'm not including the New Super Mario Bros for Wii and Wii U. I can't stomach the Generic Toadstool crap!) However, if there ever was one, Rayman Origins has come closer to that goal than any other game I have ever played. The only thing that is lacking is somewhat more of a back story that would cause you to become more intimately attatched and invested in the various characters. Maybe I'll get that when my daughter and I beat it. (We're 1/3 of the way through.) 2-player simultaneous play! Fun, Fun, FUN!!!!!!!!!***UPDATE 4-13-13***THIS IS DEFINATELY THE BEST GAME/PLATFORMER TO COME ALONG SINCE SUPER MARIO 1,2,3, AND SUPER MARIO WORLD!!!!Forget what I said about the back story. It's the personality of these characters that sucks you in and makes you love them more than life itself! I have not had this much fun playing, exploring, discovering, defeating, and then going back for more in a game since the first 4 games of the Super Mario series!!!! My 11 year-old daughter and I have been playing this one everyday for over a month now and are a little over 1/2 way through. It has soooo many worlds, levels, and challenges to unfold. It is fresh each time you play and there are always new things to uncover. Then, when you're finished, you get to go back and master your speed runs! Awesome game! Awesome time! I bought this new on Amazon for $9.99. With what I know now, I would have gladly dropped $100 for it. IT'S THAT GOOD!!!!! Look, ignore the price. No matter what you dish out for this one, it will be well worth it. GUARANTEED!!!!!!***UPDATE 5-16-13***It's been a few months since I purchased this game and it is still the only one my daughter and I play. I used to buy 3 games a month! The fact that I have found no need to buy or play any other games says more about Rayman Origins than I could ever write. Do yourself a favor, buy this game, and find out what all the rave has been about for the last couple of years.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2013"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

Brawl. At least--I thought so at first.When I popped the game disk in my Wii, I knew what to expect as far as gameplay went. When playing this game, you can either use the Wiimote + Nunchuk combo, Wiimote alone, Gamecube, or Classic Controller in order to play.Once you start the game, you get the option to immediately start brawling, go into \"Classic Mode\"--where you simply fight enemies off until you end up fighting the \"Master Hand\"--fight others via Internet, or go into your vault.If you're a fan of the Super Smash Bros. series, then you'll automatically be familiar with the controls. You control your character from a 2D perspective and attack whoever is in the area with you. The most common way of killing your enemy is to simply launch them out of the camera's sight. By pressing an attack button and shifting your joystick/pressing your D-pad in a certain direction can you perform special moves that can send your opponents flying to their deaths.At the bottom of the screen during a brawl is a picture of all the present characters, their number of lives--if necessary--and a percentage. Think of this percentage as debt; if you get hit with a high percentage, you're more likely to go flying out of the screen than if you had 0%. This percentage increases every time you get hit in the game.Accompanying you in the game are items that you can collect. These items range from koopa shells, bob-ombs, fire flowers, pokeballs; the list seems to go on and on.When you start the game, you are given a small amount of Nintendo characters to play as and places to play in. Simply by playing the game more can you acheive more characters and places. The following characters are Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, Link, Zelda/Shiek, Fox, Wolf, Falco, Captain Falcon, Kirby, Pikachu, a Pokemon Trainer, Sonic the Hegdehog, Solid Snake, Jigglypuff, Mr. Game & Watch, Ganondorf, R.O.B., Toon Link, Lucario, Lucas, Ness, Marth, Ike, Olimar, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Meta Knight, King Dedede, Samus, and two Ice Climbers. Some of the places you can get are the Mushroom Kingdom, Green Hill Zone, Nintendo DS Pictochat, Game & Watch Land, and many more.For the story part of this game, you get the option to go through a special story-driven brawl part called \"Space Emissary.\" I won't give any spoilers, but the entire story itself is full of twists and turns as the world of Nintendo is being torn apart by war.Graphically speaking, this HAS to be the best-looking game on the Wii. Unlike so many other Wii games, Super Smash Bros. Brawl delivers actual detail to its characters and cutscenes. We probably won't see this much detail in Nintendo's games until the Wii U finally comes out.Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a must-have if you are a Nintendo fan. This game will make sure you come back to it over and over and over again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2011"}

Even with the mouse patch, aiming is a supreme pain in the butt.  The game does not interpret mouse movement well at all, so your aiming sight moves way too fast.  Even with the mouse sensitivity turned all the way down, the aiming sight moves too fast.  Not only does it move too fast, it moves in stops and starts instead of smoothly.  So don't think the mouse patch makes this game playable.Also, the graphics in the PC version are unbelievably bad.  They're worse that the original Gamecube and PS 2 versions. I've heard there is a graphics patch you can download, but with the mouse working so poorly in the game there's no point.  My advice to all the RE 4 fans out there is to get the Wii version.  It looks beautiful, and with the added ease of aiming with the Wiimote it's much more enjoyable to play. Yeah, you won't be able to download all the characters mods, but at least you'll have a good time playing the game.  Seriously, the Wii version rocks.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2012"}

Guberlal","summary":"Eccentric Fantasy","reviewText":"Overview: FFX Project 1997-2001A marvel in the RPG field, breathtaking visuals and an interesting twist to somewhat familiar plotlines. That doesn't mean the plot is overly predictable or trite, it isn't. Like FFVII & IX, you get the sense that after you beat the game, you've just come back from a long, intense journey. There's no need to retread the synopsis of FFX, I think you already know by now what it's about. The only drawback, in a sense that is because you can revisit places when you acquire the Airship, is the loss of the world map. The voiceovers, which many have had problems with, are comical in areas, yet much appreciated compared to the pop-up box of old. When you look at the FF series, your compelled to be spiritual and engaged to the characters and story, with each FF building upon the fundamentals of the last release. The characters aren't the same in every one, actually, there are no mainstay characters like other RPG's. Case in point, there are no retreads of tired stories and characters locked in the same worlds for decades. FFX is fresh, a welcome change in the stale world of RPG's. Don't get me wrong, there are other RPG's out there with quality, but you have to look in this saturated market.Game Controls:Simple enough for anyone.Strategy:I've heard a lot of flack on the strategy of FFX, i.e. the game is too short, too linear, and on and on. My suggestion is that you look on Squaresoft's PlayOnline website and you'll find that there are many secret areas, both on the \"world map\" and different things you're going to find that you missed inside the Cloister of Trials & Temples.Replay Value:As with all FF releases, it depends on what you think of the story, what other games you favor, but for the most part it is incredibly high. FF has always been the type of game that you put away for 6 months or even several years, but want to revisit. It's a solid buy that plays longer than its price tag. And for those of you who resell, generally, FF maintains its value (imagine that, a software title holding its value!) check out the varying prices of FF titles (by sellers, not retailers.)Graphics:State of the art. The gameplay is real and believable. The video sequences are one of the most realistic ever seen. You're more a part of this world than in most any other RPG.Main Characters:Some of the lines spoken and characters are meant for children. Tidus, Rikku, and Yuna are great characters, but they lack the depth of mystery that eminates from Sir Auron, Kimarhi, and Lulu. Wakka is just plain fun. As for the bad characters: Maester Seymour is a pain, yet impressive character, along with his Guado followers. The beasts and bosses are harder than IX and can take some time for the average gamer to figure out. Sir Jecht is Tidus' father and although a jerk, he's also a sad character, even for a bad guy.Overall:A don't miss title that will surely be around the archives for years to come. &lt;P...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2002"}

For NBA 2K11, 2K knew it could not let down the legions of Jordan fanboys and fanatics worldwide by pushing out an inferior product and let me tell you, 2K11 has NOT disappointed me thus far.  I received this game approximately 4 hours ago, THANK YOU UPS GUY, and after 4 hours of non-stop play, I am VERY satisfied.  I'll attempt to break down what I've seen.Pros:1) Michael FREAKING Jordan.  His presence is already the showstopper part of the game, but 2K does not simply include him in a \"Legendary\" team and call it quits.  No, Sir.  As you've already read, they include him on 10 of his legendary Bulls teams whether to relive his classic moments or to use them against current teams.  Another cool feature is the ability to unlock all his Jordan brand shoes where upon wearing them, your player will gain specific stat boosts.2) Inclusion of other legendary teams.  They didn't have to, but they so kindly did.3) Improved AI.  Every year 2K and EA claim they have more life-like AI, this year is different.  Basically once you pop the game in the disk you're already playing as a Jordan-led team and the difficulty was on Pro.  I noticed immediately that the same passes to cutters will not fly.  I played 2K10 on Hall of Fame and those passes were money.  Well, not anymore. It takes a lot more know-how and timing to get things right and I couldn't be happier.4) Buttons and moves.  By this I mean 2K tweaked the buttons slightly and it's made things easier in my estimation.  Circle no longer sets your picks (rather it is the \"fake pass\" button), as it's now L1.  Pushing L1 calls your screener to get into position and releasing it tells him to roll.  Rather than allowing the AI to determine when they should roll allows the player to better gauge what the best play will be.  You can call a quick screen so that he simply slows the guy guarding you down and allow you to blow by for a layup or dunk, or you can set an adequate pick-and-roll (that would make Stockton and Malone happy) by allowing your screener to have a head full of steam before getting the ball.  Performing moves is a lot easier for me this time around, it's hard to get into detail so you'll have to see for yourself.  I say moves are a positive this time around because of the newly added animations allow for more variation when trying to break your defender down.5) Clear difference between Stars and nobodies.  When you're using a superior player and an inferior player guards you, performing moves will easily allow you to \"brush your shoulder\" of the guy.  For instance, if you're using Derrick Rose and Robin Lopez switches to guard you, he's basically screwed.  Higher ball skill ratings vs. lower speed means when you do a move against him, he'll be left in the dust.  Also, star players definitely shine in this game.  If you're using MJ or Kobe, being guarded perfectly doesn't mean your shot will clank.  Everybody knows these two make/made impossible shots, as ridiculous as it looks/seems, they did it for real and you can do it in the game.  Using Kobe in 2K10 was semi-frustrating because it would've been nice if I could've made some of those difficult shots that he makes in reality, now I can see them drop more often that not.  Just my preference that I'd like to see some contested shots go down since some guys can pull it off. Again, you need to see for yourself how clear the difference is now.6) Improved layout & presentation.  You could do without this, but it does look nicer. Presentation looks especially cool, what you'd expect if you were watching a game on ESPN or any other live TV station.  Massive improvement here that wasn't necessary but is absolutely a pleasure to have.7) My Player.  A lot of the things here will seem familiar to you, but 2K did add nice features here and there and allow for a more variation when developing your player.  The combinations of shots, moves, etc. are endless. This feature was already solid in 2K10, but 2K added some nice little features here and there.8) Graphics.  I think the graphics this year around are fairly crisp and to anybody griping about looks, have you ever considered that maybe companies have already maxed out on how great these games can look?  1080p is basically the standard and if it doesn't look as good as you think it should be, try getting an LED tv and then get back to me.Cons:1) Same announcers, but they did add some new one liners.  Either way, playing two games successively means you hear them rant about the same things.  I don't think any game developer is willing to pay two new guys to announce their games every year.2) I have not encountered any bugs thus far, but I suppose with more playing I'll see something? (SEE UPDATE)Conclusion:I think when word got out how amazing 2K11 was, EA finally accepted what they already knew.  They were pushing out an inferior product year after year.  It's never been more obvious this year as EA delayed their interpretation of basketball by 5 (FIVE!) months.  If anybody even tried their demo, I don't blame them.  Frankly, I'd get this game just for the Jordan factor... but I thank 2K Sports for merely letting his presence be an attention grabber while letting their actual game do the talking.  Whether you're a 2K or Live/Elite fanboy, you really owe it to yourself to get this game.  2K didn't have to add a lot of the stuff that they did, but they did so anyways because they really wanted to prove to people that they've mastering their craft with dedication and thought.  I hope that anybody who reads this review got something out of it because ever since popping the game in, I really felt the need for everyone else out there to see what I saw.  If you have any questions or think I'm talking out of my ass, please let me know!  And in the future, don't let EA sell you on their Great Balls of Fire (NBA JAM) to buy their games!  Quality will always win out against HYPE!UPDATE 9/10/10The more and more I play this game, the more I am impressed.  The emphasis this year around was actually SIMULATION of basketball.  This is why so many casual gamers are upset, because they can't simply pick up the controller and score 50 with any star player as they'd hope.  As good as those players are in real life, it's still insanely hard to pull it off on any given night, as it is in the game as well.Year in and year out, the AI is ALWAYS a big issue. Game reviewers and connoisseurs, like myself and I'm sure many of you, always complain about the simpleton computer.  Hall of Fame is NEVER a challenge....... until NOW.  I read a review somewhere else on Amazon, complaining about how hard it was to score and how 2K made the game worse.  These complaints are RIDICULOUS because the guy clearly didn't know what this game's about.However, I've seen a few things that annoyed me.1) Throwing hail mary passes don't work when you're doing them, but the computer can underhand a hail mary pass directly the guy down court.2) Where are the Kobe shoes?3) The new dunk contest.  I preferred last year's version, though I'm glad that Sprite guy who announces it is gone.These little things bug me, but the game is otherwise flawless.  Game play is authentic and the animations are amazing.My advice to anybody in the market for a basketball game is that, know what you're purchasing before you buy it.  If you want some fantasy game where you can do whatever the hell you like and score a million points, you can purchase a copy of Live 2001-forseeable future or even a pre NBA 2K-11 2K game.  This is the finest sports SIMULATION game ever and with that said, you cannot seriously expect to have things be handed to you when playing this.  NBA 2K11 is meant for basketball purists who want the most authentic experience playing their favorite sport in virtual reality.  Performing moves, running plays, making shots, etc.  everything requires attention to detail and an ability to survey the situation at hand... as your favorite baller would in real life.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2010"}

Every single thing about it is spectacular. If this game was a woman, I would marry her. I would die for her. I wouldn't give her children, because I would be worried about messing up her spectacular bloodline.Haha, okay, seriously though, if you are a gamer and you haven't played Uncharted 2, you are doing yourself a huge disservice.

The music is varied and I love having control over where I'm walking. I originally bought this for my daughter and had to use this to show her how everything works. I honestly didn't want to get off the mini-trampoline. She received her mini trampoline as a gift a couple of years ago and just a few months ago I put it into the garage. I'm so glad another reviewer suggested it because the mini trampoline is what makes this game so fun. My thighs after a while had a VERY good work out and she can play this for hours which gives her great exercise while it's cold outside. In my opinion, skip the dance mat and the balance board and get eitherAirzone 38-Inch Mini Band TrampolineorBazoongi 48\" Bouncerto go with it. The fun thing with the trampoline is that you can bounce, walk, or even dance and the steps register just fine. I have a treadmill that I would like to try with this, but it's not in the same room as the Wii, but I imagine that would work very well.We also use it withSennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradleso she can turn the music up and not disturb the rest of the family. Sure, the cost does add up when you have to spend around $140 or more for the set up, but that is very cheap compared to the health implications of not getting enough exercise. I think overweight children and adults would both benefit from and enjoy this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2010"}

Lethal","summary":"a fun game that's both deep and pick up and play","reviewText":"The comparisons to Golden Axe are very apt, but thankfully there are lots of upgrades for each character to add variety to the gameplay.  The RPG elements are there but things like potions can be assigned to shortcuts, so all you have to do is hold L1 and push the face button you've chosen for each such item to be used.  Unlike a traditional RPG you won't find yourself needing to break away from a battle to rummage around for the right armor or weapons.The graphics won't blow you away by modern standards but everything is colorful and well drawn.  It's funny watching my fighter switch between right or left handed the instant I have him face the other direction, but it gives the game an old school charm.  One problem I do have is discerning between my own party members and enemies when things get crowded.  The option to have cursors over enemies would have helped.In addition to the primary story the game gives you side quests that mean revisiting earlier stages, often with areas newly accessible within the stages.  The rewards of gold, upgrade points and added XP make it well worth it.  Plus the bosses are fun and enjoyable to slay a second time.Dragon's Crown is a real gem and should be on every PS3 owner's shopping list.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2013"}
