{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"BassJas","summary":"Not quite what I expected","reviewText":"I picked this game up because I loved the previous Rockstar game, Red Dead Redemption. I've never had an attraction to the GTA series so Red Dead was the first game by Rockstar I played and I loved that game. With than in mind I thought this game would be of the same caliber of gameplay. It does not.This game has an interesting style of gameplay in which you have to determine if your suspects are being truthful, lying, or full of doubt. Interesting concept and I feel it's pulled off well.Where this game falls short for me is in three areas:1) Graphics - the graphics in this game are a little stiff, they're basically the same graphic quality as Red Dead Redemption2) story - each case has is its own storyline to follow but I find that this makes the overall game experience disjointed. I like games to have a solid and forward moving storyline and I find that this game doesn't really have that (I must note that at this point I've only finished about 2/3 of the game)3) Gameplay - this game has very little action in it which is a farcry from the gaming experience of Red Dead (maybe I'm just too hung up on a great game and am expecting this one to be like that one in a different setting)All in all, this isn't a horrible game. The voice acting and face technology used in the animation is impressive. I like games to have more of an overarching storyline and the feeling of a more disjointed story leaves much to be desired. The game is worth playing at least once but I don't see playing this game a second time around.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2012"}

You can spend year after year on a game like this and you woudn't get bored. It is really incredible. Truly, it is a masterpiece. Here is the score:Graphics:Decent. Not Excellent, not Perfect, but good enough. It offers advanced terrain scenery. Indoor and outdoor scenery is certainly fineley designed. The Dynamic Lightning system and the real-time shadows are very good. The high polygon accounts and realistic textures and objects throughout the game and so on are incredible. Although the animations of the characters are done cheesy from my opinion. Graphics score: 7.8/10Audio:Very Good. I'm going to start out with the music. The music is excellent, it suits the theme of the game. When you are exploring a huge mountain or city and so on when you here that classical exploration music or when you are in an intense battle with a creature in morrowind the music really makes you feel like your there.

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"J.

{"product_name":"B00DC7O77A","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Not For the Faint of Heart","reviewText":"The Good:+Great visuals+Good level designs+Lots of secrets and collectiblesThe Bad-It can be excruciatingly difficult; filled to the brim with trial and error momentsIt's kind of funny to see Donkey Kong again.  Back in the Super Nintendo era the Donkey Kong Country series was one of the undisputed kings of the platformer.  When he finally came back and had an all new adventure on the Wii it was exciting.  A true blue platformer.  Now we've got Tropical Freeze.  A game that does exactly what Donkey Kong Country Returns does with some excruciating difficulty and some very well designed levels.Donkey Kong Country games have never been one for story.  It's no different here.  A ship full of arctic like animals are going to put DK island in a freeze and now Donkey Kong has to save his home.  That's about it as far as story goes.  You're pushed into the game immediately thereafter.  There are no gimmicks at play with Tropical Freeze.  The game starts off pretty simple.  Slowly introducing you to simple jumps and giving you a chance to get acquainted with your supporting characters.  This time around Donkey Kong and Diddy have two allies to accompany them.  Dixie Kong and Crank Kong.All of these characters can help DK navigate some of the more treacherous jumps.  Diddy allows Donkey Kong to hover across gaps.  Dixe has her helicopter spin that can also propel him upward, and Cranky Kong has his cane to provide a higher bounce for DK when he needs it.  The game supports co-op play just fine.  But this isn't the kind of game where you'll want to actually spend much of that time messing around.  Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is hard.  The difficulty alone will make or break the game for you.  And this time around, Retro Studios or Nintendo pulled no stops.  You will die.  A lot.  Don't be fooled by how easy the first couple of levels seem.  When Tropical Freeze amps up in difficulty it really amps up.The difficulty can prove a small problem in the sense that a lot of it is going to feel like trial and error.  You'll storm into a level and be stalled by a challenge only to get past it to be completely unprepared for the next one ahead.  There are a lot of moments like this.  You'll feel joy at surviving one challenge only to be completely flattened by the next.  In the past Nintendo has utilized a Super Guide that would eventually just play the level for you (or they'd give you something to make you invincible) but you'll find no such forgiveness here.  Luckily, however, you'll acquire extra lives pretty easily.  Despite the difficulty, you'll certainly be in the game for a while.  If a level doesn't reward you with an extra life you can always buy one from one of the shops.  You can also buy other items to help you along such as an extra heart for an extra hit, or you can buy something to make you temporarily invincible.  Or you can buy something that'll save you when you fall into a pit.The majority of your deaths are going to be from falling into pits more than anything.  That is until you get to some of the boss battles.  Once you get the pattern down they're not too difficult but until then it can be quite difficult at first glance.A lot of Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is about learning through dying.  Many a platformer is designed this way.  But Tropical Freeze is pretty unforgiving about it.  If you can get through that hurdle the game is actually one of the best you can find on the Wii U.  It is devilishly difficult, and sometimes your flow will be disrupted.  But it's also fun and feels really good when you finally best a level that you died in ten plus times.  That being said, however, I imagine a lot of gamers will be frustrated with Tropical Freeze to the point of quitting.  This is a game where you'll have to learn through dying.  And if you aren't prepared to do that you will most certainly not have any fun with it.  There are also plenty of hidden goodies like bonus rooms, puzzle pieces and the KONG letters scattered about.  Some of these are hard to uncover without some trial and error (for instance a bonus barrel might be down a pit) or without the right companion to help you.That being said the level design itself is really beautiful.  It's all in crisp HD.  Likewise, blasting into the background and back into the foreground is still impressive.  The levels are sometimes wonderfully detailed with set pieces in the background and in front of you changing in epic ways.  Graphically Donkey Kong can still impress in such simple ways.  The music is also top notch.  You'll find some tunes remixed (Aquatic Ambiance and Stickerbrush Symphony are gorgeous remasters here) and a few newer ones.The only real knock against Tropical Freeze is that it doesn't always feel like it does a lot to separate itself from the original Donkey Kong Country Returns.  It's got some good level design but it's not a huge leap above its predecessor.  That's not necessarily bad.  The game itself still has nothing on the Super Nintendo classics but it still makes a good companion piece.It's worth checking out Tropical Freeze, but it isn't for the lighthearted gamer.  It's a very challenging game.  Many a game will be understood and bested in a matter of a couple of hours, but Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze isn't one of them.  If you are easily frustrated or can't deal with some of the trial and error moments it isn't for you.  If, however, you're prepared and have accepted that death is not only inevitable, but a requirement in Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze then you're going to have a lot of fun with it's challenges, interesting level designs and gorgeous set pieces.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2014"}

Its the same story for this game,  you start as an undercover cop joining the gang to work your way up and take out the leader of the other gangs.This is more of a fighting game than a Shooting Game,  If you learn the controls the fighting system is flawless, and smooth,  as you progress the fighting doesn't get easier because as you gain experience and learn more combinations the enemies are better able to defend themselves.At first the driving seems to tight but as you get use to it, it almost feels perfect,  no matter how fast you go its hard to make the car flip over and making tight corner turns is a breeze, Drifting is a breeze to.The Money system is better,  you never seem to have enough money to buy all the clothes and cars in the market.  There's more clothing variety in this game than what I have in my closet. In the Cut Scenes they present the clothes you dressed your character in. which is a Plus.There's a lot of side missions, and opportunities to hack Cameras, Combination Locks, Passwords, Lock-picking and Bug Planting.I don't understand why there's features to upgrade the apartment if you can't do anything,  you can't watch TV, Cook, Take a shower, use the computer, can't use the punching bag that's in the apartment and can't use the indoor pool.Can't purchase weapons and can only carry one at a timeOne Tip I would give is to not rely on the AutoSave because it does not save everything you do, make sure you save before every mission because about 4 times the whole system froze after completing a mission.

There is so much wrong and frustrating about this game, that I don't even know where to start. How do you push a game from release several times over and still release a stinker such as Too Human? I'm sorry, but the team over to Microsoft Games took one from the page of the makers of Alone in the Dark over to Atari with Too Human.Graphics: Subpar at best. PS1 at its worst. For whatever reason, when you venture into Cyberspace, the graphics take a jump through time, back into the 1980's with flat grounds and environments. Why doesn't the water move?Controls: Okay, however I can't tell you how many times I started swinging my weapon around while trying to adjust the annoying camera with the right analog stick. Another page from Atari's Alone in the Dark? Why on earth did they do this? You have two other buttons that are'nt even used! Arghh! Frustrating. Swinging your weapon with the right analog stick is absolutely miserable and single-handly takes away any \"fun\" that the combat has to offer.Note to game makers: Halo's controls were great and spot on. Follow what works, and has been tested.Gameplay: OMG! Repetative! The same enemies over and over and over again, with the occassional new one thrown in to say that they atleast tried to spice the game up. Just wait until you try and target a floating enemy with a gun while 900 unkillable enimies flatten you in two seconds. Oh, and don't get me started on the Valkiyre cutscene everytime you die.Speaking of dying, although you don't have to restart the entire level when your character perishes, you'll soon wish you did, if that meant you could skip the annoying Valiyre cutscene.

Its not so focused on stealth, or at least not to the point that it becomes frustrating.Pros:solid graphics and soundgritty gameplaymark and execute system is goodAbility to use diverse tactics and approachesCO-OP modes, are a GREAT addition, thank you!!Awesome co-op and single player campaignsCons:There are only a few small complaints about this game. It is somewhat buggy. Many times I was \"stuck\" on something and completely unable to move. Other times after being incapped, I would be laying on top of a railing or other object that should not have been able to support me at all.Another small complaint is the lack of clothing variation. The regular suit that you have to start with doesn't have any color variations? What? Small complaint, but just a cut and polish issue.The big complaint I have with the game is the \"last stand\" mode. They force you to protect this EMP bomb, which completely limits your ability to move around. On top of that, its very much a \"run and gun\" mode, but with only two players to rely on, it is exceedingly difficult. The addition of a four player mode would have made this much more enjoyable instead of frustrating like it is now. They also do not replenish your ammo at all, or have any ammo box for you to continue using the weapons of your choice. On top of that, there are no spots that are easily defended and the opponents are so aggressive its crazy. It just seems like this particular game mode was broken and didn't fit the game at all. It would be fun if they got rid of the \"defend the EMP\" part of it and just made it wave after wave of bad-guys. Just my opinion.MAKE THE hunter, last stand and face-off modes four player!!!There is a lot of opportunity here for expansion via DLC and updates, and I really hope they do it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2010"}

I remember having vivid dreams the Mario Bros. and I going on adventures to rid the Mushroom Kingdom of the Koopa Family. Each morning I would wake to find that my dreams had not come true and I would just go on playing my old copy of Super Mario Bros. 3 like it was the newest game.

His son, the boy who would eventually become a man to carry on the family name, would have a unique video game system that He phoned my Mom excitedly but then realized only japanese games would work for this particular console. And since his son (me) was not fluent in Japanese decided to reconsider and purchase an American SNES.Needless to say I was very disappointed when he came home empty handed.

I'm impressed! I mean really impressed!  The graphics and huge maps for each level are mind boggling.  I haven't been this blown away by a game's design since Tron.  FarCry is a linear shooter without the ridiculuous puzzles and other garbage (like &quot;secret areas&quot;, etc.).  It's a little like a version of Soldier of Fortune that's finally been put together correctly.  The replay value will be great because of the overall design.  For example, the level I'm on has at least two ways to get to the final destination and three way to make it into the compound.  The first try was a bit too hard (enemy firepower), so I backed off to try something else and ended up hang-gliding into the area.  Each level is like this -- more than one way to accomplish the objective -- either on foot, by buggy/Humvee or boat.  You can shoot from any position (even leaning), go prone, crouch, crawl through beautifully rendered jungle and other terrain.  All the vehicles except helicopters are usable and well thought-out.  The available weapons are well balanced, and the number you can carry is limited to just four which calls for decisions (good).  And the AI ranges from good to incredible.  On several occasions, the NPC's acted exactly like I would expect from a live opponent online (especially good is they way they'll try to flank you).  The only glitch, and it's a big one (loss of a star), is the checkpoint gamesave system.  This often seems arbitrary and is frustrating.  One some levels you seem to go for a very long time through many difficult encounters with no save-game.  On others, the going is relatively easy and there are several, almost unnecessary save-games.  This has caused me a lot of frustration and curses yelled at the screen.  They could have a least put in a quicksave feature.  (I know there's a way to do it through the console, but it's just not the same). I have actually had to dial the difficulty back from challenging to medium because of this. You also need a pretty decent system to run FarCry properly.  I have a 3.0 GHz P4 with 1024 MB RAM and a 9800XT.  It has run flawlessly at high detail (there's a setup program that detects what settings you should use).  I'm only about 2/3 finished with the single player game and I haven't tried the multiplayer.  I understand there were initial issues, but a patch (27 MB) has been issued which is supposed to fix most of the problems.  Even better, the gaming community is already coming out with mods and new maps (and there is a 64 bit version with even larger maps in the works).  If you like straight FPS games, this one is a must have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00005NN5G","reviewerName":"Joe Sherry","summary":"great game, lacks replay value when everything is done","reviewText":"I first picked up this game more than a year ago when I bought my Playstation 2.  I had previously played Tony Hawk 2 (but not the first one) and absolutely loved it.  Tony Hawk 3 was somewhat easier since I had already developed a lot of my skills on the previous game.  Even though playing the game was easier than my first time playing the series, the developers had upped the challenge by making goals with higher point requirements and goals that are more difficult to complete.  The addition of the Revert trick allowed for higher scores since we could now link vert tricks to grinds and back to vert.One problem: While I had a blast playing through the game, after I completely mastered the game with one character, mastering the game with every character was far too easy.  The game was still fun to play, but there was no challenge.  When I finally mastered the game with every character (including the bonus characters) there was no reason to keep playing the game and when I went back to play some more, I found that the game had no replay value beyond mastering every character.  I was just going through the motions and not really enjoying it any more.My final thought is that Tony Hawk 3 is an excellent game and a lot of fun.  However, when you reach the point where there is nothing left to do except create your own character, the funs pretty quickly.

Now she must face the Space Pirates once again in an all-new adventure.","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"Beautiful, Yet Flawed","reviewText":"Without hesitation, I'll openly admit that Metroid Prime was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. Nintendo's promotion which promised a copy of Prime free, alongside the purchase of a GameCube, is without question the reason I'm the proud owner of a GCN today. To my eyes, it was to Nintendo what Halo was to Microsoft. Justification. One title that looked like an absolute \"can't miss.\" For the most part, Prime performed exactly like Halo; it delivered in grand, Earth-shaking fashion. But then it hit a couple snags.From the moment you press that \"power\" button on the system's roof, there's no doubt that this baby has been polished to a gleam. Everything from the opening sound effects to the theme song to the incredible background footage that enhances the options screen is flawless. The in-game HUD is simple, yet effective, the options and status screens easy to navigate. Five minutes into the action, you'll be expertly navigating the most complex screens without so much as a second thought.The attention to detail in Prime is off the charts. This is more than just a three dimensional first person shooter. It's an entire WORLD, with every single possibility accounted for. Moss grows in humid areas. If an errant missile explodes at the right angle, you'll catch a glimpse of Samus's face, reflected in the glass of her visor. Wander too close to a cloud of steam, and the visor will fog up for a few seconds. Quality control was all over this game, and it really shows.Ditto for the visuals. The new title is everything I imagined  it might be, and more. This is Metroid fully realized in three dimensions, to stunning result. Classic series enemies such as the Space Pirates and the Metroids themselves coexist side by side with new creatures perfectly suited for the same atmosphere.  It's like every new title in the classic series peels away a new layer of  the ecosystem. The new animals match the old flawlessly. The terrains, the vehicles, the weapons, the mazes... everything is simply stunning, to the point where I'd say it's among the top three or four games, visually, of all time. I'd rank it just above Halo in terms of breathtaking, heart-stopping beauty. That's right, the GameCube outguns the Xbox in this fight.If the visuals of Metroid Prime are a sheer work of art, the audio is in a league of its own. There's really nothing in the world that can serve to pull an entire package together as tightly as a perfectly placed tune. It's in this area, which Metroid makes its greatest impression. The music, occasionally a touch repetitive, is thoroughly compelling and, at times, an enormous chunk of icing on an already delicious cake. While the hours you'll spend underwater are truly a sight to behold on their own, they become absolutely awe-inspiring when paired with the perfect, slow, ambient melody chosen as their accompaniment. There's a true story of techno meets industrial meets trance hidden within the soundtrack of Metroid Prime, one with which you'll never grow tired.It's when I get to gameplay that Prime takes its first missteps. While one might suspect the title would control very similarly to Halo, Unreal Tournament or Quake III (where one stick controls movement and the other aims), Metroid instead took a small step backwards, to a control scheme reminiscent of Doom and Wolfenstein 3-D. The left stick moves the player forward and backward, and turns the screen left or right. Players can strafe by holding down the L button and pressing left or right, and may look up or down by holding the R button and maneuvering the control stick in any direction.Each of the game's four weapons are required to open certain doors around the world, and serve as an indicator of where exactly you should be at any moment in time. Unfortunately, doors don't always open on the first shot. Or the second. Or, occasionally, the tenth or eleventh. I've literally stood in front of a door, constantly firing, for over a minute while I waited for the thing to \"sense\" my gunfire. While that's a minor annoyance, exploring a remote area, it's more than a little frustrating when running from an angry pack of bloodthirsty enemies.Perhaps the coolest thing about Prime is the implementation of the morph ball. The moment you press X, the screen shifts from first person mode to third person, and the game transforms from a first person shooter to a 3-D puzzle game. Surprisingly enough, the two genres merge flawlessly and act as an enjoyable change of pace from one another.I enjoyed the storyline, despite being confused on more than one occasion, and was kept enthralled until the final battle, completely expecting the closing sequence to blow me away. Well, it didn't quite turn out that way. My fifteen hours of game time were capped off by one of the most disappointing endings I've ever witnessed. No joke, the credits rolled for THREE TIMES AS LONG as the closing cinema. Then Metroid proudly announced that I'd unlocked \"Hard Mode.\"Despite my qualms and my intense irritation over the unacceptable closing sequence, Metroid Prime remains a very solid game, spanning two very notable genres with impressive results. The visuals and sounds are setting a new standard for the industry, and the game is a tremendous rush to play. The sense of exploration and discovery has carried over flawlessly in the transition from side-scrolling platformer to three dimensional FPS. It loses points for its lack of multiplayer functionality, in addition to a few questionable choices in the control scheme, the horrendous let down after the final boss and that nasty bug involving the doorways. Still, make no mistake, this is an unbelievable title. It's worth every bit of the forty dollars the big \"N\" is still asking for it. Just don't go in expecting a big payoff for all your work, as I did.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2003"}

Played out with plenty of black humor and dark irony, the game will immerse players in twisted parodies of classic fantasy scenarios and characters.","reviewerName":"Aaron \"Pwnerer\"","summary":"Amazing game play experience.","reviewText":"I finally decided to order Overlord for the 360 on Amazon for 6 dollars. I wasn't sure what to expect, having never really heard of it prior.It came, I popped it in and well, I never looked back. I've been playing it almost exclusively for the past 4 days now and I am blown away by how much of a wonderful game this is.As the game opens you (the overlord) is being woken up from a long slumber by some wicked little gremlins you'll later refer to as \"minions\". These creatures explain some of what happened to you, and start equipping you in Overlord armor, and after some more dialogue and a little training, you begin your quest.As The Overlord, your goal is to be evil. Now that can mean a little evil, or extremely evil, it's up to you, and your choices throughout the game WILL have an impact on the story.You control minions of different types, like red minions specialize in fire, for example. All in all there's brown, green, red, and blues you'll be controlling. You can make your minions fight for you, pillage and loot villages, and basically anything else, like opening doors and gates, etc.In this sense, the game takes on an RTS quality, because you'll have to be strategic with your minions to solve puzzles and beat bosses. At other times though, it's an RPG the likes of Fable.The graphics don't do a whole lot to show true next-gen visuals, but having said that the graphics are still nice and the world is beautiful to look at.Now this game, although you play an evil character, is not a DARK game. It's more of a parody of other fantasy games/movies, the biggest example being Lord of The Rings. Your minions, as well as enemies and townsfolk all have incredibly funny lines and do funny things, and yes this game will make you laugh from time to time.Other times it can be frustrating though. There is NO WORLD MAP, so you'll often get turned around a lot. The controls are also a little sloppy, and it takes a LONG time to get used to them, especially when you have to control seperate minion types at the same time, very quickly.There's a lot more to be said about Overlord, but trust me when I say it's a FANTASTIC game that deserves to be played, and right now you can grab it for LESS than 10 dollars.Aside from controls, this is truly a 5 star title.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2010"}

One is why with the armenians and russians on the western front? There was no one other than germans serving in that Circle. These guys tried to kill Hitler a number of times including Operation Valkyrie , i don't remember armenians or russians involved? The graphics make these guys to look like armenians and russians and sound like them , all i need was a Glendale accent of \"Killing Nazi Bro?\" Second was the over all controls , you need to be a circus juggler to jump from button when the action gets fast. Also remember my grandfather served in the german military in WW2 , the Waffen SS and not all germans like this game are nazi party types i see a lot of german army guys in it.

{"product_name":"B00002STYS","description":"Mortal Kombat Super Nintendo Game Cartridge.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"A tremendous achievment marred by gameplay","reviewText":"Mortal Kombat, back in 1991, dominated the arcade scene and gave Street Fighter II a run for its money. So when news broke that it was coming out for the SNES and Genesis consoles, everyone rejoiced and the bragging rights for best version of this game was up for grabs. When the dust cleared, it was obvious each version had its pros and cons.For the SNES this was, for the most part, a faithful port of the arcade game. It had all the stages and the \"Test Your Might\" mini-games, the original music, the original characters plus the secret character and the end boss, Shang Tsung. The graphics were crisp and clear while the music sounded just like in the arcade game; controls were easy to get used like in the arcade game. However, the game came heavily censored; the blood was changed to look like sweat. Some of the fatalities were toned down considerably and replaced with \"non violent\" finishing moves (Kano, Sub Zero, Johnny Cage and Raiden.) They even went as far as to make sure you could not send anyone through the spikes at one stage that takes place on top of a bridge when you wanted to fulfill the requirement to fight the secret character, Reptile. The controls, while easy to get used to, were slightly changed from the arcade game and some of the basic moves were taken out entirely.So it was a major gamble for Nintendo that didn't pay off; the Genesis version, while regarded as inferior to the SNES version because of its fuzzy graphics and featured different music for the stages, had the gore and fatalities available as long as you entered a secret code. Sales wise, it beat out the SNES version as punishment for the backlash against Nintendo's family friendly policy.Pick this one up only for nostalgic reasons as Mortal Kombat II, is the sequel and better game and it came out fully uncensored.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2010"}

The world&#146;s greatest secret agent returns in his fifth interactive adventure from EA GAMES, and the action has never been more intense. Think like Bond as never before, using espionage, tactical skills, and Q-Lab gadgets to analyze every situation. Act like Bond, using your stylish physical skills, clever disguises, and bold personality to once again save the world. With every Bond moment played out before you in an all-new, third-person cinematic perspective, this action-packed adventure could only come from the world of James Bond. What would Bond do? What will you do?","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Finally a good Bond game","reviewText":"James Bond returns to the small screen in his finest performance yet on this generation of consoles. 007: Everything or Nothing's high-octane action accurately captures the spirit of Bond with a snappy variety of hijinks and a roster of talent that packs in Hollywood stars like sardines. Everything or Nothing represents a sizable leap forward in EA's line of 007 games. The star-studded cast would've been suitable for an actual movie; instead, EoN's original tale deploys the likenesses and voices of Pierce Brosnan as Bond, Judi Dench as M, John Cleese as Q, Shannon Elizabeth and Heidi Klum as Bond girls, and Willem Dafoe as Nicolai Diavolo, a villain bent on an plot involving nanobots. The camera has been pulled back to a third-person perspective, which adds to the authentic Bond atmosphere and pervasively cinematic feel by putting his famously dashing self on the screen. Also maintaining that Bond spirit, 007 tackles a crazy number of gameplay styles-he mans tank turrets, drives cars and motorcycles, flies helicopters, sneaks through shadows, and blazes away with all manner of weaponry. EA also dispensed with the cheesy dialogue and chintzy gadgets that made earlier games ring false. 007 makes great use of awesome gizmos ranging from a spider drone to a belt-mounted rappel that lets him climb or descend at will. Solid multiplayer support comes in the form of two-player cooperative missions and four-player arenas, while the PS2 version offers online co-op play. Innovative controls help you manage the switch to third-person...mostly. Targeting happens via a lock-on system, but sometimes it can be hard to light up the target you want. With practice, you learn that 007 must be facing an enemy to target him, regardless of where the camera is facing. Counterbalancing that is the effective cursor within the cursor-once you lock on, you can steer a small dot with the right stick to fine-tune your aim and go for head shots. The Spidey-like Bond sense, which activates when the game's paused, helpfully highlights rappel points, selectable objects, and more. Everything else performs smoothly, which is impressive given how many different tasks you undertake in this game. EoN is no mindless shooter. If you don't wisely use the new crouch and back-against-the-wall moves, you'll be sliced to ribbons out in the open-fast. The enemy A.I. pulls its weight, using cover well and reacting to player tactics with reasonable intelligence. The lack of checkpoints or in-game saves, along with the sometimes-stingy supply of health and ammo, means that frustration can become a factor, though not to an agonizing extent. Surprisingly, this adds up to a game that feels aimed more toward hardcore gamers than you might expect. On the presentation side, EoN delivers high quality and a big-budget feel. The differences between the PS2, Xbox, and GameCube versions are marginal at best, so it's a matter of picking your favorite controller or perhaps the Xbox's slightly better graphics. Across the board, the slick environments, cut-scenes, and character faces shine, although some of the animations are awkward, particularly when 007 runs. A great title song by Mya, strong voice acting, and booming sound effects complete the package. Like the better Bond films, EoN delivers exactly what you expect and hope for, and that's a good thing. This action extravaganza definitely brings 007 in out of the cold.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"DanD","summary":"A beautiful game marred by horrible controls.","reviewText":"DANTE'S INFERNO is basically a GOD OF WAR clone.  If you liked GOD OF WAR (and it seems most people did), you'll like DANTE'S INFERNO.  The problem is, INFERNO inherits all of WAR's flaws: no control over the camera angle; needlessly repeated animations; delayed movement; and excessive repetition of actions (swinging through fire...again...)That isn't to say the game has no redeeming features.  It's one of the most beautiful games I've played--the interpretation of Hell (NOT Dante's, by the way) is creative and disturbing; some of the enemies (who appear so often, as in WAR, that you'll get tired of them) are ingenious, as are the bosses (and again, as in WAR, you'll get tired of fighting them, because let's face it, you're going to die a lot).  The storyline, too, is clever: Dante, far from being a meek poet, is in fact a warrior who must rescue his beloved Beatrice from the clutches of Lucifer (she doesn't seem worth it, but whatever).  She is in Hell because of Dante's own sin, and he is guided (rather, informed, and infrequently at that) by the great poet Virgil.The game bears little resemblance to the epic poem; in fact, you could enjoy this game even if you think THE DIVINE COMEDY is some canceled Fox sitcom about a priest.  That's not in question (nor do I think anyone expected a loyal adaptation).  What truly flaws DANTE'S INFERNO is the lack of camera control. Dashing away from enemies is nice...except, since you can't always tell which way you're facing, you don't always know where you're dashing TOO.  And some of those ledges are completely hidden from view; you have to jump on faith (which is quite often misplaced).  Besides, the game is so beautiful, it would be nice to have more control over where you look.  You kind of want to just wander around, taking in the view.  In that regard, the game undermines itself, which is a shame, since this had such potential to be a great action game, with stellar graphics and a storyline just intriguing enough to keep us going along.  As is, I recommend playing DANTE'S INFERNO for the graphics alone; if you can put up with the lousy camera and controls, it's worth it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2011"}

Most of the changes are cosmetic or an attempt to keep players \"in the experience\" as much as possible.  And there lies the problem.  Fable 3 is, in its heart, still an RPG.  However, the RPG elements and menus are now not so cleverly disguised as a\"road to rule\" which shows your progress as well as the \"sanctuary\" where you can go to change your appearance, save your game, find your stats, etc.  Things that used to be relatively simple to do in Fable 2 are now annoyingly complicated.  For example, to save a game you have to leave the game by pressing the start key, which sends you to the \"sanctuary\" where you have to walk over to a wall, press two more buttons before you're given a menu where you can save the game.  In order to change clothes you have to go to the sanctuary, walk to the \"dressing room\", then walk around the room looking at mannequins trying to find the exact thing you were looking for.  Talk about taking you out of the experience!  What's so bad about about a good old menu to streamline things?My other gripe with the game is that progress is maddeningly slow.  Each new item or concept is introduced gradually, usually requiring you to leave the game, go to the sanctuary and listen to some long winded explanation, which fortunately is narrated by John Cleese. I mean, I know how to use a gun in a game, I don't need it explained to me.  Everything is explained in nauseating detail.  It's an RPG, the player knows he or she is going to be questing.  Having it explained in game as if it's some earth shattering concept is a little insulting.So to sum up, if you liked Fable 2, and don't mind a little tediousness, then Fable 3 is probably worth picking up after the price drops. If you're new to the series, you're probably better off picking up a copy of Fable 2 and playing that instead.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2010"}

Although the story isn't as or near \"compelling\" as Halo's this game has an extreamly awesome Sci fi like storyline.  I won't go into the storyline because you'll soon find out for yourself in this game.Doom 3 pretty much takes place in MARS Space facility were you are on a training mission...lucky enough...the Portal to hell has open putting a near-apoclyptic battle against good and evil...The humans being the good of course and the demonic beasts and zombies being the evil...well sadly enough you are pretty much the only person that's still alive in the space facilty and alll of your other comrads, scienctest ect have bin either mutilated or turned into one of hells army...Then....you though it!

The one major problem I had was it got really old and really fast when the demons would just pop out of the most predictable places, and some of the cheap scares were just plain lame.  Yes the Technology is great but ID could have made the gameplay ALOT better..but I'm not trying to complain here, I really enjoy the gameplay and the arsenal of weapons that is bestowed upon you..Visuals, sound, controls are nearly flawless and the gameplay could have bin a tad bit better but something I have to give ID credit for is probably my most favorite part of the game and one of the most remarkable thing in the game.....These guys are brilliant!  They pulled off \"hells\" image so well!  This game really defines the word \"HELL\" and I don't think any film has ever pulled anything this insane since The movie JACOBS LADDER...I truly give credit to the guys at ID, they did a fantastic job making mars look like another image of hell...Just play this game for your self and you'll see why I'm raving about how well this game defines the word \"Hell\"...Other then that...The Good-Awesome Sci Fi storyline-Superb control works-Stunning, jawdropping visuals-Really defines the word \"Hell\"..-A great arsenal of weapons and probably the coolest looking shotgun I've ever seen in a game-As bin said before by tons of people, one of the longest FPS's you'll ever play, it's way longer then Halo 2...not that I should be bringing that game up...The bad-Some people might find it a bit \"too\" linear-Other then the amazing High value production this game is medicore at it's best..It's just \"Kill, next room, kill then get the key and doing it allllll over again\"-REGULAR EDITION DOES NOT COME WITH THE 2 CLASSIC DOOM GAMES...Only limited collecters Edition-This really isn't a bad but unlike the HALO2 CE that is still instores, Doom3's limited Collecters Edition will run out fast and from the looks of it we won't be seeing any more by the time they sell out, just like Resident Evil 4's collecters Edition so get them while there still in stores..Other then that I've already said what I've wanted to say..Doom 3 is phenomenal.

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Tomb Raider Underworld","reviewText":"I first booted up a Tomb Raider game when the U.K's Official Sega Saturn Magazine gave away a free demo copy of the original game's City of Vilcabamba level, waaaaay back when in 1994/5. It's thirteen years later and through good (TR: Anniversary, TR The Last Revelation) and bad (TR: Angel of Darkness, TR: Chronicles) I've managed to get my hands on pretty much every TR game since the original. I love them, and I love Lara.TR: Underworld isn't the best game of the series to date (IMO that crown still belongs to Anniversary), but it's certainly in the top four. Across all boards it excels at what makes the adventures of Lara Croft so damn playable: the level design is exquisite, the story's gripping and the graphics are point-at-the-screen great.It has some faults, though, and those come in the form of mostly unnecessary gameplay glitches, and a lack of cutscenes to forward the plot.GRAPHICS: 4/5TR: Underworld is the game that made me buy a PS3, and, running this game at 1080p through an HDMI cable is a revelation: TR: Underworld looks almost real. Sunlight catches exquisitely bump-mapped rocky outcrops, palm fronds ripple and shake as Lara passes through them, minor henchmen enemies look as good as the main characters, and the surface of water ripples and reacts beautifully to disruptions. Lara herself is absolutely beautiful (from a technical point of view) and the secondary characters (with the exception of Amanda, who still looks a bit like a PS2 Goth) are every bit as detailed and lovingly textured. Animation, for the most part, is gorgeous.There are some downers: the design of some of the more prolific enemies in the latter part of the game is repetitive and dull, and the overall tone of the game is dark and, in many places, dreary. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is a far prettier game - TR: Underworld is as good, graphically speaking - but this reviewer would have preferred more colours than grey, blue and green.That being said, I caught myself on several occasions saying \"Wooooow\", genuinely surprised at the quality and the design of the inhabitants and locations of TR: Underworld - this is an extremely beautiful game.SOUND: 2/5It's a pity that the developers didn't come up with next-gen sound to go with Lara's first next-gen outing. TR: Underworld sounds like a PS2 game. This is not a major issue, mind you, and the voice acting is very, very good indeed, but the music and sound effects do nothing new and are not memorable. Still, one does not play Tomb Raider for the sound, and what's there does a perfectly adequate job.PLAYABILITY: 4/5TR: Underworld does indeed return to Lara's roots of enormous game arenas, almost no hints for cryptic puzzles, and that favoured enter-area-find-relic-use-as-key/weapon-leave-area gameplay that we've loved for over a decade. With few changes to how Ms Croft moves and interacts with her environment (bar the inclusion of a self-renewing, finite number of sticky grenades in addition to your primary pistols, extremely useful in later levels when baddies come thick and fast), \"If it ain't broke don't fix it\" works here: for the most part, TR: Underworld controls like a dream.The downsides come in the shape of lousy enemy AI (you could kill most of 'em with a dirty look), and pointless, tacked-on-as-an-afterthought \"hand to hand\" combat moves for Lara (use guns!! For heaven's sake, use your guns!!). Mind you, you do have the option to set enemy health to Low - I'd recommend this - and concentrate solely on adventuring, using brief killing sprees as short interludes to the game's main purpose.As always, the camera causes some issues here and there. And, disappointingly, Lara sometimes gets \"stuck\" in walls, corners or bits of debris. Although you can get out of all of this with a few creative jiggles of the analog stick and the occasional tap of the circle button, the game's programming does feel decidedly unfinished because of it.LASTIBILITY: 3/5As with any TR game, TR: Underworld is something you'll complete, go away from, come back to again, replay, and so on and so forth. I've had one play through and can't see myself going back to it again very soon, but the unlockable rewards and treasure system will see to it that I will. First-time play on a Normal difficulty level totals around ten to twelve hours (without a walkthrough or a cheat guide), subsequent plays will be less. It doesn't have a Final Fantasy lifespan, and is essentially a shorter game than Anniversary (although this could simply be a lack of cutscenes to forward the plot, making the game \"feel\" shorter than it is), with some \"filler\" levels taking less than three minutes to complete first-try.Still, while you're in the middle of it, TR: Underworld is a great game, a satisfying outing for Lara on PS3, and overall, a worthy addition to anyone's library of adventure games. Overall, I'm giving it a 3.5 out of 5 stars. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is slightly better in terms of control and aesthetics (although this is simply my personal preference, not a universally applicable criticism), but it is hard to resist the seductive silence and head-scratching solitude of TR:Underworld.Recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003O6ED7S","description":"","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"Another disappointing collector's edition.","reviewText":"I don't know about you, but I'm sick of poor collector's editions of games. Every once in a while, we'll get a really good one, regardless of the quality of the game. Marc Ecko's Getting Up, for example, was loaded. Then you get some incredible games that get great collector's editions, like Fallout 3 which came with a tin lunchbox, making of the game dvd, bobblehead and art book. But most of the time, the collector's editions aren't worth buying. Look at The Force Unleashed 2, Final Fantasy XIV, and many others over the last couple of years LittleBigPlanet 2 doesn't quite fall into that category, but it's close. Why? Because it's not too good when the best thing about a big box set is the downloadable content codes.First up, the obvious portion of this set- the game. I'll do a separate review for this, but if you want something with tons of replay, LBP2 delivers with an even bigger level editor mode than the last game's, including a game creator feature. They fixed a couple of the problems I had with the first game too, and all your DLC from the first LBP carries over to the sequel. Heck, even the demo let me use the costumes I bought! The game alone makes up most of the cost of this set.Next is the plush Sackboy, which looked completely different on the product page when this set was up for pre-order. It had a closed mouth, big eyes, and it looked like it had a metal zipper too. Now, they've just went and bundled in the Sackboy you can get at any game or toy store. It's a poorly made one that I reviewed last year, and hasn't gotten any better. There's a problem with quality control on these, like one arm being longer than the other and even holes in the body. 'looks like the only really good stuffed Sackboy out there is the one that Media Molecule sent out as a promotional item for the first game years ago.As if that weren't insulting enough, those cool looking game/bookends that were pictured in the pre-order picture, that looked like they were entirely sculpted and plastic...are now cardboard. Granted, they're a fairly thick cardboard, but you've gotta be kidding me. These look like the kind of thing you'd see on display at a game store, promoting the game. They're used to hold games or books up, but chances are that you already have somewhere you keep those. I really like the design on these, but it's too bad they're at such a risk of being damaged easily.But here's where the collector's edition shines- the DLC codes. You have to enter them online, but you're getting 11 costumes and even 5 avatars for PSN! I can't say how much costumes typically cost for LBP thanks to restrictions here, but the cost of these alone could make up the rest of the money the collector's edition costs aside from the actual game portion. Most of these costumes are great, and you gotta love the Gonzo and mandril ones.Despite how much I hate the cheap plush and game ends, this is still a fairly good deal, but it just sucks as a collector's edition. You're pretty much paying for the game and a bunch of DLC with two free bonus goodies thrown in. If you're a -huge- Sackboy fan, then you'll probably like this, but you probably already have the stuffed Sackboy. But for the fans who want the most for their money, you're probably better off just buying the game and the costumes you want separately online.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2011"}

Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization.

Tilley Jr. \"goatman_1\"","summary":"A lot of fun.","reviewText":"I'm surprised how many official and individual reviews are luke-warm to this game. I've had a blast playing it and I still am. I agree that it is a little too short, but it's not nearly as bad as most of the adventure console games I've played. The Green Goblin missions give the game a depth of replayability that most games never do. If you grow bored with the game, you should try finding some of the cheats that are out there.  SOme of them really add extra depth.I'll agree that the camera mode can be a little frustrating sometimes. I think they've done the best they can considering the complicated movements that Spidey performs, but some of the indoor levels can be whacky with the action gets tense. Some reviewers and even the offical Xbox magazine accused some of the levels of being boring. It's true that some of the later &quot;creeping around&quot; levels are a little tedious, but I thought they were all interesting enough to keep me going. A little difficult maybe, but not boring.Although they're a little grainy, a side effect of being a cross platform game I'm sure, the graphics are still excellent. The attention to detail, lighting and city scapes are absolutely incredible. The sound is good, but nothing to write home about. I will say that the Dolby Digital sound really helped create a sense of paranoia when creeping around, especially when the alarms go off. I also liked the the fact that Tobey McGuire did the voice work instead of a stand in.What I think makes the game most succesful and satisfying for me as a player is how the developers managed to fuse all the better aspects of the movie with the comics. Since this game is based on the movie, they had to make the add-on villains a little more photo-realistic so they didn't seem out of place or goofy. The story and cinematics are top-notch and balance between interactive movie and interactive comic. The makers got it all right in this category. The web-slinging, the mid air acrobatics, the high speed action is exactly what I'd come to expect. Unlike Batman: Vengence, the Xbox's other recent multi-platform superhero game, the novelty of being Spiderman doesn't quite wear off.I've seen the PS2 and Gamecube versions in action and they're vastly inferior. The Xbox version even has a bonus level featuring Kraven the Hunter. Even if you decide not to buy this game, it's definitely worth a rent. I can't remember the last time I played an old fashioned adventure game and enjoyed it, but I definitely enjoyed this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00005AV86","description":".","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Great Game For It's Time","reviewText":"With the release of Super Smash Brothers Brawl, I was curious as to where exactly Pit came from.  With how many games I've played, I was amazed that I'd never actually even heard of Kid Icarus.  Especially because it was a very successful and popular video game in the NES days, where I began my gaming.  It may be late, but I'm glad I went back and played the original Kid Icarus.  Also, if anyone is interested, it has been released on the Wii's virtual console and it should only cost you 500 Wii Points to download.Kid Icarus is about Pit.  He's on a quest to save the world from the evil demon Medusa who is plotting to kill all the mortals.  Just like every NES game, the story is simple and straight forward.  Kid Icarus has a lot of great gameplay elements to it as well.  Imagine if Mario and Zelda were combined to make the perfect game and that's pretty much what Kid Icarus is.  The levels are side scrolling levels very much like Mario, but you can also go into doors and purchase items like in Zelda.There are four worlds in Kid Icarus.  You'll go through the basic levels in Mario fashion.  Starting with level 1-1.  You'll then have to explore a labyrinth to get to the world's final boss.  Each labyrinth is a maze of sorts and at the end you'll fight a boss.The levels themselves are fairly well designed, most of them looking as though they should've been in Metroid to begin with.  You'll have enemies coming at you left and right ready to take you on and all you'll be able to do is blast them with arrows.  There are shops scattered throughout the levels as well where you'll be able to purchase upgrades and other items for Pit.Kid Icarus may be short but it is most certainly not easy.  Games on the original Nintendo, particularly in the 80's had a reputation for being incredibly hard.  Games like Contra, Metroid and the original Mega Man were games you used to test just how good you were.  Kid Icarus is much like those games.  It's an incredibly hard game for a number of reasons.  The first being that the levels are very long.  Especially for an NES game.  It's to no consolation that there aren't really any checkpoints either.  Another aspect that makes the game very difficult is that you can't go back, and in the first three levels especially, all you're doing is going up.  If the screen scrolls too far up, you can't fall and hope to land on a platform you already passed.  You'll have to accept your fate and die.  This isn't all.  While there are shops, most of them have items that in the beginning you can't afford, and you'll also only be able to visit a room once.  These areas, however, are few and far between.The biggest challenge with Kid Icarus, however, is actually that the levels are populated with a ton of enemies.  You'll be able to deal with not being able to backtrack, but many of the enemies themselves appear in droves and are often hard to get by.  Just the same, however, you're encouraged to kill them to make Pit stronger.There's no save system present either.  However, there is a password system, and Nintendo obviously knew they made a pretty hard game, as you can also access numerous cheats through the password system.  But you'll have to keep a pen and paper handy, you'll fall prey to your enemies several times.It's a rewarding game to be sure, it's just another classic game on the NES that's unforgiving in its challenge.  Those who began playing video games after the NES era will be in for a rude awakening.In terms of graphics, Kid Icarus looks marvelous for the time it was released.  There are a few graphics that come from Metroid and you'll even spot a few familiar monsters.  On the whole, though, it's very colorful.  The game also has some catchy tunes.  Many of which will probably get stuck in your head.  They're simple melodies.Kid Icarus is a great game, but also a very difficult one.  If you're not frustrated with games too easily, then Kid Icarus is great.  It'll take a long time to get through some of the games levels, but at least it's a very enjoyable game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2008"}

So if you spend 15 minutes selling a worthless item, and buying it back, you'll imp up the necessary mercantile skills. Same for communication, just spend 30 minutes admiring someone. Such systems are easily exploitable. Search the web for a 14-minute TES:Morrowind solution.NPC intereaction is distance-triggered. If within a few feet of almost any NPC, you'll trigger their dialogue and they'll start talking to you. It can get annoying.Quest management is non-existant. To review your quests, open or closed, you need to open a journal which stores events in chronological order, and page back and forth between entries. A lot of gamers often receive quests which are too high for them at the moment, move on to gain levels, and return later on. By this time, you've got several journal entries cluttering things up, so you need to thumb around the journal to find them.There is no way to keep in-game notes, so if I get a quest which involves 5 NPC's, I need to physically write down their on a notepad.They (BethSoft) also have some strange engine which gives me motionsickness after a few minutes. I don't have this problem with any other 1st person perspective game. Something odd about this particular engine. For instance, I can play UT2004 with no problem, and that game moves a lot faster than this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2005"}

McBeth \"PSN/XLive/Steam: DirkPittSpawn\"","summary":"A little of the old...","reviewText":"Basic: Take the previous X-Men Legends game and add some good/new features, and the ability to play both Brotherhood and X-Men. Unfortunately they took away some good characters to do so.Review: In my opinion, the game is good for playing with friends, online, or if you get hooked on trying to unlock or improve your characters. The Normal setting is fairly easy so far and even so, I enjoy seeing what I can unlock for each character.The cinematics are pretty good, but when it displays cut-scenes, the characters are just like they were in the previous game, very cartoon-ish.I'd recommend renting the first if you have not yet already, and then getting this game. You can play previous missions, online, etc., so it is very versatile. In the first if you want to backtrack at all, you better have a save game to go to. And if you fail a mission, you better hope that save game isn't that far back in your travels.It is a RPG due to the fact that you're controlling your characters and their progress/development. And the game is centered around the Team-based combat and combos.Overall: A good game, this 2nd one will have replay-value, on top of the new features....but only if you have the patience to develop your characters into a good team. And if you dont want to control their development, you can put it on \"Auto\" and the game will distribute their stats accordingly.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0007TS24U","description":"Take2 Games Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories 23696 PC Games","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"best portable gta yet","reviewText":"GTA: Liberty City Stories is the first game in the series to hit the PSP, and you can bet it won't be the last. Given the dismal crop of PSP titles currently available, an original PSP-only GTA game couldn't have arrived at a better time. And the good news is, Liberty City Stories is a real Grand Theft Auto game, through and through. Whether you love the GTA series or despite it, the fact is that Liberty City Stories is on the same quality level as its bigger brothers on the PS2, Xbox, and PC. You'll be surprised by how few compromises Rockstar made in order to bring the world of Grand Theft Auto to the PSP. On a visual level, the game looks simply awesome. It's not quite as detailed as Vice City or San Andreas, but it absolutely destroys the original GTA 3. The graphics look so clear that you can read the type on fliers and billboards posted around town, even on the small-ish PSP screen. As series fans well know, the game is set in the New York-inspired Liberty City. Liberty City itself is ripped straight from GTA3, and it's never looked better. From the huge crowds of pedestrians to the cars, you'd be hard-pressed to tell Liberty City Stories from GTA3. Toni himself looks fine, if a tad blocky. But in a welcome piece of news, many of the legacy character animations have finally been replaced, so longtime GTA fans won't have to keep looking at the same stupid jump animation that plagued that last three games. Liberty City Stories comes up a tad short when it comes to special effects; you'll notice that effects like explosions won't draw unless they're fairly close to you. But the weather effects are spot-on (and now include snow!), so it's a worthy trade-off. We could do without the infamous blur effect, though. And, there is a noticeable bit of ghosting on the PSP screen--especially when Toni runs; not the game's fault, but it should definitely be noted. Perhaps most important of all is the fact that, despite its visual beauty, Liberty City Stories runs butter-smooth. Even during heated action or driving scenes, you'll be hard-pressed to spot any framerate stuttering. The core gameplay is ripped straight from earlier entries in the series, so you'll find that Toni can't pull himself onto walls or boost his stats like C.J. could in San Andreas. But aside from a few tiny compromises--you can no longer crouch, for instance--this is the exact same GTA you know and love. We think that's damn impressive. The single-player mode pits you against a succession of missions and side missions, just like the console versions, and this approach holds up very well for brief snatches of gameplay on the bus or the train. When it comes to handheld gameplay, Liberty City Stories is just a natural. We especially love the new PSP-only multiplayer mode, which stands as perhaps the biggest single reason to pick up the game. Up to six players can compete in a local (or \"ad-hoc\") wi-fi match. There are seven modes in all, and they range from standard deathmatch (Liberty City Survivor) and races (Street Rage) to more sophisticated team-based games where you sabotage enemy cars (Protection Racket) or steal tanks (Tanks for the Memories). Our favorite?:Hit List, an addictive little game for larger groups. In that mode, one player becomes the target while the other players relentlessly stalk him through the city. Fun! Now for the nerdy stuff. The UMD loading speed is surprisingly fast, but load scenes still popped up little too frequently for our tastes. We also appreciate the fact that Rockstar supports custom soundtracks, but we detest the highly limited system that they're using to implement them--you're essentially forced to rip a CD straight to your PSP's memory card. Not an ideal solution at all. But those are quibbling details. Liberty City Stories is a truly worthy entry in the Grand Theft Auto series. In fact, if you hated the crudely-implemented RPG elements of San Andreas, you might actually prefer this game's simpler approach. Regardless, this is the game that will finally make the PSP a must-own handheld device. You should buy it immediately.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2005"}

My impression of the first game was quite positive overall. It was a very engaging game with a solid story, stunning (especially for the time) visuals, intuitive gameplay, and interesting (but not overly difficult) puzzles. I thought the gunplay was pretty easy to grasp, and the enemy A.I. was pretty decent. The game took me around 15 hours to finish (although part of that time was spent familiarizing myself with the gameplay mechanics...my play time for parts 2 and 3 dropped significantly). Overall, I would easily have given this game 5 stars except for the following issues which force me to drop a star off (SPOILERS):The jet skiing upriver sequence. That was just tedious at best in my opinionCollectibles. Some seemed pretty impossible to find, much less actually get to. Although shooting them off of inaccesible branches and such was sometimes an option, overall, they were a little too difficult to access, andThe 28 Days Later-ish twist towards the end. People turned into hairless, cannibalistic mutants by some odd powder coming off of the remains of a body sealed in a golden tomb. Presumably, these raging mutants had children (or were immortal) since they had been around the area they were in for many hundreds of years. I felt this was interesting, but particularly unnecessary since they did nothing to explain how that virus(?) even came into existence, much less how they were able to seal it away in the first place. This ambiguous mysticism is present in all three games, but in this one, the writers dont even hint at why it might e. It simply is, and that was a big hole in the plot in my opinion.SPOILERS OVERStill, this was an excellent game which clearly showcased the PS3's power when it was released. The cutscenes are seamlessly integrated with the gameplay, and you really feel like you are participating in the develpment of a cool adventure ala Indiana Jones.Well worth the price of admission.Enjoy!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWBAE","description":"","reviewerName":"hwrose379","summary":"Pikmin 3 is a fantastic real-time strategy game; a must-have Wii U game","reviewText":"In the past, I've never really been that interested in the Pikmin series. Gameplay footage from the first two games never managed to hold my interest. However, something about Pikmin 3 intrigued me. I couldn't tell what, but after watching many gameplay trailers, I decided to take the plunge and buy Pikmin 3. And it was worth it. I discovered that I had been missing out on a series full of charm and top-notch gameplay, and Pikmin 3 is well-worth your time and money.*STORY*Pikmin 3 revolves around the adventures of three space explorers: Alph, Brittany, and Captain Charlie of the S.S. Drake. Their home planet, Koppai, is in the middle of a food crisis. They send the three to a remote planet named PNF-404 to gather fruit for their starving home planet. However, the S.S. Drake crash lands on the surface of PNF-404, and the three crew members are separated. The story then begins to revolve around three major plot points: 1) The crew must reunite, 2) The crew must find fruit to bring back to Koppai and to keep themselves fed, and 3) The crew must find the cosmic drive key, a crucial part of the ship that they need in order to return to Koppai. The story is quite gripping and there is a major plot twist later on in the game. This is honestly one of the few times where the story kept me fully interested and gripped until the end, and I commend Nintendo for doing that.*GAMEPLAY*The core gameplay of Pikmin 3 revolves around the player throwing their Pikmin to achieve various tasks. The Pikmin are the key to everything, as you must perform every task using the Pikmin, whether it be fighting enemies or collecting a piece of fruit. The game uses a \"Day\" system, and each day lasts about 15 minutes. At the end of each day, you must have all of your Pikmin gathered up or else you risk losing them. As such, Pikmin 3 really stresses time management and multitasking as key gameplay elements. You can control each of the three characters separately, allowing you to split up the work amongst them. However, I found it to be easier to simply keep the three characters together at all times and to only multitask when it is absolutely necessary. Nonetheless, time management will always be a crucial part of the experience, and you must decide whether you have enough time to complete a certain task before the day is up or if it would be more worthwhile to complete the task the next day.Pikmin 3 makes use of five different Pikmin types. The Red, Blue, and Yellow Pikmin return from the previous two installments, whereas the Rock and Winged Pikmin are new additions. The Red Pikmin are resistant to fire, the Blue Pikmin can survive in water (keep in mind that water is fatal to all other Pikmin types), the Yellow Pikmin are able to conduct electricity, the Rock Pikmin can smash through crystals, and the Winged Pikmin can traverse all different types of landscapes. There isn't one Pikmin type that feels underused, and the balance between them is perfect. While each Pikmin type has their advantages, you will need to use all five types in order to fully explore the game world and collect everything there is to collect.On the surface, Pikmin 3 isn't overly challenging. The real difficulty comes from your ability to assess a situation and determine the best way to complete a task without costing too many of your Pikmin. This is the true challenge that Pikmin 3 presents, as you want to end the game with as few Pikmin deaths as possible.Finally, Pikmin 3 presents several different control schemes, however, the Wii Remote and Nunchuck combination stands out as the definitive way to experience the game. The Wii Remote and Nunchuck combination allows for more precise aiming and it allows you to run away and aim behind you at the same time. This may not sound like an important feature, but it is very crucial to the gameplay.*LEVEL DESIGN*Pikmin 3 contains five different areas for the player to explore. While this may not seem like much, each area is vast and contains a large variety of different environments, including caves, underwater caverns, and more.  The main goal for each area is to find and defeat the boss battle, which will allow you to move on to the next area. In order to reach the boss battle, you must perform several tasks, such as building bridges and pushing ramps into place. In addition, the fruit contained in each area is meticulously placed, and in many cases will require you to think and determine the best way to recover it without costing too many of your Pikmin.Speaking of the boss battles, they are appropriately huge and challenging to defeat. Each boss is unique and each has their own weakness. Exploiting that weakness often involves using a specific Pikmin type. The boss battles really do a great job in providing a sense of fear and stress, as you don't want to lose any of your Pikmin. As such, finally defeating the boss provides such an overwhelming feeling of accomplishment that you can't wait to find the next one and give it justice.*SINGLE PLAYER*Pikmin 3 provides a very solid single player experience. This is primarily because there really is no rush to finish the main adventure, and you can take however long you want, so long as you have enough food in your food supply. This really caters to all gamers, including the speed gamer and the gamer that likes to take their time and fully uncover everything Pikmin 3 has to offer. In addition, you do not have to collect every piece of fruit in order to finish the game. This really makes Pikmin 3 accessible to everyone, and I'm really glad Nintendo took that extra step to make this game available to all gamers.*MULTIPLAYER*Pikmin 3 also provides two multiplayer modes: the cooperative Mission Mode and the competitive Bingo Battle. In Mission Mode, you and your friend must collect as much treasure as possible within a certain timeframe, usually ranging between five to eight minutes. Mission Mode is a fantastic addition and the co-op is fantastic and it works perfectly. In fact, the splitscreen co-op works so well that it makes me wonder why Nintendo didn't include co-op in the main adventure. It would be a lot of fun to play through the main adventure with a friend, and it is a missed opportunity.Bingo Battle, on the other hand, is pure insanity, chaos, and fun. In a nutshell, Bingo Battle dumps the two players in a small arena filled to the brim with enemies, fruits, and collectables. Using a small squad of Pikmin, you must collect the items you need in order to complete your Bingo card. In addition, you can sabotage the other player by taking the item they may need to complete their card.Overall, the multiplayer modes offered here are a lot of fun, but it leaves me wishing that Nintendo had incorporated some type of online play. Even if it was limited to online play with your registered Wii U friends, any form of online play is better than none.*GAMEPAD INTEGRATION*Even though the Wii Remote and Nunchuck combination is the ideal way to play Pikmin 3, the GamePad is still absolutely necessary to experience the game to its fullest. The GamePad constantly displays a map of the area. The map shows you the location of every piece of fruit in the area, the location of the other characters, and the location of all of your Pikmin. This is extremely essential, especially when the day is drawing to a close and you must gather all of your Pikmin. The \"Go Here\" feature built into the GamePad is perhaps the most important tool in the whole game. You can use your finger to drag to any location on the map and click the \"Go Here\" button. Your squad will automatically head to that location. This is extremely important, especially while you are multitasking. Off-TV Play is also available, but keep in mind that you must control the game using the GamePad while in Off-TV Play. Overall, the GamePad is put to good use in Pikmin 3, and it shows how the GamePad can be essential to the gaming experience.*GRAPHICS & SOUND*Pikmin 3 is a simply beautiful looking game. The environments are so lush and realistic looking that you would almost believe the developers simply filmed the environment outside and added the characters, Pikmin, and enemies in later. Every now and then, there will be a day where it rains in the game, and this also exemplifies how realistic the game looks. The environment looks appropriately wet and you can even see raindrops falling from the various plants. That being said, not everything is perfect. The ground textures look dated and out of place when compared to the rest of the environment, and there have been several rare and minor instances where the game lagged. These small complaints aside, Pikmin 3 is one of the best looking games on Wii U.In addition, the music for Pikmin 3 is wonderful. For the most part, it is very calm and relaxing, but it slowly becomes more upbeat and rambunctious as you start to battle an enemy. There are also moments where the music slowly fades out, indicating that something big and bad is about to appear. Essentially, the soundtrack is very atmospheric and it works hand-in-hand with the graphics to provide that sense of realism that the game is trying to achieve, and honestly, it succeeds.*VERDICT*In the end, Pikmin 3 is a fantastic game. The gameplay is top-notch and it plays marvelously, and the atmospheric graphics and soundtrack are just the icing on the cake. Despite a few minor nitpickings with the multiplayer modes, I can safely say that Pikmin 3 is a must-have for any Wii U owner that may be looking for a great strategy game.STORY: 10/10GAMEPLAY: 10/10LEVEL DESIGN: 10/10SINGLE PLAYER: 10/10MULTIPLAYER: 8/10GAMEPAD INTEGRATION: 10/10GRAPHICS & SOUND: 9/10FINAL SCORE (not an average): 9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00149ILDO","reviewerName":"Death is real \"GAMING ON A BUDGET!!!\"","summary":"Wait for the price to drop before buying.","reviewText":"Ok when I saw this title a while ago I thought another WWII game. I'm pretty much done with this era of gaming when it comes to WWII games. But this one I'm glad that I did get it. Not really worth the $60 but will hold you until others come out soon. On to the review:First of all the pros of this game:Being able to blow CRAP UP! And I do mean anything that belongs to the Nazi's that is.Jacking any ride and being able to have it later without having to search for another is good a touch.Weapons are the same as you see in any WWII game but you can feel the impact more and its just more enjoyable to hit a sniper without using a sniper rifle.Plus being able to have weapons dropped off to you is great and you don't have to go searching for anything that you need to complete a mission or a fight.Being able to start a fight with the Nazi's and then getaway with some needed cash and perks that are in the game.The race cars are a nice touch to the game have not seen this done before in a WWII game.Graphics and sound are excellent.The black and white touch is different and nicely done and then watching the color come back looks even better.Now the cons:The load time will have you ready not to play as much but that may have something to do with the graphics of the game and it does slow down gameplay at times and cutscenes seem to long because of them.Die anytime before a savepoint and you lose money and some explosives.Driving controls are lacking and at times get you stuck in places that you can't get out of.The map and mini map is horrid you can't place markers or get a clear path to your next mission and at times I was lost more then anything.And to actively call for help or ammo refill you have to hold down the select button and move the Right stick. (Once again toggle option not there and no feature to help it either.)The climbing could be better not all structures can be climbed and no \"safety\" feature that keeps the player from just falling off the the screen or bulding.And pressing X to keep climbing can get tiring at times and just keeps you from really exploring the game more.HAS A RED FACTION FEEL TO IT. (if you played that game you know what I'm talking about)Hope this is not to long but I really have to say that i enjoyed this game but there is more I need to say and that is this game is good but the story/plot as far as the WWII theme is concerned has and is overdone. The game is worth playing but not at the price they are asking for and the hang ups are not enough to really make it not enjoyable but they do take away from the game at times. Rent if you don't have the money and if you do I would wait for a price drop before buying. To many new games coming in 2010 so save your money for those that are coming and rent this first and see if you like it. And if you do buy after a price drop but not at full price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2009"}

Here's my review....","reviewText":"Okay here we go... GT5, def mine and many others out there most wanted game... Was it worth it?? from early reaction its mixed... I coulda put my review up in the first day which woulda been a 3 or 4 but like most games i decided to play through the game before giving my final review...**CARS**: they werent kidding when they said over a thousand cars... there is one problem you run into and thats the custom cars... they arent the best of graphics... But they are def outpowered by the premium cars, the premium cars look stunning.... Def some of the best cars ive seen in racing games. Cockpit view? the premium cars do have cockpit views that look stunning, like your actually sitting in the driver seat. Custom cars do not have cockpit views... This part didnt bother me to much cause i dont use cockpit view when playing racing games.OVERALL: 4/5**TRACKS** ASlot of tracks in this game... Many people i believe played arcade mode and immediately condemned this game. Yes the graphics arent perfect in Arcade mode, some tracks even dip to mediocre level... But if you play gt mode and unlock tracks most of them are incredible looking... Even can say a few are jaw dropping. Another addition to this game is create your own track which is alot of fun..OVERALL: 4.5/5** CONTROLS** The controls in GT5 are simple... Its not hard to figure out and get very good at this game in a matter of minutes... Having a steering wheel makes it all the more fun too... If you have a steering wheel i would use that to get you licensing (a spec and b spec and up). menu controls arent hard to figure out after a few times on the screen... I really like the screen layout...OVERALL: 5/5**SOUNTRACK** The soundtrack in this game is the worst one of all the gts in my opinion, but heres an advantage and what i did.. Create a custom playlist on your xmb and use it in the game... thats what i did, so for that i love the soundtrackOVERALL: 5/5**ARCADE MODE** arcade mode is the simple mode to use to pollish skills or just do time trials and 2 player battle... The 2 player battle is alot of fun... but like i mentioned earlier there are a few tracks that look gloomy graphics wise..OVERALL: 4/5**GT MODE** Gt mode or career mode is amazing... I can def. see where 6 years of development went... theres sooooo much to do with this... I mean ive put in almost 3 days of playing and im only 30% done with it, I own 32 cars right now... I mean GT mode IS the reason why this is getting 5 star review..OVERALL: 5/5**GRAPHICS** the graphics on this are amazing at times and other times (def arcade mode) are mediocre... like i said earlier the premium cars are amazing... And the tracks on gt mode are amazing... In arcade mode i did notics alittle tearing... But that im sure will be fixed in the upcoming download...OVERALL: 4/5**PLAYABIITY** The career mode is soooo long it will take forever to get through it.OVERALL: 5/5**ONLINE** I didnt have the problem people the first day were having when they said they couldnt get online, cause i didnt get online til today... And it was alot of fun, there are sore losers online... like if you pass someone there ram you in the corner... But no glitching for me at all, And if you are one or know someone who had problems day one getting online, dont worry Saturday November 26th, there coming out with a new update to fix that problem... They said the proble was that they had a open 500,000 connection for america, and over 500,000 americans bout the game which kept people from getting on...OVERALL: 4.5/5FINAL NOTES: If you had this game and were upset at the start dont give up on this game yet, Sony announced that OCTOBER 26th there an upgrade for online and on DECEMBER 1st theres an upgrade to help screen tear and graphics, and they said they will be coming out with new updates every week or tooSO OVERALL FOR THIS GAME I WOULD GIVE IT A  4.5/5  IT ISNT PERFECT YET BUT ITS DEF ONE OF MY FAVORITE GT GAMES.... Its def one of my favorite racing games this generation... Theres not many racing games ive enjoyed this generation... Other than GT5, Burnout Paradise, FORZA 3, and motorstorm... If your a FORZA fan take a stab at gt5, same goes for GT5 fans, take a stab at forza, because they are the best Simulation games this generation...Any questions about the game, comments just let me know.

I must have played racing the VW bus in a figure 8 for at least an hour because I found that to be interesting. The problem was every time I hit a marker or another VW bus I was disqualified. Then I really got into the go-karts for a while. I must admit the go karts are fun, but at the higher levels it's so easy to spin out on the grass. When I spun out, I couldn't recover and I pretty much automatically lost (because the go kart is always facing the wrong way). Both of those games kept me entertained for a while, but the nuisance of being disqualified or spinning out at the intermediate levels and above, I became frustrated.The most fun I had was using the Benz Stealth car,(pre-order through Amazon) because even if I messed up I was racing a Toyota Corolla, and I could afford to mess up. This game is a driving simulator, so I guess that means no fun. When going into a sharp 105 degree (slightly obtuse angle) curve at 55 mph, and the car doesn't react and crashes STRAIGHT into the wall, that isn't what a great simulator should represent. I had 3 people verify this. NO burning rubber, no skidding, just crashing straight into the wall. I'm not speaking about a hairpin curve. I drive 20 mph for those. On top of that, what kind of simulator has cars crashing into you when you're ahead of them? Aren't they supposed to overtake you by going around?Simulator does not equal not fun. Maybe it's different with the wheel. I just don't see what everybody else is seeing. Sorry.Overall, great cars, great variation, great scenery, graphics, relaxing music, but driving unmodified standard cars and a flawed AI directly hinders the game play and users initial reactions. As one of my PSN buddies said, the game gets better, but getting to the point where you can afford a premium car and modifying it can be a frustrating experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2010"}

They did change nearly everything the fans asked for from Asylum for the better.1) What more free roam, you can move across Arkham City from the very beginning of the game.2) Less gadget dependent - you start with a lot more of the crucial gadgets and end up with a few more from story and optional missions.3) Fighting remains great, but now with even more enemies and combinations.  Also Batman starts with a much greater arsenal as opposed to unlocking nearly all of it in the game.4) The game is huge. To finish all the riddles, challenges, story, and all will sure take a much longer time than Asylum and keep you busy.And much, much more.The Catwoman gameplay is sufficiently different that it is not Batman with a different shape, she plays more like I remember Spiderman playing than Batman.  I haven't tried the downloadable characters, so no opinion on them.I did feel the story was less realistic than the one from Asylum, it felt more cartoony and convoluted, but the ending while a bit detached from the story was absolutely great.  So in a way they make up for a weak story with a fantastic ending.  I can't avoid saying that I liked the villains from Asylum more than the ones from City, but not enough to take a star away from the game rating.Great game, worth the money.

This game could and should win game of the year. The voice acting is superb, especially Joker. Put down the first person shooters and buy this game! Oh, if you have difficulties using your brain, stick with the FPS! This game will make you think. Most games are not worth $60, but this is definitely worth it. If at all possible, please do not buy used copies of this game. Buy it new. The developers put a lot into this game and did a great job on the game and they deserve to be rewarded for their efforts. The only problem that I have with this game (which doesn't affect my score) is that the gliding (AR missions) missions were frustrating because the controls are sooo loose that it almost feels like you have no control over the gliding.

{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Excellent Game","reviewText":"This is an amazing game that any action or RPG fan should play. The story is very good, and the gameplay is excellent. My only problem with it is that the difficulty isn't consistent, with the bosses at times being incredibly hard, and the other enemies not being too difficult if you strategise effectively. It was a little shocking though, when I was killed in one of my first battles. I think that I went into a cave that I wasn't supposed to be in yet, and it was swarming with dozens of goblin-like creatures. Thankfully, after reloading I was able to run around and use traps and all of my bombs, to take them all out. After that, while there were difficult battles, other than the boss fights, they all seemed fair.This game is huge, as the whole second act is completely different depending on your choice of who to side with, and the third act is probably different for everyone depending on other choices you make. I really wish that there was some kind of new game+ or you were able to go back to the second act and immediately play out the other side. I would have started the game over immediately, but I really hated going back to being the weak character I was at the beginning. Also, it's going to be great to eventually play through the game all over again in a year or so.This game definitely has adult features, but it's nothing too crazy, and the graphics aren't great enough to be fascinated by the pixelated breasts. Still, the adult features of the story were very enjoyable, it didn't have to pull punches like a lot of video games. The only thing here, is that I saved Triss, and in the end my Witcher barely got a hug from her. This is part of the problem, while it was really cool where you could end the game with no final boss fight, or you could initiate the toughest fight of the game to get your revenge on the other Witcher that framed you for the death of the King. I didn't like how the ending really just turns into a cliffhanger. I'd love to know how everything turned out, but I'm probably going to have to wait a couple years before I find out. It'll also be very interesting to see how the next game takes your choices into consideration. I would guess that the third Witcher will take place after the war is over, and they can make everything you did before unimportant for the most part, except for a few moments they could craft for each player's different play-through.So overall, I really loved this game and would recommend it to any adult RPG fan, and any action fan as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2012"}

I beat if a few weeks ago and I was totally blown away.  I didn't play 1 or 2 and didn't even know much about God of War, but it's now one of my favorite games of all time.  I can't really say anything that hasn't been said before in other reviews.  The graphics look spectacular, and I the environments and artwork are just great.  You will spend a lot of time admiring the scenery.  It really does have a very epic feel to it.  The controls are top notch.  The number one thing is that it is just so much FUN!!  The Story didn't make much sense to me, but I played it pretty spread out over a few months, so I could never remember what had already happened in the story.  If you had played the first two games then it probably would also make more sense.  However, I can't say that this really took away from the game at all.I highly recommend playing on Titan (Hard) for your first play through, particularly if you play video games a lot.  I started out in Normal, but then started over in Titan because Normal felt like too much of a button masher.  I was glad I did because it made that first play through much more rewarding.  Titan is quite challenging but without being overly frustrating; it strikes just the right balance.  It makes it so the game is not just a button masher and forces you to focus on what you are doing and learn the controls.  You really feel like you are accomplishing something as you progress through the game.  Another thing I liked about Titan is that it makes it so that when some huge monster jumps out you really fear for your life and get ready for a challenge, which in a game like this is a good thing--that's how you SHOULD feel when a huge monster is trying to kill you.  However, be warned that the very first boss in the game (like 30 seconds in) is pretty dang tough in Titan, so you have to hang tight through that.  After that things smooth out a bit and the difficulty ratchets up at just the right pace.Another thing I want to mention that I really liked about this game is that you can get through it using different fighting styles and weapons.  There is rarely one best strategy for beating something.  You could beat the game using different weapons and combos then I used for most of the fights.  I know this is true because on one or two occasions I got weak and looked up tips to get through a certain part of the game (I wish I hadn't).  When I did, I found that there were usually countless potential strategies and no one right way to do it.  If you can't get through something, experiment with different strategies and weapons, and you'll find your own way to beat it.Just a couple general tips before I go-Don't forget your bow and arrow, especially early on.  I often did.-The parry ability is your friend.-Don't forget about all the different combos and moves you have.  If you can't get through something, check out the combo list and try some of the combos you don't normally use.  It might be that you can find something that fits the situation you are in very well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001CRQYBO","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A worthy update to a classic","reviewText":"The Good: Looks great, decent story, not so linear, upgrades are great, powers are usefulThe Bad: Little enemy variety, graphics are a bit bland, can be pretty hard at times, pretty much the same throughoutid software is famous for creating the FPS genre with Doom, Duke Nukem, and Wolfenstein. Wolfenstein is a little different from your typical WWII game. The game is wrapped around the paranormal, so you're not going to get another Call of Duty or Medal of Honor. The game is entirely fictional, so it lets the Raven use fact and fiction and kind of mix them. You play as BJ Blazkowicz who is an American secret agent trying to stop the Third Reich from using the Black Sun as a weapon to rule the world. Sounds cliche? Well it kind of is, but it's interesting enough and has a very small plot twist at the end that makes the whole story worthwhile. You are working for to resistance factions known as the Kraisau Circle and the Golden Dawn.Wolfenstein isn't just a linear run and gun shooter. In fact the game is a bit sand boxy in the sense that you can choose your missions and getting to them requires running around the city, fighting your way through Nazis, and getting the right sections. While I found this kind of pointless since there are only half a dozen side missions, but it makes it different from most shooters. The game has four different powers you can use as well as a whole new weapon upgrade system.The four powers consist of slowing down time, shield, Empower, and your basic passive power that can let you go through certain marked walls, climb hidden ladders and see energy pools, as well as highlight enemies in the dark and reveal bigger enemy's weak points. You will use all these weapons, but not as often as you'd like. You can upgrade your powers at the Black Market buildings, but finding gold is a pain since it's all hidden and the only way t upgrade everything 100% is to find every sack of gold in the game and there are over 200. The same goes for intelligence files and Tomes that let you unlock more power upgrades. I just find hidden items in shooters pointless since you're concentrating on not dying yet you're also supposed to hunt for crap? I don't like it. The powers must be used during boss fights and to get through some enemies.Upgrading your weapons are real fun since we have never had a WWII game that uses real WWII weapons that can have silencers attached to them and scopes. Of course there are fictional weapons such as particle cannons, tesla guns, and a flak cannon. All these are slowly acquired as you play the game and each weapon is fun to use and the way the weapon's efficiency is solely up to how you upgrade.The levels are pretty varied, but they all look the same. The graphics are very nice, but there's not really an art style here. All the levels are pretty much laid out the same: Kill these nazis, figure out how to get past this obstacle, kill more nazis, blow this up, kill boss. Rinse and repeat for about 8-10 hours. This doesn't mean the game gets boring since all the is scrambled up quite often so you get the illusion that its not the same thing over and over again.There is some enemy variety in the human form. Each are the same except some are wearing different uniforms, but its the super natural enemies that you should worry about. There are assassins that will sneak up on you and slash you to death if you don't use your powers to spot them quickly. There are powerful generals that shoot fireballs and pound the ground and they will kill you fast. You have sexy Nazi chicks that do extreme melee on you unless you're fast. There are guys with flamethrowers and particle cannons that use must find the weak spots on to defeat. That's about it though and you can throw creepy monkey dogs in there too. The enemy variety is a bit thin, but these guys work.The boss fights are pretty amusing and some are just down right hard. You just figure out there weak spot and what weapon works best then it's easy from there. So overall the structure of the game is sound with your main missions branching off the city of Isenstadt where you go get your missions from the two resistance factions. The game is well worth the purchase, but you won't really come back to this and not even for multiplayer since no one's even playing, and even if there were it's pretty generic.Wolfestein offers great game play, a decent story, and just a good solid 8-10 hours, but you won't be coming back to this one unless you really want to find all the hidden items.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B006W41W4Q","description":"","reviewerName":"R. McAdams","summary":"Turtle Beach Ear Force XP400 Dolby Surround Sound Gaming Headset","reviewText":"UPDATED: 2012-03-21: to include more details about the sound quality, and clarify the wireless device interference trouble:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have been testing theTurtle Beach Ear Force XP400 Dolby Surround Sound Gaming Headsetfor several weeks now mostly with my XBOX 360, and to watch TV with, and I am ready to write a review based on my experience.On the whole, I found the headset to work fairly well.  The sound is good, the base is good, the directional sound levels are very good.  When the headset wasn't sputtering, popping, or cutting out, the sound was rich, and warm, and certainly sounded like \"true\" surround sound. If the sound was supposed to be behind me, if I turned away from it while playing the game, it became quiet, if I faced it, it got louder, and as I turned, it moved from ear to ear. I am not a sound expert, but the headset seemed, to me, to provide rich, full quality surround sound, when it was working properly in my setup at home.Setup was a breeze, you just plug in the base-unit to a USB power source (our TV has several), and plug in the supplied optical digital cable to the TV-out, and the base-unit IN ports, and you are all setup!  To connect the headset, simply hold down the power button until it beeps and starts flashing green, and you are good to go.  Volume is controlled with a simple roller wheel, and sound equalizer settings are controlled by a button which cycles through the various presets -- which tell you what setting you are on by the number of beeps (not the best design, but it works).I setup the system to work with my XBOX 360, and have done several Halo multiplayer sessions using the built-in microphone, and communication worked fine. I didn't test it with the PS3, but there are instructions for doing so -- I just don't have any PS3 games to play multiplayer with =)  The microphone can be unplugged and put out of the way, if you aren't using it.I setup the Bluetooth link to my Android (Galaxy Indulge) phone, and tested taking a call while using the headset.  It works fine, but I didn't like the Bluetooth connection draining both my phone and the headset's batteries, so I turned it off.The headset unit itself is sturdy, solid construction, and the padding is a nice slick mesh.  The whole unit just FEELS expensive and luxurious, if that makes any sense. I did feel warmer wherever the headset touched my head, after wearing the unit for more than 15 minutes, but not uncomfortably so. The unit charges with an included USB-mini(B) cable (a LONG cable (about 3 meters/15 feet), so you can charge and play at the same time).So, with all of those positives, why the 3 stars?  Quite simply, the sound keeps cutting out for me -- a lot.  Now, your mileage may vary, but in my household, we have a lot of wireless devices (here is a short list for you to match your own devices up with, to decide how closely your setup is to mine, and thus may provide the same problems mine did: internet router, wireless landline phone, wireless home security system, microwave, wireless laptops, our cellphones (which aren't on the same frequency, but contribute to the \"noise\" in the air), wireless blu-ray player hooked up to Amazon Instant Video, and the wireless video game consoles)  At any given time, at least 80% of those devices are broadcasting or listening over the air on their various communication protocols.  What that translated to, for me, was a lot of stops, stutters, pops, and occasionally outright cut-outs in the sound coming from the headset. I am willing to forgive the occasional stutters and pops, but when I actually miss dialog in a game (or when watching a movie, or TV), then I have to dock the product points.  I *DID* find out that the more devices I turned off that used wireless communication, the better the sound I got from the headset.  But, it is kind of a major bummer for me to have to turn off a bunch of stuff, in order to use a headset.Like I said earlier, my household has a LOT of wireless signals crowding the air, so much so that the dual channel nature of the headset was still being interrupted.  Your household may be setup entirely differently, and thus not suffer from the audio connection problems I had. In that case, add a star to the review for yourself.But, overall, for me, it was a 3 star experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0001NJHH8","description":"Combining the best parts of role playing games and first-person action games, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines plunges players into the dark and gritty vampire underworld of modern day L.A. as a recently embraced fledgling vampire in the service of the city's dark Prince.","reviewerName":"bayou_hannibal \"bayou_hannibal\"","summary":"Great RPG, not an FPS","reviewText":"WARNING!  \"Vampire: The Masqerade - Bloodlines\" is not a first person shooter.  It is, however, a great RPG, filled with terrific script, intriguing story, a sense of mystery, unprecedented character interactions, dazzling style, lots of colorful personalities, and a cool role-playing system.  It doesn't live up to being the spiritual successor to Deus Ex, but it is still better than any other PC RPG so far this year.To start with, this game is beautiful to look at.  Is it as astounding as Half-Life 2?  No, but that's not exactly saying anything.  A regular Corvette isn't as great as a Calloway Corvette, but that doesn't mean that the regular 'Vette isn't great.  The game features a huge variety of highly detailed and beautiful environments that show the glamour and sleaze of LA.  Goth night clubs line the streets next to convenience stores and porn shops.  The streets are lit up with neon while the bums and prostitutes stand around flaming barrels.The best part about the look of the game is the NPC's.  Characters show realistic facial expressions that change based upon what dialog options you select.  Dialog in this game becomes the best part, largely because of the realism that these characters show.  The games numerous NPC's don't suffer from the \"attack of the clones\" problem, except for the bums and prostitutes.  This is a highly underappreciated quality for this game.  Some graphical weaknesses are the walking, running, and fighting animations for the game's various characters.  Some animations are done poorly.  Some of the NPC's in combat seem like they only have a few frames of animation.  This game could have really used some motion capturing.The voice-acting for the game's huge script is excellent.  The writing, itself, is excellent, and hearing it delivered by the game's interesting characters is a real treat.  The firearms also sound great.  The licensed music is very good too, and so is the moody ambient music that plays in the game's various areas.  Unfortunately, the audio does have some problems.  One of them is the low variety of ambient and licensed music, which ends up looping quite a bit.  The audio also has some hiccup glitches from time to time, and enemies in combat only have one or two barks, which aren't very convincing.  Every set of enemies uses the same sound bites - this sticks out like a sore thumb as a cheap shortcut.  There is also a nagging glitch in the audio that causes your footsteps to be heard a full second after you stop walking.\"Vampires\" has a somewhat simple but very unique and flexible role-playing system.  There are seven clans to choose from, each of which has their own unique traits.  You start off working for the LA Prince of the Camarilla, a strict society whose rules revolve around preserving The Masquerade -- the process by which Vampires keep themselves a secret from humanity.  Your character has a bunch of attributes for fighting, infiltration, stealth, and persuasion or seduction.  He/she also has three disciplines, which are supernatural powers that can be used for a short period of time.  There are no levels in the game.  You receive points to assign each time that you complete a quest.The true highlight of the game is solving the game's various quests while exploring all of the environments and interacting with all of the characters.  \"Vampire\" has a cast of colorful characters that easily rivals any RPG ever made.  Or any game, for that matter.  Dialog is even better than \"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\", and that's saying a lot.  The dialog is often influenced by your conversation skills.  Special lines of dialog only show up if your skills in intimidation, persuasion, or seduction are high enough.  The game forces you to make some pretty tough choices and live with their consequences, so you had better watch what you say and do.  The quests have you doing some pretty interesting stuff, like shutting up a blabbermouth who is breaking the Masquerade, infiltrating a museum, and investigating the origin of a bizarre snuff film.  This game earns its \"M\" rating, and is not for the faint of heart.Combat is clunky and not very deep, but it's still fun.  The game does a good job of mixing your role-playing stats with your twitch gamer abilities.  Combat generally involves using one or more special abilities while furiously clicking the mouse during melee, or doing your best to move and shoot your guns.  You also can feed on enemies during combat, which you will often need to restore your health and blood level.  Firearms are somewhat underpowered damage-wise, but using them keeps you safe if you're not very tough.  This imbalance isn't as bad as you find in lots of 3D RPG's, which always seem to favor melee combat.  Combat usually isn't the strength of these types of games, and \"Vampires\" is no exception.The worst part about this game though, is the tiny areas and annoying amount of loading screens.  \"Bloodlines\" has literally dozens of tiny maps.  Some maps are only one room.  Yes, one room.  This means that you are constantly looking at loading screens throughout the game.  This game would have benefited from a better layout of the maps.  The video also seems under optimized, as there are occasional frame rate slowdowns in the streets and during combat.  Thankfully, I did not encounter any of the famous big bugs that have hit other people playing this game.The game lasts about 30-50 hours, and after you are done playing, you can choose a different clan and get an entirely different experience.  This is especially true if you are a Malkavian, since this clan gets an entirely unique set of dialog.  Any game that gives you this much content in the box deserves praise.Despite its many rough edges, \"Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines\" is a resounding success as an RPG, and it is Troika's best game to date.  If you are looking for another first person shooter, then you'll be disappointed.  If you are looking for a role-playing game with great dialog and tons of colorful characters, then you need look no further than here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2004"}

I do not remember seeing that feature or mode when I purchased then installed it.Starting out I was a class that was into combat. Okay, typical hack n slash FPS RPG. Then my friend suggested that I should try out a character that was not heavily into combat, but communication. So I created a male Toreador and had an absolute blast seducing people. The voice acting and dialogue is great! SO much can happen depending what you choose to say or do. The music was another plus. IT fit the setting of White Wolf's LA ruled by Vampires. The story is really interesting as well. You'll be wanting to continue the story rather than dance at the clubs. Like Knights of the Old Republic, this made me be careful with my choices. I would save the game in several spots to see what the different conclusion would be.However, the biggest issue was the gameplay itself, and that usualy hinders away from enjoyable. Getting frustrated at certain graphical issues kept me from thinking this was a great game... even though I really enjoyed playing this!Annoying load timesbland character movementsrandom glitchesAlso not having a character creation mode was another downer.RPG lovers should check out this title.

Because of Crysis 2's superior campaign mode (11 hours compared to Killzone 3's anemic 5 hour or so campaign) and its wider color pallete compared to the gritty Killzone 3. 2 to 3 weeks later I'm still playing the campaign because it's so darned fun and beautiful. Crysis 2 brings a degree of choice in playstyle that makes playing even on the highest difficulty setting fun and engaging rather than a chore for achievement hounds and I, personally, have not experienced a single frame rate hiccup on even the PS3. So, to summarize:Pros:Presentation is great and the story is more than adequate. Crysis 2 is inarguably the best looking game on the 360 and debatably the best looking game on the PS3 which is a staggering accomplishment for a multiplatform game.Gameplay: The nanosuit really allows for a great deal of variety when playing and the controls are great. The campaign will keep you more occupied than most first person shooters of this generation.Cons: None so far...well, any Crysis 1 fans will be displeased by the drop in graphic quality.So what are you waiting for?

{"product_name":"B0002CHJAA","reviewerName":"Ryan H.","summary":"Whoa, what happened?","reviewText":"Xenosaga 2 looked like it would be a great game, I mean updated graphics, continuation of a good storyline, and probably one of the most noticable changes, Shion's makeover.  Unfortunately, this game falls a long way below the expectation I had.Where to begin, the first noticable change is the graphics system, which is a good thing.  It's easy to tell how the character is reacting or feeling.  Also, the more realistic environments add to the seriousness this game has.Anothing new change are the costumes, which work but are, in some cases, kind of creepy.  Shion now sports an outfit that shows a little more skin (it's not that I don't like scamply clad women, I do, it's just not the Shion I know), Momo gets a navy-like costume, Jr. gets something similar to the past game, and so on and so forth.The biggest change you notice though is the voice actors.  Shion, KOS-MOS, MOMO, and chaos each have different people doing the voices.  Shion, MOMO, and chaos don't bother me as much as KOS-MOS' because now she sounds almost human as opposed to the cybernetic voice in Episode 1.I figured that wouldn't bother me for long, but then I get into the game and find out that they messed up the battle system.  No longer do each character have their unique moves, but instead each character can learn the same moves depending on what they spend their points on.  The only good change to this is the Dual Techs which allows two characters to do a move on an enemy.  Physical attacks also suck in this game because you have no control as opposed to the ability to change them in Episode 1.So, we start off with new voice actors, an even worse battle system, and some really confusing battles.  The battles get confusing because now you have to Break the character to weaken it by using the right combinations of buttons, which is really annoying to do.So what are the redeeming factors you ask?  Well, we've got the storyline, the graphics, and the new costumes.  If that's all that you want, then great, pick it up, otherwise stay far, far away from this game.Pros:- Continuation of the epic saga- New costumes for the characters- More mature look- Dual TechsCons:- The change in voice actors- The battle system- The long loading times to get into battle- Taking away the unique abilities that each character could learn.- The side quests are more annoying this time around and more bountiful, but if you want more dual techs, you have to do them.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2005"}
{"product_name":"B002I096AA","description":"","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"Phenomenal","reviewText":"Like the Nintendo DS before it, the Nintendo 3DS has signaled the start of the next generation of video game consoles.  Nintendo has created a little machine here that far surpassed my expectations.  The 3DS is simply magnificent, and if it's this impressive now I can't wait to see what the future has in store for it!First up, the 3D effect.  The skeptic in me wasn't prepared for just how functional the glasses-less 3D display was.  The image is shockingly great.  This thing works, and it works well.  Given the proper viewing angle, which is surprisingly easy to find and maintain, you get true 3D just like you would in a movie theater.  It's got depth, and depending on the game, you'll even get graphics poking out of the screen.  The depth slider on the right of the 3D screen easily adjusts how strong the 3D effect is, so if you experience dizziness or eye strain, simply lower or turn off the 3D effect.  Personally, I have not had any ill effects whatsoever while playing in full 3D, but I realize that people are different.  The 3D screen is also in a standard 16:9 aspect ratio, which makes the 3D more immersive.  Also, they will be releasing 3D movies which take advantage of the widescreen format.  The lower touch-sensitive screen is pretty much the same as the original DS, though it is a tad-bit smaller.Right out of the box, the 3DS is preloaded with a few goodies that will have you enjoying your new system even before inserting a game in it.  Making use of the two 3D cameras on the outer shell, you have a selection of AR games (augmented reality).  The system comes bundled with some AR cards that you place on a table, and the 3DS will recognize the cards and superimpose games right in your environment.  Most of them are simple little shooting games, but the effect is extraordinary.  You can even take in-game pictures and store them on the included SD card.  There's also a game called Face Raiders.  In this game you can either take a picture of someone else or take your own using the inside camera that faces you.  The game takes your face and animates it wonderfully (seriously, it'll make your face show different emotions, etc with just one still picture), then makes you shoot it.  It also uses augmented reality (without the card) and it uses the 3DS' accelerometer so you need to move your entire body around the room to play!  It's really impressive!  The 3DS also uses Miis, just like the Wii, only this time you can take a picture of yourself and the 3DS will construct the Mii for you.It includes a feature called StreetPass, which works while your system is in standby mode.  You can take it with you wherever you go, and if you walk by someone else with a 3DS in sleep mode, you will collect their Mii.  Some games, such as Super Street Fighter IV 3D or Nintendogs + Cats, do game-specific bonuses with StreetPass.  The system has a built-in pedometer too, so every 100 steps you take will earn you a coin.  Coins can be used to purchase little extras.  The Mii Plaza is a gathering place for all the Miis you've picked up in StreetPass, but it also includes some minigames such as a RPG where you use StreetPass-collected Miis to rescue your own Mii (or you can purchase heroes using coins).New for the 3DS is an analog control called the Circle Pad.  For the games that use it (such as the must-have Pilotwings Resort), it works beautifully.  It's also very well-built and doesn't feel flimsy or weak.  The directional pad is fairly standard, but feels more robust as well.  The typical face buttons are nothing new, and it also includes some sturdier shoulder buttons.  The only disappointment in the button aspect are the start, select and home buttons, which are somewhat awkward.The system features a home menu just like the DSi and other consoles of today.  You have spots for cartridge-based games and all the preloaded software as well a settings, etc.  While playing a game, hitting the home button will suspend the game and allow you access to the home menu.  You can then resume your game whenever you want.  While a game is suspended, you can access anything, be it your friends list or the upcoming web browser, etc.  It's a very nice feature.  The friends list requires friend codes, but at least there's only one this time.  Once you input a buddy's friend code (and they input yours in return), you will see their Mii as well as the game they're playing.  The system uses WiFi to maintain a constant internet connection.Of course, as is typical these days, the 3DS is somewhat incomplete.  You will see icons to access a web browser and a data management tool, but clicking on this gives you a message that says the feature will be implemented with a future software update.  There will also be an eShop where you will be able to purchase downloadable games and older Game Boy, Game Gear and Game Boy Color titles.  This supposedly happens sometime in May.  While it's a shame that these features are absent for now, I'm not docking points from this review because I know it's coming, and that it'll make the 3DS even better.  The games that are currently available at the time of this review are fairly decent, but the killer apps won't be available until May or June.  Still, I highly recommend Pilotwings Resort as it is probably the best showcase for the system at the moment.  Also, Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars will provide hours of tactical shooter/RPG fun, while Super Street Fighter IV 3D will impress with just how incredibly closely this resembles the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 version (only with 3D)!  In a very welcome move, Nintendo made the 3DS fully backwards compatible with Nintendo DS games, making the transition from one to the other much more smooth.The one drawback of this system is the battery life.  Sadly, you will get between two and five hours on a single charge depending on how bright your screen is set and how strongly you've set the 3D.  However, a docking station is included which makes charging it a breeze.  I didn't think it would be that big a difference between plugging the 3DS into the charger and simply setting down on the dock, but there really is.  Docking the system between play will keep your system nice and charged, and there will also be some third party accessories that can extend battery life.  As it stands though, just keep an eye on it and keep your charger handy.The Nintendo 3DS is a fantastic system that will only get better as time goes on.  Upcoming titles such as Kid Icarus: Uprising, Resident Evil: Mercenaries and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D only provide more of a reason to buy this system.  Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2011"}

First of all, the system is supposed to be backwards compatible, but will not play half of my original ds games. Second, The launch games are nothing short of terrible as well as very expensive. My final complaint is that nintendo launched a handheld system before there were proper games for it and charged people $250.00. Also, they don't have an online store for it yet and from what i've seen the games coming for it are aweful. I mean seriously, they're really putting gameboy advance games and the old black and white gameboy games on there. Psp had downloadable psp games and ps1 classics last generation of handhelds, so why can't nintendo do the same thing. Bottom line is that I'm really considering selling this and getting a NGP when it comes out. I love nintendo, but I think I'm just sick of the rehashed games every generation and their lack of focus on what their fans want.

The game also has a superb multiplayer mode that will keep users coming back. The user interface is improved over the previous installment, and the game still continues to have a roster of cars that is second to none. The interior of the cars (for most cars, that is) are fantastic, mimicking the real world versions of the car. In particular, the Viper looked exactly as it would in a dealership. Offering many different types of racing types, this is a one stop shop for most racing enthusiasts.This game, however, is not a must-have installment for the franchise. The graphics are not improved over Gran Turismo 5, if they have I did not notice. The frame rate drops from 60 fps. The load times are initially long but appear to decrease as data installs from disc onto the drive (it installs the game in pieces as opposed to one large install, just as it did in GT5). The music is good, but rather odd - if feels as if I am more at a rave or dance club rather than playing a racing game.The biggest problem lies in the single player campaign's lack of intelligent AI. The artificial intelligence is pathetic. The game also has no balance: you can upgrade your car to beat the competition with little to no skill required. Drive off the track, its okay. Collide full speed with the car, that's fine - you'll get cosmetic damage and both of you or however many cars that were involved in the pile up will be on their way. No qualification either. That is the problem: real-time changing weather and time is fine and great, amazing, but what is a race without consequence for poor performance? Where is that sense of accomplishment when talent gets you to win the race, not a car that outpaces the competition (not even performance limitations, which I am glad they introduced from GT4, make races feel competitive). There are modes, such as Rally, Kart Racing, and a few others where the cars are close enough together in performance to create competition, but they are exceptions. Online multiplayer remedies these problems by making these actual options, but unfortunately the single player has no such options. Maybe cutting that 1,000 plus library of vehicles in half would allow for developers to focus on re-tooling the AI that feels no different than Gran Turismo on the PlayStation (yes, I am referring to the first installment).This is a good, solid game but the game still has problems with damage and AI in single player.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2014"}

I knew about the terrible reviews and tried to wait for a cheaper price but couldnt resist at just under $40.The graphics aren't as bad as some people and pro reviews led me to believe. They def arent good but better than a game like Left 4 Dead. The lighting is good and unless you are inspecting the walls and looking for bad graphics they wont jump out at you most of the time.The Alien AI also isnt as bad as the pro reviews led me to believe. Basically at range the Aliens jumped around moved from wall to wall and were generally tough to hit up close though is when they basically walk towards you. There were plenty of times though when I would be battling Aliens and one or two would pop up out of the floor behind me or out of the ceiling. Of course there were times when they would crawl by you or get stuck in a wall something like that.The pulse rifle sound is good and there is decent customization.My issues with the game are there are long sections when you fight people. This was prob the most annoying part of the gameplay as early as I think Chap 2 you are fighting people. This is an Aliens game and i'd say its 50/50 the levels and battles against people and Aliens and that is a major mistake by the developers.Ok now to the story which before release was touted as cannon in the Aliens series. My god I hope it isnt cause the story for this game is horrible, and makes the AVP movies in terms of story look like the Godfather. There is a ton of stuff at the end that makes no sense and isnt explained at all and while the cut scene graphics are OK most of the time in the game there is a cameo at the end that has one of the worst character renders and laughable graphics I have ever seen. I am not kidding as a fan of the films the story was insulting that they would try and pass it off on me.Multiplayer is OK nothing special, everything works matchmaking and all that its just not very fun.This game was a major let down the graphics are OK and really the least of this games probs the story is really terrible and if this is really cannon in the Alien series I guess the franchise is dead.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2013"}

This \"simple game\" is already a classic -- and yes, all the loose ends are tied up, even the hay angels, even as the credits roll.My only caveat would be that, like last year's Curious Village, even the \"easy\" puzzles may too hard for young children (or adults with a beer commercial attention span).  This year's batch seems to have a few more Sudoku type puzzles and a few less of my personal favorites, the notoriously difficult Hakoiri Musume (\"daughter in a box\") style sliding block puzzles.  Maybe that's just how it seemed to me ;-)  Still, there are about 150 puzzles all told, and ways to find more, and all of them are serious brain teasers for the time it takes to solve them.

It intrigued me, the fact being that all the characters were flat, but the environments were three-dimensional.  A truly unique game.Then Paper Mario for the gamecube came out.  The first installment gave me such good fun that I decided to get this one.  And boy, was I glad.Paper Mario 2 shares the graphics that the first one had, so I can't say much about the graphics except that they are more solid and less blurry than the sprites were in the first game.  Also, some of the characters are 2D and 3D in one; for example, Hooktail the dragon has flat polygons as surfaces, but all those surfaces combine to make a 3D dragon character, much like origami.  This looked awesome.There's something I'd like to say about this game's challenge.  It is much more difficult than the first game ever was.  Every boss delivers a sense of  \"Oh man, I don't think I'll ever win...\"  Whereas the bosses in the original Paper Mario were easily defeated; Bowser, the final boss, was killed on my first try.  The boss that came before him was more difficult.  It seems that Nintendo made the decision of upping the challenge in the next game to appeal to more gamers.  I felt that this was an excellent decision.  The final boss in paper Mario 2 was extremely hard and it took luck and skill to win.  There is even an optional boss that is more difficult than the final one.That covers challenge.  I'll only say a little bit about the story itself: Peach has delivered Mario a map that may lead to some treasure, from a town called Rogueport, but when Mario arrives Peach is gone.The game's theme is a unique one: you're in a storybook-like world, and everyone is, well...paper.  The background is sort of like cardboard, and some strange cutscenes display this very well.  The battle system is also unique: it is based on a theater stage.  There is an audience, stage props can damage you or the enemy, and you can appeal to the crowd for more bonuses.  I will not go too in-depth with this, seeing as how a character explains everything to you early on in the game.  So basically, Paper Mario 2 is like a storybook-theater-type videogame.As far as gameplay itself goes...the game flows pretty smoothly.  But what I'm about to go in-depth with here is probably the greatest aspect of this game in my opinion, and is done better in this game than in any other videogame.Throughout the Mario series, there are many \"species\" of creatures, baddies, and inhabitants of the Mario universe.  It starts with simple turtles, then we have goombas and King Bowser, then there are chain chomps, etc.  Hundreds of creatures litter Mario's world.  The majority of these creatures are recreated in Paper Mario 2, and this recreation is done extremely well and really brings back the nostalgia of the older Mario games.  Throughout the game, you will encounter different species of Mario creatures not only in battle, but in towns and such as well.  Toads, penguins, different-colored friendly bob-ombs, koopas, etc.  Every sprite in the game is different from the others, they each have personalities, and it makes the game's style spring out from the paper and cardboard foundation it was originally built upon.  This game combines all other characters and their races and weaves it all together in one region and one adventure.  Playing this game gives you a taste of what the Marioverse is actually like.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2006"}

And that said I thoroughly enjoyed the Xbox version, much to my surprise, even without a mouse and keyboard to aim and shoot with.Orange Box includes the original Half Life 2, and it's subsequent followups Episodes 1 and 2. In addition it contains the quirky spatial-puzzle game Portal, and as icing on the cake Team Fortress 2. To get these separately (at least on PC) would run in the realm of $250, more or less, and to get all 5 games in one bundle for all of $60 is too good to be true. On to the actual reviews.Half Life 2 begins with MIT PhD Doctor Gordon Freeman, released some 20 years after the Black Mesa incident by the G-man and into a dystopic City 17. It appears that Earth has been conquered by a galactic conquering empire of sorts who used Freeman's previous handiwork at Black Mesa to burrow through the walls of time and space to invade Earth. The game follows his insertion into this volatile situation culminating in his leadership of Earth's rebellion against the Combine Overwatch. The game's \"silent protaginist\" approach, where the player's character never speaks, is played out perfectly and adds greatly to the storytelling angle. The game tells it's own story and you're basically along for the ride. The weapons selection is fairly standard fare for a shooter, with your usual selection of pistols, rifles, and the ubiquitous shotgun. The real nice touch is the Gravity Gun, which can pick up loose objects on the ground and can then be used to hurl said objects at your enemies. The sound, voice acting, and atmosphere of the game (of a familiar world turned into an Orwellian style police state) are all fantastic.Episodes One and Two both continue the story as Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance both try to escape City 17 in the former and deal with the remnants of the Combine in the latter. Each new episode showcases a new technology add to the engine (lighting effects for Episode One, motion blur for Episode Two) to increase gameplay.When I loaded up Portal I had only the vaguest idea of what to expect. The game is admittedly hard to grasp at first and requires you to think puzzles out using Euclidean geometry and Newtonian physics and a little bit of brain juice all mixed in. The game begins with the protaginist, a female in an orange jumpsuit, being forced to complete a number of puzzles for the test facility's computer using a hand-held portal generating device. One can cross chasms by blasting an entry hole in the wall next to you and an exit hole in the wall across the chasm and simply cross it by walking through the portal. Each test gets harder, and it becomes apparent as things move along that the computer running the tests (and you) is more than a little deranged. As this game is set in the Half-Life universe I look forward to seeing how the plot of this game fits in with that of the larger title.Lastly we come to Team Fortress 2. I must admit that I have loved Team Fortress since it's inception and have played it religiously since 1998 on the PC. This game spent the better part of 7 years in development limbo and those of us among the originals fans were pretty skeptical that the game would ever be released at all, but the finished product is here and is an absolute blast. Players can pick one of among nine classes to play, from the lightly armed but fast moving Scout, to the lumbering two-legged tank Heavy. There are only 6 maps included in the game, which is a downside, but the maps themselves are quite solid and the game dynamic is unique. The game itself is done in a style reminiscent of \"The Incredibles\" and this lends some rather comedic elements to the overall experience. The game is entirely Capture the Flag (CTF) so don't expect to go into Deathmatch as it was never designed to do this.There are some minor points I must mention about Orange Box though. For starters the Half-Life games are really dark. I've had the benefit of having played this on the PC and the lighting is pretty ho-hum on the Xbox version. Case in point, even with the brightness on the game turned up you can still barely see in even dusk conditions, let alone the details on your weapons. The caveat here is that if you turn the brightness up *too* much then you end up getting flooded with bright light when you enter better lit areas, resulting in a weird glaucoma-style whiteout. Expect to have your HEV suit light on *a lot*. In addition the surface textures aren't quite as crisp as I what I was accustomed to with my previous experiences on the PC, although this didn't detract from the game that much.I also felt it something of a disservice to 360 owners that as big as the game release was Valve kind of dropped you into the *middle* of the story, without the courtesy of even giving the new HL player an overview of what's happened thus far. The events of Half Life, HL: Opposing Force, and HL: Blue Shift are all integral to the storyline, and taking someone completely new to the story and simply dropping them off halfway through it seemed a puzzling choice. As they'd gone as far as making a game release this big how difficult would it have been to at least add HL 1:Source into the mix? Granted, it's an eyesore by today's standards, but still.With TFC2 I don't have complaints, more like concerns. In the PC world you have literally thousands of custom player-made maps, as well as numerous Valve releases, and I'm wondering if players will be able to play classic Valve TFC maps like \"Rock\" and \"Hunted\". I suppose it wouldn't be too difficult to accomplish, but all in all it was a befuddling thing to place such a great, solid game into the mix with only 6 maps. And I'm wondering if they plan to eventually add class-specific grenades as those would most certainly enhance the gameplay.Still the game package itself is fantastic and it's clear that a lot of love was poured into their production and subsequent carryover to the 360. I'm impressed enough with the 360's performance with these games that even an old, grizzled PC gamer like myself is giving it a serious second look. Cannot recommend Orange Box enough! Now if only they had a mouse/keyboard setup for old PC diehards like me to play with. :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2007"}

Once you've been through it, the replay value goes down even with a different character, but that is the nature of the beast.  Once you've finished it you can still keep playing the same character from the beginning and increase levels, spells, etc.  It is fun to do some butt kicking to those so and so's that gave you such a rough time when you were just learning the game.

Whether they're frustrating and cumbersome or it's repetitive or it's just simply not a worthwhile thing in the first place. In a way, I call it the \"good idea/bad idea\" syndrome where developers believe that if something sounds fun for the player, than obviously it will be fun for them regardless of how well it's executed. Heavenly Sword became one of the Playstation 3's big launch titles and one of the first to show off the power of the machine. On that note, everything as far as the look of the game is spot-on; it's everything else that's the problem.Story: You play as Nariko, a young female warrior who wields the titular and powerful Heavenly Sword which corrupts men's minds who want to possess it yet claims the life of whoever wields it. King Bohan, an evil ruler wants the sword to himself and with huge armies at his disposal, it's up to Nariko and her friend Kai to try to bring down Bohan and his warriors.Naturally, the story is the big highlight of the game and while it's rather simple and not exactly the most complex or even original, the presentation and just the general feel of the game helps the story move along when it would've been slightly generic in other hands. So while indeed it's a short game, it's a good story anyway.Graphics: Thanks to being picky and having specific choices about what games I try out, I find graphically they've been pretty stellar. Heavenly Sword is one of them as this is one beautiful game from the art design and the environments to the fast, flowing character animation and the motion capture, this is definately a game that an HDTV-owner will love. Sure there's minor things like really brief pauses or slight framerate parts but again, super minor.Sound/Music: The music is naturally that big, orchestral sweeping score that these games tend to have, like God of War. It's a pleasant soundtrack when it's on though I find myself forgetting the music later than admiring it again when I play the game. The voice acting though is absolutely great and with some great performances including Anna Torv (from TV's \"Fringe\") and Andy Serkis (Gollum, King Kong), this is definately voice acting done well...except for this one guy named Flying Fox; one of the most annoying voices I've ever heard in a videogame and I'm well aware of Farleen from Star Ocean: Till the End of Time by the way.Gameplay: Basically one way to describe this game is God of War with a girl. It sounds simplistic and there's enough differences but fundamentally anyone who's ever lopped heads off with Kratos will find much familiarity here. Nariko has 3 stances: Speed (normal, sword attacks), Ranged (holding L1, long chain attacks) and Power (R1, slow powerful attacks) and it's fun to switch back and forth depending on the enemy and seeing Nariko flying all over the screen doing the combos is quite something. However you start the actual fighting and you find the enemies also use the stances too and they glow a color according to the stance they're using and if you're in the right stance and don't press anything, Nariko will block and a successful one and a push of the Triangle button will be a Counter Attack or even an Instant Kill. The problem is when you're surrounded by literally 10 or more enemies and you're building up your combo, it's hard to figure out what stance will be needed and they'll always be that one jerk that resets your combo meter because you just couldn't press it fast enough or he somehow dodged/phased through your attacks.Remember that good idea syndrome I talked about where developers believe a good idea will be awesome even though it might not work? This game has the Aftertouch system and it's annoying as hell. Basically, if Nariko throws something or if you're on a Kai mission with her bow, holding down the firing button brings up a travelling camera similar to firing the guided missiles from Metal Gear Solid and by tilting the controller, you can control the direction of the arrow. The problem is that the game requires such sensitivity that even with careful precision and slow movements, you still miss your target anyway. I found it was better to just turn it off and use the analog stick and the whole thing becomes similar to the Sixaxis use in Ratchet and Clank: neat but entirely unnecessary since the analog stick does a better job.The other gripe is the oft-used and already overused system of Quicktime Events where you have to either repeatedly hit one button or just hit it once during interactive cutscenes. While at least in a game like Resident Evil 4, it always felt at least anticipatory with a decent enough time given to press the buttons, here it's rather quick and it becomes more about restarting and memorizing not only the button required (thank God they're not randomly generated) but also the place within the cutscene. This makes boss battles even more aggravating since I found failure of the cutscene actually replenished the boss's health; yes that right, fills it right back up. And with limited health pots in the fighting area, it's aggravating to have to widdle the boss down again simply because you missed one button.With some boss fights that seem more like cheap hits and near-unavoidable attacks and a rather repetitive battle system with nothing gained other than more glyphs which unlock artwork, videos etc, is this a game worth getting? Well unless you're a massive fan than no. Not only because of its short length and 60$ price tag but for the game itself. Yes it's a beautiful game and a great story but at times it felt more frustrating to play than fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2008"}

InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"M.

Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"A great port of SSFIV","reviewText":"There isn't a whole lot of must have 3DS games at the moment but the port of SSFIV is a great edition and stands out on its own. It takes advantage of many functions of the 3DS. To start that off, the 3D looks good in the game. It really gives a new visual impact. The backgrounds are not as rich as the console ports with more static characters but its nothing that can draw you away from how it looks. It looks good. Another unique thing is the ability to obtain coins by walking around. You will obtain coins that you can use to gather trophies that you can use to fight other people that you have the game and SSFIV. These trophies are characters that have their own stats. Its a pretty unique feature.Besides two of the new features they also have a over-the-shoulder mode, I don't think anyone should get too excited about it. Its nice to see a game take a new perspective in fighting games but this mode is pretty bad in judging distances. Now as like the console versions, the gameplay feel no different. I had no difficulties and to make things easier they added two special moves and the super and ultra on the bottom touch screen for fast access to pull off. Everything else is there from the cut-scenes, the bonus levels, and there is a online mode to go against others. Lag wasn't a major issue and finding people wasn't too difficult.If you want a portable version of Street Fighter, this is the way to go. If you want it for just more Street Fighter, there is DLC for Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition with 4 new characters, battle saves, and such. There will also be a standalone version. Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition plays like you would expect. Its just as fun and visually stimulating.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2011"}

Set 150 years from now, the world has been ruined by war and ecological disaster with only a handful of survivors remaining.End Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"A journey well worth taking...","reviewText":"Enslaved is roughly based on the original story, Journey to the West.  While the game doesn't copy the book it uses the overlying plot to drive the storyline.  A solid storyline, with simple...fun gameplay mechanics makes for a journey well worth taking...**Gameplay: Enslaved gameplay is like mixing Uncharted mechanics w/ a high quality storyline presentation like a Metal Gear game.  The difference is neither gameplay aspect is overly polished and can come across almost simplistic.  Jumping mechanics is simply handled by the jump button and a direction, with Monkey making insane leaps but this works well.  The response and handling of your acrobatics is fluid but requires very little more than pushing a button.  Your combat mechanics are basic at best which can be a good thing.  Instead of hitting you with 10,000 combos like Bayonetta / DMC ... or even say 20 like God of War; you are given basically \"two\"  light x2  then heavy  light x3 then heavy  that's about it.  Combat ends up being very simplistic and once you upgrade your staff you will pretty much just point and kill enemies before even fighting them hand to hand.  **This is a good thing however for the game.  It focuses less on combat mechanics and more about allowing you to just enjoy being 'monkey' and enjoy the storyline.  You don't need to rack up a 200 hit combo to take out an enemy.**Sound/Story:  Storyline is outstanding.  A very simple retelling of a great book (Journey to the West) with some noticeable changes.  The main plot is pretty much the same but a lot of the details were changed to give it more of a video game / modern day edge.  Your first time through this game will be a real adventure with every cutscene being well played out and acted.  This leads to the \"sound\" aspect.  Voice overs were very classy.  There were only 3 voice actors needed and all did their parts fantastic.  It was obvious they really did care about telling the story and acting their role.  The game sounds are pretty simple but crisp and clean.**Graphics/Presentation: This is a bit of a snag.. now while Enslaved doesn't have \"bad\" graphics - they aren't nearly mind blowing either.  In fact sometimes they looked down right low res PS2/Xbox like in some spots probably due to bad lighting.  Being I only own a PS3 I did have the opportunity to examine the game on the 360 and there is quite a noticeable difference in graphics.  Ninja Theory isn't that good of a dev for PS3 and Namco isn't known for making very good PS3 ports and it showed.  Many of the PS3 cutscenes had noticeable tearing and frame rates would constantly dip almost into the low 20's.  The final boss I swear must of been running at 15-17 fps for a short while when I was staring at the sun.  It isn't the PS3 hardware... it is the game-code itself(like bayonetta's bad port).  However, graphics aside when you are PLAYING the game - no lag, little to no tearing  etc. So you don't lose any enjoyment which means the overall *presentation* of the game is well handled even with a bad port.**Length/Replay: The overall game I'd say was about 10-12 hrs.  I played on normal + learning curve.  You can probably get a good 12-16 hrs on HARD  since you can't just go run in there all Rambo style w/ a stick and own some baddies.  Replay value is up to you.  If you enjoy a great storyline and are the kind of person who could play MGS4 per say, over and over and over just for the story... then replay is a def + .  If you are a completion-est well, you can replay chapters upon beating them at any difficulty to find hidden masks and tech orbs.(i got 87% orbs and 71% masks on my first playthrough) so replay is a + again.  If you are in it for the combat... well.... one time through is enough.~~Overall Score:  I'd give Enslaved a 83%(4 stars) on the PS3. Enslaved is a game with a great storyline that won't disappoint; Having a simple, enjoyable combat system to keep things moving without becoming to ridiculous.  However this hurts the game at the same time.  It sometimes seems to simple, and a little more variety to the combat and enemies would of been nice (and I mean ways to kill them... every enemy you defeat/fight the same way.. a dodge here or there at best).  The road traveled is long and fun...but with a little more it could of been a true adventure.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004FSE52C","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon P. \"Brandon\"","summary":"From Beginning to End","reviewText":"A incredible story of Lara Croft started with a bang and also end with a bang. Yes I know that the series was suppose to me about solving problems like puzzle and other stuff but I guess the developers wanted to show more action to the gamers. My opinion they did a great job of graphics, the environment, characters , and the story line. This game was all about suspenseful and adventure. Yea, there are side missions that you can complete some challenges or search for more clues or whatever. It is funny that almost every where I turn there is enough ammo laying around. I don't think a survivor should have bullets and arrows laying around like that I mean they should have made few ammo laying around. Of course after you kill the enemy, you loot the body or grab ammo or whatever from the dead body. Cool part of the is that you can upgrade your skills and your guns. You can more ammo, modify it, put a silencer on your pistol and such more. But really I think for me they are missing the point here. A survivor doesn't get that much stuff lol. but whatever it is just a game. The whole point is this. Lara Croft was there to find something or complete her task and there were enemies try to stop her and kidnapped her friends. She then save some of her friends and finished the job and left the island. That's all. Simple as that. That was just the game story but really love the details of it such as rock climbing, shooting arrows, hunting animals, upgrading your skills and guns, completing challenge which by the way, you get XP for finding journals, completing objectives, hunting, killing enemies and more. Graphics are not that bad. There were only several weapons that you can get. I can so much stuff about this game but just can't really explain it that well.

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Meg \"Livin la vida loca in Maine!\"","summary":"Super Mario Sunshine - Too Difficult, but..","reviewText":"Graphically, this game was a masterpiece. It feels like the continuation of Super Mario 64, but it's got an entirely different premise. I felt the controlling was not where it should have been. You're so busy trying to figure out what to press to get Mario to do different things, you don't see the enemy coming up on you.

{"product_name":"B00B59L9T6","description":"The fear that was originally brought to players in Resident Evil Revelations on the Nintendo 3DS system returns redefined for home consoles complete with high quality HD visuals, enhanced lighting effects and an immersive sound experience. Furthermore, the home console version will deliver additional content including a terrifying new enemy, extra difficulty mode and improvements to Raid Mode such as new weapons, skill sets and the opportunity to play as Hunk and other characters from the series. Raid Mode, which was first introduced to the series in the original version of Resident Evil Revelations, sees gamers play online in co-op mode or alone in single player taking on the hordes of enemies across a variety of missions whilst leveling up characters and earning weapon upgrades. The critically acclaimed survival horror title takes players back to the events that took place between Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, revealing the truth about the T-Abyss virus. Resident Evil Revelations features series favorites Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, plus their respective BSAA partners - Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat.  The action begins on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship, the 'Queen Zenobia', where horrors lurk around every corner before players head for the mainland and the devastated city of Terragrigia. With limited ammo and weapons available, the race is on to survive the horror of Resident Evil Revelations.","reviewerName":"Midway 47","summary":"Nice Addition but Not the Best RE","reviewText":"To put it simple, if you are a fan of the series you will like this game.  Resident Evil 4 is by far my favorite and 5 is next.  I understand why so many people disliked 6 but I still enjoyed it.  To me, Revelations falls in there somewhere between 5 and 6.  The graphics are crisp but a bit more 'cartoonish' than the others.  I'm sure that that's because of it originally being for the 3DS.  I didn't like having to switch between characters and storylines between episodes.  I even find it kind of funny that people have complained about the multiple characters/storylines in 6 but don't seem to mind when it comes to Revelations.  I think one reason this game has been loved so much is because of the hate that 6 got.  I guess there's some leniency with it since it wasn't originally meant for PS3 and XBOX 360 and it's not an official 'numbered' RE game.  I did like the New Game + mode but I felt the overall game length was a bit short and you couldn't really upgrade anymore in New Game+ mode, unless you found something that you missed the first time.  I think it would've felt longer if I didn't have to switch characters so often.  RE5 was short but felt allot longer to me.  The story was pretty decent and I liked the environments.  Being on the ships reminded me of Dead Space and gave it that calloustrophoic vibe.  The controls were easy enough to figure out and the few new additions, like a tool to search for items, gave it some originality and kept it interesting.  Overall, it's allot of fun and pretty easy.  I generally enjoy RE games, unless they are obviously weak links like Operation: Raccoon City.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Serfius","summary":"A Disney/Squaresoft Masterpiece","reviewText":"This game is truly one of the best games I have ever played.

Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A 10-megaton blast of nostalgia on a disc","reviewText":"Ah yes, the ol' Sega Genesis, beloved originator of \"blast processing\" that \"does what Nintendon't.\" You gotta love the great console wars of the early 1990's. They truly gave birth to some epic moments in gaming. For those out there like myself who grew up playing Sega Genesis games at home and have a weakspot for nostalgic blasts from the past, this collection is a Godsend. There isn't much to say about this collection that hasn't already been said in great detail, but I felt it to be a worthy endeavor to add my voice to the legion that is Sega fans.What you get when you pay for this collection is essentially 40 Sega Genesis classics, as well as 9 extra bonus games you can unlock, some of which are arcade titles and others of which are Sega Master System games. Most of these games really are timeless classics too: Sonic 1-Knuckles, Ristar, Shining Force 1 and 2, Phantasy Star 2-4 (and the Sega Master system version of 1), Vectorman, Ecco the Dolphin, Dynamite Heady, Comix Zone, Golden Axe 1-3, I mean the list goes on and on. The games here range from serious smash hit titles to very obscure, lesser known gems that should have been hits. It's a great collection that will offer hours and hours of nostalgic fun and truly memorable experiences. There's also a large variety of games here, taken from all sorts of genres that were prevalent at the time.The Genesis was a system with fantastically unique hardware. I mean, the music alone is magic in electronic form, truly. Obviously, the graphics have aged and some better than others, but like a fine wine, most have aged quite well and that adds to their charm. What's even more amazing is just how timeless the gameplay is in most of these gaming darlings. To be honest, I'm quite stunned at just how much most of these games have retained their \"freshness.\" Granted, most games are over two decades old, but still, these games play way better than I expected them to. That could be attributed to the stupendous work done to port these games onto the disc. The games have been worked on so that they output in HD. Now, the graphics aren't better, but the colors are definitely very vibrant and you don't have the infamous SD lines going across the screen. Beautiful, colorful games like Ristar never looked so good. The controls also work very well on the 360 controller too. Sega and Backbone Entertainment did a very good job making sure these games play and control exceptionally well. Bravo!Also worth mentioning is the fact that there are quite a few extras you can unlock. There are nine additional games that are quite easy to unlock. These range from arcade games that eventually became Genesis titles, such as Altered Beast, as well as some famous Sega series that started on the Sega Master System, such as the first Phantasy Star. That was really nice to see on here. There is also a gallery of sorts on the disc, where you can view nice little advertising/marketing pictures of each game, as well as neat, informative fun-facts about each game and its history. There are also bonus things such as interviews that give insight into that time period in Sega's history. All of these are really nice extras for Sega scholars out there. Overally, Sega really went all-out to give one of their shining achievements the treatment it deserves, and I really respect that.The very first video games I ever played as a child were on the Genesis my family had at home. I grew up with a healthy diet of awesome Sega treats. Now, all these years later I have my own home with my own family, and to play these titles on my 360 at home really packs a nostalgic punch in the heart. I have such a soft spot for those old classics. My wife, on the other hand, grew up with a SNES at home instead and was blessed with all of the truly magical titles that graced Nintendo's awesome 16-bit counterpart to the Genesis. Even she, who has never really known Sega's quality first-hand until now, has loved becoming acquainted with it with me from this collection. Two very different experiences, same great opinion of this collection. That's just awesome.This disc was truly a divine gift. To top it all off, this collection is a mere $20 these days, sometimes less. That's less than 50 cents a game! To contrast this, Phantasy Star IV was nearly $100 at launch, so this collection is seriously a fantastic value! I really can't recommend this collection enough, whether you're a gamer who was significantly impacted by this sweet system of blast processing, or you're a gamerly scholar who is interested in a genuinely thrilling and fascinating pocket of video gaming history, this is a great purchase. Buy it, crank up your speakers and put on your early 1990 goggles, and travel back to a truly wonderful, memorable era in gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001L8DKJ8","description":"InPrinny: Can I Really Be The Hero?players are treated to a single player spin-off from the popular role-playing (RPG) universe ofDisgaea. Here players step into the unlucky shoes of a penguin called a Prinny and 999 of his comrades as you slash your way through various Netherworld areas in side-scrolling service to the Demon Lord Etna. Although the mission that you are saddled with is ridiculously comic, the action you face is not, so you're given 1,000 lives to work with and you can use everything you find on the battlefield to help you survive and succeed.Caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Classic side-scrolling action.View larger.Challenging difficulty levels.View larger.Multiple vehicles &amp; aircraft.View larger.The StoryPrinnies are the reincarnated souls of evil humans trapped in purgatory. Summoned by urgent order, the player in the form of the lowly Prinny rushes to meet his boss, Demon Lord Etna in her chamber. You arrive just in time to see Etna beating your fellow prinnies to a pulp. She is definitely in a bad mood, being even more abusive and violent than usual. As it turns out, someone has snatched her favorite dessert from the fridge. Eager to vent her frustration, she orders you to hunt down the ingredients to create a new Ultra Dessert and promises that if you do not deliver the goods by the next morning that you will learn what eternal suffering really means. Since you are at the very bottom of the netherworld food chain, if not its gutter, you have no choice but to snap into action.GameplayPrinnyis a side-scrolling platformer filled with classic flavored gameplay that requires timing of jumps and memorization of the patterns of enemy movements. As non-threatening as dessert making might seem, nothing could be further from the truth. In the game players are given 10 hours and the use of 999 identical comrades from the Prinny Squad to defeat demon bosses spread throughout the game's levels who possess the necessary ingredients to create a new dessert for Etna. Although this may sound like way more than enough help, surprisingly challenging gameplay that consistently has players one blow from either victory or defeat and the nature of the prinnies themselves will quickly change player's perception on this.True to their origins in theDisgaeauniverse where their literal explosive nature makes them perfect cannon fodder to aim at enemies, prinnies are extremely volatile. Players can only only control one prinny at a time because you only possess one red scarf, which not only indicates your status as current game hero, but also keeps you from blowing up. Wave after wave of enemies within the game also conspire to exploit the prinnies' tendency towards combustion, and more often than not are successful, underlining the importance of your 999 friends. This means that players do not actually play as a single prinny. As one meets his end another takes his place and you are kept informed of how many prinnies you have left, as well as how many hours. Prinnies are not defenseless though. Players have use of a variety of attacks and moves like the 'Dual Sword Slash' to deal with enemies in front of you, the 'Hip Pound' which allows you to stun opponents with your bottom and standard platformer jump and sprint functionality for mobility. In addition, prinnies can lift and throw objects like bombs, stomp enemies and even pilot tanks and planes to bombard whatever gets in your way. The game comes with two modes: Standard Mode, which allows you to take damage up to 3 times before losing a life and Hell Mode where one blow means instant death. In this ridiculously comic adventure you will need every advantage if you hope to survive the cost of the ultimate sweet treat.Key Game Features:1,000 Units- Players will get 1000 lives to beat the toughest action of this platforming side-scroller.Lift &amp; Throw- Prinnies are able to lift and throw objects on the battlefield.Vehicles- Steal and control powerful vehicles, like tanks and UFOs.Hip Pound: Jump and pound enemies to stun them. Then you can inflict multiple combo attacks for extra damage.3D World with 2D Characters: InPrinny, character art is created using fluid 2D sprites, giving it a classic look with a comical tone. Battlefields and backgrounds, however, are created with 3D models. This allows for a smooth and unique combat action where certain attacks are rendered in a 3-dimensional view.Boss Battles Galore- 10 Major stages featuring many hidden characters and a boss waiting at the end of each.Music Collection Mode- Find music tracks during game and replay them as background music.Humor- Ridiculously comedic storyline and characters.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"For the Masochistic Gamer","reviewText":"Pros:+Cute adorable prinnies!+Good music+Beautiful game+Simple gameplay conceptsCons:-Unusually difficult game to the point of frustration.  The game's elements all come together and blend really well, but dying over and over again through what can mostly be considered trial and error makes what is a very fun game somewhat more frustratingPrinnies, if you don't know, come from a cult classic SRPG by Nippon Ichi called Disgaea. They've become quite iconic in the series for providing humor and their constant use of the word \"Dood\". What they're probably best known for, however, is being those little penguins that when tossed at the enemy... explode.Prinny: Can I Really Be a Hero? is not a Strategy RPG. It is a side scrolling platformer, in which you are on a quest to create the ultimate dessert. If the quest itself seems dumb... well, you haven't exactly played a Disgaea game, which is not known for having deep enriching stories. They're mostly known for having ridiculous premises and their humor. That is exactly what you get from Prinny.Let us talk about what Prinny does right. The first is simple, it's a beautiful looking game. There are vibrant, colorful environments and backgrounds throughout each level. You'll recognize a few Disgaea characters and enemies as well. It's quite nice to see this kind of detail in a 2D platformer. The game also sounds incredibly good. There are some surprisingly catchy tunes. The voice acting is not exactly strong, but it isn't like nails on a chalk board either. It just needs a bit more emotion than what it gives you from time to time.When it comes down to the gameplay Prinny has simple basic concepts.  Like any platformer you'll jump a lot.  But you've also got standard blade attacks as well as a ground stomp to take on your enemies with.  There's not much more to the gameplay than this, but there doesn't have to be.  It's simple to learn but difficult to master... really really difficult to master.As you begin your adventure you are given 1000 lives. This is not a joke: 1000 lives from the start. Surely a game must be crazy to give you 1000 lives, right?  Well, this is where Prinny's big problem comes in. The game is designed so that you'll die. A lot. Make no mistake, Prinny is an incredibly challenging (and frustrating) gaming experience. Most of it comes from level design and the jumping mechanic. If you remember what it was like to play Ghost n' Goblins or the old school Castlevania games, you have an idea of how jumping will feel in this game. The difference is that timing is much more important than in those games. In fact, aside from bosses, the majority of your deaths might come from jumping. The first time you might not think it's such a big deal. But after missing a jump more than 20 times (which can and probably will happen) it becomes quite frustrating. You can double jump, but the problem will still persist. You can't change direction once you begin jumping. It sounds like something that wouldn't be a big issue, but it's actually a huge one.  Even worse is that after dying several times from missing or having the wrong timing with a jump... your reward just might be another very frustrating and unreasonable test in jumping.  The good news is that there are a lot of checkpoints.Another aspect which really contributes to the difficulty level are the boss fights. For the most part it's all about pattern recognition. But this means a lot of trial and error goes into defeating a boss. You'll learn their pattern eventually, but it might be after dying 25 times or so.  After a while dying... becomes repetitive.Normally, difficulty is a very good thing in a game. Gamers have been complaining about games being too simple lately. Prinny is the antithesis to simplicity, but for the wrong reasons. It's difficulty, for the most part, comes through design. But missing a jump more than twenty times or having to die at a boss more than twenty times just to learn how to do it is a bit excessive. The game in and of itself isn't very long, but you'll see that by the time you get to the end, you might have lost half your lives (and remember you begin with 1000 lives!).  You'll definitely feel good if you can slug through the entire adventure, but it hardly seems worth the trouble to do so.However, for what it's worth, the game is fun. But it would've been more fun if it weren't quite this difficult. The amount of death you'll run into can elevate from a simple \"whoops\" to sometimes wanting to throw your PSP across the room. In short, it's a fun game, but not if you're going to be frustrated easily by what could largely be considered meaningless deaths.Prinny: Can I Really Be The Hero? is by no means a bad game.  You just might have a lot of fun with it.  But for the easily frustrated it can be a test in patience as much as it is a test in skill.  If you're a die-hard Disgaea fan or a die-hard Platformer, you just might enjoy this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"Dressi \"K N D\"","summary":"Wow... ok, so yeah I liked it.","reviewText":"I preordered this game, had it rushed delivered, tore it own by with me teeth and admired it for it's shiny goldness.  Then I went out to EB and purchased a Gamecube (Along with Metroid, another cool game).  I sat, drop jawed and google eyed through the intro music, loving every bit of it, intrigued by the story it set up.  It was a wonderful set up and the music went right along with the dialogue every moment.  The opening scene of actual game play was really cool, the overwhelming cuteness was beginning to choke me, though it was quickly relieved after the story hook entered.The new graphics approach was really cool, i really liked the cell shaded, cartoon look to the game.  It completely turned it around from what Space World had given us as the Gamecubes promise as far as Zelda was concerned. But this was completely different... and it was a really nifty difference too.  The gameplay is basically the same as Ocarina of Time, but with a few differences.  Camera angles can be changed using the C-stick.  The direction pad maneuvers between maps, a clock and others.  There is a kind of cute pseudo-Metalgear thing with Link through the game as well, crawling around, pressed up against walls, hanging and scaling ledges, sneaking around in barrels.  Through the first dungeon you have to go through it without a sword, so sneaking around is best (and almost mandatory).  There is a wonderful assortment of gadgets, a new grappling hook that can be used to rob enemies, hunt for burried treasure and of course grapple to certain ledges, the pictograph box has returned from Majora's Mask.The one most unique thing that this game brings to the table is the world map (the sea).  In ocarina there was the world that you walked across, or you could pipe up the ocarina and teleport.  In majora's mask there were owl teleportation stations practically everywhere.  In Windwaker... well there's the far less than appealing Baton and nonsense choir that sings, but that only changed the direction of the wind... then you still have to sail across the great sea to reach the next island.  Every square on the map has an island and every island has a secret, story or just something really cool about it.  Throughout the waves are sunken treasure, enemies, large enemies, puzzles and the occasional barrel/ruppee run.The story has a little to be said about it.  First of all it's a completely deviation from traditional Zelda... there are many places in this game, including the intro, that disassociate the main character (your Link) with the actual Hero of Time (Link).  So... anyway, as well one can easily discern that you are in Hyrule and that it has been flooded... and that every island is just a mountain popping through... well I do not remember Hyrule having so many mountains...  ok so there is this is not just a new addition to the Zelda series, it's a totally new ERA of hyrule... no Kokiri, no Zora, or Goron (not enough), no Gerudo.  A whole new race of people, familiar names are twisted and distorted, and the one name and character that pretty much stays the smae is Tingle (AHHH) and there's more than just one Tingle too...  Oh well.  So there's a lot that's different as far as a traditional Zelda game is concerned.At the end of it all, it was a great game still.  I still give it 5 stars for it's flavor, it's fun.  It was challenging, somewhat, not too hard but not easy either.  There were many side quest types of deals that could keep you distracted from the main story line for a while.  It was fun, in the end and I liked it.  Of course after seeing Spaceworld's Zelda Demo I was expecting really awesome depictions of reality... but after hearing of the new cell shaded graphics, all my expectations dropped, I didn't know what was coming.  But it came and I've played it several times over already.  It's not a traditional Zelda, but then it doesn't have to be.  Most die-hard fans that I know of hate this game just becuase it's different.  I like it becuase it's fun and enjoyable.  There's an incredible silliness to it and commical value that really gave it flare.But that's my opinion...[This game is suitable for young children of young ages]","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2003"}

But I think voices would add personality to the characters. Not a big deal though. The controls take a little getting used to and there's a lot to remember.

There is not enough double teaming with the main characters since you can mostly do this in the major battles where all your time is spend commanding your troops.  The battle controls are annoying.  The individual orders command is deeply flawed.  The graphics while good are not as good as a game of this type should be.  The multi-player version of this game just sucks by making the commanding general be it Eddie or whoever much whimper than the one you become familiar with in the single player game, the car is useless in this version and hardly plows anyone down. Your character is basically just ordering your troops to take down this tower or putting up that tower  while fending off attacking hordes, until you get into position to take down the stage.  Looking for the last five of this or that like the dragons can become very tiresome and makes you want to turn to Internet cheats to find them for the reward things.

Despite that, CoD Ghosts still manages to disappoint.The pros:1) As usual with CoD, the basic game mechanics (e.g. shooting, movement) just work right and this shouldn't be discounted, especially when so many other games fail in this area.  The game froze a couple of times in the first week, but I think it's a good first week success rate, especially compared to another modern day shooter that was just released.2) Quick scoping, the dumbest feature to plague past CoD games, is finally gone.  I hear that it's not impossible, but it's weakened to the point that I haven't seen anyone using it.The cons:1) The maps are stupidly large for 12 person games.  This makes it way too convenient for camping.2) The spawn system is broken.  Despite the large maps, I still find myself spawning right next to enemies.3) It's just not that much fun.  I know it sounds like a terribly subjective thing to put on a review, but I don't know how else to say it.  It's probably the disappointment of playing this game and wondering why they can't just reproduce the immense fun of earlier CoD games.  So I think it's a legitimate criteria that compared to older games this is less fun, so why waste the money.

You play as Heather, a 17 year old girl whose trip to the mall turns into a twisted nightmare of hideous monsters and alternate realities. Using what few resources she can find, she must make her way back to her apartment, then eventually to the town of Silent Hill to uncover her bizarre past. Combat is slow and clunky, but as with all games of this type the main emphasis is on story and riddles...not action. By the end of the game, the whole Silent Hill story finally starts to make some sense...especially if you've played through the first one.

{"product_name":"B0087OZ5FG","description":"","reviewerName":"PM_SuperFreak","summary":"Great sound! Comfort issue CAN be fixed (see details)","reviewText":"I have never spent more than $20 for a set of headphones probably because I'm not a true audiophile and don't listen to a lot of music. I have played for years without a headset but realized that my hearing isn't as good as it used to be, and I cannot hear a lot of the dialog in games. Since I usually play at night and I cannot raise the TV volume due to the family. Hence, I started looking around for a solution. I looked at the Pulse Elite and compared to many other wired/wireless gaming headsets by Turtle Beach and decided to give these a try because of the design, simplicity in connection, and tight integration with PS3. I also considered getting the first iteration of the Sony headsets but the design seemed clunky and the protruding microsphone was a big negative. I have only used this for a couple of weeks but so far my impressions are positive.Positives+ The overallsound quality is superb! The sound across the frequency range from lows to highs is very well handled.+ Plenty of controls on the unit. Easy to adjust once you learn where everything sits.+ Charges up just like your PS3 Dual Shock. You can see the battery level on-screen.+ Sound modes are customizable using the PEM (Pulse Elite Manager) application which is downloadable from the Apps section of the PS Store. You can load up to 6 modes on the headset ranging from Shooter, Driving, Games, Action, Football, Horror, etc. You can even download a sound profile specifically designed for Bioshock Infinite! I downloaded this profile and updated the headset, which took about 5 minutes, and the sound is absolutely amazing. The positioning of sound comes across clearly and accurately. Example: In Bioshock, when Elizabeth is talking to me, and I turn to left or right, the sound source changes to reflect my movement. One thing to note, the differences between the sound profile are very subtle so you might not be able to distinguish one from another depending on the game and sound design.+ Padding around the ear cups is not great but good enough. Synthetic leather is supple and smooth.+ Sound separation is very good due to the large ear cups; outside noise is nearly impossible to hear and there is no noise leakage so others around you will not hear what you hear unless you turn the volume to max.Negatives- This unit is a bit heavier than I expected, which is good in a sense but can cause some discomfort on the top of your head (as other have mentioned). After about an hour of use, I began feeling the weight of the headset on top of my head due to the padding not being very thick. I'm hoping I will get used to it over time. This is not necessarily a big deal since I usually only play for a couple of hours, but if you plan to use this for longer period of time this could be an issue.- The \"Bass Impact\" feature doesn't seem to add a lot to the overall experience. I experimented with just a few games, including Bioshock and some shooters, but it just sounded either like a blown-out bass or has no change at all even if I turn the slider all the way up. This appears to be dependent on the implementation of each individual game so your experience will likely vary.- Battery life, as others have mentioned, is ok but not great. The most I've gotten is about 5 or 6 hours. I read somewhere that battery life is worse if you have Bass Impact turned on, but I have NOT used Bass Impact at all.- No USB cable! Sony does it again as they did with the lack of USB and HDMI cable for the PS3. I have no idea why Sony assumes we would all have the required cables but it's just donwright silly that none is provided.Overall, this is a solid accessory for the PS3. The biggest flaw is the lack of padding on the headband which would have significantly improved the overall comfort level especially for extended wear. After trying out the headset, I regret not having purchased this sooner as the audio experience completely changes the gaming experience.*** EXTRA NOTE ***In my search to find a solution for the comfort issue, I found this add-on headphone padding from another reviewer; see link below.NEW! Replacement Upgrade Headband Comfort Cushion Pad in Leatherette with snap locks. Universal fit most Headphone models; Grado SR SRi-series, Sennheiser HD-series, Beyerdynamic and more.This is designed for \"universal\" headphones but given that it's relatively cheap, I decided to give it a try to hopefully enhance the comfort. This headband cushion provides about 5/8-inch padding which drastically improved the comfort level of the headset. I have posted a detailed review under this product, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this add-on to anyone who has comfort issues with the headband on the Pulse headset. This add-on fits so well that it almost feels like it was part of the design from the start! If I had not found this cushion, I would have definitely returned the Pulse headsets. Check it out![EDIT 5-28-2013]Still amazed at the quality of the overall sound. The bass is nice and strong, and comfort is still great with the addition of the headband mentioned above.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2013"}
{"product_name":"B008XMSR6G","description":"Neo-Paris. 2084.Personal memories can now be digitized, bought, sold and traded. The last remnants of privacy and intimacy have been swept away in what appears to be a logical progression of the explosive growth of social networks at the beginning of the 21st century. The citizens themselves have accepted this surveillance society in exchange for the comfort only smart technology can provide. This memory economy gives immense power over society to just a handful of people.Remember Me is a 3rd person action adventure where players take on the role of Nilin, a former elite memory hunter with the ability to break into people's minds and steal or even alter their memories. The authorities, fearful of her knowledge and capabilities have arrested Nilin and wiped her memory clean. After her escape from prison, Nilin sets out on a mission to recover her identity, helped by her last and only friend. This search for her past leads to her being hunted by the very people that created this surveillance society.","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"You Must Remember This","reviewText":"On the store shelves, we've started to see an influx of lack of creativity. That is to say, most of the games today consist of grey-and-brown shooters with overtly patriotic plots, with the same cover-based gameplay and shoehorned multiplayer modes. While there are some shimmers of hope, there's no sign of these games slowing down. With this predicament, we have to latch onto these shimmers for truly unique and original experiences, and hope they can deliver. And now, much like this year's magnificent \"Tomb Raider\", Capcom delivers a game that truly breaks the mold. \"Remember Me\" isn't perfect, but if you care about video games as an art form, it demands your attention.Over half a century from our present time, memories are treated as digital items to be bought, traded and stored, much like a movie or an eBook. But a group of revolutionaries known as Errorists are attempting to stop this practice by taking down Memorise, the corporation who has started to hold the world's memories in a monopolistic chokehold. They use the very tools they hate to gain access to top-secret information to topple the company, but their biggest asset is a woman named Nilin. Not only can she steal memories, but she can hack into people's brains and insert new ones, therefore altering their motivations and alignments. But Nilin has run into a bit of a problem: she was captured by the company, and almost all of her memories were wiped. Now she's on a quest to regain her memories and beliefs, while grappling with the moral ramifications of altering the very foundation of what makes people unique.It's all very thought-provoking stuff, and done in a very impressive fashion. The whole narrative plays out like a blend of \"Ghost in the Shell\" and \"Total Recall\", while adding original elements to prevent it from being too familiar. Especially intriguing is the blend of philosophical banter and believable technobabble, which makes for a meaty plot with plenty to reflect on. What makes this so reflective is the relative believability of the concept; seeing how corporations today are bent on gathering personal information and storing it to profit from, the idea that actual memories could be used for that purpose is entirely feasible to a certain extent. Grappling with the ethicality of this practice is something that any writer would have an issue with, and while there are some ideas that could definitely be explored further here, what script does with the concept is commendable, and definitely deserves an \"A\" for effort, if not for execution.What helps sell this concept is Nilin herself, who is without a doubt the finest female protagonist I've ever had the joy of playing as. Her introspective nature, coupled with her stoic build and unconventional looks, makes for a truly unique protagonist. This is not a character who panders to the lowest common denominator, or one is routinely othered because of her gender. She matches and outperforms the men in the game, as do the other female supports. Her arms are ripped with muscle, and her tongue is as sharp as her wit. That being said, she is vulnerable in the sense that she is struggling to understand who she is, or the validity of what she does. Nilin is a torn, yet powerful, protagonist, and helps elevate the game to narrative levels that I personally didn't know games were capable of ascending to. Lara Croft, Faith Connors and Bayonetta have undoubtedly been left in the dust by this memorable, lovable and deeply human character.This ambitious narrative and wonderful protagonist, however, comes with a small hitch. The gameplay's scope is just as far-reaching as the plot, but unfortunately, it fails to deliver the same bite. What it excels in, it masters; in this case, it's the exhilarating platforming and the relative fluidity of Nilin's move set. The parkour-esque moves lend themselves well to exploration and maneuvering through combat situations. That being said, the combat itself feels a bit stilted. While being able to build your own combo trees (a la \"God Hand\") is fun, but being able to use those combos is deeply frustrating at times. You'll have to hit the buttons in perfect sequence with perfect timing in order to pull them off; this should be easy due to the fact that they're displayed at the bottom on the HUD, but you'll spend so much time looking at them that you'll lose sight of enemies surrounding you and get pummeled.Adding to the frustration is combat is the only way to regain lost health. Building restoration combos in order to get back health is essential, because there are no med kits to speak of outside of occasional health refill terminals. This is a really ambitious idea, but the combat is too precise and finicky for it to truly work. Overall, it feels great to control Nilin when she's jumping across buildings or cartwheeling through the air, but things get a bit frustrating when it comes to fisticuffs. It's fun once you get the hang of it, but it takes a while to do that, and some players might not have the patience for something other than button-mashing.The most unique gameplay element of \"Remember Me\" is, without a doubt, the Remixing feature. Nilin hacks into people's memories and alters them to suit her goals, and she does this through an odd little process that does just as many things right as it does wrong. Players move the analog stick forward or backwards to play through somebody's memories, and search for \"glitches\" that will change the course of the event. It's a fun novelty, and it's almost reminiscent of cult gem \"Ghost Trick\" in its ambition to find little details in order to change an outcome of any given situation. While the concept is nice, and it works well enough, it would have certainly been nice to have the rewind and fast-forward commands be less awkward. Having to rotate the stick gets annoying, especially when having to alternate speeds, then jam it in a certain direction to pause. Furthermore, having to find the exact sequence of glitches can be an arduous chore, even more so when considering that you have to erase glitches if you want rewind past them. It turns the entire experience into an extended cutscene of trial and error. Certainly, it's admirable that the developers made cutscenes with so many outcomes, but a bit more direction and streamlining of the process would have been nice.From combat to movement to \"remixing\", the problem with the gameplay is that it's simply too ambitious for its own good. While it definitely has plenty of new and fresh ideas, some polishing of the more basic mechanics (combat, remixing) would have been much appreciated. This doesn't hamper my enjoyment of the game, really, but it definitely makes it a bit more of a challenging recommendation to everybody.What certainly saves players from constant frustration are the incredibly lush aesthetics of the game. Environments are teeming with life, bleeding vibrant colors and filled to the brim with creative paths that Nilin is led down. Everything in this game is positively beautiful to look at, and during platforming sequences, every single thing in the world seems to be moving and changing at times. What helps make it more visually appealing is the sheer variety at play. French architecture, modern houses, futuristic skyscrapers... this game truly offers the most beautiful vision of the future in a game since \"Binary Domain\", with plenty of variety and a vast array of beautiful colors. Special note should be made of the \"advertisements\" that hover in the air around Nilin, a part of her permanent memory augmentation from what I was able to gather. Character models are also wonderful, with little clothing and facial details lovingly added to even the most minor characters. When it comes to visuals, from creativity to color to variety, this game packs a one-two punch.To tie it all together, we have one of the most brilliant musical scores in recent years. The beautiful symphonic arrangement, spliced with pounding techno during battle sequences, conveys a sense of wonder and whimsy that parallels the works of music maestros such as John Williams or Hans Zimmer. It's an amazing score, and one that even non-gamers ought to listen to, simply for the sake of listening to some great music. Adding on top of it all is the great voice acting, which is consistently good across the board. While there are some issues (some characters sound a bit too archetypal for my tastes), the major players have seriously great actors, with Nilin having a strong and assertive voice that displays traces of uncertainty, and the villainous Doctor Quaid coming across as a neurotic yet powerful sociopath. Powerful performances atop a great score makes for an all-around pleasant auditory experience.Developer Dontnod was aiming for something truly different with their debut, and they've certainly achieved it. While it has some issues that could have been worked out, the sheer scope and ambition of this project is truly admirable, and I do hope that Capcom holds onto this very talented and creative team. \"Remember Me\" is definitely not a perfect game, but like many games that hold this distinction, it has hacked its way into my heart and become one of my favorites of recent years.New entries in the \"Call of Duty\" and \"Battlefield\" series will come and go, but \"Remember Me\" will stand tall as a truly unique and fresh experience that is quite unlike anything I've played before.Plot: 9.5Gameplay: 8.5Graphics: 10Sound: 9.5Overall: 9.25","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"drollere","summary":"a videogaming achievement","reviewText":"i'm a mature gamer who bought a dozen or so videogames with a new xbox just to see how the technology had evolved. (the digital animations in many recent films had piqued my interest.) some few important flaws aside, grand theft auto is in my view exactly where the medium is headed, and is head and shoulders the best game available today ... and i say that as a great admirer of half life 2, portal, assassin's creed, bioshock and crackdown. the point here is total, seamless, deep immersion in a world. not just an environment, not just a point of view or mission or skill set, but all the redolent layers of culture: people, infrastructure, authority, television, radio, internet, dating, sex, weapons, power, money, recreational activities, jobs, vengeance, justice -- and not just culture but a world where hydrants erupt when you drive over them, jetliners blink their slow trace across the night sky, the city breathes with distant sounds of traffic, disorder, and heavy objects, the light changes almost second to second with the time of day or the weather or the illumination of interior spaces, and your vision blurs and your driving becomes erratic if you have too much to drink. against this rich background of sardonic humor and social commentary in the guise of \"urban landscape\", the splendid graphical rendering and gritty art design, the two big flaws are the waxy and unconvincing computer animation in cutscenes, and the still less than lifelike animation of the wireframe action figures (those strip club dancers are not very enticing). but the depth of detail here is remarkable -- the way different weapons handle, the way different cars drive (carjack an ambulance or stretch limo, for example), the completely unique content on different car radio stations, the internet parodies, the cellphone text messages, and the sheer variety of characters in the mix -- all of it designed with unbelievable detail and dramatic interest. despite the segmentation of the game into separate missions, the narrative has a compelling overall architecture. as one example, i had early on tried to cross to the largest of the four islands of the city (blocked by a plot motivated police action), and had been shot or arrested every time. so as i worked the missions, one of the fortunate recipients of my gangster skills asked me to drive him home: and home was on the inaccessible island. crossing over the bridge, the light of late afternoon streaming into the car, the music on the radio playing a vatic beat, it was an emotionally rousing moment. i say \"me\" but of course it's really niko bellic, an eastern european thug on a quest that only gradually becomes clear as the plot unfolds; and it's a third flaw of the game that this quest, as important as it is to niko, does not seem very important in his unstructured and varied choices of dating, driving and drilling bad guys with high calibre. but that's because the richness of the storytelling has made all the conventional story lines of videogames obsolete. the essential point is that this videogame has i think crossed the milestone of creating a digital, full length feature film, with much more depth and detail than any feature film has ever had to come up with, and a film that is potentially open ended, multilayered and even life changing. (i've learned that the addictive effect of videogaming is considerable, which means there is power there to affect \"plotted\" change of all kinds in videogamers.) videogames can now be anything: the story of an individual's search for the meaning of life, non stop sex with a harem, fighting the revolution and constitutional wrangles of a new republic, solving a deep scientific mystery, getting married and starting a family, building a career in a corporation ... anything and everything, but computed in real time and with an open ended architecture. videogames can do these things with the compelling visual realism and depth of any major studio film with digital special effects, and with the possibility of a collaboratively constructed reality through network game play. the painting of light and visual objects is i think a trivial problem: the obstacles now are in managing the narrative complexity and event interactions, in building new narrative conventions or genres, and in the animation of life forms, in particular a speaking mouth and an exerting figure (for example, a figure that actually runs *on the ground*). the fourth and last flaw of this game is the gangster mentality of all the characters, which is not really a flaw so much as a genre convention (as in for example film noir or chandler novels). this gangster ethos actually reduces the impact of the violence, which i think motivates too much of the game. but grand theft auto prototypes a new cultural modality, the digital fantasy domain, which as fantasy can come very close to reality and as game can stimulate any perplexity of emotion. it's an achievement.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2008"}

I had a pleasant time with this purchase, so I didn't cross any problems that some other reviewers may have had.I recommend buying this battery pack if you have the charging wire or dock to charge them with. They make wonderful replacements! Great for the avid gamer and even people who play with friends on the same console. I am so glad I purchased this, hopefully you will.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2014"}

Starvation, betrayal, heartbreak and more will challenge you as you attempt to survive in the world of The Walking Dead.","reviewerName":"maskedgamer","summary":"I thought this was one of the best CHOOSE your action adventure stories out there","reviewText":"but then as usual I was let down. The art style is great the story is great it's just like watching the walking dead except actually being in it. All of the characters and how they interact with you is also great as it makes the story seem realistic but the problem starts around the 3rd episode of the game where you realize the choices you make mean little and the outcome actually rides on rails. After some events in the game I just realized the &#34;lie&#34; of this &#34;your decisions matter&#34; really don't and that was a let down.You can't really save anyone in this game and the only thing that changes is the dialogue. I figured this game would be great for replayability but the story cannot be altered. People you want to live will die and even though it seems like you can stop it you can't. Events that take place will still happen and even though it seems like you can go left or right at a fork in the road you can't. There is no &#34;Exploration&#34; or &#34;Chose your own adventure&#34; in this story. It's more like select what dialogue you want a character to say. With the idea that there is so little freedom in this game It just comes down into the point and click adventure column and with that I don't see how this is &#34;Game of the year&#34; or getting the praise it's getting for being such a linear game in an age of gaming where people want an open explorable world and the option to write their own stories. For me episode 3 ruined the game and I didn't care for it much after that.It's not so much the events that occurred as it is the fact the player has no choice to intervene. Some people give the excuse &#34;oh it's supposed to be realistic&#34; but that's not realistic. It makes the game feel like a cartoon show with the crazy stuff that happens. &#34;Realistic&#34; is the choice of changing the future but making a right or wrong decision to change the consequences. I just felt personally that parts of the story could have been done much better to make the game feel more like a game than a point and click movie to which my input has no effect on.Overall this is a fun game to continue The Walking Dead experience if your itching for some zombie action in its likeness but as a game especially a Choose your own adventure one It's not very good. After all the games I've played the only Choose your story game that I played that stayed true to the concept was &#34;AR Tonelico&#34; which is probably why I ended up playing that game for a year straight because it's full of options that change what your characters do and how the story plays out. I give the game 3/5 because it's well done but gives the illusion of having a freedom of choice that you really don't.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2013"}

I can't say that it was everything that I hoped for, but it wasn't a complete letdown either.  The makings of a great game are there but the problem is that there are so many different facets of game play rolled into one game that it never satisfies fully in one area.  On the one hand the game is open-ended and free form, but only if you don't care about the storyline.  On the other hand, if you want the sense of accomplishment that you get when you truly complete a game then you will find Dead Rising a frustratingly mixed bag.  The reason for this is that while the storyline is actually good and the time system is innovative (to a degree) it is also so hectic and unforgiving that you will find yourself constantly repeated large chunks of the game, at times even starting over from the beginning to get some extra levels under your belt.  I think you would be hard pressed to finish this game start to finish without ever quitting and starting the game over from the beginning.  Also, I don't think there is enough time in the game to complete every task (investigations, rescues and psychopaths to deal with) and stay on top of the cases (the events that propel the storyline and actually give you the \"correct\" ending.  For me, this meant that I never felt a sense of complete accomplishment.  I give the game 4 stars because despite its flaws it really is a very good game, just not perfect.The GOOD:- Despite being another zombie title from Capcom this game is much more in line with zombie pop-culture and more fun than the puzzle-driven and serious survival games like Resident Evil.- The mix of humor and horror in this game is perfect, at times I was laughing out loud only to be grimacing a moment later.  The game retains a tongue-in-cheek vibe from start to finish that celebrates zombie pop-culture.- The game lets you dispatch zombies in any fashion you choose - literally I couldn't even imagine all the ways to kill zombies that exist in this game.  Almost everything is a weapon with a surprising amount of versatility.- The mall is huge and very well detailed.  I was very impressed with it and could imagine this being a real mall just down the street.- The voice acting and some of the cinematic sequences are great, but why can't the voices exist outside of the cut scenes? I'm sick of getting hounded by Otis on the transmitter every few minutes and having to pause to read what he has to say.- People have complained that the game demands a decent hi-def TV to fully enjoy and I agree that it does.  However, I believe in creating a game that is a visual acheivement and meant to be cutting edge and not dulling it down to make it marginal so it could be played on lower-end technology.  However, this does limit how many people will be able to enjoy the game.  But it does look good.- Great and diverse sound effects.Now the BAD:- Time-based missions are too strict and hectic, and often times vague.- Difficult to feel a sense of accomplishment the first time through.  this is further emphasized by the odd save system and the fact that the game designers expected you to have to restart the game several times from the beginning.- Controls for aiming are clunky and awkward.  The aiming can be improved upon by changing the camera controls under settings though.- Survivor AI is poor, but they are hardy and can withstand a chewing on.- Doesn't put as much focus on killing zombies or survival as I'd have hoped for.- The voice acting is really well done but doesn't exist outside of cut scenes (instead you are hounded by moments when you have to pull up the transmitter, limiting your movement choices and killing your combat abilities, and while trying to keep Frank alive you have to read the on screen text).- Save system only allows 1 save slot per profile.- Plenty of save locations, but in the unforgiving chaotic timeline you are under it can take precious time to reach a safe point before and after ever major event and some events do not allow for a convenient save which is incredibly frustrating.- The constant loading screens get annoying.- The weapons have varying (and confusing) lifespans and damage output.- There is a variety of skills you can learn (martial arts style stuff) but they are hard to execute and don't work most of the time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00BGA9YZK","description":"","reviewerName":"Peter Faden \"robilar5500\"","summary":"A beautiful game with some lackluster levels.","reviewText":"Well, I've been playing this since launch. My impressions are as follows: the graphics are simply stunning. They definitely took advantage of the new OS to really push the limits. They are definitely the highlight of the game. The game design itself is a mixed bag. The game is certainly fun enough, and the stealth sections in particular were quite enjoyable. There are some frustrating aspects though...most notably the falling sequences and the unimaginative use of enemy waves rather than less enemies with better A.I. I think as far as level design goes, the developers phoned it in a bit, relying instead on standard shooter scenarios. I feel they could have done so much more with this. The multi player is a blast. Plenty of different settings and large deathmatches have made this enjoyable to me. Note however that if you arent really that great at shooters, you wont be good at the mp, and the longer it takes for you to get into it, the more time it gives the dedicated players a chance to become almost unstoppable. The bots are a welcome addition as well (not sure if they were in previous games, but they are cool in this one).Overall, I think the developers could have done a much better job, but the game was still pretty enjoyable, and it's a decent launch title overall. Certainly a decent launching point for future PS4 games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2013"}

Gannon was defeated in the previous game so he's nowhere to be seen, unless its game over (he returns after his minons and guardians feed him blood from a defeated Link).  A now late teenaged Link must awaken Princess Zelda (not the same Princess Zelda we all know, but a decendant from hundreds of years ago) from multi-century long slumber due to a wizard's evil spell.  In order to awaken Zelda, Link must obtain the Triforce of Courage from the Great Palace, but in order to unlock the palace, he must place six crystals on the stone statues of six different palaces that are guarded by six of the late-Gannon's guardians.  Some of Gannon's minor minions like Stalfos, Moblins, and Octoroks return to give Link more trouble but Link faces some of the most annoying minor enemies in video game history like the multi life sucking Dairas (those annoying axe weilding/thowing mutant alligators) and Ironknuckles (a more stubborn upgrade from Darknuts from the previous Zelda game who comes in three different forms).Unlike other Zelda titles, Link does not gain any upgrades on his armor, sword, and shield (according to the instruction manual, Link still uses his magical sword and shield he upgraded to in the first Zelda game), but you gain expeirence points in attack strength, life, and magic (a new feature in the Zelda game that will revisted in A Link To The Past and a few other games).  You do go into an attack mode as you run into a weak or strong enemy images floating around on the overview, but you don't take turns attacking like most traditional role playing games so Zelda II was very innovative for its time. Also another first is Link can go to different Hyrule towns to talk to select people for secrets to progress throughout the game or to learn new magic spells (from a town wizard) and offensive moves (like the upward jump sword thrust and downward stab sword thrust from a local swordsman).  Due to all these added features mentioned, this game acts more of like a role playing game with some minor modfifications.  Due to the success of the game, Castlevania II: Simon's Quest emulated its game play to the fullest with little excitement and more mundane objectives.  Despite of its difficulty, it was a fun game and a timeless classic of which many fans would dissmiss.  Many players complained due to the strong difficulty, but thats why there existed a battery genrated saved feature so you can try again.  The only disadvantage compared to the first game is that if its \"Game Over,\" you go right back from the beginning, literally.  You don't start from the beginning of the palace, unless you loose all your lives at the Great Palace.  I also don't like the fact that you loose all of your expeirence points when you die.  Another minor complaint I have is that you are only confined by your sword for protection.  It would've been nice if Link had more variety of weapons like a boomerang or arrows because these offensive magic spells are too costly and the game is a bit stingy when it comes to refilling his magic meter (full magic bottles are rare).  Other than that, its a pretty good game, yet it is probaly condered the last adventure for Link due to the fact that all future Zelda releases were taken place before the first Zelda game.  Due to the storylines, they were all consired prequels.  Castlevania did the same thing for the third NES installment. Get your gold cartridge today!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWYTC","description":"","reviewerName":"E. Luna \"FPS Connoisseur\"","summary":"Worthy mobile counterpart to a great series","reviewText":"The PlayStation Vita is a handheld console that has not received it's due diligence. It has a decent video game library that covers most genres quite well. It has good fighters (Marvel v Capcom 3) good RPG's (Muramasa) good racers (Wipeout) and others. The one thing this console was missing was a good shooter, the Call of Duty game that came out at launch was a horrendous excuse for a shooter, and the Resistance shooter was a lackluster title.Enter Killzone Mercenary. A game with the graphical oomph of a PlayStation 3 game, the solid gameplay of a console shooter, and a multiplayer portion to rival any opponent. In short, this is a fantastic game. In fact, it may be the first \"good\" mobile console FPS.For years it was just a fact of life that FPS were not easy to translate into the handheld medium. But, Guerrilla Cambridge actually went and did it. This is a worthy title in the Killzone series. It looks and plays like Killzone 3, and that makes it all the more impressive.The campaign may be a little short (easily completed in about 4 hours if you rush through it), but it does offer a ton of replayapility in the form of side missions and intel pick ups. The story spans events from all three Killzone console games, and it manages to catch and keep your attention.The multiplayer may see a little bare bones, but is so much fun to play. It has a free for all, a team deathmatch, and a multiple objective mode. All three are incredibly fun to play.If you have a PS Vita, and you love the Killzone series or shooters in general you have to buy this game. It's amazing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000BWZY7Q","reviewerName":"JD","summary":"More of the same, for good or bad","reviewText":"I've held off review of this item until I actually had a chance to really get into the features offered by the expansion beyond just initial impressions.  What I came away with is that The Burning Crusade delivers more of what the original World of Warcraft game offered, but that the new offerings are much the same as what was available before.  In other words, you can continue to advance now beyond the level cap of 60 (and the skill caps of 300) but that the new advancements don't really offer anything that redefines the game.  If the design was to merely open up \"more\" then Blizzard delivered a well done, if pricey (you are paying the price of a full game here), continuation.  If you were looking to be wow'd the way we were when first visited by World of Warcraft, I don't think this expansion delivers that.  Continuing a good thing is fine, but paying the price of a full game to just unlock 10 more levels of advancement that is much the same as before isn't a great value.  If you were not a big World of Warcraft fan you will likely enjoy putting that money into discovering a new MMO entirely as you won't see anything really new or inventive here.As stated, The Burning Crusade moves the level cap from 60 to 70, allowing you 10 more talent points to spend on increasing the strengths of your character and investing in talents that were recently made available.In addition, the game offers two new races (Drenai and Blood Elf) with thier unique starting areas and character models.  The models and areas are not exactly new, you've seen them here and there before in one form or another.  But still, new-ish models and color schemes and a new layout of the scenery models to explore.  Quests remain much the same as they ever were, with nothing about them standing out.Also introduced was an additional trade skill, Jewelcrafting.  I wasn't a big fan of the Trade Skills in the basic game because the items you could make were not of any better quality than what you could loot (oftentimes lesser quality) and required a lot of effort in acquiring mats for when you could just buy the items readily available equivalent.  There were a few high-end crafting items that were very nice to have, but very difficult to get to the point of making.  Overall, the Trade Skills were a waste of money as you were better off financially to just harvest materials and sell them for immediate cash and then buy the items you want.  Jewelcrafting has some early items that are actually useful as low level rings and such are often difficult to find.  Hopefully it is a profession that will actually remain useful throughout.The Burning Crusade features a new world to explore and conquer called Outland.  The visuals that comprise the new models and new area look right in place and familiar - because really, you have seen the same models before for most things.  Don't get me wrong, the new races and areas look as good as anything you will see in World of Warcraft, but they don't feel entirely different or new.The new expansion doesn't require computer upgrades as the graphical quality hasn't really changed much and things are rendered much the same as before.  By today's standards the graphics of World of Warcraft, while vibrant, are aging, but friendly to a large group of computers so you won't have to worry about performance demands.  If you could already play the game well, you will be fine with the expansion.I still give the game an enjoyment factor of 4 out of 5.  It has a lot of things that I don't like but it offers a lot of enjoyment as well and is a great time sink.  The Burning Crusade rekindles my interest in the game but I think that interest will sadly be short-lived.  Having already grown tired of World of Warcraft's basic gameplay and mechanics, I don't think it will take long to feel like I've experienced all the \"new\" stuff.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2007"}

Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Jason A.

I loved the first two, and the first one was one of my all time favorite games. But I finished the game with trying to do and get just about everything in about 7 hours. Luckily I only paid about 1/2 the sticker price on Ebay.The graphics and elements like the skyline were great. Although overall the visuals were much more close to Dishonored than previous Bioshock games. The game started out more like Bioshock just with the way you collect supplies, health, and the feel of combat & the historical feel of the originals. But once Elizabeth came on the scene, the game really changed. Granted, it was nice to have someone tossing me health and elixir, but it wasn't the same feel as Bioshock.Despite other reviews, there still are a few moral choices, mainly dealing with racial issues. I don't mind a game examining racial topics, but it didn't feel like the real focus of the game and some of it portrayed very stereotyped images. The ending as many have said really does not flow with the game and is some 1/2 attempt at something more existential, etc.Overall this has been a disappointing year with franchises really jumping the shark to make a buck on rather lame games. Assassin's Creed 3, Tomb Raider, Hitman Absolution and now Bioshock all really missed the mark concerning the good things about each series. When a game changes so much, they really just need to call & package it as a new game.The one game that did make the grade this year was the previously mentioned Dishonored. It lived up to the advertising hype, and I find it quite replayable, and they've just released a nice DLC called \"The Knife of Dunwall\".I wish I had a better experience & review of Bioshock infinite, but I want to give my honest review.

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVUA","description":"","reviewerName":"ManUPT","summary":"Can Only get Better from Here","reviewText":"I'm not one to be obsessed with anything, but man can this thing do it all. I find myself using my Xbox one for everything because that is what it was built for. I play video games with great graphics, watch TV (Football usually) even while playing a game, and using Xbox fitness to get in shape while having fun. That's generally speaking; now let's get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup. Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about. The Bumpers on the controller are a little bit annoying. They take some getting used to because they are positioned slightly differently and make a very loud and annoying sound. The thumbsticks are smaller which is somewhat better and also have the edges a little tighter which keeps it from tearing like it did on my 360 controller. The positioning of the home button is much better in that it doesn't get in the way of the buttons. When my Dad plays, he might hit the center of the 360 button in the middle of the game, but this controller helps avoid that from happening. Overall it is similar to the 360 controller and I believe it is easy to get use to the new layout within a day or two. 4.6/5[Design] Now this is an ugly ass Xbox, but that was kind of expected now wasn't it. The upside to this is that we will not have to go through the horrible red ring of death. It is capable of keeping cool and will not overheat even if on for 24 hours straight for every day, I would know. I'm sure within 2 or 3 years we will have a redesigned Xbox that is smaller, just like how the Xbox slim was released. Another upside is that the Xbox is very quiet which is quite surprising given the size and consumption of it. But until then, just be content with the fact that there is no more red ring. 3.5/5 (The 3.5 is mostly due to the upsides)[Xbox, Record That] Well the Xbox is constantly recording the last 5 minutes of gameplay so you can easily record anything, either automatically or with a voice command. Unfortunately I have been having trouble with the voice command so I have been stuck having to do it manually. Sharing videos with friends is very easy thanks to this. Hopefully people will reduce the uploads of their uninteresting videos and keep it restricted to only the ones worth watching. 3.9/5[Movies] Finally a blu-ray player, I have been wanting this for many years. Although I already had one in my living room, I could really use one in my basement. Sometimes you just want to watch a movie by yourself without being disturbed or by disturbing others, this is why this came in handy. Now that I get almost all my movies either streaming or Blu-ray, the Xbox is my number 1 movie player. It is true that you have to download an app to play the blu-ray, but it's free and easy. 5/5[Kinect] Well, well, well, so you add a Kinect Microsoft and you bump up the cost 100 bucks more than the PS4?... NO PROBLEM! I am not disappointed at all. The Kinect is amazing; 10 times better than the old kinect. I can say anything and the kinect will do it with ease. Also, almost all games have at least some kinect functionality. Battlefield lets you turn your head in order to turn your head in battlefield when in a vehicle which is really cool. FIFA allows subs to be made just by saying it which is also cool. As time goes on, I feel that the kinect will be more and more useful in these games. In the end, this is a great addition to the Xbox.  4.6/5[Overall] With everything the Xbox has to offer, there is no other thing I would rather have. I give it a 4.46/5 for now, but I think I will rank it higher as time goes by. It has been great for everything, mainly gaming with revolutionary graphics. And remember, it can only get better from here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}

If you are new to the Virtua Fighter series, the in-depth training system will teach you the art of combat, move by move. Rewards await those who master every move, and you can expect to unlock a few secret techniques along the way.Two new characters (Lei Fei and Vanessa Lewis) join 11 VF veterans for a grand total of 13 fighters, each with his or her own unique styles based on real martial arts. New counters and defensive moves allow players to switch up their stances and fighting styles midbout. High-polygon character models, exquisite detail, and brilliant light sourcing combine to create breathtaking visuals. You can also train a computer-controlled character through sparring and an easy-to-use rewards system, then pit your character against a friend's, or challenge the arcade mode. A new accessory system allows you to customize your character's clothing, sunglasses, hairstyles, and more.","reviewerName":"thebluedevil","summary":"The uncontested greatest fighting game of all time.","reviewText":"I have always been a VF fan, but i never thought it could be as good as Tekken.  Now, I gladly trade the entire Tekken series for this one masterpiece of a fighting game.  Those of you who say the gameplay is too simple clearly aren't getting the complete idea of how many fighting moves you can get out of combining those three different buttons.  Those of you who say there aren't enough modes should play more Kumite.  I can understand some hardcore gamers who beat the Kumite mode in a few weeks, but for those of you who havent gone into that, you really should.  You have to win over a thousand matches to even get a chance to fight Dural, who is the unlockable character. Kumite also brings the most fun aspect i have seen in a fighting game: customizable characters.  Finally, for those of you who want more endings, I have a word of advice for you: go into RPG's.  A fighting game like Tekken 4 that tries to make up for their below par controls with flashy endings,(and i have seen all those Tekken 4 endings for any of you who wonder) will never be as good as a fighter that turns toward the gameplay before they even think about some storyline endings.  I would gladly trade the entire Tekken series for this fighting game so carefully crafted and so utterly addicting.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2003"}

Pure is one of them. It is not adulterated, no un-necessary crap included. The game is extreme sports on four wheels. Your skill in pulling off tricks gets you the winner trophy.As this game doesn't try to be a jack of all, either you will fall in love or may not bother about it. If you are one of those who loved games like Skate, older ATV games; dont miss this one. Try out the demo, it is a very good representation of the basic gameplay.The game is very easy to pick up. But to be a true master and unlock every thing you need to practice a lot. The gameplay is very well balanced;  you can't just be a one trick pony. There are three modes in the game, I like all of them. You need a different mind set to champion each style. My most favorite is freestyle. All you are doing is pulling of tricks for extra time. It is purely your skill, nothing else.For me Graphics is not just polygon count. I would like to see good art work too. Art style and texture work is stellar. Probably this is the best looking racing game so far in this generation. As you jump higher and higher you can see a much wider area. They look awesome, it is like riding up a gondola looking down. Areas are very varied from lush forest to snow covered mountains. Very well done with lot of details. Iam not a big fan of the shiny bloom lighting, but it is there. It seems to be very common in new racing games.Online works like a charm. Every mode is available online too. Don't approach this game as you do in Forza. Driving fast all the time wont help you much. Make sure to nail the tricks, build up your boost meter. It is a extreme sport game.Another impressive feature is ATV customization. You can even build the entire ATV from scratch. Only complaint I have is, you can't use your own textures or custom paint. So all the ATV's either custom built or the ones from the game  look the same. Customizing your ATV becomes very important at latter stages as the vanilla ATV wont cut it. More time you spend on this game, more you will fall in love with this.Black Rock Studio has done so many iterations of ATV games in the past, Pure is a big fan service.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2008"}

Wright","summary":"Mediocrity sometimes works, but not this game","reviewText":"While this is not an AAA title or franchise, it has its moments. Unfortunately, it falls into too many usability traps to make it a truly good game.The game suggests itself to be an RPG, but it's really just a third person zombie-esque hack and slasher with some RPG elements thrown in.  The enemies are nothing special. The RPG elements and leveling pieces just seem to be add-ons. However, the combat is okay. But, let's get right down to what's wrong with this title.The graphics are weak and uninspired. In fact, this looks like a title that could have been on the Xbox 360 without any significant problems. This is one of the primary problems with this game. However, the main problem is the boss levels. As with many lower budget games, they go overboard by throwing you into a heavily tutorial-laced intro. This isn't so much a problem in that it's expected with most games, it just that this game constantly interrupts the game play so frequently you cannot even play. In fact, I had to turn the tutorial system off (thankfully there's a setting).  Worse, the tutorial intro requires you to use each of your actions to make sure you understand how to use them ... when, in fact, you should be conserving the use of your finite items (like health).However, when you need to actually get down to business and play the game, you cannot because of some stupid design decisions. Yes, the game offers you ways to crafting things such as weapons, armor and health. Though, there are no health pickups on the level, you must craft them. The trouble is, no components are to found to actually make health potions. So, while you're forced to use up all your given health potions just getting through the intro, you cannot make any more. After having used up all of the health potions just trying to clear the enemies leading up to the first boss, you are left without any health potions when confronting the first boss.Also, after you get through the lead up to the boss, you will acquire what seems like it should be an awesome power. Instead, it's just a magic spell to enchant your weapons or throw fireballs. Worse, the spell wears off fast and takes far too long to cast. This newfound power doesn't help you in any way. At least if you're going to empower the player character, at least make it count.But, this isn't the real problem. The real problem is that because you cannot craft any new potions (no components) and you cannot back out of the boss level to go search (not that you'd find any), you're stuck there. On top of boss attacking you with various techniques, which you have to destroy him by hacking his hands and feet at opportune times... all the while the level is constantly throwing waves of archers,  mace and sword wielding zombies that never end (which also consume health). Because the game traps you into a level without health pickups and with no way to actually complete it, the only thing you can do is start the entire game over with a completely new tactic... conserve your potions at all costs. Something you wouldn't know to do based on the tutorial.And therein lies this game's fundamental problem and why it's getting 2.5 stars. If you're a game developer who wants to design a shooter, don't do it this way. If you're going to force a boss level at the end, then you frickin' well better give enough components along the way to craft enough health to win it. Or alternatively, offer health pickups on the boss level. Trapping the player on a boss level without any health is just insane. Who would ever do this other than people who just don't 'get' how to create video games? Forcing the player to start the entire game over just to choose a new tactic to survive the boss level is just stupid. Think through game design people. Trial and error gaming is never cool.It's clear that this game wasn't in any way play tested. I would give this game 2.5 stars, but there's no way to give that here. So, 2 stars it gets.Game mechanics: 4/5Gameplay: 3/5Voiceovers: 2/5Graphics: 2/5Audio: 3/5Overall: 2.5/5Recommendation: Rent only.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2014"}

{"product_name":"B007XVTR3K","description":"","summary":"It's still COD, but different. (Multiplayer Review)","reviewText":"I have been playing COD since 2007 when the first modern warfare came out. With that said the games have gotten kinda stale over the last few years. This game changes a lot of stuff. The pick 10 system is great because it gives you tons of options. The point streak system is great, almost everything you do to help your team gives you points. Kills while a UAV is out give you assist points for every kill. It's great... Being a team player actually pays off! So far I haven't seen any of the big kill streaks, but it looks like killstreaks have been toned down a bit, which I definitely see as a plus.People are complaining a lot about spawns, and hit detection. The spawns will be patched in a few weeks, they are always bad at the release. The hit detection though? I don't have any problems. I was holding down a 2.02 k/d ratio, no problems killing people.I do have a few complaints though...I don't like that I can't see my overall accuracy with my weapons. Not a big deal, but I was curious what mine was and couldn't see it. Some of the maps are a little dark, and some of the bad players decide to hide in the dark spots to get cheap campy kills. That's really it though, the rest of the game is pretty solid, and the minor problems will be patched. Treyarch has always been good with releasing patches for their games.I wouldn't listen to most of the bad reviews. A lot of people think that their K/D ratios mean something, and are upset because they can barely get a 1.0 KDR(kill death ratio) in this game, when they had 3.0 KDRs in the past 2 COD games. Basically, your cheap tactics from MW3 don't carry over to this game haha. I had a friends that had a 2.75 KDR in MW3, and in black ops 2 he is under a 1.0 (he already said he hates this game after 3hrs of play). So to me the bad reviews are just sore losers who are upset that they are not at the top of the leaderboards anymore.This is the first COD game in years that I wasn't disappointed on release day. If you don't care about stats then you should definitely give this game a shot, it's fun, and worth it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2012"}

Make every second count; you only get one chance.  Stay Human.","reviewerName":"Drewz","summary":"Don't believe the negative reviews all over the net","reviewText":"When I picked up my Wii U on launch day, I was 99% positive I was going to cancel my ZombiU pre-order and just wait and see how reviews handled the game. I decided not to. I just had a feeling that I wasn't going to regret it.I was right.This game deserves a lot of respect. The developers definitely took some risks here. Survival horror just isn't popular anymore (unfortunately) and survival horror is exactly what this game is. Preparation is very important in ZombiU. Naturally, you can't always be prepared for every possible situation, but conserving ammo and trying to make the most of every medkit are two things that will definitely help your chances.You die relatively easy in this game, so running and gunning isn't a smart thing to do. You'll want to scan your surroundings (using the game pad) and tag any items you might be able to pick up (you can also tag undead, so they show up on your map). You'll want to use your radar (also used via the game pad) to be aware of any possible dangers that might lurk in the darkness. And, most importantly, you'll want to keep your eyes open.The attention to detail in this game is what truly shines (in my opinion). Menus fit the mood. Environments look demolished. The lighting is amazing. Weather adds an incredible atmosphere to the gameplay. I was thrilled to hear the deafening sound of heavy rain as it pounded the roof of the storage container I'd sought for shelter. Its little things like this that the developers did not have to spend time on, but did anyway. I even like how the voice guiding you through the game comes out of the game pad speakers and not the TV's. This makes it feel as though he's talking directly to you and not your survivor in-game.Combat is varied, depending on how you look at it. Even I wish that melee combat had a little more variety to it. You basically just bash zombies repeatedly with your cricket bat until the option to -- finish it off -- pops up on screen. Guns are as they should be, however. 1-2 bullets (even from a handgun) to the head will drop most undead. There are also barrels and tanks here and there that will explode or catch fire when shot. These containers aren't flashing or glossed over with an obvious hey-you-can-shoot-me-and-I-will-do-something texture, so you really have to keep an eye out for them. The game also has plenty of sub weapons (limited in quantity, of course) to find, such as grenades, mines, and molotovs.You can upgrade your weapons at any workbench you come across (there is a workbench in your safehouse, but you will also find others here and there). You can upgrade the power, capacity, firing speed, and spread of most of the weapons in the game. Upgrades are accomplished by bringing the required attachments (found throughout the game) back to a workbench where you simply attach them to whatever gun you wish. It's really that easy.Inventory is limited, so get ready to manage items. You can store excess stuff at your safe-house, which you can return to at set intervals using the sewer system (i.e. the game's fast-travel system). You can assign items to the game pad for quick-swapping, but in order to actually rummage through your pack, you have to keep one eye on the TV screen as the game does not actually pause while you are messing with your items on the game pad. The same with removing barricades from doors, picking locks, and opening new manhole covers. You need to keep an eye out for any undead on the TV that might decide to attack you while you're busy interacting with the prompts on your game pad.Survival means something in this game. When you die, you lose all the skills that your survivor had developed. You start fresh with a new survivor who has no skills. If you want the guy you've been playing as for the last 5 hours to keep his really sweet handgun skills, you'd better keep him alive. Skills are developed the more you use certain weapons. All weapons except the cricket bat have skills, I believe.If you ask me, I think those who hate this game do so simply because you aren't drowning in ammunition and healing items at all times. Games like Resident Evil have changed (for the worse) over the years and have basically turned survival horror into action. Don't get me wrong, I still like Resident Evil, but it's great to finally get to play an actual survival horror game again!I'm a huge fan of The Walking Dead TV series and I always enjoyed how they placed such a huge emphasis on not drawing needless attention to yourself, conserving ammo and supplies, and never leaping before you've looked. This game will treat you to a lot of the same.Why only the four star rating?-Unfortunately, the aiming is very float-y and takes some getting used to.-You cannot adjust horizontal and vertical analog sensitivities separately. I HATE this as just about every single FPS makes vertical too sensitive. By the time you wrestle vertical into a comfortable position, now horizontal is way too slow. This is why we should be able to adjust both X and Y separately!!!-The occasional bug/glitch does pop up. I've had my survivor's character model change even though I didn't die. One minute I am a man, the next I am a woman. But, if I go into my character's ID card, I'm still the man. I've even had a zombie's behavior glitch through a locked door in order to pull me down from a ladder that I had started climbing. Since the zombie itself wasn't actually glitching through the door, I couldn't kill it in order to prevent what was happening. My only option was to keep climbing the ladder over and over until I got lucky and managed to make it to the top without the glitch occuring. I never encountered a bug or glitch that broke the game, however.-The immersion is occasionally broken up by the fact that the story barely changes at all for new survivors (when you die). The game just continues on as though your experiences were (somehow) passed on to the next survivor. I understand it would have taken forever for the developers to craft a story that accommodates for this, but it still just causes the occasional hiccup in believability. Having to kill your previous -- and now infected survivor -- after you die is a nice twist on the gameplay, however. It at least makes retreiving all the items you had when you died make a lot more sense.Overall, I think most people will find that this game deserves a chance. Sure, not everyone is going to like it. Don't listen to sites like IGN and Game Informer when making your decision, though. ZombiU is not without it's flaws, but it's easily much better than those sites claim in their reviews. At the very least, try to borrow it from a friend who has purchased it. I am confident you won't be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

I've never seen anything look so good through my HDTV, and that's saying a lot.The game is fairly unique in that it's based off the last few hours of composer Frederic Chopin's life, in the hours he was unconscious and near death. While in this state, he enters a realm of high-fantasy that contrasts sharply from the dark and dreary surroundings of old timey France.Since this involves Chopin, the game revolves a lot around all things musical. Even the characters in your party are thusly named; Allegreto, Beat,Polka etc.The gameplay is just as unique, as depending on whether you sneak up on enemies from behind, from the right side, from the left, or head on, it makes a difference in the battle. Yeah, that's not so unique, but while in battle light and shadown play a big role. Some monsters are weaker or stronger depending on whether you fight them in the sunshine or lure them into the darkness. Monsters can also mutate into other forms depending on if they are in the light or shadow. Battles are sort of real time, when you start a meter starts counting down and you can attack until that meter runs out. Every time you hit an enemy, it fills some of that meter back up. So it's in your best interest to attack fast and furiously as it gives you more time to attack. There's also numerous ways to use \"Echo points\" in every battle which make your special attacks more powerful. There is one thing I didn't like about the combat, and that's the fact that your average run of the mill enemy is easy to somewhat easy to kill, but the boss battles, and there are many of them, are long and hard. I'm 3 hours into the game and have fought 4 or 5 boss monsters already, most of them nearly wiped out my party by the end, and the latest one I've tried 5 times and have yet to beat him. I'm sure he has some weakness I'm not exploiting, but it still seems a bit uneven compared to regular battles.The complaint about assigning items I didn't find a problem either. It reminded me of how you had to use items in a very limited space in Odin Sphere for the PS2. Once you get used to it, it becomes another strategic gameplay mechanic.Some have said that the story isn't up to par, and while you're in the fantasy world it is pretty cliche, but there's a lot, a TON of backstory and character development, so you get to know your party members fairly well, even early on.I'm quite surprised that over the last few months most places rated Blue Dragon higher than Eternal Sonata higher than Eternal Sonata. Blue Dragon is a great game, but I find Eternal Sonata a lot funner and more in-depth than Blue Dragon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Marshall David WahlstromHelgren","summary":"Mario Party 4","reviewText":"This game is amazing I only payed $15.00 for it though I had to pay $10.00 for the manuel since when I bought the game it didn't have a manuel.

First, they were all based on established franchises. Second, they might have been considered by some as \"kiddie\". Trauma Center: Under the Knife breaks those traditions. It's a bold step in the right direction for Atlus, the DS, and games in general.Understandably, some people might be turned off by the concept, thinking that it's a boring medical simulator. This is not so. Although you will operate on some \"real-life\" diseases, and the methods you use are grounded in reality, you'll spend most of the game fighting against a fictional, futuristic infection that takes many forms. The game designers obviously had a lot of fun with this; each operation is essentially a \"level\", and you'll find yourself doing all kinds of things, especially with all the different tools available. Although you will repeat a few surgeries, no two stages feel exactly alike; you definitely won't get bored.The basic gameplay is extremely tight and unforgiving. You need a steady hand, quick reflexes, and a lightning-fast brain to get through some of the harder operations, but it never feels unfair. Your success is based entirely on your skill, experience, and understanding of what needs to be done. Yet at the same time, it's just flat-out fun; the DS' unique abilities are used in so many different ways, and the sense of accomplishment is incredible.To keep you engrossed, the game also has a rather involved, gripping story with many interesting and fleshed-out characters. Even though it's told solely through text-based dialogue and static scenes, I actually found myself getting emotionally involved. For those who don't like the story, though, you have the option to skip right through the story segments to the gameplay.If you own a DS, there is really no reason not to pick up Trauma Center. Great gameplay, an exciting story, and a decently long, challenging quest (along with an addictive \"Challenge Mode\" where you can compete for better \"grades\" on operations) make for yet another excellent addition to the handheld's library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2005"}

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or fighting the good fight solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesSpecial Controller Included- Designed with input from the Capcom development team, the Wii Classic Controller Pro is included in this bundle.Hunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone. Hunt together with up to 4 players online or take on arena quests with 2-player split-screen action. In single player mode, you even have the ability to hunt with AI-controlled characters named ChaCha.Communicate Online- Because communication is key in coordinated huntsMonster Hunter Trisupports Wii Speak and text chat.Monsters with Unique Abilities and Attacks- Monsters have unique and dynamic personalities, abilities and defenses, increasing in complexity as the player progresses. They camouflage themselves to ambush hunters, but will flee or call for help if outmatched.Immense Living, Breathing World with Ecosystem- Monsters interact amongst each other in a living breathing ecosystem, complete with food chain. Monsters have stamina, migrate and even attack one another, the strong feeding on the weak.New Underwater Maps- For the first time ever in anyMonster Huntergame, you will be able explore land and sea and hunt monsters of the deep.Fully Customizable Equipment- With ten weapon categories &ndash; including the all-new Switch Axe &ndash; and new armor and weaponry created from the remains of slain monsters, there are almost limitless opportunities for equipment customization.Choice of Controls- Play with either the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, with the Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.Take Your Character with You- The ability to save your character to your Wii Remote lets you engage in multiplayer hunts anytime on a friend's console.","reviewerName":"Gameboy \"David\"","summary":"Good but could be better","reviewText":"Recently, I acquired the bundle with the classic controller (highly recommended for PSP MH veterans b/c the control scheme is the same).  I have many many hours invested in the Monster Hunter series on the PSP and some on the PS2.  So i'm a veteran you could say.At first, I was disappointed with the Wii version.  I stuck with it though and found it to be quite fun, although watered down from the PSP versions IMO.It also seems to be pretty easy compared to the handheld versions of MH.  I never lost a quest all the way up to and including the final offline boss monster.  That's not necessarily a bad thing though! lol It's nice not to get all frustrated trying to find out how to defeat a monster for a change because they were freakin hard and hit like a dang tank on steroids. lol  Tri, to me, is a somewhat easy and enjoyable MH experience.The monster, armor, weapon, and skills lists are pretty short but still cool.  Having finished the offline mode, I have ventured into online and am working my way up.  Online is where you will access high rank as you rank up and find some new monsters not in offline mode.  Of course with new monsters, will more than likely come new weapons, armor, etc.It also appears that you will at some point require the help of others to complete certain quests.  I am typically a solo player and was able to pretty much beat Freedom 2 and Unite on my own with very little help both online and offline, but Tri seems like it may be another story requiring me to enlist aid to reach high rank due to the urgent quest needed to get to high rank.  I have tried out hunting with others online and so far it's pretty fun with Tri, although some hunters seriously need some manners before hunting with others! Sometimes it can be a hunter free-for-all! I'm like, \"look at these guys smacking each other and hogging all the items in the box!\" lol Be prepared to bring all items you need ahead of time and just get a map from the box since they can only take one. =)  But it's all fun and we all get better the more we play.  We learn through experience and Tri online seems like it will be good for that and has many quests available.The new Switch-Axe:  not impressed.  It looks really cool and I was eager to try it out, but once I did, I went back to the standard weapons namely the Great Sword, Hammer, and Longsword.  I may give SAs another try later on...maybe but don't hold your breath.My one real beef with Tri, other than I hate the way the farm is now (you can't do your own gathering and farming...you have these cats do it for you and there is no mining on the farm whatsoever), is that they took out the bows.  I loved the bows.  They were really cool and fun to use.  They need to bring them back.  Well, at least they left me the hammers. lol  Hammers are awesome to use in Tri as well. =)To sum up, if you are a veteran of the PSP series of MH or if you are interested in trying out this kind of game and don't mind investing the time required to get anywhere, buy it and enjoy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2011"}

I'll admit, it's not without its' flaws(collision detection, choppiness) but there's not enough of it to take away from the whole gameplay experience. Blood Omen 2 is a brilliantly thought out game, one well worth the experience of playing though. I think the thing I loved most about it was the thrill of the fight. About halfway through the game, those guys you go up against get harder to beat. So, when you do beat them, you feel like you've accomplished something. You owe it to yourself to check out this game.

It's beautiful, but it's flawed.Graphically- it's what they promised. Gorgeous. The drab and dark (and largely grey) environments are suitable to taste, but technically there are very, very few places you'd not be impressed. Sound is great, level design is also largely without fault.The game however, falls apart IMO because the controls are HORRIBLE. There are 6 different settings, but NONE of them feel right. There's a lag or sluggish feeling when you're playing normally, and a jerky TOO sensetive sensation when you zoom in. And there's no setting for one vs. the other- it's all the way or nonthing. I played the entire game and it never felt comfortable from start to finish.In the end- it's a great FPS- nothing \"new\" or \"revolutionary\" but still very good from all aspects on screen or speaker... but the issue of control is a MONSTER issue for me and that brings the score down a LOT.

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement.

Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"\"As close as you can get to the ring without going through the ropes\".","reviewText":"+ Pros:+ Easy controls and compatible with the Wii Fit board.+ Practice Mode for veteran and novice players.+ 13 Punch Out!! opponents, both old and new.+ Unlockable challenges for each opponent.+ First game in the series to offer 2-player mode.- Cons:- Wii Fit board not available in two-player mode.- Sore arms from playing too much!Back in 1984, Nintendo claimed their Punch Out!! arcade game was so realistic; it was \"As close as you can get to the ring without going through the ropes\".25 years later, this game has a new life on the Nintendo Wii and is one step closer to making good on that claim.You play the role of Little Mac - a young up-and-coming boxer from the Bronx who's ready to take on anyone he steps in the ring with. The goal is pretty simple: KO or TKO your opponent and move up the ladder until you face Mr. Sandman. Each boxer you face has different strengths and weaknesses, and once you learn to counteract their attacks and use your Star Punches to bring them to the canvas, the sky's the limit.The controls are fairly simple. One style of playing requires holding the Wiimote sideways and the directional pad is used for ducking and blocking while the buttons are used for punching.But that's not nearly as fun as the other way to play, in my humble opinion.If you have a Wii Balance Board from the Wii Fit, that can be used for your ducking and dodging. The Wiimote and Nunchuck serve as your right and left hand motions, so when you jab, dodge or uppercut in the game, you're doing it for real!The exhibition mode of the game provides a sigh of relief for new players and veterans alike. You can practice against holographic versions of your opponent without fear of your record being tarnished, and once you learn how to defeat them, simply go back to career mode and take them on for real. This is a GREAT way to introduce new players into the Punch Out!! universe.One of the main reasons Punch Out!! stands out is because of the hilarious characters. Nintendo has done a great job keeping the characters we love (Glass Joe, will you ever win more than once?) and eliminating the ones we didn't care for (what were they thinking with Hoy Quarlow???). I still miss Kid Quick - but that's just me.Now you might think there's nothing left to do after beating each boxer and completing the World Circuit, right?WRONG.There are 3 challenges for each of your opponents - for example, Glass Joe's challenges are:Knock Glass Joe down 3 times and let him win by decision.Find the one-punch-knockdown weak spot.Win the fight without dodging, ducking, or blocking a punch.There's also other fight modes with tougher versions of your opponents!Now in the past, watching Punch Out!! was the only way our friends could participate, but not anymore...our family & friends can pick up their Wiimote and play right along with us!Overall, I absolutely LOVE to play this game, and I can't help but chuckle when I watch other people play it. I was a little sad that the Wii Fit board couldn't be used in dual-player mode, but that's a small negative that gets outweighed by a LOT of positives.If you've got the Wii Fit board, there's no time to waste...get your pink jogging suit on and start training with Doc Louis!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E6NE","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Bioshock Infinitely Overrated","reviewText":"Working down my backlog of games I finally had the chance to play and beat Bioshock Infinite. As a big fan of the first two games I wasn't quite sure what to expect with Infinite. While the game was in development I had the chance to read a few articles and see a few early pictures of the development of the game. Having finished the game I can definitively say that Bioshock Infinite is... just okay. In trying to create something different enough to be called new yet similar enough to be called Bioshock, Irrational Games, the development studio behind the series, has created a strange in-between game that comes off as considerably less charming and less engaging that previous Bioshock titles.---------------------STORY:You are Booker Dewitt, a veteran of the US Army and the battle of Wounded Knee, and a former employee of the infamous Pinkerton Detective Agency. Your charge is to infiltrate the sky-city of Columbia and retrieve a girl named Elizabeth. All the information you're given is that you have a debt and by retrieving the girl the debt will be paid. What unfolds after Booker enters Columbia is an interesting story that follows many of the same lines as the original Bioshock title.The leader of Columbia, a man named Comstock is a god-like figure that Columbians' refer to simply as, \"the prophet\". Comstock's persona is represented in almost every aspect of life in Columbia, from larger-than-life statues scattered about to entire floating-islands dedicated to his life. Clearly this is a cult of personality. Comstock is similar to Andrew Ryan in that both reject the meddling of the United States for similar reasons and set about creating their own utopian society that goes horribly wrong.---------------------GRAPHICSThe graphics are again very similar to Bioshock. Character models and the look and feel of everything from buildings to art style are almost identical to that of the original titles. The major change of course is the setting. Columbia floats high above the land and seas below. The graphics are a mixed bag, however. Outside areas (and there are many) in Columbia take on an almost blinding sheen. Everything outside is annoyingly bright and blurred giving the graphics a very soft almost dream-like state. Perhaps that is intentional but I found it extremely annoying. Interior areas are better and feature excellent use of lighting to lend the environments different characteristics. The first area you encounter after you enter Columbia, a temple-like setting where new citizens of Columbia are baptized are excellent examples of the lighting effects as daylight pours through different colored stained glass lending a somber, meditative state to the level.The other obvious complaint with the graphics is that the original Bioshock was released in 2007 and little has changed.---------------------GAMEPLAY:Gameplay in Infinite is, as you'd imagine, very similar to the previous Bioshock titles. This is a first person shooter with the added benefit of magic-like powers. Except know the powers are known as \"vigors\" instead of plasmids. Vigors are pretty much exactly like plasmids with few cursory changes. Instead of injecting vigors you drink them. Vigors use \"salt\" and salt can be replenished by drinking salts scattered around the game, buying them outright from vending machines or acquiring `gear' that imparts salts when certain criteria is met.As Booker you're allocated four-slots to equip `gear' which is a not so clever way of granting passive abilities to the player. For example some gear might impart a bonus for melee attacks that lights enemies on fire or another piece of gear might increase your weapon accuracy while riding sky-lines.The single biggest change is the addition of Elizabeth who after you rescue is a NPC that accompanies you on your journey through Columbia. Really when all of the other tweaks and setting change is boiled away, Infinite is about Elizabeth. Happily she is a contributing member of your part and she is essentially invulnerable. She takes care of herself, hides during battles and even scouts out the surrounding area to provide Booker ammunition, health, and money. Elizabeth plays a central role in the story and has the ability to open tears which are essentially windows into parallel universes. Her power comes especially handy in the heat of battle where Elizabeth can open a tear to provide you with health items or ammo or even a friendly sentry gun.All told your adventure through Bioshock Infinite will probably take around a dozen hours. There are 51 trophies all told and all of them are offline.---------------------THE GOOD:(+) The story is generally good though things can get confusing especially toward the end(+) Graphics are a mixed bag - interior areas retain the same moody atmospherics that were so prevalent in the original Bioshock titles(+) Elizabeth; she is a contributor more than a drain and constant source of frustration (a la Resident Evil 4) more NPCs should be modeled after her---------------------THE BAD:(-) Graphics frequently appear white-washed and blurry particularly in outdoor areas(-) Same basic graphics as the 2007-released Bioshock, in other words the engine is dated(-) Very little has changed besides the setting; other changes (e.g. vigors) are simply renamed properties from previous Bioshock games(-) The story has plenty of plot holes and contradictions---------------------CONCLUSION:Bioshock Infinite is a good enough game that I recommend purchasing it especially at the reduced price it's selling for currently. However, that doesn't diminish the fact that this is essentially the same game that was released 6 years ago with a different setting. Hopefully the inevitable sequel in the Bioshock franchise on next-gen systems is a bit more thought out and developed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2013"}

I have this game on the 360 and it was such a mind blowing experience i went out and got it for my PS3.  My character is a Female Battlemage.  Your destiny is based on the style of gameplay and how you choose to level up.  In Skyrim there are Reckless Mages but in Amalur the Mages are Deliberate.  Did i say the Mages can Fly around and re-spawn?  I found myself caught in a battle with 2 mages and 4 warrior soldiers.  Before i could even get one hit in i was torn apart with a flurry of Magic and weapon attacks.  They hit me with fireballs, lighting bolts/balls and something that looks like mini tornadoes.  The warriors all had great swords that stun locked me and once you are stun locked the Mages will have a field day.  My Primary weapon is a Lightning Longsword laced with fire and poison.  My secondary weapon is the Septer that deal out Ice and freezing magic.  I also like the Daggers and the Charmars or those Disc you throw.The world is not as large or spectacular as Skyrim but what it lacks in visuals it more than make up for it in COMBAT.  Each battle and enemy is unique.  The fights with the giant TROLLS are SICK.  You must learn to use the world to your advantage in order to fight these GIANTS.  They have a HOMING charging attack that will hit you 95% of the time so you must be quick with your rolls or you will die.  Did i mention the spiders that will gang up on you and spit out poison and webs?  Did i mention the female characters are very SEXY...GEEEZ???It has a cartoonish feel to it but the style of the game itself will satisfy any gamer thats into ACTION/ADVENTURE/RPG style of games.

{"product_name":"B007A7UJ4S","description":"","reviewerName":"M.D.C. \"Tempting Reviews\"","summary":"What Blue Dragon should have been.","reviewText":"I'm finally reviewing Ni No Kuni even though I stopped playing the game months ago.Short and sweet:  Ni No Kuni suffered the same ignominious fate as so many other games I played, including Tales of Graces: They start out with an incredible story and fun battle system, but as the game progresses it's like they fired the story writer and just winged it throughout.If you didn't know, the story begins with the simple premise that your mother has died and a fairy from another realm has offered you a way to possibly bring her back (operative word: &#34;possibly&#34;).  You get a magic wand, and you have to become a wizard.  This sounds fantastic on paper and the cutscenes are simply awesome.  As you go through the game you'll bounce between the other realm and your home town, and it feels like an offshoot of Earthbound, but for one issue: it gets boring, real fast.  Part of that isn't the game's fault.So your primary goal is to get the most powerful wand and restore the spells in your spellbook.  Simple enough, right?  You'll get the strongest wand after a while of gameplay, and in truth you'll get a lot of spells.  Problem is maybe 80% aren't usable.  Many say, &#34;yeah, it's just to fill up the book&#34; but some of them read as though they would have been great fun parts of the game: turning into a cat, duplicating yourself, etc.  Not used.  Very disappointing, especially given the level of effort necessary to collect all of these spells.The other issue is the same issue that plagues a lot of Square Enix games: the side quests.  I'm ok with side quests as long as they don't become tedious.  In Ni No Kuni they start out ok, but slowly descend into tedium.  Things like finding monsters is fine, but when you have to sing to them to capture them, it gets to be a headache, especially when your characters can still kill the enemy, ruining your shot at capture, forcing you to franticly pound the button to get to the sing command.  One such quest involved capturing a creature in a desert that simply would not convert no matter how many times I fought it, so I moved on.  After I went back online to find out what the deal was, apparently the theory is that I wasn't hitting him hard enough.  Err?  That's called artificial difficulty, and it annoys me greatly.Finally, there are people in your home town who are actually opposites of people (or creatures) in the other world.  These opposites get possessed and when you find them, you need to drive the demon out.  This in itself isn't a problem, except that their difficulty ramps severely after the second one.  To the point you question whether you're truly supposed to win the fight.  I can't count how many times the boy was the only one left alive, forced to run around and dodge attacks and self heal until I could sneak in an attack.  This is a sharp contrast to the first boss battle of the demo, where you fight a beast in a forest, flawlessly executing hits, collecting a gold orb and unleashing major damage.  The orbs still come, but when you execute the move, it barely harms the enemy.It was this progression, and the fact there was much more to do, that caused me to just stop playing, which is unfortunate.  That, and the severe lack of cutscenes after you're a few hours in.  Same thing happened with Tales of Graces, same thing happened with Eternal Sonata.  To date, Star Ocean 4 is the only 360/PS3 RPG I've finished through and through, and the only one to &#34;get it right&#34;.It might seem like I disliked the game.  I didn't.  But it couldn't keep me engaged.  I hope some of the newer ones in September will do a better job.  It's definitely worth a play, as if you like sidequests you will love this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2013"}

The biggest is sometimes trying to be careful to differentiate between enemies and friendlies as on some levels the enemies looked pretty similar to the friendlies and if you shoot a friendly you hat to replay from that save point which was annoying especially when you're in a firefight with multiple enemies being shot at and sometimes you shoot at the first person you think is the enemy but after getting the message find out they were friendlies.

Siddiqui","summary":"Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon maintains the same charming formula that made the first game a success.","reviewText":"Back in 2002 Luigi was given a second chance to star in his own adventure called Luigi's Mansion, and although it was a short journey it won the hearts of critics and fans. Now ten years later Luigi is summoned once again by the intelligent Professor E. Gadd to once again dawn his trusty flashlight and the new Poltergust 5000 to star in his newest adventure, Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. With a lengthy adventure, that easily surpasses the predecessor, combined with some humorous comedic situations and an elegantly crafted world timing with intricate puzzles Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is an excellent reason to purchase a Nintendo 3DS.Professor E. Gadd has spent his life researching paranormal activity, but when a mystical dark moon disappears from the sky of Evershade Valley, his ghostly allies turn hostile. In order to restore order Elvin Gadd contacts his friend Luigi, who is comfortably sleeping in his chair, to collect the shattered pieces of the artifact. Although the Professor can spark a few laughs the true humor of the game comes from the wacky animations: Luigi getting thrown into the wall by traps that open hidden areas; peering through crack in the wall and seeing ghosts gleefully performing misdeeds. These concepts are complemented by the superb sound design and soundtrack, adding more favor to the silly events as Luigi hums with the spooky music.The atmosphere of Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is its greatest accomplishment. The perfect combination of spookiness and child-like wonders adds charm to each of the well-designed capacious area. Suits of armor line the hallways waiting for unexpected trespassers and flashes of light cast shadows when shined in front of an object. Turning on 3D the effect allows for excellent depth-of-field in certain parts of the game, especially when the camera zooms out. Each mansion is saturated with large rooms littered with secrets that include traps, treasure, and hidden ghosts. The various safes, vents, plants, and other strange contraptions release bundles of coins, notes, and gold blocks that make interacting with every piece of the environment time well-spent.However, exploring the mansions can be difficult since the mission structure follows a specific path and encourages you to follow it. The helpful map on the bottom screen ensures you don't get lost, but it would be nice if you were given more freedom. Each mission is divided into levels and Luigi is transported between them using a transporter called the Pixelshifter, which warps Luigi from one location after being converted in tiny blocks and then put back together. Although Professor Gadd constantly calls Luigi on his Dual Scream (a clever take on the original Nintendo DS) to inform him of his current progress and give him instructions for the set objective, it seems unnecessary to inform the player of everything they do. It becomes a vexing inconvenience after the first level.Luigi has access to two tools to take the supernatural: his flashlight, whichcontains a dark-light attachment that reveals illusions, ghosts, and hidden objects, as well as his Poltergust 5000 vacuum. These are the only tools required to solve the many puzzles within each mansion and are properly equipped to handle any combat situation. By exposing the hearts of the ghost using his flashlight Luigi initiates a tug-of-war between the creatures and then suck them into his vacuum after draining all the health of his target, a power meter also appears that if charged can do a massive amount of damage for quicker battles. Missions all require a combination of catching ghosts and solving puzzles, ending with a boss fight that requires a combination of both. Anything in the environment can be important to your task, requiring careful observation and use of your dark-light. The puzzles are varied and rarely repeat the same pattern, offering new challenges as you progress through the game. Although Professor Gadd points you in the right direction, finding the solution to each problems is tricky but rewarding once you do.Multiplayer is the most shocking addition to Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon called ScareScraper. Up to 4 players are sent into a random mansion and take control of different color variations of Luigi to clear each floor all the ghostly inhabitants, locating invisible ghost-dogs or racing to find a hidden hatch to the next area. Whether playing online,  local or download play, teamwork is essential to pass through each level and defeat the bosses, but it's clear that these modes were made to accompany 4-player cooperative play and taking on the multiplayer mode with less players can lead to frustration.Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is a wonderful sequel. It allows Luigi a chance at the spotlight once again and show gamers that he can be just as entertaining as Mario. A fickle difficulty curve and a poor checkpoint system can lead to annoying situations but these are mostly minor concerns. Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon maintains the same charming formula that made the first game a success and returning to Luigi's newest ghost catching adventure is definitely worth taking.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2013"}

Boeshaar","summary":"This would be a good game.. if it was released in 2004.","reviewText":"If this was released 5-6 years ago, it would've been one of the better shooters out there, but in 2010 it fails.- Singleplayer is yet again a ridiculously short and quick experience, which seems to be the trend these days with FPS games (put as little effort into singleplayer as possible because multiplayer is the selling point).- 2 different engines in singleplayer and multiplayer means you can do stuff you can't do in the other mode. This includes stuff like PRONE in multiplayer, when is the last time you saw a soldier unable to prone, no lean either, everything being dumb downed to be console and kiddy friendly.- The selection of weapons is WOEFULLY limited, and they all function almost exactly the same, very similar generic recoil and damage capabilities. Little to no point of switching from your default weapons except for perhaps the sniper classes.- Almost 0 customization, no perks, limited weapons, can't choose streaks or anything else.- All the maps start to blend in together to look exactly the same, they are all Afghan looking deserts with generic buildings and rocks, yay.- All the streaks are awful and look identical. The defensive streaks you just press a button on a walkie-talkie and it activates, with the offensive streaks you use a pair of binoculars and explosions happen, YAY. How is this crap supposed to compare with Call of Duty when it has streaks like an AC-130 or Apache helicopter which look 500 times better.- Multiplayer is a campfest, I spent the last 3 games hiding in a corner with a sniper rifle picking off people, using the streaks, and ending up with a score of 15-0. Why do I play like this? Because if I actually run out and do stuff I will get shot by the 500 snipers camping in every corner. By the way, when you die they don't tell you how you died or from where, you just die and respawn.- Spawning is AWFUL. You can't choose where you want to spawn and chances are you will spawn near an enemy who will shoot you or rocket strike the minute you spawn. There are also no delays in spawning by default, you die you respawn instantly. So much for flanking and tactics.- Hit detection is a joke. Expect to die behind walls and crates when you're taking cover by laggy bullet and hit detection.- Only saving grace of this game is that the single player is SOMEWHAT ENJOYABLE through the first play through, but that's IT.- You know honestly this game would be x100 better if it was $20, then everyone can buy it and enjoy it for a while. But it cost's $60, the price of a console game and it isn't worth it. It just isn't even nearly worth it.I understand if you dislike Modern Warfare 2's twitchy and Hollywood style gameplay and would rather have something more realistic, but how can you defend this game? There are a million other shooters out there that do this better, including DICE's very own Battlefield Bad Company 2? How? Do yourself a favor and buy Medal of Honor Allied Assault or Call of Duty 2, both games which came out 5-6 years ago, and see which is better. I guarantee you will enjoy the older games a lot more than this overhyped and overpriced piece of garbage.EA could have had a much better game if they didn't rush this game and try so hard NOT to be MW2.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2010"}

Perks and weapons can be unlocked out of level order with skill points, but perks are also eventually unlocked at levels. The different strike packages are tailored not only to player's ability but game play preference. Dropping secondary weapons and tactical and lethal gadgets grants extra perk slots, which is more in line with what Black Ops II did. At the core, however, multiplayer gameplay is the same.

Having defeated 7 of the 16 colossi, I am still waiting to be drawn into this vast storyline I keep hearing about.Ahem, but I get ahead of myself. \"Shadow of the Colossus\" is certainly unlike most games I've ever played. You start as a...man (boy?) who is trying to resurrect a...woman (girl?). You journey to a forbidden land to speak with the Dormir (dormir is Latin for \"sleep\", by the way), who are...spirits(?) who can raise the dead. They propose a challenge - defeat 16 colossi roaming the land, in order to destory 16 idols in a vacant temple. And thus, your story begins. And...that's pretty much it, to this point. Each time you defeat a colossus, you return and hear...that you need to defeat another colossus. That's REALLY it (other than some poorly translated stuff at the beginning, said by some witch doctor, or possibly Majora's Mask).Let's begin with the good. \"Shadow\" has some of the best graphics ever to grace the PS2. In fact, they're a little TOO good - the PS2 can hardly handle the graphics stuffed into this one, and often skips some animation. This is a minor flaw, however, and the countryside is both vast and lush, with green forests, blue lakes, excellent shading for light and dark, etc. If you want to get a good idea of how great these graphics are, you need only observe the fine detail of your horse's tail. I mean, these graphics are incredible (for the PS2).As far as ideas go, this game has a good one. Rather than bore the player with the tedium of mindless monster encounters which do little but tire your thumbs and fingers, there are exactly 16 enemies in the game (not counting the optional lizards, which can't really be called enemies, anyway). And each battle is epic - the colossi each have weak points to be exploited, but it's up to the player to figure out how. Much of the time, a player will have to climb a colossus (who generally have fur/moss to grip) and stab it, but getting there is all the challenge. I love the battles in theory...However, in execution, there are numerous problems. The first is the horrible camera. Rarely does it move where you want. And while one CAN lock onto a colossus, I have found that often, it is detrimental to the player's chance of defeating the titan. Also, the character's running motion is incredibly awkward - one cannot easily run away from a colossus, out of the screen. This makes battles that SHOULD be easier much more complicated (although I haven't found any yet that are particularly challenging).Controls are gummy, particularly when controlling the horse.  Climbing colossi is more difficult than it should be because the character often gets hung up (you try to move sideways, but he wants to go up). The horse is a nightmare all around - his speed is controlled by spurring, but it is erratic, and he always slows even in a slight turn. This makes overworld travel rather painful.And that's a problem, too - while no overworld enemies saves a player from the boredom of fighting 100 green slimes, it unfortunately adds to the frustration when a colossus cannot be found. Riding on the horse will fray the nerves of many, and you'll be doing it a lot.The music? Not bad, but nothing special. And even if it WAS great, it is so sparse as to be forgettable despite its greatness. You will get music while fighting colossi (and it is helpful - a change in music usually means you're on the right path to defeating the giant), and a small theme each time you enter a colossus' realm, but that's it.And we end where we began. I have no doubt that this game has a great story - somewhere. Unfortunately, it has developed so slowly that most will give up before they see the payoff. I'll stick with it, because I enjoy the colossus battles, but it isn't surprising that some people don't see what the hub-bub is about. I surely don't...at the moment.All in all, an intriguing idea mixed with good gameplay, great graphics, mediocre control and zero story (at least through 7 colossi), and you pretty much have a dud.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2007"}

Worst of all, an ages-old conspiracy bent on world domination has decided that the time is right to emerge from the shadows and take control. No one believes the conspiracy exists--no one but you.In this thrilling role-playing adventure, you play the part of J.C. Denton, a powerful, nanotechnologically augmented antiterrorist agent. It's up to you to stop the conspirators from achieving their goals. But this world is full of lies and betrayal, a world where nothing is as it seems and entire nations can seemingly be turned against you at the push of a button. To succeed, you must travel the globe in a quest for knowledge, develop your character's nanotech augmentations and strengths as you see fit, build a network of allies to assist you, and determine when stealth and strategy are more important than action.

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M. PadillaPros:One of the best and most complex stories in gamingOutstanding graphics with many interactive elementsExcellent soundtrack and voice actingCons:Long periods of watching instead of playingSome extraneous dialogueSolid Snake may inspire gamers to grow mullets","reviewerName":"Nick Schwartz","summary":"Classic Gameplay - Suffering Story","reviewText":"&lt;Spoilers> I love Metal Gear Solid 2.  The gorgeous graphics, the interactive environments; but most of all the gameplay.  Sons of Liberty improves upon the gameplay of the original in every way.  Control feels more responsive, and there is an abundance of new moves: Hanging from ledges, peeking out to fire weapons from behind walls, rolls...  But most importantly the ability to shoot while in first-person perspective.  Sure, in the first Metal Gear Solid you could look around in first-person mode, but now you can fire while in it too, which allows you to take out enemies from a distance.  Add in new weapons, new characters (and returning ones), and you've got one hell of a good game.You won't actually be playing that often though.  Cinemas between ten and fifteen minutes in length are rather common, and break up the gameplay.  Which, in my opinion is generally fine, because they flesh out the story.  In a game like the original Metal Gear Solid, the cinematics were my favorite feature.  And while they are certainly impressive looking in Sons of Liberty, the story is seriously disappointing.Some magazines attacked the story for making absolutely no sense.  I disagree.  It is difficult to follow, but you should be able to understand most everything about it, especially if you play throuhg multiple times and/or have played the original Metal Gear Solid.  The real trouble with the story is that it gets too caught up in trying to surprise the audience.  The plot does so many U-Turns in the last twenty minutes of the game it just seems rather ridiculous.  Plus, most of the complications ad plot twists are way to far-fetched to believe.  And that was one of the things that truly immersed gamers in the original Metal Gear Solid.  A great, believable plot.Still, with it's shortcomings - and the plot is the only one I can think of, aside from broken up gameplay - Metal Gear Solid 2 is a remarkable achievement for videogaming, both technically, and because it bridged the gap between videogaming and other forms of respectable entertainment even more.At the very least rent it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2003"}

I do like to try out games in other genre, and Devil May Cry has certainly been the recipient of much critical (and enthusiast acclaim).  With the price being as attractive as it is I decided that this would be my semi-annual dip into the world of compulsive destruction.The story is straightforward.  Girl drives into occult detective's office, stabs him with his own sword, then asks for his help in fighting the underworld.  It seems that a BIG evil is planning to take over the earth and has set up shop in a castle on Malay Island.  Dante, by the way, is the son of the demon knight who originally defeated this particular BIG evil.  So revenge is also on the menu.What ensues is a mad dash through a gothic nightmare that augments normal castle architecture with jungles, ships, airplanes, outer space, and, of course, hell. [I guess the story wasn't so straightforward after all]  All of this is an excuse for some of the most detailed graphics that I have ever seen.The animation is of such high quality that you can't always tell where a cut scene ends and the action starts again.  And, lest I forget, an array of weapons, gadgets, and puzzles that kept me busy from start to finish.  Very little was spared in making this a spectacular playing experience.My only complaints aren't about the game, but my own mediocre skills.  While I'm not exactly arthritic, my ability to deftly poke and stroke my controller is substandard.  And Devil May Cry is a game that requires both pinpoint accuracy and good timing.

BF4 my body is ready.","reviewText":"Getting ready for Battlefield 4 my playing Battlefield 3 things I've learned and I am a Call of Duty gamer. If you are on PS3 and have PSN+ You can get it for free at the time of writing this review.First on writing Battlefield 3 is more immersive than the Call of Duty franchise. The levels are amazing the first time I saw a building get blown apart in battlefield I was floored (literally I was crushed by the floor) and it was awesome. Now I know Call of Duty Ghosts is going to have \"destructible environments\" but it will not be on the same level as the Battlefield series. It needs to be seen to be believed. Next is the audio in battlefield it sounds like you're on a Warfield is top-notch and super immersive.If you're a Call of Duty gamer want to get into Battlefield 4 by picking up Battlefield 3 I think that's a good idea. One thing you have to learn about the suppression it's totally unique to battlefield. Basically suppression is a blurriness on your screen that comes from enemies shooting bullets near your location. For the longest time I thought I was taking damage but suppression merely screws with your aim and recoil.If you need a battlefield and looking to level up quickly I would recommend running the assault class and the defibrillator you get 100 point XP for each revive and it totally helps your team. It's a great way to make a ton of XP and level up your character rather quickly. And I think the same will hold true for Battlefield 4.Another thing if you're new to the series you are able to choose servers to play on even on console. And I would recommend playing Metro Rush 500 tickets the games last for an hour plus but you will make so many experience points is a great way to level up.All in all I'm excited for Battlefield 4 I think it's really going to raise the bar especially on the next Gen consoles. I will be getting it for my PlayStation 4.Thanks for readingPS if you're playing during a double experience points weekend (yes they still have them) and if you're playing in a long game make sure you stay till the end of the match because you get double experience for all the time you spent in the game. I played a game that lasted more than an hour and I made 15 to 20,000 experience points as a bonus if I quit out of the game early I would've missed out on that.

{"product_name":"B002I0J9M0","description":"","reviewerName":"Chip L \"chip1978\"","summary":"Unique experience","reviewText":"This is a puzzle game that plays like a first person shooter. For anyone not already familiar with the gameplay, you lay down portals with a gun. That deceptively simple gameplay is good for hours of entertainment. The game does a good job of introducing you to concepts (e.g. redirecting a laser beam with portals to activate a switch) then it builds on the previous lessons to make increasingly complex and difficult \"test chambers.\"The single player and multiplayer modes are about four or five hours each. Playing with a friend is actually harder than the singleplayer experience, but it never gets maddeningly frustrating. All the test chambers are just right in terms of difficulty.While the protagonist in both single and multi-player are mute, the supporting cast is brilliantly voice acted, (especially in the single player story). The multiplayer story is a little weaker than the single player; but [spoiler] both have equally confusing endings [end spoilers].Overall, this game was a nice break from the usual shooters. It's also a puzzle game that is so unlike any other it really stands alone. You can rent this game and beat it; but you'll probably want to pick it up and play again after you're done because it is so compelling. I'd suggest buying this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0016NRS8M","reviewerName":"Tstops","summary":"A dated and plagued game and end to a franchise","reviewText":"I love open world RPGs. I've played the gothic series, elder scrolls, dragons dogma, reckoning etc....and liked them all in some kind of way.  gothic had a dark and cruel world that made you start with a stick and a hut.  you really had to prove your worth to certain factions and it gave you a real sense of accomplishment if you could pull it off. Skyrim has a lush and beautiful world with amazing visuals and tight controls for combat that had you saying \"more more\". Dragons dogma had ground breaking deep combat never seen it an open world rpg that we've never seen before. What does two worlds two have? Not....much.It does have: bad controls, bad camera angles, crumby graphics, awful voice acting, weak story line, unbalanced questing, cumbersome inventory with a poor excuse for an interface and worst of all a combat system that will have you saying \"what in the....\"  Over and over.The controls are the biggest problem with me because bad controls make for bad combat( at least on the console versions). The controls are just cumbersome and unresponsive. I can never do what I want to do. They had the right idea with mapping your abilities with x y b a but that's not the problem. The problem is, they thought it smart to make the sneak button the same as the run button.  jump is also the action button such as mounting a horse or opening a chest or character interaction etc... That makes for sloppy and awkward gameplay. ie I meant to sneak up on this guy but I ran right at him or I'm trying to talk to this dude but I keep jumping around him instead. WHY!?? This will cause you to shout obscenities you never thought possible and have your wife laughing at you(ok that was just me but you get the picture). And don't get me started on mounting a horse OH MY GOD! I mountin a horse in this game is like trying to give a girl a Cheerio as an engagement ring....it just doesn't work. In fact I can't think of one time I mounted my horse without incidents of jumping around it first.  Riding the horse is just as messed up. The trigger buttons make the horse go and stop. Any one who played skyrim red dead redemption or assassins will want to kill every horse they ride. It's so awkward.  The developers also thought it would be a really radical idea to put obstacles like fences and barrels in the middle of the roads you have to jump over. Surrreee, that sounds cool but the game is so random with the timing of the jumps that your lucky if you make it. I think it has something to do how bad the collision detection is in this game.This problem migrates into combat, which at first I liked until the horrible hit detection and unresponsive controls lurked its way into the combat. Switching weapons is as easy trying to round house chuck Norris. Just mash up on the d-pad a few times eventually it'll happen. Need to drink a potion mid-combat? No problem, just mash your right bumper a few hundred times till your dingus character feels like drinking it.And the worse part of combat is starting it. The game feels the need for you to draw your weapon.  I know sounds easy enough (skyrim did it, gothic did) however............ You have to press down on the d-pad again sounds easy right?  Well remember how I said its like trying to round house chuck Norris??  It's worse. You have to be standing perfectly still to draw your weapon problem is, if you get ambushed you natural instinct is to run and reposition yourself so drawing your weapon In combat is like try to round house the entire cast of the expendables........2.  It's just bad. I'm constantly fighting the controls in this game. Every step along the journey. Which had forced me to suspend gameplay.That's right.  No, I haven't beaten it yet. I will get back into it though,I always beat the games I get.As far as your character and story goes. It's sucks. I really can't think of anything else to say except that your character is extremely unlikable and a cheeseball voice acter,he just sucks.There aren't many pros to this game but it does have a really cool magic system.The spells are 100% costumized and you can create some really cool spells. This system is something I hope more games in the genre start to copy cat. Look some up on YouTube it's really cool.I gave it 2 stars because it has a lot of content which is good and the magic system is really original and ground breaking. Other than that. This game is a puke magnet.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2013"}

Kallister","summary":"Comics Live!","reviewText":"A friend of mine bought this game a few months ago, and one night while over at his place, he decided to show it to me.  He said he'd picked it up for cheap somewhere, and was just raving about it.  At first, it looked really cheesy and kind of lame, but later I found out that Freedom Force is actually one of the most fun games I've played recently.The actual storyline is really cheesy, but no more than the stories from the Golden Age of comic books.  At one time or another, Spider Man, Superman, The Green Lantern, and Captain America have all been thrown into poor plotlines to battle a less-than-intimidating villan, and use really bad dialogue to get their point across.  And let's not forget all the \"Bam!\", \"Biff!\", and \"Socko!\" onomonopieas saturating the artwork.  Even with all this, comics survived because of their ability to create fantasy for the reader.  Comics don't need to be realistic, because the reader is well aware it is fictional.  With this in mind, I think the game designers decided to reproduce those elements to be comical, as to give the player a bit of a laugh at how lame the image of the comics was in those days, and how much we have evolved since then with our ability to write.Putting that aside, the game itself is actual very clever.  Your characters will be thrown into a multitude of different battlegrounds, such as the urban streets, city parks, underground tunnels, and secret labs.  Much of the terrain is destroyable, so you can have some fun by bashing the sides of a building, or smashing up some guy's car.  Also, certain pieces are even usable; you can lift light poles, oil barrels, and trucks up, and wield them as weapons.The RPG genre is perfect for it, since your characters \"evolve\" as you play, gaining experience.  After gaining levels, your characters will be able to learn new abilities, and increase their stats to better equip them to fight the baddies.Perhaps the best feature of all is the customization of the characters.  On the web, I found several private and public sites of game fans who have designed their own skins for characters, such as Marvel and DC superheroes.  Also, there are a few original skins that look really nice, as well as new \"meshes\" of characters they couldn't normally make, like making it so you have Nightcrawler with his tail.There are, of course, flaws with the game, as there are with any.  The bad writing and voice-characterization (which is done on purpose, I realize) can get very annoying.  Sometimes you just want to slap them and make them talk normal.  Also, the stock characters you are given gain experience slowly, and their powers don't always catch up with the power level of the stage you're trying to get through.  This means you may have to spend seven, eight, or even more tries to get through a level after getting defeated over and over again.So, let's do a quick synapsis:Pros:  Good, colorful graphics, full-functional environments, customizable characters.Cons: Bad dialogue, hard levels.Overall, I'd say that it's worth the [money] I paid for it.  Definitely a lot of fun, and it's online capable!  So grab a copy and get ready to save the day!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2003"}

Convery","summary":"Place up there with first 2 games","reviewText":"Let me start by saying that I thought the controls were horrible as well.  Until I got used to them.  They are different.  You no longer have a camera that simply hangs ten feet behind Lara.  When you turn the analog stick, Lara moves in that direction and you need to manually adjust the camera behind her.  Is that a bad thing?  No.  It is different from all previous Tomb Raider games but that is not to say that it is garbage.  It worked fine in the N64 Zelda games and it works fine here.I think the new and \"dark\" story is great.  I'm sucked into it.  NO OTHER Tomb Raider game has ever had a good story (save Last Revelation).  The first and second TR games had as minimal story as possible.Down to the shaky aspects.While I think the new controls are good, there are times when they aren't too great.  Aiming can be a chore especially when an enemy is at a higher or lower position than Lara's standpoint.  There is a part when you are in a graveyard and are being chased by dogs.  After climbing a certain mosoleum (sp?), I tried to aim at the approaching pooches.  When they got to close to my standpoint I'd pull back and Lara moved on her own for a couple of seconds.  No big problem.The slowdown.  People have been complaining about it.  In the beginning of the game there is a part where Lara stands on a rainy rooftop.  The game slows considerably.  Yet this is the only time I've witnessed it so far.  Luckily there isn't much you need to even do on said rooftop.I give it five out of five.  It's really a 4 out of 5 in my opinion.  So why 5?  To conversely skew those who drank to much Haterade with their Cheerios.  Seems popular for gaming geeks (IGN) to give a negative review for Tomb Raider games that are not TR1 and TR2.Bottom line: If you've been a Tomb Raider fan all along then you don't want to miss this one.  Try the controls.  Get used to them and you will feel that whole TR thing all over again.  ;)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2003"}

The under water level, and the final level each took me a very long time to do.  Still, the game is action, action, and more action but the actions is so good, that the game player probably won't mind it.  Alias is a decent hero, much like Parker in the first game, and the unique plot twist half way through Red Faction 2 was a very good idea.  Where this game does surpass its original is in the area of weapons.  Red Faction 2 has a great deal more weapons than Red Faction, all capable of doing the coolest things a video game has seen in a while.

It features RPG elements similar to Fallout 3 and 4 player zombie melee co-op action similar to Left 4 Dead 2.  Unfortunately, Dead Island isn't nearly as good as those games.STORY:  Dead Island is pretty light on story.  You play as one of four characters, each with their own backstory and paper thin reason for being on this resort island.  Unfortunately, none of this matters as no one will refer to you by name nor mention your history.  After you select your character, you wake up from a hard night of partying to find that zombies have overrun the island.  You meet up with some survivors who inform you that you're immune to the zombie virus and they need your help getting off the island.  Along the way you'll be given silly quests like fetching a necklace or fetching some spark plugs or fetching some food or fetching an armored vehicle.  So basically, a lot of fetch quests.GAMEPLAY:  Dead Island can't decide if it wants to be a deep RPG or an action zombie game, and unfortunately the two don't mesh well.  The RPG mechanics tend to get in the way of the action and interfere with the pacing of the game.Controls: The game plays like a first person shooter, except instead of a gun you wield melee junk like a kitchen knife and a broken broom stick.  Other games have tried the first person melee approach: Condemned, Left 4 Dead 2, Fallout 3.  It didn't feel right in those games and it doesn't feel right in Dead Island.Trying to aim is a chore, and the game has a kind of \"auto-aim\" system where the aiming reticle will move from it's home in the center of the screen and lock-on to nearby zombies.  It's as if the game doesn't trust me to do my own aiming, and it's so wonky that it seems to lock on to random parts of the zombie regardless of where I'm trying to aim.  There's also no way to shut this feature off in the options menu.  Besides the difficulty of trying to aim a melee weapon while getting your face torn off by a dozen zombies is the difficulty of trying to judge distance on a 2D television screen.  Without any way of perceiving depth, I often found myself swinging weapons and missing my target because I was a quarter of an inch too far.  The only way I could land hits was to get right up in a zombie's face.  Unfortunately the game punishes you for taking this approach as zombies will beat you to a pulp in a matter of seconds.That is another frustration I encountered often.  A single zombie is not too hard to kill, but in groups they will overpower you quickly.  Most zombies can take more hits than you can, and I often found myself dead in a matter of seconds when encountering 3 or more of the fiends.  The penalty for death is a loss of half your money and 5 seconds of your time.  When you respawn, your inventory is intact, and your quest progress is not reset, however the game will respawn you in some odd locations.  I was frequently respawned in rooms filled with zombies who would immediately tear me limb from limb for disturbing their peace.There were other oddities I found with the controls, like the fact that your character's feet get stuck on objects and corners easily, and the movement felt floaty and uneven.  Sometimes stronger zombies can knock you down to the ground, but once down there zombies will politely wait for you to get up on your feet, making me question what's the point of knocking me down in the first place?On the RPG side, you talk to various survivors around the island and they give you quests to complete for rewards.  What's strange is you are given the option to accept or decline any quest at the time it is given to you.  There is no penalty for declining a quest, and people will wait patiently for you until you are ready to accept the quest.  Once you accept a quest, there is no obligation to carry out the quest immediately or even ever.  Since accepted quests are still optional, why even have the \"Yes/No\" choice in the first place?  It's completely unnecessary.Similar to Fallout 3, the game is an open world, and as you take up quests they appear as markers on your map.  Unlike Fallout 3, which had you moving forward through the main story (if you chose to do so) from one new place to the next, Dead Island sets up a couple small bases and then has you fetch an item then bring it back to base, then fetch an item and bring it back to base, again and again.  It's repetitive and boring.  Eventually you'll progress far enough to make it to a new location, but then the cycle of tedium starts all over again.As you complete quests you gain XP which will level you up and net you skill points that you can spend on skills to aid you in your journey.  You will also find various weapons, items, and money that you can use along the way.  The problem I found with leveling up was that enemies level up right beside you, so even though I was level 12 and had more power than when I started at level 1, encounters with zombies were just as tough.  By having the zombies power up exactly along side me negated my leveling up and made it feel pointless.Another pointless aspect was the inventory system.  You can pick up and carry most items in the game, but food and drink (which restore precious health) cannot be carried.  Instead you consume them immediately upon picking them up, regardless of your health status.  Medical Kits can be carried, but they take up a weapon slot for some stupid reason.  You can carry all the glue, duct tape, and batteries you want in your gigantic pockets, but MedKits use up your separate and limited weapon inventory slots.  Navigating the inventory system is confusing and unintuitive, and equipping weapons takes some getting used to.Each weapon you carry has a damage meter, and when a weapon is completely damaged it is nearly useless.  Most weapons can't take very much damage, though, so after about 5 or 6 zombies you have to switch to another weapon.  Why weapons are so damn fragile I don't know, but it was annoying.  The only way to repair your extremely fragile weapons is with money.Money makes the world go `round, even in times of zombie apocalypse.  Money has to be the stupidest thing in Dead Island.  Everywhere you go, you'll find wallets and copses that have a few bucks on them to loot.  You can then use that money to buy weapons from characters around the island, although why they wouldn't just give you weapons is beyond me.  You are, after all, their only hope for survival.  But I guess that doesn't matter when there's money to be made.  You can also use money to repair weapons, which would make some sense if you were paying a weapon smith to repair them, but you're doing the repairs by yourself at a work bench.  So what is the money for?  Do you rub the magic dollar bills on the broken knife until it heals?  It's stupid!  You can also use the money to buy snacks from vending machines for health.  But why would you buy it when you could just smash the vending machine and steal all it's contents?  You have the strength to smash a zombie's skull in, and clearly you have no qualms looting during this time of crisis.  So, again, why are you forced to use money?There is a game somewhere underneath all these bad design choices, but whatever fun I could have had with this game is squashed under the weight of all these poorly implemented and confusing mechanics.  If the player is asking \"Why am I doing this?\" and \"Why am I doing that?\" eventually they're going to ask, \"Why am I playing this game?\"GRAPHICS:  You might think I'm going to tear the graphics a new one, but I won't.  They're actually decent.  The textures are sharp and detailed.  The draw distance is impressive.  The lighting effects are well done.  The animation is serviceable.  I did notices some small flaws like screen tearing and pop-in, but none of it was so bad it was distracting.  Some of the human character's faces looked a little odd, but that's pretty common in most games today.  Overall, pretty good graphics.SOUND:  The sound was there.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't distracting.  The voice acting was a bit hokey, but it is a game about zombies, and great voice acting isn't going to make or break this game.  The music was repetitive and forgettable, but not annoying.  Sound effects sounded canned, like they were taken from an audio library entitled \"Video game SFX\".  One small gripe was that the player's character will repeat themselves a lot.  You will hear the same three lines of dialogue from your character about a dozen times an hour.  And this is not a short game.MULTIPLAYER:  Dead Island is meant to be played with other people.  In fact, it feels very unbalanced as a single player affair.  By default, the game puts you in a lobby with other players, and you have to change the settings manually in the options menu if you want to play alone.  This game was designed for 4 friends to play co-op through the campaign.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any friends who had this game, so I was relegated to playing with strangers.  Strangers suck.  They will wander around aimlessly, or rush ahead and die a lot, or just generally be a nuisance.  IF you buy Dead Island, make sure you've got some friends to play it with.OVERALL:  Dead Island isn't a broken game(although IGN did find a game breaking bug), but it's just not a fun game.  Personally, I find the frantic mayhem of CoD Zombies to be very fun.  I wanted Dead Island to be like CoD Zombies but with a story.  When I learned of it's RPG elements, I was still excited since it was likened to Fallout 3 and I LOVE Fallout 3.  Unfortunately, Dead Island is just lame.  Combat is a chore, quests are tedious, inventory is confusing, money is pointless, and the difficulty is off the charts.  I really tried to like Dead Island, and I gave it 7 hours of my time, but with each passing hour I just grew more frustrated until I couldn't take it anymore.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2011"}

It's basically a mixture of Crysis meets Resident Evil, and looks just a good as both games with Maximum 1080p settings. If you google the update for the game, you can find it, either on many torrents sites, or private site from people who already have the game. I purchased mine from steam, found the update and have had no problems to speak of. Besides the 2 main things, the crappy 3rd person view, and the whole flying routine were meant to be, just not for the \"final\" release. Deep Silver admitted to releasing the wrong version to STEAM. Claiming they were focusing more on the console versions of the game, which eventually as most games, will need updated eventually as well. Look at all the glitchy games that were nearly unplayable in the past. The first big one that comes to mind is Half Life 2, and/or the Orange Box, never in my life did i experience so many glitches and updates. So onto the game, pros and cons.Pros1.On a good rig, like mine. Full 1080p looks absolutely stunning, and buries the consoles. Although a friend of mine has it for PS3 and i must say it looks great on a big HDTV.2.Game is fairly simple, although you will definitely be tempted to explore the beauty of the Island, at your own risk.3.Missons can be a little odd, with all the other little side missions you can get into, radar map is off at times. Nothing major.4.The Zombies don't just come after you no matter what. As with a game like Assassins Creed you can hide if they do, and sometimes they may not see you at all.5. Weapons are scattered, just have to know where to look. Boat paddles, knives, pipes etc.6.The game has no \"real\" story but is loads of fun, and as i said reminds you of Crysis, especially when you can get guns. Even Far Cry 2 a bit.7.Game comes up super fast, load times are short, and the controls feel smooth and accurate.Cons1.The glitches of course, which i personally didn't see, but minus a star for those who have had to suffer.2.Stamina doesn't last long, as the weapons don't either. They take damage very quickly and need replaced. Basically RUN!3.The game will push your graphics card, so make sure you have a good one, if you intend on maxing it out.4.While the controls are good, striking the zombies is a bit sloppy, and not super gradifying.5.Some things are intentionally stolen from LFD 1 and 2, points, experience etc.6.Your friendly AI, are pretty stupid.Other than that from what i can see it's a lot of fun, and i'm about 5 or so hours into it, off and on. They claim with everything in the game you can get up to 20 hours, so we'll see in the next week or so. Since i don't have that kind of time to play straight through.:) So if you want good killing zombie fun, and new surrounding for eye candy and exploration, then this is the game for you. I got it simply for the fact it's on a Paradise type resort, which is much different than the normal slums, dark alleys etc. Although later on, you will experience a few of those places. So once you download the fix, get your fix, and i'm sure the reviews overall for the game will get better. Deep Silver doesn't seem to be a really popular company (fairly new), but excel in beautiful graphics. So give them a break, they'll come around.My rig-Acer M5800, 8 gigs DDR3 RAM, Core 2 Quad Q9400 2.67ghz, ATI Radeon 6770 1gig DDR5(don't let sites full you on this card, it's got the juice to max out!) Highest Temp on any game i've ever played, only 53 degrees C. Just fans, no special cooling, which is great. Later.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2011"}

Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"Andrew \"Radaar\"","summary":"Get Lost In The Dark","reviewText":"This game is superior to GoldenEye in every way.

Camera angles can be an unexpected enemy.Graphics: 4/5 -- the game looks good, but when up close to some structures the resolution of the textures look muddy.Online: 3/5 -- online is interesting and well done, but the inability to partner up with specific people or take advantage of more co-op experiences makes it feel less compelling.  Also, invading Black Phantoms can be annoying but sometimes exhilarating knowing that you're about to go up against another player and see who wins.Overall: 4/5 -- while frustrating, the experience is very rewarding.  The story is interesting, but feels like it could have been fleshed out much more for an overall more satisfying story element.Definitely worth picking up if you are a fan of action/RPGs.  You may want to stay away if patience is not your strong suit.** IN-DEPTH REVIEW**The premise:A fog has descended over Boletaria engulfing the land.  The Old One has awakened and demons are corrupting the denizen's souls.  The player is tasked with defeating the arch demons within each of the Archstones.  The archstones include:-the Small King, a medieval castle;-the Burrow King, a series of mines connected to a volcano;-the Tower Queen, a large prison that is thrust hundreds of feet above the ground;-the Shadowmen, a fort overlooking a bluff that is surrounded by the sea;-and the Chieftan, a shanty town around a treacherously poisonous swamp.Each Archstone has a different overall feel, or theme to it.  The Small King, for instance, is reminiscent of knights and archers.  The Burrow King features corrupted miners and lava bugs.  The Tower Queen, one of my favorites, is very Lovecraftian featuring warped creatures with tentacles, several heads, and magic orbs made of bodies.  The Shadowmen feature skeletons, wraiths, and giant manta ray like creatures that have taken to the skies.  The Chieftan archstone features warped humans and plenty of nasty bugs.The Nexus is the primary hub where the player can visit each stone, store items, have stronger weapons enhanced with ore, learn magic and miracles, and buy basic supplies. The player can also spend their collected souls on getting stronger by speaking with the Maiden in Black (available after the first demon, Phalanx, has been killed).  The player can choose which stats to enhance to customize gameplay, but each time a stat is enhanced, the cost of the next level increases.Gameplay:The gameplay is very action oriented, with R1 and R2 assigned to melee attacks/casting spells depending on what weapon or wand is equipped, and L1 and L2 differ depending on if a shield, weapon, or wand is equipped.  Players can (and will need to) block, parry and dodge in order to stay alive.  Different weapons and have different swing speeds, reach, and stamina consumption.  Each has pros and cons, so the players has to find what works for them and the particular enemies they are going up against.The game doesn't pause to allow the player to manage inventory, so players must be ready at all times and only manage their equipment and gear when they've defeated the enemies in their vicinity.  Enemies do not engage the player until they've approached a certain distance, which allows for an assessment of the situation.  Two weapons and two secondary weapons can be equipped, five items, two rings, one set of arrows and one set of bolts, and 4 pieces of armor.This game is notoriously hard and for good reason.  The enemies hit hard and are unforgiving.  However, planning, strategy, and above all, patience are key to surviving.  The game can be (and has been) completed with players never increasing a single stat.  However, sometimes it's necessary to spend souls on increasing levels or enhancing weapons.  A boss can be really difficult until the right weapon with a particular enhancement has been used.  For instance, some demons are weak to magic weapons and using anything other will only slowly wittle their life down.  Having the right items and coming prepared will lead to success.  Above all, do not let a death deter you.  Learn where the enemies were placed, their attack patterns, and conquer them the next round.  Or the next one.The player will spend most of their time in Soul Form.  In Soul Form, their health is reduced by half and they appear transluscent.  Footstep don't make as much noise.  When a player's body is returned, either through defeating an Arch Demon, using a Stone of Ephemeral Eyes, or through a method described in the Online component below, the player's health is returned to normal.  This can be a good thing, and a bad thing as detailed below...Online:The online component is a key aspect of the game that enhances the experience in unique ways.  Other players can be seen as \"ghosts\", faint shadowy outlines of other players in the game at the exact same time.  Blood stains, which become visible after another player dies, can be activated to see a \"red ghost\" of that player's last moments.  These can be helpful for new players to see how the player died and what didn't work for them.Messages can be left (by pressing select on the controller and choosing one) that will show up in every player's game world.  Messages that are useful should be recommended.  The more your message is recommended the longer it stays in the world.  There other benefits as well, as each time your message is recommended your health/magic/stamina is refilled.  Not all messages are useful however, and some players will trick others into dying by telling someone to \"Take a step forward\" only to watch their character plummet to their death.With a Blue Stone, a player can leave their Soul Sign for other players to summon them into their game world.  The Sign appears like a message mentioned above, but is very bright Blue and easily noticed as a Soul Sign.  These Blue Phantoms can only be summoned by a Host who in NOT in Soul Form (they have their body).  The host can summon up to 2 Blue Phantoms.Where Blue Phantoms are helpful, Black Phantoms are often the bane of a player's existence.  A player who is in Soul Form can use a Black Stone to invade a host who is in human form.  The Black Phantom must then hunt down the player.  A black phantom who successfully kills the host player will retrieve their body back.  The host player can hide and fight back, summoning blue phantoms to help defeat the black phantom.  The host can also dismiss the black phantom by teleporting back to the nexus or going into a room with an Arch Demon.  **This is basically the Player Vs Player (PVP) combat in this game; whether the host likes it or not.**The last component is World Tendency.  Certain actions will change the lightness or darkness of each archstone (seen in the World Tendency menu).  When the color is pure black or pure white, there are different events and areas that will open up for each world.  Pure white is MUCH harder to achieve than pure black as there are only a few ways to increase the tendency towards light. I would suggest trying for these tendencies only after the game has been finished once as it can be very frustrating and deter the overall first time experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2013"}

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

H. Wells","summary":"Gave away my Elite and bought this!","reviewText":"My brother wanted an xbox 360 for christmas. And I was about to need to upgrade to a 250gb hard drive for my old elite.  I did a little math and rather than buying an entry console ($199) for my brother and a hard drive ($130) for me, it just made good sense to buy the new 250gb \"S\" console ($299 + $20 transfer cable).  I am amazed by the improvements to the xbox 360.  Here is my experience with the new 360 console:First, I had to transfer the data from my old xbox360 to the new one.  The transfer cable (twenty bucks) was about as simple as I could have hoped for.  Once the new 360 \"S\" was hooked up to the TV, I attached the old hard drive to the cable and plugged the cable into a USB port.  A few prompts later and the transfer was underway. Then, I went to xbox.com on my phone and transfered all the lisences.  All my saves, avatar goodies, and achievements are on the new \"S\" console.The new console is a nice glossy black. It is a little slimmer than the original, but really, they are both about the same size.The DVD tray has a small sensor that opens it instead of a button.The built-in wireless works perfectly.  I can't believe this feature did not come with original 360.  At any rate, I couldnt tell any speed difference between the internal wireless, and the old add-on wireless.For me, the absolute wonder of the 360 \"S\" is that it makes NO NOISE.  It's not \"whisper quiet\"--it is silent. The old xbox had its own fan, and because I wanted it to never overheat, I also had an intercooler with external power.  So the old xbox made a decent amount of noise.  Im sure the 360 \"S\" has a fan, but I can't hear it!I have heard rumors that xbox has a slightly redesigned controller to fix D-pad issues.  The controller I got with my \"S\" did have a glossy black accent, but otherwise seemed to be exactly the same as the old controller.So this holiday season I upgraded my xbox 360, and my brother got his own 360.  It is a very happy christmas here! Any xbox veterans thinking about upgrading their old unit would do well to give a friend or relative a great christmas with your old xbox and go ahead and treat yourself to the new \"S\" model.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I0GF72","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"The definitive version of a true Legend that feels brand new again","reviewText":"The Legend of Zelda is my favorite series in all of gaming, a lifelong hobby and a favorite pastime in and of itself for me, andThe Wind Wakerjust happens to be my favorite entry in that series. When I first glimpsed the screenshots Nintendo revealed of this remake, I literally danced for joy all the way to my bedroom to wake my wife with the blessed news. I just couldn't contain my excitement, and now that I finally have Wind Waker HD in my possession, it's nearly everything I could have hoped for from one of my personal favorite and most influential video games of all time. Although I was pretty skeptical it could be *that* much of an upgrade when I first bought it, Nintendo really went all-out here, way beyond my expectations. Before you read this review any further, I need to insert this disclaimer: this review will be quite long (hopefully in an informative-from-a-superfan sort of way) and (mostly) full of gushing praise from a lifelong gamer who is super passionate about The Wind Waker. If long, detailed reviews are not your thing, then skip this one. You've been warned.For fans of Wind Waker who already know how amazing the core game is and just want to know what Nintendo upgraded and how this remake works out, skip the next two paragraphs. I bought the downloadable eshop version two weeks ago, and have become intimately acquainted with this remake by now, and I've played the original more times than I care to count. That been said, I think I'm more than capable of judging this version fairly.*What's So Great About The Wind Waker?*If you're unfamiliar with the game at all, you might wonder why I love Wind Waker so much. Well, it'd take a full-on dissertation to cover all that and I want this to mainly be about the remake itself, so I'll try to sum up my feelings quickly. It's true that pretty much every game in the Zelda series does a wonderful job capturing the epic tale of the \"hero's journey.\" However,  few Zelda games, and hardly any other games in general for that matter, have managed to capture the genuine and amazing feelings of  discovery, exploration, and adventure like The Wind Waker did, at least for me anyway (Disclaimer: I love all Zelda games and am not bashing *insert your favorite Zelda title here* with that statement by any means. It's all subjective, right?). The timeless graphical style is so vibrantly colorful and imagination fueled/fueling, complimented very well by its timeless sound design and stirring, iconic musical score from Koji Kondo. The surprisingly mature, deep, and impactful narrative is juxtaposed beautifully against the colorful \"Toon\" aesthetics. The entire cast of characters is lovable and unique because of the fantastic writing and localization. The graphical style helped in this area as well, as the cartoon/anime style made for beautifully expressive characters (I personally find character expressions in WW to be preferable to the prevalent motion capturing and photo-realism you see in games these days. I like video games that don't always try to be interactive movies like so many modern \"games\" these days do. In my opinion, that approach ditches what makes video games such a unique, magical medium). In my opinion, The Wind Waker also features the most deep/interesting/engaging/sympathetic depiction of the series' mainstay villain, Ganondorf/Ganon. Even to this day, the brand new oceanic setting and nautical theme makes the game feel so fresh in comparison with other entries in the series. Every race and island feels genuinely real and likable, giving an amazing sense of connection to the world despite its gargantuan size, which in turn makes the quest feel all the more urgent. When it comes to gameplay, the established LoZ mechanics were more refined than ever, and the new gameplay mechanics fit the series perfectly. The swordplay is still among the best of any traditional 3D Zelda game to date, in my opinion. It all just screams top-notch, timeless masterpiece for me. The game literally changed my tastes and gaming horizons forever when I first played it all those years ago, and my love for it has only deepened with time. To see it get a genuine HD remake treatment is an absolute dream-come-true for me.The original was not a perfect game though and I readily admit that. The game has a few noticeable flaws that keep it from the status of perfection that masterpieces such asLink's Awakening,Ocarina of Time,A Link to the Past, and (arguably)Twilight Princesshave attained.  No, the original was not quite perfect, but WW got so much right, it still ranks as my favorite Zelda entry. I have so many fond memories of playing it when I was younger; my baby sister used to love sitting at my feet and just watching me play, unable to read yet so I would read the words to her with the best acting ability I could muster (Grandma was read with my best sweet ol' granny voice, for example, lol). I've played this game so many times since then, it's the definition of a seminal game for me. Thankfully, this remake fixes almost all of the issues that weighed the original down, which I'll get to later. With WWHD, now I do consider it a flawless masterpiece, like the aforementioned legendary Zelda classics.*A Review of The Wind Waker HD as a Remake*That's enough about my nostalgic rambling though. This is a review of Wind Waker HD after all, so the real question is, how does this game fare with regards to the remake treatment it received? To put it simply, fantastic, amazing, utterly beautiful. It feels like a brand new game again.The first thing you'll notice when starting up the game is its revamped graphics. The original Wind Waker's graphical style may have been hugely controversial when it was first announced, but the Toon design eventually won most fans over and actually lives on as one of its most timeless aspects. Seriously, the original Gamecube game still looks gorgeous compared to its contemporaries and it is because of this that I was kind of shocked when WWHD was announced (I readily admit that other Zelda titles,even ones newer than WW, seem to beg for a remake treatment more, but I'm not complaining). Still, Nintendo managed to find several ways to visually enhance Toon Link's world. It's all cel shaded still, and most 3D models seem to have little change, aside from much softer, more realistic shadows and edges on them. All textures have been redone completely and look fantastic in HD! Colors are far more vibrant than ever before and the range of colors has increased dramatically. The most noticeable graphical addition here are some very impressive enhanced lighting and shading effects. Because of all these new upgrades to the visuals, the majestic atmosphere of an endless deep blue ocean or encountering a thunderstorm at sunset while at sea (one of my favorite memories of the original) is simply unmatched. Seriously, take a look at the moon at night and marvel at how the world seems to be bathed in that lunar light, or the forbidden fortress with its incredibly thick level of atmosphere, or heck, even just soaking in the sun with the salty sea air breezing by. It's unbelievably gorgeous and immersive. The lighting shines through even in small moments, such as when weapons clash and sparks fly or when an opened treasure chest lets out a heavenly light. It's just awesome. Memorable locales and events (and anyone who has played the original knows this game has many of them) all have new life breathed into them because of the awesome new updated presentation. Some events have been really enhanced to new levels. Watching the game play out almost feels as if Pixar made a Zelda movie. Seriously, fantastic job here!Contrary to my expectations, Nintendo made substantial upgrades to WW's formula in other ways too. Even the basic gameplay mechanics have been improved. The overall experience feels much smoother and more refined than the original. For example. the grappling hook item now wraps around your target much faster. Also, you don't have to come to a complete stop to switch your direction while swinging with the hook; you can just naturally change direction in mid-swing. These tweaks make using the grappling hook much more enjoyable and streamlined. Text scrolls much faster now in conversations than in the original. The Wind Waker itself is always mapped to \"up\" on the d-pad making it much more convenient to use. Little tweaks like this are everywhere in WWHD. These little gameplay refinements add up very quickly, and the overall experience is all the better for it. Controls feel more responsive, movement feels smoother, and everything just feels refined to perfection. Add this to the graphical improvements and new features exclusive to this version, and you get what feels like a brand new game. It's hard to explain, but you'll see what I mean when you play it for yourself. Some new ideas are neat and fit in with the classic experience very well too. One example of this is that you can now enter a basic first-person view and actually walk around and use some items like the boomerang or bow in this perspective. Don't expect an experience like Skyrim, but it is a pretty cool addition.As far as new, system specific features goes, the Wii-U's signature hallmark, the gamepad, is utilized very well. Off-TV play works like a charm. Being able to relax in bed and enjoy the game is a very welcome addition. The touch screen is also used to good effect, making inventory management, accessing items like the hook or canon while at sea, or looking at the map of the great sea without having to pause the game a breeze. It makes for a smoother, more seamless experience. Being able to direct Link's use of the Wind Waker baton using touch controls feels natural. You can use the gamepad's gyroscopic feature to better aim things like your bow, picto-box, telescope, you name it, and it all feels fantastic. It's games like this that really show the potential and unique benefits of the gamepad. The Wii-U's button layout also makes the game better, as you now have many more buttons to map items to compared to the GameCube original. If you don't want to use the gamepad, you have the option to switch control to the Pro Controller for a more traditional experience. I think it's very nice that they put in that choice for players.Another Wii-U feature that has been integrated really well is Miiverse. The original Wind Waker allowed you to connect your Gameboy Advance to your GameCube to access some unique but nonessential features involving Tingle and even a little co-op mode of sorts. That has all been taken out and replaced with the Tingle Bottle. This is where Miiverse comes in. At any time, you can take the bottle out and use the gamepad to type a message, draw a picture, or even take a photo with the in-game pictograph, put it in the bottle, and hurl it into the sea. Then, somewhere else in the real world, another player may see your glittering bottle washed up on a beach in their game. They can pick it up and see whatever message you put in the bottle. It's such a neat feature, and it fits right in with the rest of the themes of adventure on the high seas so prevalent in the game. Seriously, just the concept of a message in a bottle is so magical by itself, and using that as the Miiverse feature in WWHD feels like a perfect match. Awesome.Remember how I mentioned the original Wind Waker had some caveats earlier? Most of them have been fixed in this remake! A bit into the game, you gain the ability to speed up sailing to a massive degree, via a \"red sail\" upgrade purchasable at the in-game auction house. You don't even need wind in the direction you're going to get this super speed. This update erases any frustration from getting from one locale to another using the \"slow\" sailing of the original almost entirely (Many people complain about the sailing in the original, but I personally loved the sailing a lot and think complaining about is missing the point, but oh well. The fast sailing feature here is a welcome addition, at any rate). The non-confrontational, easier difficulty of the original has been \"fixed\" via a much more challenging \"hero mode\" option similar to the one found inSkyward Sword, where enemies do double damage and the only method of healing Link is through potions. Even better, this more difficult mode is available right off the bat without having to play the whole game first! Best of all, they addressed my biggest gripe about the original: the infamous, horrendous Tri-Force piece fetch quest that all but ruined the otherwise perfect pace of the original. They fixed this by making it MUCH more streamlined and actually engaging, and that's awesome! Thank you so much for listening to fans and fixing these issues Aonuma-San. You're the best!As much as this remake enhances the original WW's magic in many ways, it is, once again, not quite *all* I had hoped for. I really wish they had gone all-out in every aspect since this is a home console remake. They did nothing to add any substantial new content. Just one new dungeon would have made me so happy, and it's not unheard of for Nintendo to do this with enhanced Zelda titles (Link's Awakening DX comes to mind), but no. I know Aonuma wanted to keep the core experience intact here, and much of the original WW's cut content ended up in later Zelda games, but still, it's a slight shame. Ah well, at least the core game is such a masterpiece. Also, Koji Kondo's soundtrack for this game is one of my favorites of any video game ever. Yet, not much work was done to enhance it for this remake beyond some remastering of the original tunes. To be fair, some tunes do come across as a lot beefier and sound amazing, but not all. It would have been awesome to get Skyward Sword quality orchestration of at least some of this iconic soundtrack, but alas. Finally, and this is an admittedly nit-picky gripe, you can't invert the Y-axis of the second analog stick while in normal view. You can only invert right/left and you can invert the Y-axis of first-person view, but not the general Y-axis? Talk about jarring and difficult to get used to, at least for me anyway (I'm one of those guys who likes inverted controls). Why not put that option in for players, huh?! As you can tell by my score, these issues didn't keep me from loving the game, but I still feel they must be said. It's only fair for me to voice some criticism, right? I don't want you to think I'm completely blinded by bias, after all.I understand some don't like reading long reviews, but if any remake deserved an in-depth analysis, it's this one. I'm so glad Nintendo decided to remake and enhance it to the degree that they did. Few games have made the huge impact on me the way that Wind Waker has. It's so surreal to think that when I first played it, I was just a kid not much older than Link is in this game, so young and naive. Now I'm an older (but still young) man with his own family and yet I feel the same childlike excitement when I play The Wind Waker HD, having gone though my own journey in life (with a lot left to go, hopefully :P). Everything about WWHD, the characters, the settings, the story, just the overall experience, it all just feels so familiar and yet brand new and magical again. It's a beautiful and surreal thing. Thank you so much Nintendo, for giving me the definitive version of one of my most beloved games of all time. The Wind Waker was always a flawed gem, but this remake has made it into a virtually caveat-free masterpiece and can now stand tall and proud among other flawless Zelda games. Not only that, but it stands tall among all video games, period. It really feels like a modern masterpiece, despite the fact that the core here is over a decade old, in much the same way playing other fantastic remakes likeHalo Anniversary,Klonoa, andOcarina of Time 3Dfeels. All great remakes, and WWHD fits in that high-quality group perfectly.To you readers who stuck with this review until now, I hope my sappiness and wordiness hasn't been too annoying. I sincerely hoped to be helpful to all of you out there wondering if you should get this. Most \"remakes\" these days end up being incredibly lazy ports with no real effort put into the rerelease beyond upscaling resolution and no more. WWHD is so much grander and better than 95% of today's \"remakes,\" remasters, and rereleases, it's not even funny. Trust me, I went into this remake with a huge amount of skepticism that they could really improve this game, and I really did wonder if the changes could justify buying it again, but I did anyway and boy am I glad I did! I say it's absolutely worth it. This is, without a doubt, the definitive version of a true classic and revitalizes it to the point where it feels brand new again. Go out and buy it immediately, and enjoy one of the greatest Legends of Zelda that has ever been told. Buy it, prepare for the adventure of your life, and go discover, and save, a vast, beautiful new world.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2013"}

Hicks","summary":"Hard for those of us who are reflex impaired","reviewText":"I have enjoyed the COD series, but gave up on Black Ops after a bit - it just wasn't any fun. I was getting butchered all the time. Whether or not people cheat isn't clear to me. It may simply be that a 12 year old boy raised on FPS's can kick my 52 yo butt with ease.I missed the game play though, so took on  MW3. The single player is fine. Lots of scenarios and fun ops. Not terribly hard on normal settings.Multiplayer has so many games that I haven't touched, but I enjoy Dominion and Kill Confirmed. I like Barebones, which is still present. Somehow I tend to do better there.My issue with the game is that it disenfranchises the marginal player. You enter a match with your Sergeant's stripes and everyone else has Prestiged a couple of times around. You are really fresh meat. There is just not much that a sucky player can engage in without invoking the wrath of little punk brats, dragging down your team, or just feeling like you spend more time dead than alive, all of which seriously diminishes the fun of the game. It would be nice to have some stratification of talent, and advance through a grouping of more similar talents and expertise rather than just throwing us all in together. Or have casual rooms to play in.If you are in the same boat, what helped me a lot was finding a clan. They do help coach me, tolerate me, and make for just a good time rather than a harrowing experience.I do think that the online service has improved. I don't get dropped nearly as much. There is occasionally some lag, but not often enough to matter. You occasionally respawn right in the middle of the other team's presence, but this is sort of funny - you gotta laugh at getting pummeled soundly at some point.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2011"}

An engaging strategy epic where you try to survive battles against secret cults and powerful, mysterious wizards.","reviewerName":"Tso Haven Hei Wan \"Havenough Dupont Randall-B...","summary":"Compelling and addictive RPG since FF X","reviewText":"The Shadow Hearts series is a real alternative type of RPG that makes itself stands out from other RPGs in the market. The first one got the unfortunate fate with a close launch with Final Fantasy X, so it got sunk to the bottom. Nonetheless, this doesn't discouraged Midway and Azure to roll out the second instalment of the Shadow HeartsCovenant's event happened 6 months after the first game when Yuri the ill fated hero decided to move into a peaceful life in a small country village. Nonetheless, with the outbreak of World War I, no place is safe and peaceful. Thus he was forced into fight to protect this small village from German invasion, which eventually led him back into arms.The character designs are much better this time round with each of the character having their own personality that actually shows up in the story. An old puppeteer whose puppet is a mirror image of his late daughter, a German official, a gay vampire wrestler, a spoiled and adventurous Russian princess, a single hearted samurai, a tarot card reader and a white wolf. They together formed a very unique party one had ever seen in a RPG. Their abilities also hovered around their nature. Abilities like Marionette, Tarot Cards, Aromatherapy, Muscle skills etc. are very well thought of and designed. They also exhibit different types of attribute that makes the formation of your favourite team a very enjoyable experience.The judgement ring system is back but much better. The judgement ring is a dial that appears with every single command that you use, no matter it is attack, ability, magic or item. You have to hit certain required areas to make the move successful. The last game has the flaw of being too difficult to use a lack of customisation. But in this game you can customise the ring with a lot of flexibility, be it enlarging strike (critical hit) or hit areas, increasing the number of hit areas, slowing down the indicator or add on more status effects with attacks. This makes the game more enjoyable for a lot of people. You also have the choice of auto ring, although it trades of the damage you can do to you enemies.The side quests are interesting and they actually enriched the story of each character. The downside is most side quests are not available until the end of the game. However, that makes up with the difficulty of the bosses associated with these quests. The game also makes fun of the game itself and thus put more personality inside the game itself. The story of the Ring Soul is one of them. Nonetheless, the game has a lot of homosexual elements in it, which further takes the game out of normal RPG conventions. So probably might not be suitable for under age kids to play it and at least teenage about 15 would be recommended to venture into this game.The story is engrossing though still quite fall into most RPG story conventions. The cut scenes are very well done and could rival every single Final Fantasy game in the market. The best part is when you finished the game once, you are rewarded with the theatre mode where you can watch all the movies and semi-movies again without going through the whole game again.Shadow Hearts: Covenant really stands out as an outstanding RPG and for gamers who are eagerly waiting for FF XII to come out. Covenant could well quench your thirst with a lot of joy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2005"}
{"product_name":"B003VUO6H4","reviewerName":"Joshua Glowzinski \"Gman\"","summary":"All I can say is wow","reviewText":"This is rather long.  So prepare!!!!I had a Wii and a 360.  I never cared about the PS3.  Then I spent a lot of money at best buy and had some reward credit coming.  So, I decided to buy a PS3.  I sold half my movie collection and got blu ray before I even had the system.  I guess so I would have to buy it.  I got the system.  I was blown away by how great it is.  Below I will tell you why.The systemThe new PS3 is much smaller than the first.  It has two buttons on the front, as well as two USB ports.  I know some people complain about the fact that it has only two USB ports I can understand why.  I decided to get the move and was trying to charge up both of the controllers.  You need the Playstation Eye plugged in, so I only had 1 free USB.  But, while it is an in convince, I found no reason to complain.  I have a multi USB hub which makes the one USB port into 5.  So the problem is was to fix.  You can find a hub for about 35 dollars.  Some may say it is stupid to have to go buy it and not have it already available.  I guess they would be right.  But it is such an easy fix.  The system is very quiet.  I can not hear the system and I sit no more than 10 feet away when playing and watching movies on it.  It is rather long though.  It is about as wide as a standard DVD player.  It is rather heavy also.  Not to worry, I can't see people carrying it around.  I bring it to my grandfathers and that's it.  You can get a carrying case for it if you wish to carry it around places.  Also, I was watching a DVD that was about an hour and fifty minutes.  When I got up and took the DVD out, the system was not hot at all. It was a tad warmer in the back left, but nothing like I thought it would be.  That made me happy.  You need not worry about breaking the tray that comes out for games and movies because you just load your stuff like you do on the Wii.  You put it in front of the space in the front and it goes in.The controlsI heard people complaining about the PS3 controller.  Now that I own a PS3, I can not understand why.  The controller is great.  It feels very comfortable in my hands.  I have medium hands.  I almost got teary when I started playing a game because it reminded me of all those times I spent playing my Playstation and Playstation 2.  Besides the fact that is feels and works great, there is also another cool feature within the controller.  There is a button in the middle that you can hit to do things like quit a game, turn on the system, turn off the system and a few other things.  I thought it was really neaGamesThe Playstation 3 has a lot of great games.  A lot of the games can be played on 360 as well.  But I will play them on here as well.  Just so I can get the points for doing things.  Also, there are a lot of great Playstation only games.  Like Metal Gear 4 and Uncharted.  I was wondering which system to add the games to my amazon wish list for and then I realized why not get them for both?  Now I can play great games twice!!!!  Actually, the games I downloaded look better than some of the games I have played.  It does not mean the games are not a lot of fun.  But I'm just saying.  I can not weait to try Modern Warfare 2 with the PS3 controller.  I also am excited about trying multiplayer games on the Playstation 3.  I have yet to play a game online.  So I look forward to giving it a try soon.The in system features.Ok, when I found out that I would search the internet with the system, I kind of had a freaky dance moment.  It works just like using a PC would.  I had no problem searching and watching videos from CNN.  I could search all the sites I did on my PC.  I can't wait to try Christmas shopping while sitting in my bed this year.  On top of the internet, you have things like music, videos, pictures and the Playstation store.  There are so many things you can do even if you buy the system but do not have the money to get a game at the same time.  I downloaded a game called Joe Danger and Planet Mini Golf and even now that I have Metal Gear, uncharted, sports champions and motorstorm, find myself playing more than the games.  They are very fun.  Good to know that there are some good games on the online aspect of the system.  That being said, I still don't know if I'm crazy about the store itself.  I like Xbox live and buying games from it.  Playstation has a lot of good stuff going for it.  Like when your looking for a game, on the right there are squares with a little picture of the game.  On the left you can see a little more about the game.  Then you choose an item and you can read more about it.  I also like the whole wallet thing.  When you have credit in the store it is put into a wallet.  I thought it was kind of cool.  Some things I didn't like were the fact that when you are downloading something, you can not leave the store.  You have to stay there and wait for it to download.  Oh and it takes FOREVER, for something to download.  I understand that the files are large.  But wow, I mean like 25 minutes for a game.  I have cable internet.  Playstation is the slowest thing I have when downloading.  Not sure why.  Then, sometimes when you go to play a game you will have to download an update.  I understand that you do that on Xbox as well.  But it has to do with the slow speed.  It just drags on and on.  But, I guess patience is a virtue.  You can also look at things yo have downloaded, any times you want.  You can redownload the items that you have already paid for free.  So, if you delete something for some reason or something is not working, you just go on your system and you get a list of everything you've gotten.  I thought that was great.In the endAll and all I love the PS3.  It has so many things you can do and is only 299.99.  It's like buying a PC with a monitor the size of your TV that also has great games on blu ray and to download.  It also has net flix.  Also, the move is absolutely amazing.  I saw my Wii hitch hiking on the road a few days after I got the move and realized it was depressed.  I still love my wii.  But the Move is great.  Just hook the camera to the USB port and play away.  If your going to get the Move, I must say, get the one that comes with the camera, controller and game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2010"}

And through all the years and games since then, it has always remained at the top of my list through every new release they came out with. Fast forward to the present and we have a new Tony Hawk game. Tony Hawk's Underground.I picked this game up the day it was released and have been obsessed ever since. Once again, the Tony Hawk series never ceases to amaze me. This time they brought a fresh new idea to the series and I think it is quite welcomed. While the other games are fantastic - it was a good idea to freshen it up a little bit. Although, it's really not all THAT different. The goals are basically the same type of goals from the previous games. (e.g. collect 5 of this, do a trick here, etc.) except now, there's a story line behind it, which is better, because it makes doing the tasks a little more interesting.The best part about the THPS series and now with this game, is, the gameplay never changes - and that's really what makes the Tony Hawk games fun. The gameplay. As always, with new Tony Hawk games, comes new innovations in the trick department. And this game is no different - going as far as to let you create your own trick. Of course, the usual things you expect from a TH game are present, crazy levels, awesome stuff to unlock, crazy new tricks and the ability to create your own skate park.

A NEW Tony Hawk game with NEW features/storyline that stays true to it's THPS roots. My only complaints with the game are: I think the song selection could have been a little better for the soundtrack of the game and it could run a little smoother on Playstation2. I've seen the FPS drop a little bit and it lag a tad. I'm sure the latter of my complaints is remedied on Xbox. (But who wants to play Tony Hawk on an Xbox controller?

{"product_name":"B001HB7K6I","reviewerName":"Nightmare","summary":"Stunningly beautiful and very fun","reviewText":"Muramasa: The Demon Blade is an exceptional game that deserves its place in any Wii owner's game library.  Nothing is bad about this game, in my humble opinion.  There might be aspects that some gamers don't prefer, but overall nobody can deny how truly amazing this game is.Graphics 10/10: Simply dazzling.  The artwork is beautifully detailed, colorful, and crisp.  There are a wide variety of environments, and all of them are pure eye candy.  The art style is what makes this game look better than most other games on any system.Music and Sound 10/10: Obviously this is largely a matter of preference.  I find the Japanese music immersive and appropriate, and I've never heard Japanese music that would fit this game better.  The voice acting remains in Japanese as well with English subtitles.  This makes the game even more engrossing so I don't have any complaints here.Controls 10/10: The controls in Muramasa are very tight.  There are plenty of different moves to perform and most of them are very intuitive.  Using \"A\" to attack and \"B\" to use a special attack seems overly simple, but when you can use the control stick in combination with the \"A\" button you can use dash attacks, upward slashes, downward thrusts, and other moves/combos.Gameplay 9/10: Muramasa is a side-scrolling action game.  You travel through different screens (there is a map function so you can tell where you're going) fighting enemies and collecting items.  Battles occur as special events (an ambush) that typically prevent you from progressing until you defeat all enemies in the group.  After you do so you are awarded money and experience points.  When you level up from sufficient experience you gain strength and vitality, and the more of these you have the better swords you are able to equip.  How do you get swords?  You get some from defeating bosses, but most come from forging with souls and spirit.  Souls come from killing enemies and can be found lying about.  Spirit is earned by eating/cooking foods that heal you.  There is a sword tree that you follow so you can't unlock any sword at any time you want.  You must unlock them in a given order (although there are several branches you can work on at a time).  There are also two characters in the game, each following their own story, and their sword trees are different.  Each sword has its own attack power, special attack, and some have a special effect, so it's a good idea to try unlocking every sword in the game.  The game has two difficulty levels so it is accessible to beginners and experienced players alike.  The only real problem is when you have to back track through certain areas and no enemies appear.  However, the artwork is so beautiful that it's really hard to find this particularly annoying.  Just admire the scenery!Overall 10/10:  Muramasa: The Demon Blade is a gem that Wii owners should not miss out on.  There's plenty of depth and challenge for anybody to enjoy.  If you have been considering Muramasa, now is the time to pick it up.  You won't regret it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2010"}

{"product_name":"B008GEH9HO","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"Signatures are onerous.\"","summary":"Bigger is Better, but not Brighter","reviewText":"In terms of design and ergonomic comfort, the 3DS XL is a vast improvement over the original. The original 3DS was a great gaming machine but it was just too small, requiring some kind of grip accessory to provide comfort. The main benefit of the 3DS XL is obviously that the screen is bigger, but the larger size also makes it easier to hold and play. The stylus has been relocated to the right side of the device, making access easier. The 3D depth slider has been improved with a \"snap\" feature that prevents the player from accidentally turning the 3D depth slider on. One of the things I was most impressed with was the improvement in the sound quality. The 3DS XL boasts true simulated surround sound now. The speakers sound so good that I no longer feel the need to use my headphones, as I did with the original. The Select, Home and Start buttons have become actual buttons now, instead of pressure points that give no tactile feedback when you push them. So overall I'm very happy with the new features of the 3DS XL.However, there is one glaring setback, and that is the screen brightness. The maximum screen brightness of the 3DS XL is quite poor--much less bright than the original 3DS. My games all look like I've got the brightness set to about halfway, but it's not. I crank the brightness level all the way up, and even leave the 3DS plugged in, but this makes no difference to the brightness level. I'm guessing Nintendo did this to conserve battery power, since the 3DS XL is bigger and requires more power to illuminate the screen. But it was a bad choice. Nintendo has always been \"backlight challenged\" when it comes to their handheld devices.  It seems they assume that everybody plays their games in a completely dark room. Remember when people had to send their Gameboy Advances to some dude on the internet to have a better backlight installed? It looks like people may need to do the same thing with the 3DS XL. Other than the brightness problem, the the 3DS XL is a great machine.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2013"}

Vehicle physics and handling are very floaty leading to some moments of extreme frustration as your character Rico swerves back and forth like a drunk, hitting a tree with a car if you are lucky, hitting a building with a Jetfighter if you aren't.  The AI isn't particular good or challenging, mostly earning its rare kills with swarming of large amounts of firepower more than any outsmarting.  And the writing, god the writing is awful.  The barely there plot is held together with embarrassingly bad voice acting.  And that beautiful open world?  Its not that open as every building is just a block, nothing inside any of them with a very few mission related exceptions.  The mission checkpoint system isn't quite broken but I doubt you'll be a fan.So what exactly is it about Just Cause 2 that demands so much time when there is just so much wrong with it?  They figured out fun.  Simply put, Just Cause 2 is the craziest game you'll ever play.  It isn't a piece of art, it isn't an Oscar winner.  This is a game that lets you tether a jeep to a 747 and use it as a wrecking ball to knock jet fighters out of the air.  It's a game that lets you para-sail behind a bus while firing rockets at an oil refinery.  Or use a grappling hook to pull snipers out of towers and machine gun them on the way down for good measure.Two major game design decisions made way for this grand entertainment.  First is Rico's grappling hook.  Used to pretty mediocre extent in the first game, the grappling hook is now indispensable.  You can hook it to any object to reel Rico in or tether objects to each other.  You can also use it as a slingshot in concert with your parachute, allowing you to get around Panau like a heavily armed Spiderman.  The grappling hook is endless entertainment.  In one of the first set pieces of the game you ride on the roof of a car while the government troops chase you in Jeeps.  You can at one point tether the jeeps to the supports of a bridge you are passing over, pulling them off the side and sending passengers screaming into a fiery wreck.  Or latch a bothersome security guard to a compressed gas canister and fire it off, watching him fly along until they both explode.The second design choice was to base the minimal story around destabilizing the government by causing chaos, that gives you reason to go to each city, base, settlement etc and blow the holy crap out of everything you can.  Run cars full speed into gas pumps, fly jets kamikaze style into oil rigs.  In GTA it is what you do when you get bored of doing the real missions, in Just Cause 2, it IS the point.  Enough chaos and you get another mission.  But chaos and nuttiness is where the game reigns supreme.There really isn't any way to properly explain this, its just somehting you have to experience, and I promise you, if you are just looking for a good time, you'll be drawn in for weeks on end.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00DBRM3G8","description":"","reviewerName":"Enlightened \"Both Eyes Closed, see what u don...","summary":"Enough is Enough...This is an unacceptable and incomplete project","reviewText":"For the past 5 years the NBA2K franchise has been my favorite gaming franchise.  With a product that kept improving every year and addictive gameplay it seemed 2KSports could do no wrong.With the leap to next gen systems, however, it seems as though 2KSports have forgotten about the fundamentals.  The number one reoccurring problem with the NBA franchise is the offensive rebounding.  For the life of me I cannot figure out why this hasn't been fixed.  You could have Shaq, Dennis Rodman and LeBron James on your team crashing the offensive glass and still get pounded on the offensive boards.  It's abysmal, it's laughable, it causes you to lose games, it causes you to put down the controller.  Pressing the jump button does nothing as your player fails to jump for the rebound.  Rebounding is just unresponsive and it's so bad that it causes you to lose games and that's where you draw the line.Passing the ball is STILL horrible.  You often throw passes past the open guy under the basket to the guy that's covered in the corner that 100% of the time gets stolen.  Grown men still throw these soft rainbow passes like they are in the third grade that always gets stolen.  There's no reason an NBA player can't pass the ball with some zip and force on it.  None whatsoever.  Pass the ball like a full grown 6'9 225 lb human being that's been playing basketball all of his life not like a 5'2 100lb third grader.  It's ridiculous in the NBA players can't throw a 5 foot chest pass to a teammate without it getting stolen or tipped.  Too many times this results in turnovers simply because the guy is open if they throw real a pass and not the BS pass the game makes you throw.  This mechanic allows defenses to get back on shooters, defenders clearly out of position have time to get back and get the steal.  It's atrocious.  This is supposed to be next generation.The instant replay is as terrible as it's ever been.  Needs a complete overhaul.  Enough said on that.You cannot create a player.  Yes you read that correctly.  I cannot open a menu and create a random player in 20-freaking-14.  The PS4 (and this game) came out November 2013 at $400 and $60 respectively.  Why on EARTH can I not create players?????  While we're on the subject...you can no longer create teams either.  While still on the subject of creation, you can barely edit rosters and draft classes and when you do you're forced to save them to the 2K server instead of on your console's hard drive...WHERE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN.  So guess what...when the servers go down (as they do frequently and lengthily) you can't even edit your rosters or draft classes (more on this later).  UNACCEPTABLE.The developers force you to create a MyPlayer before the game loads up and even so you cannot change the player's appearance.  The game comes pre-loaded with about 15 faces.  I've read somewhere that these are the developer's faces and if so I just don't see the need for them to be TROLLS.  Let the user customize their own faces!! I just don't get it.When creating a draft class you can't change the player's face nor skin complexion.  Instead you have to scroll and scroll and scroll until you find a guy that KINDA looks like how you want him to look.  You can't add tattoos...it's just a true travesty what happened to the CAP, Create A Team, and draft class.  They would have done better just completely taking it out of the game then present this farce to the public.You STILL can't edit ages of NBA players therefore you still can't play with a 19 year old KG or Vince Carter.  The only way is to try to create one in a draft class but oh yeah...you can't edit appearances so yeah...can't do it.  It seems like an entire decade went ignored when it comes to classic players and teams.  There's a few players you can play with from the 2000s in their younger form such as Tim Duncan, Shaq, Kobe, & Allen Iverson.  They weren't the only great players from their eras though.  Can I get some T-Mac and Yao Ming?  Can I get some Nash & Stoudemire??  Can I get some Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin??  Chris Webber???  2004 Pistons???I understand that a lot of the stars from that era are in the game.  Players like Vince Carter, Ray Allen, KG, Amare Stoudemire and the like are in the game as old players about to retire or as scrubs.  This of course would be a moot point if you could just EDIT THE PLAYER'S AGES which you cannot.  Reggie Miller, Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Charles Barkley are still not on the rosters to everyone's amazement.  If you can get MICHAEL JORDAN then I don't see how you cannot get those very essential players into the game.  Get it done.  Instead of doing that they chose to focus on Euro-League teams that really in the grand scheme of things nobody cares about.  Sure, it's a nice touch but I don't need those teams.  Give me the NBA players and teams past and present not some players that can't or won't make NBA teams.What really gets 2K player's blood boiling is a little something called VC.  First off, I'm not opposed to the idea of VC.  It's a basic build up points to upgrade system.  The problem lies in the amount of VC you get for playing the game versus the amount of VC things cost.  To sum it up, basically I have to play three or four games to get enough VC to be able to change my lineup in MyGM.  SAY WHAT???  Everything costs around 1000 VC on average and trust me you don't earn that much for playing through a basketball game.  I'm a patient gamer and trust me I've tried to &#34;bank&#34; VC but it just doesn't work.  Want to make a trade because the owner will get unhappy?? That will cost you 1400 VC and the reward you get for completing the owner's goal is  a lousy 100 VC.  You might as well make the owner unhappy.  Want to send your rookie to basketball camp???  1400 VC.  A quick sidenote...you can still only send a player to one camp per year.  That's so stupid. To add to that, they've taken out the ability to improve during the season via drills.  Back on the subject, simply earning VC by playing the game won't get you enough VC to actually do anything significant.Every mode pulls from the same VC account so you are frequently low on VC.  That's where the developers (or the people in charge) decided that was a place to cash in.  Of course you can buy VC!  Why didn't I think of such genius???  For the low low price $10 US you can get 35000 VC!  That's right folks....$400 for the console, $60 plus tax to prove that I own NBA 2K14 and another $10 just so I can play the game with any competence.  I just can't wait to buy more VC!!  Your VC is saved on NBA 2K's servers that go down frequently and lengthily (did the record skip???).  When the servers are down you can't earn VC.2K Servers.  Completely unacceptable.  The servers go down frequently and lengthily (it feels like I've said that before) and you CANNOT PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET!  MyGM, MyCareer, MyTeam are completely useless when the server is down.  The only mode available is Quick Game.  I repeat...after shelling out $60 for the game, if the servers go down (something completely out of your control), you may as well use the disc as a coaster until the servers get back up.There's also some minor issues that don't necessarily detract from the game but are noticeable and add up.  Players fall through the goal, fail to react to lose balls and don't move without the ball.  Your players frequently will be dribbling and just lose the ball, too many kicked balls, too many deflections on the pass, too many missed bunnies, too many missed free throws on A releases, there's a lot of contact and &#34;riding&#34; going on on defense, moving screens are too frequent, the steal animation is still terrible resulting in this unrealistic lunge that takes you completely out of the play.  I understand the &#34;you reach I teach&#34; philosophy I truly do but it's not a reach it's a LUNGE when all they really have to do is swipe at the ball.  While on the subject for some reason double tapping the steal button results in intentional fouls.It's not all bad.  The graphics are phenomenal and is most likely the best looking thing on the PS4 so far.  Some players do look a little funny (CP3, Jeff Teague, Jamal Crawford, Glen Davis) but for the most part the players look like themselves.  The players don't float on the court anymore and gameplay overall is more fluid.  The commentary is great as usual but it may be time to retire Clark Kellogg or at least have him record some new material.  The crowds are alive and they react to things that happen on the court.  It's probably the best crowd I've ever experienced in a game.  There's finally a noticeable speed and quickness difference amongst the players.  Their still isn't a noticeable height or weight difference though.  For example Shaq looks like a regular center instead of a massive human being.  The post game and halftime interviews are a nice touch and could be the start of something beautiful.The myriad of problems makes it so that you can't enjoy the game fully though.  There's a lot of frustration to be had if you spend a little time with the game.  Back in the day recommending NBA 2K was a no brainer but as is I cannot recommend this game to anyone.  Being this game was the sole reason I bought a PS4 at launch, after spending a month and half playing the game, I'm thinking I could have waited until 2k15 because it's simply not worth the upgrade.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2013"}

It was an excellent alternative to the Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat games that dominated the arcade scene. While it did not have as many characters or stages as other fighting games, it made up for it with stunning graphics, excellent music, a roster of good characters and deep gameplay that made you want to master each character. Then in 1995, Rare released Killer Instinct for the SNES shocking and surprising gamers at the same time. And it was so close to the source material that it was such a marvelous achievement from Rare and Nintendo.Killer Instinct has a story in there that no one cared for so you just jump into the action. Pick a character and you'll see the line of characters you must fight one after the other. Each character has his/her/its own moves waiting to be discovered. The game gets you acquainted to a combo system where you can string together certain moves to start a combo chain. The longer the chain, the more you get to beat up the opponent and take off more energy. To make it interesting (and to stop players from over dominating matches), each character has a \"combo breaker\" move: a certain combo then when you execute after someone tries to chain a combo, that character breaks out of it and hits your opponent at the same time. When your opponent loses all of his/her energy, you get the chance to end the match by either knocking him/her off the stage or by doing an \"end special\": a special move that you execute to unleash a barrage of combo hits earning you an \"ultra combo\" (40 or more hits in a row.) If you take too long to finish your opponent, he/she comes back to life with a little bit of energy and is extra powerful. Alongside the main mode, you can get used to the controls in the practice mode, tweak the game setting in the options screen, take on another player in the 2 player VS mode and tournament mode, where up to 8 players can duke it by passing the controller around.The PROS: For Rare to bring this game to the SNES and have it turn out as good as what Capcom did to the home port of Street Fighter II a few years before, it was quite impressive. The core game, complete with all the characters, stages and moves is intact and inside the massive, black 32 megabit cartridge. The graphics, music, sound effects and game play are worth seeing in person. The controls are very responsive and it's just a matter of memorizing the moves before you learn how to play and get better. The game will become more difficult once you raise it so prepare to fight hard. Adding the extra modes means you can get all your friends in on the action making it a fun game to play. As an special treat, Rare included a bonus music CD of the game's soundtrack and remixed tracks exclusively for the SNES version.The CONS: Due to cartridge limitations, Rare had to make cuts here and there. You will see missing frames of animations, flat 2D settings instead of the original 3D look the stages had in the arcade version, graphics running on a lower resolution setting and the music tracks playing in the background of matches are instrumental compared to the arcade versions where you heard it with the lyrics spoken (hence the reason why the music CD was included???) These are just minor quips as it doesn't deter from the overall gaming experience.Killer Instinct was worth picking up back in 1995 and is still worth playing to this very day. Those of you who want to take a chance on this better find a used copy as this game is expensive to buy as a new product. So if you still got your SNES and it works, definitely check this out. And if you can, buy the soundtrack as well; it's pretty good.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2011"}

Broken down into five distinct open-world gameplay areas, linked on the game map, cumulatively these areas comprise a massive area, much larger than anything ever seen in previousMidnight Clubreleases and possibly larger than any existing racer to date. Within these areas, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Mulholland Drive and Downtown LA, players are free to engage in mission play driving them to attain and customize a wide range of authentic world-class street racing vehicles, or to simply explore the city, taking on all comers in a variety of race types as they wish. Regardless, along the way they will experience not only the visual realism of the iconic boulevards, freeways, and landmarks made famous in TV and movies, but also the realism of the living breathing LA urban experience. Here traffic backs up then clears as people go to and leave work for the day, weather systems come and go and day turns to night, then back again. All the while the race goes on. It's all part of the living, breathing LA. It's all part of theMidnight Club.The CarsMidnight Club: Los Angeleswill feature an astounding selection of vehicles in the Muscle Car, Exotics, Tuners, Motorcycle and Luxury car categories. At the time of publishing only a fraction of the total list has been announced, but a good sampling of what players can expect at launch can be seen below.

The hottest licensed cars and bikes in the world are at your disposal - kit them out, supe them up, and personalize them down to the last detail to make them all your own. Visitthe Club'sin-game garages located in Hollywood and Santa Monica and let your imagination run wild - tweaking and fine tuning through the following three different types of vehicle modifications:Performance &amp; Handling- To become a street legend, you're going to have to tune your vehicle for maximum performance. The garage offers three levels of upgrades for virtually every component on your vehicle, but it's up to you to craft the winning combination that will give you the edge on the competition.Exterior- For the Midnight Club, stunting is a habit and its clandestine Los Angeles garages have all the toys needed to ensure heads turn in this jaded town. From making sure your car is dripping in candy paint, to adding unique body kits and jaw dropping extras, the garage offers practically limitless possibilities to personalize your vehicle with aftermarket accessories and customizable options.Interior- Don't embarrass yourself by pulling up with an outrageously kitted-up car that has a 'me-too' factory interior. Not a good look! You're going to be spending a lot of time behind the wheel, so renovate and make yourself feel comfortable.Beware or Befriend the Local CompetitionThe street racing scene ofMidnight Clubis tough, but tight, meaning that everyone that you meet in expansiveLos Angelescould just as easily be an ally as an enemy. One thing is for certain though, they are all willing to throw down at the drop of a hat. Just a few of the faces you'll encounter out on the streets are:Karol, Age 45- A veteran of Moscow's underground street racing circuit, Karol moved to LA in the 1990's after the collapse of the Soviet Union. If you're looking for cars, he's your man. He owns two successful garages and claims to be able to get hold of any vehicle, no questions asked. He also sees himself as a philosopher and will bend your ear if you left him. He mostly races around Hollywood and the Beaches and his rides include a 1975 Datsun 280Z, 1969 Boss Mustang 302, 2006 Dodge Challenger and a 1971 Lamborghini Miura SV.Annie, Age 31- Annie has a rep as one of the fiercest drivers in the city. She detests posers and wannabes, is intelligent and sharp-tongued and pulls no punches when it comes to cutting the competition down to size. She has been spotted in everything from a 1983 VW Golf GTI, 2006 Pontiac Solstice, 2008 Chrysler 300C SRT-8, 2008 Audi RS4 and a 2004 Ford Shelby Cobra Concept and can usually be found hanging out near Pink's Hotdog Stand in Hollywood along with her crew.Rockstar Games Social Club: Join the CommunityBeing a Rockstar gameMidnight Club: Los Angelescomes with a huge commitment to the gaming community.

With the extended wait for this release, I had high hopes and Rockstar delivered on every one of them. The graphics on here are much smoother than on Rockstar's other big release this year, Grand Theft Auto IV. Frames flow seamlessly and this game looks incredible when played on your HDTV. When you first pop this game in and start your career, you're given a horrible hooptie that you're expected to start winning races with. Don't be discouraged, this game is pretty hard at the start but once you get into the flow of things, you'll find yourself winning races, racking up cash, and driving much nicer vehicles.If you're looking for a storyline, you're better off going with Need For Speed Undercover, because Midnight Club LA has no storyline. Sure, you'll meet people along the way and there's a few cut scenes here and there, but this game is all about customization and racing.The customization possibilities on here are literally endless. You are given full access to every shade of every color imaginable, as well as all sorts of shapes, designs, and letters that you can use to create whatever your heart desires on your car. Once you have your car looking the way you want, be sure to upload it to Rate My Ride and check out the creations of others while you're at it. If you're confident in your work and you make your ride purchaseable, you stand the chance at making some free money from others buying it. Your ride can sell online an unlimited number of times, and all the while you get to keep it along with the cash it makes. The one flaw with this that I've noticed is that once your ride gets 8 or 9 ratings, it really sits without being rated at all after that, and you're better off deleting it and reuploading it for a chance at more ratings.One thing we were disappointed in with this game is the omission of custom soundtracks. You do have the option of playing music directly from your PS3 harddrive while playing the game, but it makes it pretty much impossible to change songs easily while you're racing like you can with the game's built-in soundtrack. Also, you cannot play your music while playing online.The gameplay itself is great. This may be the best racer yet released for the PS3 or Xbox360. Los Angeles is absolutely stunning, especially when viewed at 200+ miles an hour. There's not as many gigantic jumps on here like there were in Midnight Club 3, but there's still a decent amount of air to be had. There are also 60 collectibles (yellow Rockstar canisters) hidden throughout the city. When you find these, you can open up all sorts of different cheats, but the cheats cannot be used in races if you want to earn cash or further your progress. The game also brings back the use of special abilities. Agro, Roar, and Zone are all back once again, and MC:LA introduces us to a fourth special ability called Emp. Emp releases an electric charge that temporarily disables all of the cars around you. It's interesting, but it can be very frustrating when used. If your opponent is directly in front of you and you use Emp, your opponents car reacts wildly and you really have to watch yourself or you could end up in a messy situation. Whereas with Agro or Roar, if your opponent is in front of you and you use either of those, there's little to no possibility of you crashing into them.Online play is decent but does come with a few flaws. The frames get jerky at times, and at other times during a race your opponents cars appear out of nowhere, or appear to drive right through you. Other than that it works, and the ability to earn cash in online races is an added bonus, although it's not nearly as much as you earn during regular play.Overall, Midnight Club Los Angeles packs a punch worth every penny. If you're a fan of any of the earlier Midnight Club releases, or just a fan of racing games in general, I would highly recommend this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000WINB56","description":"","reviewerName":"M.D. Edwards \"Avid Aesthete\"","summary":"Provides a very different, soothing experience on the Wii.","reviewText":"This game was the first one that I got with my Wii, and I still enjoy playing it a few years after owning it.The game play provided by \"Endless Oceans\" is completely different from any other game out there. It's not got any real sort of competitive angle to it at all, outside of SCUBA diving in different venues in an effort to \"collect\" as many different species of marine life as you can. Playing \"Endless Oceans\", to me, is all about developing a love of the beauty of the ocean, and all that it contains. It's also a VERY soothing game play experience, in that you're not under any pressure while searching out different species during your dives. The only restrictions that the game puts on your dives is by way of the amount of air that's in your tank, which is a real-world SCUBA consideration, anyway.You progress through the game via time invested in your dives, missions that you take to lead visitors and clients on dives, your searches for creatures, and the depth of your interaction with said creatures. The Wii remote is utilized very well with this game, in your shaking it from side to side to scratch or pet the creatures that you encounter. The more time that you spend petting them, and occasionally feeding them, the more familiar you become with them, allowing you to collect them for inclusion in the large reef tank that you'll add them to later in the game.Having grown up in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the water's crystal clear and contains many different varieties of sea life, this is a game that I pull out to remind me a little of the waters that I've left behind in favor of four seasons and snowy vistas. At the end of a stressful work day, this is a great game to pull out and relax with. I even sometimes find myself becoming so immersed in it that the larger creatures that I encounter and the deeper waters that I dive to actually can freak me out a little, the effect is so realistic and engaging. The way that your character moves through the game is very reminiscent of the way you move through deep water, and it can get disorienting if you're just getting used to the controls, but it's really very fun and clever. Just watch out if you suffer from vertigo, because this game can really get it going!The game play with \"Endless Oceans\" is good, as are the graphics, but they're not great. Things can be a little herky-jerky, so I honestly can't wait for the sequel to come out. I'm really looking forward to seeing what the game developers have added in, and how well they've improved on the graphics and gameplay. If the trailer is any indication, it's going to be a great improvement to an already good, and different, game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2010"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end? Discover their fate inBorderlands.GameplayAs in a traditional RPG,Borderlandsis built around the continual leveling of characters as they delve into quests. These quests include both story-driven adventures and side quests that offer players rewards such as items exclusive to quest completion and/or forward movement of the story. Players can look forward to action set in both single player and multiplayer modes--including co-op play--as well as vehicular combat, literally thousands of different types of weapons that change each time you play and randomly generated maps and map features.Playable CharactersBorderlandsfeatures several playable characters, each with its own unique backstory, abilities and skills. Skills can be leveled up, allowing for improvement of things like health, accuracy with weapons and capacity for items. In addition to this, characters possess unique skill tree development, ensuring that each will develop differently regardless of time spend leveling them up.Key Game FeaturesCo-op Design-Borderlandsis built from the ground up to be an exciting, intuitive cooperative experience for up to four players simultaneously that rewards players who work together and invest in co-op skills. Split screen is also supported.FPS Gameplay- In this role-playing shooter, choose one of four distinct characters, each with their own individual skill sets. As your character grows throughout this fast-paced FPS, you choose and customize your abilities to suit your style of play.Art Style- The game's distinctive art style combines traditional rendering techniques with hand-drawn textures to paint a bold and eye-catching spin on the FPS genre.Vehicular Combat- Jump behind the wheel and engage in high-speed vehicle-to-vehicle combat, complete with spectacular explosions and road-killed Skags.Frontier Planet- Search the wasteland planet of Pandora for the legendary alien vault.

Co-op is the way to go and it becomes highly addictive. We've gone through The Vault level on playthroughs 1 and 2 and are doing some of the side missions now and the level of difficulty has ramped up - almost straight up! Sure, you're Level 50 now and have plenty of orange, purple, blue, etc weapons to deal out incredible firepower...But the enemies just swarm you and deal out a huge amount of hurt also. This adds so much replay value that most games are missing. You beat the game once on playthrough 1, beat it again on playthrough 2 and then they throw the kitchensink at you...I LOVE IT!There are only a few things I didn't care for. First, the GAME SAVE system. Someone who plays RPGs regularly is probably familiar with \"character saves\". As someone who never plays RPGs, this whole game save, game load thing was a mess and really screwed us up on Level 17 one night. We tried to go through the LOAD GAME function the next day and it's anything but straightforward. What happened to a simple SAVE GAME, LOAD GAME menu where you pick up from the last place you saved? Well, we did something wrong and all of a sudden one of us was Level 17 and the other fell all the way back to starting over at Level ONE. The fact that this can even occur is a head scratcher. This sufficiently screwed-up our game all the way through completion because upgrades that had been earned were deleted in the second character and were never recovered. There are no \"instructions\" detailing the game load function and no warnings that you're about to start over at level one until it happens. Turns out, you actually have to go into the PS3 game save menu and select individual game saves for each of your characters prior to loading the game. This is just stupidly complicated and I'm sure it has needlessly resulted in similar frustrating experiences for other Borderlands players.Second, the vehicle driving has the ridiculous \"dual-function\" stick control. Blacksite: Area 51 is the other game I encountered with this stupid control feature. The same stick that steers the vehicle also controls the camera view - AT THE SAME TIME! Instead of a fixed view behind the vehicle while driving, every time you turn the vehicle, the camera view swings from side to side making it nearly impossible to drive without running into objects until you finally get somewhat used to it. If people really drove like this, the highways would be littered with casualties.The other thing that bothered me was how under-armed you are in the beginning. You really need to buy additional weapons before you go after Bone Head. His crew will repeatedly mow you down if you walk in there with basic pistols/rifles and try to take them on. This isn't really \"explained\" anywhere, but you kind of figure it out by trial and error. After you start acquiring more powerful weaponry, the game is no longer difficult and it becomes much more enjoyable. I also didn't care for the dollar limitation of $9,999,999. After you exceed the limit, there's little incentive to scavenge for more $$$ or sell weapons for $$$. There shouldn't be a visual limit here because you can still gather more money...You just don't have a clue about how much more than $9,999,999 you actually have!?!This is the only game that I've ever been afraid to turn off at night for fear of losing all progress! Other than these \"inconveniences\", Borderlands was a load of fun! Co-op works great most of the time unless one player is cycling through their inventory menus while the other is in a firefight...Then things can lag and create video interference. This was a very creative game where you soon learn all of the characters and creatures on Pandora and feel like you see them every day when you walk out of the house...Fortunately you don't really see Skags wandering around the neighborhood, though! What a GREAT game!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0002SQ0AY","reviewerName":"Mark Hills \"Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!\"","summary":"Too long, too limited, too slow and too boring!","reviewText":"Before I get into my review I want to make one thing clear: Suikoden IV or any game like it (Neverwinter Nights, Final Fantasy, Knights of the Old Republic, etc.) are not role playing games. The way I see it they are adventure games with limited character interactions. To me a role playing game involves sitting around a table with friends, dice and rule books while game master weaves his tale of adventure. A video game cannot hope to capture the detail, the immediacy, and possibilities that can and do occur in a well constructed, well balanced, rip-roaring epic spread across medieval fantasy nations or star-spanning empires. With that in mind, I still enjoy many games like the ones I listed, I just detach myself from any notion of actually playing a role and accepting that I will be following a carefully scripted series of events.On that note I have to say that Suikoden IV is at best a mediocre outing from the video adventure game outing. The graphics are substandard, even for the aging Playstation 2 hardware; the music is entertaining with its cheesy synthesizer sound track, and the story and characters are weak. Suikoden IV divorces the player so much from even most other so-called role playing games- you have NO control over any of your character's stats, abilities, or weapons and only limited input on magic items or equipment, thanks to a limited number of equipment slots for items. Most damming, however, is the almost criminal lack of input when it comes to making decisions in conversations, asking questions, etc. The main character often simply stands and stares, complacent and bovine, yet always looking doleful.You play the role of a Knight of Gaien on the eve of graduation and the adventure takes place in an archipelago, complete with ships and merry pirate crews. Arrr. Bad things happen to the Hero when it runs up against the pirate Brandeau and acquires the Rune of Punishment and is later accused of murder and forced into exile with a few of his close friends. You spend an utterly inordinate amount of time traveling between tiny islands on a relatively small map, which isn't so bad except you can barely travel a boat length before having an encounter with monsters. The first few times is interesting as you learn the best combos of magic items and runes, but when it turns into literally hundreds of encounters the battles get tedious very quickly. And combat is little more than selecting what you want your party to do then watch it happen then repeat as often as needed to kill the bad guys. At least travel time is cut done once you meet Viki, a wizard who teleports you where you want to go.The only other bright spot in the game are the naval battles, but even they get dull fast because again your control and options are very minimal. You select which characters man the magical rune cannons then give your commands and watch it happen. There is very little pretense of strategy save for knowing which elemental rune beats the runes possessed by the other side. Also, the game provides you with no diaries, logs or screens that list completed, in progress or pending quests. Graphically, the game resembles first generation PS2 or any PC game circa 1996- textures are dull, low rez, and bland. Objects are low detail and clunky looking- you can't pick up or interact with the environment in any way. Map areas are small and load screens are often longer than it takes to move from one area to the next. You can't climb or jump and low curbs like sidewalks stop your guy cold. On the other hand the static character art (from menu screens, etc.) is first rate, which typical for the Suikoden series.All in all, given the technology and capabilities provided by the current generation consoles, this is a very substandard outing. Even Xenosaga had more interesting characters and story lines. Suikoden IV seems like it continues through inertia rather than generating a real interest from the story and its people. It's a dull, lifeless spectacle. It doesn't reward cleverness or good ideas, though there is little reason to since you're basically on rails through out the whole adventure. And like a six hour lecture on the differences between pre and post Columbian pottery, you start wondering when it's going to end.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2005"}

It does not send game audio (music/sound fx) to the headset.  You have to plug the amp into your gaming console with the headphone jack.  This can be tricky (ie: if you use HDMI for PS3, then you have to set it up for multiple sound outputs and connect the old scart cable with RCA outputs), but the instructions are easy to follow and work.  The main problem with this is that you have to change your setup every time you switch consoles.  Depending on your television and/or reciever, you may be able to set this up with so that you don't have to change it every time you switch.The RCA splitter cable should allow you to connect this to your TV output or your Wii/PS2/original XBOX/DVD/ etc.  They included wires for just about every standard audio input you might need.You can unplug the headset from the amplifier and plug them into your phone/tablet/etc for audio only (no chat).The sound quality is excellent for my needs.  These are stereo headphones, so do not expect surround sound.There is a nifty spot to plug your phone into the PX22 remote box so that you don't have to take the headphones off when you get a call.  Just plug the phone in...play your game, when you get a call accept it and move the remote switch to phone and boom.  It's a pretty nice feature.The biggest negative for me is that it's wired...I much prefer wireless (although batteries can be an issue if you have an extended gaming session).  If this headset were wireless, it would replace all of my gaming headsets.In conclusion, I think this headset is perfect for anyone who likes multi-player gaming on multiple systems.  The price is excellent for the quality.If you have any questions, please post in the comments.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00004U1R3","description":"Paper Mariohas a 2-D look in a 3-D game world--an aesthetic designed to make players feel as if they've entered an animated pop-up book. A stationary camera helps reinforce this storybook illusion. The game's title is taken from the paper-thin characters inhabiting the Mushroom Kingdom. For example, when Mario is sleeping, he flips and flutters through the air like a leaf falling from a tree.Paper Mariois the sequel to the classic Super NES role-playing gameSuper Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. Like the original, it contains a mix of turn-based battles and intricate puzzles, as well as timed attacks. Players time their attacks by moving the D-pad and pressing the A button at exactly the right moment to inflict maximum damage. This seasonsPaper Mariowith a little action/adventure flavor. Classic characters, such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, and Toad, are joined by the likes of Goombario and Kammy Koopa.","reviewerName":"TigerPomme \"tigerpomme\"","summary":"One of the better attempts at an RPG involving Mario so far.","reviewText":"It's funny how things work out. I was one of the lucky few to acquire a Sony PS2 on time and yet all of my latest game purchases are for the dying Nintendo 64. Paper Mario is the latest in the N64 line up, and one of Nintendo's better iterations staring Mario and his gang. Naturally I'm disappointed in the absence of ALL of the characters. But that is a minor complaint since very few of the characters in the Mario world have a part big enough to justify playing themMario's flattened appearance in a 3D world takes an open mind to appreciate. Initially, I really didn't like the game since it seemed a bit haphazard. When I saw the first commercials on television, I was expecting the characters to appear and behave much like the Um Jammy Lammy (for the PSX) characters. Where characters would fold and bend much like real pieces of paper. Paper Mario kind of falls flat here (literally) the characters are more like pieces of cardboard, inflexible with the same image on both sides. The game's battles occur on a sort of stage complete with hanging props in the background (look for the guy wires), I sincerely wish the rest of the game occurred on a sort of stage as well (In a more obvious manner). Kind of disappointing really.Getting past the &quot;faked&quot; paper, the game is actually kind of fun. The storyline is the usual &quot;Save the Princess&quot; kind of thing that Nintendo used since day one. But the actual game play is sufficient enough to keep a player amused for around thirty-six hours. After that, it's another few hours to squeeze every last secret out of the game. The addition of the &quot;helper&quot; characters and their families play a crucial part in adding the extra time to the game. I spent a lot of time running around, doing useless errands for various characters for who knows what kind of useless thing. I never once traded anything for the star pieces I collected, I never had the need to. Once a player has discovered everything there is to know about the game, the game's replay value diminishes rapidly. It's a safe bet that we're going to see this game on the Amazon.com marketplace.The game's lack of appeal to older players and the late appearance on a dying game may be what kills this title. This is a better title for the younger players since the controls and camera work will not frustrate all but the absolute worst players. Or for players who insist on owning every game that Mario ever appears in. I know this is a weird thing to say but the $49.99 price tag (as of this writing) is worth the admission, despite the less than forty hours of game play. Nintendo is heading in the right direction with the paper look of Mario. This sort of game will bring Nintendo back to ground zero after the disappointment of Mario 64 and the other games involving Mario (and lack thereof of Luigi). Are you listening Nintendo? How about more games like this with the smooth camera work and responsive controls?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2001"}

Rossi","summary":"Like Thief, but better","reviewText":"I wasn't a big fan of this game when I first started playing, but now that I've logged over 40 hours and finished the game a couple times (and in process on a third) I have to say it is an excellent game. The missions are very well thought out and as are the weapons and abilities.  I did have a problem with the game crashing on the first play-through, but it was solved by going to an earlier save.  The game allows you to play as an assassin killing everything that moves, but it rewards you for sneaking and for choking characters out instead of killing them.  There are many paths and options on how to achieve your goals.  I highly recommend this game to anyone with a bit of patience.  This is a first person shooter/sneaker and you can customize how your character improves (skills and weapons) as you play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000WS97QI","reviewerName":"Christopher Deweese","summary":"Bad to the Bone","reviewText":"Bad Company is turning out to be quite a surprise for me.  I was hooked from the moment I popped it into my PS3.  Great graphics, sound design, physics, and environments are but some of the highlights of this gem.  The dialogue and cut scenes are pretty good.  I enjoy watching the guys play rock paper scissors in the background.  The weapons seem realistic and are quite satisfying.  I do have two gripes about the game though.  First, it has crashed on me 2 or 3 times already.  Second, why is it that the tanks always seem to find me and kill me but not my buddies?  That's a minor complaint because overall the game is great.  It's a worthy, albeit quirky, addition to the Battlefield series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2008"}
