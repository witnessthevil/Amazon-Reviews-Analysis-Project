The game moves relatively slow because of the dialog and there is no way of skipping chunks of dialog at a time. The combat is pretty simple and makes for less tedious leveling up of characters. I'm rating it lower than perfect because the story isn't as well developed as the FF series, I found it less interesting than it could have been.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"Bowman373","summary":"A refreshing, excellent addition to the series, albeit with some flaws.","reviewText":"Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag is really one of those games that hooks you, whether or not you're an Assassin's Creed fan yet. Going into this game, I had every AC game except the original under my belt, so I was definitely excited to play this one. The hype for it was massive, and it certainly delivered! I'll divide this review into the two main sections of the game: Story & Gameplay.STORY:Unfortunately, the story was one of the weakest parts of AC4. In past AC games, we're used to riveting stories with some of the most memorable characters, stories that both make sense and are a fun ride. While this game opened pretty strongly, and the first half or so was pretty good story-wise, the last half is just a drag and you find yourself just not caring about any of the characters anymore. Although the new main character as well as a couple of the supporting ones are good, others are just plain awful. For example, I found the main Assassin master in the game to be one of the most boring, uninteresting characters in it. That's not good at all, and even though the gameplay outweighs this con by a lot, I still was disappointed that the story and characters in this game were generally lackluster.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay is what really saves AC4. It stays true to the traditional easy to pick up, hard to master Assassin's Creed gameplay, and adds some minor tweaks to improve it where it can. The downside to that is we still have some of the ever-lingering problems that we've seen with the series, such as the sometimes-inaccurate freerunnning and annoying weapon switching. Even though there were some interesting elements added into combat, it's still a bit over-simplistic and button-mashy. The naval combat is undoubtedly one of the most memorable parts of the game. You have your own ship that you're free to use and upgrade however you choose, and exploring the entirety of the Caribbean in this badboy will provide you with many hours of fun. It's even cleverly added into some campaign & side missions as well, allowing you to seamlessly go from land to sea without any loading whatsoever. And boarding ships in true pirate fashion, brawling it out with the crew, and collecting your plunder? Easily some of the most fun things about the game. AC4 allows you to explore every nook and cranny of the Caribbean, and this is one of its major strengths. Although most of the campaign missions are fairly linear, this open-world exploration makes for many hours of pure fun and entertainment along your ride. You're greatly encouraged to explore, as exploring will allow you to find new places, missions, and upgrades to your character. There's a very wide variety of missions and tasks in this game, nearly all of them rewarding. That being said, it still has some bad missions, and some ever-annoying gameplay elements such as eavesdropping and tailing will bore you to death at times. Fortunately, these can easily be overlooked when compared to the game's beautiful graphics, naval combat, and variety of things to do. It even has a multiplayer mode as well, which I haven't been able to check out extensively yet. However, the multiplayer leaves plenty of room for customization and fun with friends.OVERALL:AC4: Black Flag is a wonderful game, boasting great graphics and mostly excellent gameplay. It's at its best when it doesn't try to be an Assassin's Creed game, and this is completely fine. Some of the issues plaguing the series are still here, but these can be overlooked when compared to the rest of the fun things to do throughout your journey. With an extensive multiplayer and lots of DLC, combined with its excellent story mode, AC4 is one of the must-have games of the year, for AC diehards and newcomers alike.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2014"}

Must be finished!!","reviewText":"I got a copy of R6V2 last night and I have to say that I really welcome the only 4 new additions they implemented on this game in which are (character customation, Sprint - like COD4, co-op mission gameplay online, and online/offline rank up system.I am a huge fan of Rainbow Six series and by far, I like this game a lot more than the first Vegas. Eventhough a lot of you might feel the game is basically just an expansion, for that reason alone is why I like it a lot better than the first. Being able to sprint was something I always wanted in a Rainbow six game, co-op mission gameplay with a buddy online is also something I really welcomed in this game, the ranking system in which is not limited to just online play is simply an incentive for playing this game. And last, but not least, I was able to use my 360 web cam to take a shot of my face and place it on the character................. yes, I know you were able to do this on the first Vegas,,,, but now it doesnt just limits for this to be just online, you can have an image of yourself on the character during the campaing as well.To summarize, some of you might have expected a lot more, but as a Rainbow Six fan, I have to say that even if it did not change much from the previous one, the new additions fit well on the game, the graphics are a bit more polished and the game itself kicks arse. And to top it off, it runs as smooth as the first, if not better.Stop complaining and go get this game. I tripple dare you..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2008"}

It is just amazing how encompassing this game is. We just hit 100% on the entire game and have to say it was a lot of fun to get through it.In a world where games can be won and ended in a day or two, it is so satisfying to have a games that literally lasts weeks and is fun from start to finish. The humor in these Lego games is amazing. The little looks, the interactions are so funny. Whoever creates these games really should get a lot of credit for it. You get sucked into the story, become fond of the characters and really enjoy the ride.You get all three Indiana Jones moves in here - with detailed scene by scene recreations. In addition there are extra levels for Young Indiana Jones and the traditional smash-all-you-can level as well. There are tons of in-jokes - many characters from Star Wars make appearances in here.The basic operation of the game is that you and a friend (or a computer AI) go romping through a Lego recreation of a given scene from the movie. Maybe you're running to escape a giant rolling ball. Maybe you're wandering around a mysterious library looking to create a letter X. Whatever it is, you bash everything you see, breaking the Lego pieces apart, earning coins to then buy new characters, special unlocks, and much more. There are puzzles to solve, enemies to bash, but it's all in good fun. It's not violent (although I suppose some might say that having a little Indiana Jones take his whip and cause a little tribesman to fall into Lego component parts is violent).It's not just a game for kids - as adults, my boyfriend and I have had great fun with both Lego games. It's neat that a second player can \"pop in\" at any time, play along for a while to help out, and then \"pop out\" again.I would love to see more movies go through the Lego process. How about Lego Lord of the Rings? That would be incredible :) Until then, though, I definitely recommend Lego Indiana Jones.Rating: 5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2008"}

Lush enviorments, beautiful shadows and lighting as the characters move throughout the areas, and the transition between one area to another without much use of a load screen was nice to experience in the game. The battle system can be a bit clunky at times, especially while using healing items, but overall combat is fun. The game actually reminded me somewhat of Fable. It's not very long, I finished it in under 30 hours. It's too bad there won't be a Sudeki 2. I think with a few tweeks, it could be a good franchise. But, at least I got a chance to play the game.

{"product_name":"B002ZJNWWC","description":"","reviewerName":"YO","summary":"To many people comparing!","reviewText":"To me this game is unique especially the tier one mode in campaign. It is a true challenge for anyone that's been playing fps's sense they first came out. It's fun because of the challenge 3-4 bullets kill you and no checkpoints, plus they are timed. You can easily get through them within the time limit. However not dieing while doing so is a challenge. The overall campaign story is typical of a fps, also it is typical because of the extreme shortness. There is replay value though within the tier one mode and multi player. I have herd a lot of kids going crazy because they do not like the online and same with gameing sites. I have to agree that it needs a lot of work. I have gotten the cruise missile and it is a HUGE bomb and its rewarding because what you have to do to get it. Although there are a lot of camping snipers, which leads me to the fact that one bullet kills with the sniper if it hits your chest region and sometimes a limb. This gets annoying so I have learned to avoid them by staying away from combat mission online mode. The overall experience is not as annoying as COD but not as good as I wanted it to be, I was expecting bfbc2 size maps with kill streaks but that's not the case. The only other problem with the online that I have is the lack of weapons, I mean really how can you make an online multiplayer without atleast 20 - 30 guns? Oh and the maps get old real fast... If you think this game will be amazing like I did you will be let down, so don't buy it unless your a platinum trophy freak like me or want to play something else till cod bo.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"A great console from Nintendo back in '96","reviewText":"Things would have been drastically different if Nintendo and Sony had indeed joined forces without any fallout or drama. As the days of the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis systems were winding down, gamers were looking ahead to the next big thing in video gaming. Sega was working on a new game console while Nintendo and Sony joined forces to bring out a new game console as well. However, at the last minute, Nintendo and Sony parted ways. Nintendo decided that the business arrangements and agreements weren't good for them and they secretly made a deal with Phillips to make another game console. Sony was so infuriated by this betrayal that they decided to enter the game console race themselves. The Sony Playstation was released to the public in the fall of 1995 and faced off against the Sega Saturn. After its deal with Phillips fell through, Nintendo released the Nintendo 64 in 1996 and for the first time, they had an uphill battle on their hands.The Nintendo 64 is a cartridge based console system that came bundled with one controller, unique because no one ever saw a three handle controller designed quite like it did doing those times. It was also built with 4 controller ports so that up to 4 players can play at the same time, thus ushering it the \"multi player party\" theme the N64 was associated with: games made to support up to 4 players. Though it was initially released as a black console, Nintendo released the N64 in other colors and also started bundling it with different games. Later on, they released the expansion pack, which added 4 MB of processing power for third party developers to take advantage of. Then came the rumble pack, an accessory that you plugged into your controller and gives force feedback depending on what game you played. The N64 would be the last home console Nintendo makes that uses cartridges.The PROS: The N64 is a sturdy piece of equipment. It's made of high quality and was meant to last for a very long time (I would know; I bought mine in 1997 and to this date, it STILL works.) It's very easy to snap on a cartridge or a controller so you will be playing quickly any time. Also, Nintendo's library of games is pretty impressive despite competition from the Playstation.The CONS: Like I said before, the N64 uses cartridges. The Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn both used CDs, which was able to store more data and because of its media size, it's much bigger than what a N64 cartridge could hold. It was the main reason why most developers were willing to and able to develop more games for Sony and Sega while Nintendo had limited third party support for much of its lifespan. In the end, the PS game library was more diverse since certain franchises started with Sony's system and never saw the light of day on the N64.Nintendo's battle with the Playstation showed that they made some mistakes that would cost them dearly. They weren't on top like they used to be, lost die hard fans from the NES/SNES days and finally had to acknowledge Sony as a worthy competitor in the video game world. Despite all the setbacks Nintendo were dealt with, the N64 still managed to stay in the game and be the host to great Nintendo games and excellent third party games from those developers who did show some support. If you were a fan of Nintendo, you bought a N64. If you never did, it's a worthy investment since you can pick one up and several games at bargain prices. I still have my N64 and games so I take it out every once in a while. It brought a lot of good memories and reminds me of what happened during those times and how different the video gaming world is today.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2011"}

The biggest flaw is the simple fact that you start with the Warp Star and have to unlock the rest of the machines which could take forever given that each machine is set at a different speed and it means taking the fastest route without crashing into walls or ghost collision at the top of the game. The soundtrack for each stage is amazing and every stage is themed (and I dare say after an element). Frozen Hillside and Magma Overflow are still my favorite level.Top Ride is a small multiplayer mode (then again all of the modes are multiplayer). You play on an extremely small course trying to complete it the fastest. This game I found was boring since hitting your opponent was similar in the other modes of the game only you get controls that hardly work and the computer is so perfect with its steering on the higher levels.City Trial is probably where you'll be spending most of the game doing. In this game, you're thrown into the city on a Compact Star (weaker than Warp Star) and have 3-7 minutes to collect power ups in the city to power up your machine (from increasing the attack to increasing the boost, etc.) Your usually put up against 3 other computers doing the same thing and more times than not, they'll leave you alone to collect their own power ups. City trail is so open though in which you can do almost anything. You can switch your air ride machine, collect power ups, participate in the events that occur in the city (such as destroying the pillar or attacking Dyno Blade) and even attacking your opponents, destroying their machine and stealing their power ups. There are many weapons in the city to choose from sword Kirby to setting time bombs in the ground where it blows up if someone hovers over it. At the end of the time limit, you are thrown into a random event and whoever completes the objective wins (from racing a stage from the main game to defeating a certain amount of enemies to KOing King DDD). Sometimes the game foreshadows what event will happen on the bottom of the screen while other times it keeps you guessing. You can set it up where it will only be a specific thing if your'e trying to get a certain achievement (but even with the racing, the stages are random). The best part though is collecting the three pieces of the Hydra or Dragoon star and wrecking your opponent in the city and outside of it given how overpowered these machines are.Overall, why the game was not well received when it came out, it's a cult classic now with how original the game was that set it apart from Mario Kart Double Dash and F Zero.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000ZJVDA2","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Average old school RPG with a next-gen paint job","reviewText":"Lost Odyssey may be a next-gen game, but its roots are definitely in the old school world of turn-based, RPG gaming.  Lost Odyssey follows the story of Kaim: a brooding immortal on a mission of self-discovery.  Or something.  The story is kind of hard to follow, with prolonged sequences that attempt to flesh out the game's story and characters.  The characters of Lost Odyssey themselves are great and interesting on their own, but they're stuck in a run of the mill story we've seen in RPG's before, and will more than likely see again.  The game's turn-based combat is where the real meat and potatoes of Lost Odyssey is to be found though, with some great animations and some excellent uses of spells and skills development.  What really hurts Lost Odyssey though is that the non-battle gameplay elements are just plain boring.  You'll feel as if you're doing a ton of backtracking throughout the game, which is nothing new to the RPG world, but here it just seems more noticeable than anything else.  Also, there are some really long loading times that populate throughout the game and detract from the gameplay experience, along with some technical issues and frame-rate problems that pop-up from time to time.  Flaws aside, Lost Odyssey is a mostly gorgeous, lengthy, turn-based RPG that long time fans of the genre should get some enjoyment out of, just don't expect anything real special here.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Davidovich53","summary":"A Star Wars game that's actually (gasp) good...","reviewText":"...and not just a half-baked product placement tool. BioWare's decision to make the game pre-date the movies was a great one because it gave them considerable creative freedom, even within the confines of the Star Wars brand.The biggest reason why KOTOR won over 40 game-of-the-year awards (yes, over 40) is not because you get to swing a double-bladed lightsaber around and use Force powers; it's because of the story! A strong plot is crucial for every RPG, and KOTOR doesn't disappoint. This plot of course includes one of the biggest twists in video game history (all you fans out there know what I'm talking about! If you don't, then go out and buy this game now).The game's principal characters, while somewhat stereotypical (i.e. Bastila is the condescending socialite snob, Carth is the tough loner with a troubled past, etc), work very well together and have good chemistry, including with you, the created character. For example, if you play as a female character, it soon becomes obvious that Carth develops feelings for you, but he feels slightly guilty because he lost his wife not too long ago. You'll also find yourself acting as mediator when some of your allies don't get along with each other, i.e. Canderous and Carth, because they fought on opposite sides in the Mandalorian Wars that took place five years before. And aside from the character development, the game feels very rich in its \"Star Wars-ness\" -- for example, some of the names that BioWare came up with for the planets and people feel and sound like George Lucas himself approved them.Despite what I said earlier in this review, cutting down your enemies with a lightsaber and looking good doing it has got to be one of the joys of KOTOR. I admit that when I first got to Dantooine and was on the verge of becoming a Jedi, I was trembling at excitement that I was going to build my own lightsaber, as I wondered what color I was going to choose.Having said all that, there are some things that keep this game from getting 5 stars. I felt the game was a bit linear (being able to choose your planets in any order only gives the ILLUSION of open-ended gameplay). I was hoping that the storyline would be different depending on whether I decide to be evil or good, but everything plays the same, save a few minor events and certain conversations. Also, there is a \"doorway bug\" that causes you to sometimes get stuck when moving through a doorway or narrow corridors. When this happens you can wiggle the thumbstick and free yourself; I've never had any real problems with this bug, but it can get distracting. Also I found moving around in the menu screens to be problematic; you press start to go to the main menu, then you pull the trigger buttons to move between the screens, but often I have to pull the trigger multiple times before the game responds. Also, I'm sure many people would agree that the game's graphics are not up to Xbox standards; even the PS2 is capable of doing better! I don't usually gripe about graphics, but the textures on some background buildings on Taris are downright laughable.Overall, I have to give BioWare serious Kudos for taking on a daunting task like creating a new Star Wars game, and I sing their eternal praises for actually making it fun. It is not a stretch to say that I bought an Xbox just to play KOTOR (and a few other titles, but that's another story), and I'm glad I made the investment.

When you play certain types of games a lot (especially games that are online-multiplayer), you have to be fast. You have to know your controller well, so that pressing the buttons don't require thought, or your reaction time will be way too slow. If you play with the same type of controller all the time and don't switch out, you'll be more accurate with your movements.I play Call of Duty games online on both our xBox and the PS3. I use the PS3 most of the time, but have also put some time in on the xBox. The difference between the PS3 controllers and the xBox controllers is the location of the D-pad and the left joystick. On the PS3, both joysticks are side by side, with the D-pad located above the left stick. This is switched on the xBox controller, so the D-pad is beside the right stick and the left stick is above the D-pad. Once you are use to one style of controller, it's hard to switch to another.So why would anyone want to play on the PS3 when they prefer the xBox? Just as there are games like Halo that only come out for playing on the xBox, there are also games likeUncharted 3: Drake's DeceptionandinFAMOUSthat are only available on the PS3. So if you want to play them, it has to be done on a PlayStation. But rather than try and play the games with that feels like a backwards controller to xBox users (using a PS3 controller), using this xBox style controller will make playing much easier.Comparing this controller to a standard PS3 controller doesn't really work, because this is meant for those who prefer the xBox controller and want to play games on the PS3. This is great for that. It has the same size and shape as the standard xBox 360 controllers, and after 3 hours of playingCall of Duty: Ghostsonline last night with it, the controller still felt great in my hands. It has a smooth rubber-like finish on that helps your hands keep their grip even when they get warm.

When you start the game, you choose either to play the role of a boy or girl, and depending on your choices, the hero will grow up to be tall or short, good or evil. Players can get married and have children; female player characters will become pregnant, which will then be reflected by their physical appearance.Early in the game, players are presented with a stray dog for a best friend, who will need to be fed and loved, and will accompany the player throughout his or her life. Depending on the player, the dog will change appearance and assist him or her in various ways, such as alerting of impending dangers and attacking enemies.Players inhabit the world of Albion and are free to roam the land to as they please. Players can use different expressions to communicate with others, such as taunting and laughing, and even belching or farting.As the players grow, so does Albion, reflecting the choices that were made earlier in the game.

Players can buy up all the land in a town and can become mayor, king, and even emperor of the entire land.Fable 2 presents a dynamic and free-roaming world that doesn't demand a player to take any one set path. At the same time, players seeking a plot line will find an epic story and quest that they can follow if they wish, along with many side adventures.Fight Using Different Weapons and MagicFable 2 introduces a new combat system that allows for mastery of hand weapons, such as swords, long range weapons such as cross-bows and guns, and, of course, magic.

The main story is entertaining (if derivative), and the side quests keep you busy. Like most sandbox games, I find that the majority of the time in game is spent on non-quest related play: families, property, searching for gargoyles, etc.There are some issues though: the camera is still a little wonky sometimes (like when aiming), and the multiplayer is not as much fun as it could be if we didn't share perspective, and it's too easy to make money (by midgame you have way more money than you will even spend.)A great game, with lots of replay value, and easy to play = excellent!

I'll admit, I played the Gameboy Advance version of this game and loved it but came into this one a little speculative about whether it'd be any good or not. Well, I'm here to tell ya' that it is the best Square Enix remake I've ever played. Matrix really did a good job with this remake. It easily trumps Final Fantasy III in every way. The story itself goes a little something like this....Cecil is the lord captain of the Red Wings of Baron. Bound by his duty to serve his king and country, his conscience is heavy with the sins that he is committing in their name. Returning from a mission to Baron's friendly neighbor Mysidia, he finally dares to question his king's motives. For his insubordination, Cecil is stripped of his rank and sent on an errand north to the village of Mist, where his destiny is revealed to him and his journey begins. The story itself is told in cinematic style prsentation with voice acting. Throughout his journey, Cecil is joined by a number of intriguing characters: Kain, his best friend and a dragoon of considerable skill; Rosa, his lady love, who became a white mage to support him on the frontlines; Rydia, a summoner capable of calling the legendary Eidolons (referred to as summon monsters in other games) to her aid; Tellah, a revenge-driven sage who's forgotten more than most have learned; and many more.Make no mistake, though, Final Fantasy IV is only for the hardcore RPG fan. Why, you ask? Well, unlike FF3, the battles in this game are really hard. If you make it through a battle, you'll realize it isn't through luck that you did but sheer skill. Admittedly, I went away from the game feeling more satisfied that I did but was annoyed somewhat by it being so hard. Yet, I think it reaches that perfect challenge.The graphics are simply amazing. Simply the best I've seen on the Nintendo DS. With easily the best character and world designs on any game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2008"}

The PlayStation EYE picks up this controller very easily and my movements are tracked precisely.

If you don't want or need an external charging dock the standard mini-usb cables that came with the system (or many other devices will work fine).My one complaint with this controller is that the glowing orb on top (however stupid it looks) doesn't feel very sturdy. It would be very easy to hit the orb on your pants or a couch or other object and just feels like it could easily be ripped off.This controller came with a wrist lanyard so it doesn't fly out of your hand and break something and has rechargeable (not removable) batteries.

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"Catfish Kozmo","summary":"Epic in scope but still pretty linear","reviewText":"I had to say that I had huge hopes for this game.  How epic in scope is this?  You're a Crusader who is killed but instead of accepting death, you fight death to be with your wife.  Unfortunately, death already came for your wife and bummer, she's in Hell.  So off you go to fight everything under the sun.While this story is the tale of Dante from Inferno, it definitely reminded me of the sci-fi novel from a few years back called \"Inferno\"InfernoGreat read by the way.  The game has great visuals and sounds given that you're in Hell and the colors are pretty much fire and brimstone.Unfortunately the game play gets a little bit silly in spots.  Dante is a major butt kicker with his halberd and then his scythe.  He's got some good moves and evidently can jump higher than any normal person can.  Hey, it's a game.  There are a ton of unlockable moves that you can figure out.  Mostly they involve the L2 button.  And the moves vary depending on if you're trying to use your powers for good or to punish.  You can absolve or punish your enemies after you've beaten on them enough.  After a while enemies won't give you as many good/bad points when you absolve them and eventually, you'll just start killing everything.Action is pretty good. The vista's are impressive.  Unfortunately, the camera is fixed so you can't pan around and really take a look.  There are some times where I really wanted to see more of the background but you're restricted from doing that unless you happen to move Dante to just one spot.  The game locks you in on a path most of the time.  I.e. you can't fall to your death in most places.  But then again, there are other places where you can fall to your death quite easily.  That just makes the game frustrating when out of nowhere, you can die just by moving to the edge when most of the game, you can't die from falling off of the path.  And since you're locked on the path, there is not much to explore.  The game becomes a flow of kill, kill, puzzle, kill, puzzle, repeat.  And most of the puzzles are not too bad but there are a few where you'll want to throw the controller.There are major characters through history to find and punish/absolve as well.  That was pretty neat to find some of them and try to figure out what to do.  The story unfolds very slowly and really picks up speed once you're 2/3 of the way through the game.  Basically, you find out that you're not quite as pious as you thought you were.  That part played out well.  Because even though you're the \"good\" guy, you're not really all that good.This is a fun game albeit, a very dark concept.  I wish there was more exploration because for the most part, you're locked in on one direction which is down.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2010"}

Yes, walking.  And the last 10 minutes were spent running through the same sequence that after about 6 replays became so frustrating that I had to eject the disc and send it back before I put a hole in my drywall with a $60 PS3 controller...Now, I understand the purpose of Uncharted.  I understand that they're going for movie-like sequences and trying to immerse you in a story.  But when I'm controlling a teenage boy, walking through a museum at a snails-pace, something has to happen QUICK to hold my interest.  I'm a 30-year old husband and soon-to-be father who has a busy schedule.  I don't have all day to \"walk around\" in a video game.  And I also don't have time to replay the same game sequence a dozen times because the platforming controls are jumpy, innacurate, and vague.If you're a fan of the Uncharted games and you LOVE this game and you think I'm \"stupid\" or lack \"skills\" or whatever you fanboys wanna throw out there, then by all means, enjoy yourself.  One of my gaming friends tried telling me that this game was great because it provided \"backstory\" - and that's probably true.  Unfortunately I was never too immersed in the FRONT story, so some of the affect may have been lost on me.If you're NOT a big Uncharted fan and are wondering if it can successfully stand on it's own, then I'll share my opinion that \"no, it does not\" and suggest you look elsewhere.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0012N3ZXS","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Spectacular","reviewText":"Of all the defining video games that I grew up playing, the one that bears the most relevance to me is Street Fighter II.  It's what introduced me to fighting games, as well as many others, and still defines what 2-D fighting is today.  All these years later, Capcom unleashes Street Fighter IV, which combines all the old school elements you know and love with a glossy, next-gen look and feel; and the end result is one of the absolute best fighting games on the market right now.  Very accessible yet deep and complex, Street Fighter IV brings back all twelve warriors from Street Fighter II, and throws in six new ones as well, including a powerful end boss.  The first thing you'll notice when powering up the game is that there is some seriously stylish animation and absolutely gorgeous, flowing graphics.  In fact, for a 2-D game, the overall presentation is a pure work of art in itself that looks and plays better than most current 3-D fighters.  The single-player mode is fun, but the real meat and potatoes of Street Fighter IV lie in the online multiplayer modes, even if it is occasionally laggy.  There's also unlockable fan favorite fighters like Akuma, Sakura, Cammy, and even Dan; all of which combines to offer a ton of replay value.  All in all, Street Fighter IV is a pure blast that you will enjoy for a good, long time; and is right now the best current fighting game on the market, and it wholeheartedly deserves your attention whether you're a longtime fan of the long running series or a newcomer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"nintendofan","summary":"it will drive you insane","reviewText":"pros. the insanity feature is very cool. the magic feature is also cool. the characters are weel animated. the story is really scary. it gets you in the moode for a good freddy kruger moviecons. it is to dark in the graphics. to few enemys. not for young children","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Jeffrey S. Stanley \"Viper_29\"","summary":"Loving it so far!!!!!","reviewText":"Ok so I'll add my little bit to the discussion as well regarding my launch PS4. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. The PS4 was delivered by UPS and the shipping box was damaged pretty badly, fortunately the PS4 box itself had no issues and it was very well packed. I plugged the unit into my TV and waited for the day 1 patch to download. First thing I noticed was how much FASTER the PS4 downloads versus the PS3. It wasn't long before I went thru and did the initial setup. Upon turning it on and signing into the PS network, I noticed that the home screen was clean and simple to navigate, although I can see down the road it looking like my Kindle fire screen and taking forever to scroll thru once games, music and movies start to load up on the PS4. Hopefully they fix this with an update later. I had two games, Killzone and Battlefield. Battlefield looked good, but wasn't what I was expecting for a next gen game, it was better than the current gen consoles, but only marginally. Killzone looked very impressive and I expected so as it was a nex gen game from the get go and not developed alongside current gen versions. Unfortunately, I have Satelllite internet and limited allowance so I haven't been able to enjoy any multiplayer. Word of caution for anyone downloading demo's via satellite. THe demo's appear to be huge. I couldn't find anthing saying the size of the download and I downloaded EA NBA 2014, figuring it'd be a gig or so......it drained the remaining 10 gigs I had remaining for my allotment, so be aware the demos are huge downloads. Appearance wise, it blends much better into my entertainment area than I was expecting it too, but I try not to touch it too much.....like my original PS3, it's a fingerprint magnet. I will say, Battlefield and Killzone, while they looked great, it was apparent the PS4 was not being taxed to play, so that bodes well that as good as these games looked now, they will get much, much better as developers learn to utilize the power. The PS4 controller is much improved over the PS3 dualshock, but I gotta say the first thing I did was turned off the controller microphone. This may hinder some gameplay when listening to videos within the game. I played audiologs I found in Killzone and never heard anything, and I assume this is why. The light on the controller, while being a great nuisance to my wife when she's trying to sleep, doesn't seem to do much more than run the battery down faster. The touchpad seems nice so far, and was fairly well utilized in Killzone where it became second nature to use really quick, actually much quicker than I anticipated it would. I can honestly say I think I will see an upgrade of the harddrive, just playing Killzone and Battlefield, the mandatory installs take up a LOT of space, so 500 gigs won't go very far when the games start rolling in. Feel like I'll be in the same boat I was in with my 60 gig PS3 and having to delete things to make room for other things.All in all, I'm glad I got it, I'm passing on the Xbox One for now, will wait for it to come down in price and after the reliability has improved. For my PS3, I had one die on me and replaced by Sony. My Xbox 360 (original unit) I had die 7 times and recieved another unit which has lasted so far, but I rarely play it as I bought the newer black Xbox 360 and it has worked fine. I think they'll both be great boxes for everyone and hopefully they both survive as it is the competition between them that will give us great gaming for a long time to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2013"}

There are some flat textures here and there, but this game is the smoothest running I have played in years.  Whether you are racing in third person or gunning down mutants in first person, there is no frame rate drops at all!  The story and atmosphere were good, but the shooting and racing are really top notch.  Now, when I am really enjoying a game, I like to do all the side quests, etc in order to prolong my enjoyment.  That being said, I ended up clocking just over 20 hours in the single player!  Compared to Call of Duty and other FPS titles, that is a really nice game length.  There is still the online multiplayer racing and online co-op to play too so I definitely found this game to be worth the full retail price.

Players will be treated to an all-new, full-size act set in the Barbarian Highlands. Other features include new monsters, two new character classes (Assassin and Druid), a larger stash, new Horadric Cube recipes, support for higher-resolution graphics, and thousands of new magical items.","reviewerName":"Andrew C.","summary":"Nice conclusion to a very good series","reviewText":"This expansion finishes(?) the Diablo series in a great way, while adding a good deal of improvements.  I never played Diablo 2 without the expansion installed, so I never missed any of the new features which include hirelings that can travel with you between acts, a bigger stash, 2 new character classes, improved video resolution, and more of everything (areas, items, monsters, weapons, etc.).  For anyone who liked Diablo 2, the expansion is definitely worthwhile.Gameplay: More hack-and-slay, but some interesting quests.  You have to track down Baal, Diablo's brother who escaped in Diablo 2.  The story is focused on a Barbarian land that is under siege by the forces of evil.  Overall, the story is interesting and the new areas are appropriately stocked with a mix of monsters.  Most of the six quests have multiple parts.  Like the other games, LoD still throws hordes of monsters at you and occasionally sticks in a memorable, worthy opponent.  There are about 3-4 truly epic fights, including the one with Baal (in which there is a bit of a surprise).  Also, like the other games, there are randomized monsters, items, shrines, dungeon walls, and other things that might make a replay worthwhile, but the 6 quests are always the same.  LoD still maintains the annoying game-save system that was featured in Diablo 2, which is a real shame.Visuals: The game looks good in 800x600 resolution.  You can see more of the screen and the details are well done.  There is nothing ground-breaking here, but the visuals have held up well after four years.Sound: Same as Diablo 2.  The monsters have more convincing sounds and speech than the NPCs. Overall, the music is decent, but does not measure up to the roaring drum beats of the original Diablo.Overall, this is a good buy if you liked the other Diablo games, or simply want an arcade-action game with some roleplaying elements.  The skill system does help you get into the characters more.  Also, those who want to play this game online should especially get some replay value out of it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00DHF39L2","description":"","reviewerName":"A Gamer at Heart","summary":"A Highly Polished FPS","reviewText":"I have played so many FPS games and was expecting yet another tired addition to a repetitive genre. My expectations were low. I was happy to be wrong . . .This is a great game. Amazing graphics, outstanding FPS mechanics, and a decent story with great voice acting. Just before I started this game, I had just finished reading The Man in The High Castle, which is a science fiction classic set in an alternate history version of the 1960's where the Nazis rule the world. This game is set in the same alternate time period, a 1960's where the allies lost and Nazis rule the world. The little touches really sell the story and the immersion, like the public service announcements you hear extolling the virtues of the master race while encouraging you to inform on your neighbors and loved ones. The mood here is more somber than prior games in this franchise. It is not as satirical as Borderlands, yet not quite as somber as the Bioshock franchise. It strikes a nice balance in between.The levels are huge - and incredibly well done. After I have finished shooting Nazis in the face, I often marvel at the beauty and polish of the levels and graphics. Clearly a lot of effort was put into the game, and it shows. On the Xbox One, it really shines.Anyway, if you enjoy a good shooter, you will enjoy this game. It may appear as just yet another shooter, but the production values help to elevate it to something much more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Marc \"Snowman\"","summary":"It's the real deal","reviewText":"The PSP offers the widest selection of capibilities of any handheld ever.

If you don't have a mp3 player and you're getting the PSP, you don't need one. You got one right on your PSP. And best of all you can go on the internet on the PSP! Browse websites for god's sake.

Review & a few hints for Heroic mode.","reviewText":"I liked the original Syphon Filter and its sequel. Three was a dissapointment. MGS2 had some really good parts, but the overly long video clips and convoluted story line made it frustrating and tedious. I also prefer the greater immersion of true first person shooters.Halo is the best console first person shooter period.I'm 56 and it took me well over a week the first time to get through Halo in normal mode. It has incredibly expansive and detailed scenery, terrain and architecture and the first person shooter physics and manual interface is the best of any game.I just managed to complete Halo in Heroic mode in about 4 days and it was a real experience. You really feel like youve fought an entire war and while not exactly winning, you are truly the last man standing.Some of the sequences are incredibly difficult, and don't get stuck starting from a checkpoint with the wrong or empty weapons. There are things you can get away with in Normal mode that simply won't work in Heroic.A few real caveats are: When your following the monitor to the index, always kill all the flood before proceeding at each checkpoint. You won't get there otherwise. A lot of reviewers like the shotgun for killing flood. I pack a full plasma pistol and plasma rifle. Ammunition lasts longer and you don't run out at those emabarrasing moments (oops died again). You just need to be on target and fire rapid bursts. The stupid marine rifle recoils horribly, is relatively ineffective against the aliens and even less effective against the flood. The pistol zoomed is fun against the aliens. The sniper rifle is a lot of fun. Some times you really need the rocket launcher for tanks and the flying alien craft. At one point when you are trying to blow up the generators, you will come out on a snow bridge with a couple aliens and two of the alien flying craft. In heroic mode, if youve got rockets fine, if not, run to the left out the door and slide down the ice wall then run past the tank to the ravine at the bottom of the pyramid buttress. Rocket launcher awaits. This will take MANY tries. No doubt you will try to cross the ice bridge. And if you do you will know why I didn't reccomend that.Find NeoSeekers website online for a fine walkthrough. I used it only for the hint about killing all the flood on the way to the index. I have tried Legendary and gotten part way into the second level, but it is too much like continual suicide for me. I would like to know if anyone over 40 has completed in Legendary. I can tell you that every possible strategy and reflexes better than mine are absolutely necessary at this level.My guess is that you need to spend much time restarting entire levels just so you end up at checkpoints with the right weapons and sufficient kills. Too many too tough aliens, not enough ammunition.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2002"}

What makes BAA such an amazing game is how simple it is to pick up and play. The controls are simple and the fighting system is engaging. I used to play a lot of video games when I was a young kid, but as I'm older, i dont want to play a game that takes forever to figure out where to go or figure out the control scheme. The best games out there are the ones that are simple to play and navigate. What makes BAA stand out is the high level of production values that contribute immensely to the Batman experience. The graphics and music take BAA to a whole new level of gaming excitement. The music is incredibly orchestrated and makes the gameplay experience that much more engaging. Plus, the iconic voices of MARK HAMMIL and KEVIN CONROY from the Animated Series make their entrance into Arkham. What also makes BAA such an amazing Batman experience is the level of detail put into the Batman characters as well as the gadgets and locales. The Batmobile, the batcave, Arkham, etc. is beautifully detailed. The reason why I like BAA better than other Batman expereiences because it is a TRUER Batman experience. Instead of the gravelly, pretentious voice of Christian Bale, you get the smooth natural sound of Kevin Conroy. Plus in BAA, you get to experience Batman as a martial artist. The experience of taking out 15 criminals and 2 juiced up monsters in one room is just an awesome bad ass experience that you don't get any where else. In the Dark Knight, you get limited and awkward fight scenes. Not only are the production values and control schemes excellent, but the level design is amazing as well. BAA incorporates a great mixture of fighting and stealth that does not feel contrived. The Stealth aspects of the BAA also surpass those of the Metal Gear Solid Franchise which is amazing in its own right. BAA makes the stealth aspect suspenseful, rewarding, and most importantly fun, whereas in other games it can be frustrating and cumbersome. Another great aspect of BAA is that the story is great, especially for a video game. ALthough the video game industry has provided for some great experiences, not many video games are able to convey a story that rivals that of movies and tv shows.

Arm yourself with pistols, cannons, machine guns and more as you strike out on a mission with two fearless compatriots whose bonds of blood are only strengthened by the blood they spill together.","reviewerName":"DanD","summary":"Fun, engrossing, with a few flaws that are easily overcome","reviewText":"Ray and Thomas McCall are ex-Confederate soldiers, on the run from their former commander, who has labeled them deserters and who refused to lay down arms when the South lost.  They head to Juarez in search of a mythical treasure, with which they can buy back their home that was damaged during Sherman's march.Plot-wise, CALL OF JUAREZ: BOUND IN BLOOD is so-so; it starts off as a war story (the first chapter takes place during the Civil War, fighting the North), moves into a western, and eventually congeals as a half-baked adventure story.  It's good enough for a video game, at any rate.  The graphics are outstanding, the voice acting is good for the most part (Ray's accent isn't quite consistent, and some of the characters just seem...well, not up to par).  The real catch here, though, is the game play.  Is there anything better than riding a horse while firing a gun from each hand?  I didn't think so.  JUAREZ offers classic western game play: there's the repeating rifle, the quickdraw revolver, the double-barreled shotgun, dynamite, lasso, throwing knives, horses, stagecoaches, Gatling guns, Comanche warriors, shoot-outs, high noon duels...it's all here.  JUAREZ is like your favorite childhood western, but with more blood and bullets.So why the four-star rating?  Well, the game has its flaws, as most games do.  The in-game weapons change menu is stubborn; it quite often won't change weapons when you need it to (and you need it to); the problem is, it happens in real-time, so that the game doesn't pause while you're doing it.  I don't know how many times I died because, when I went to change weapons, the game couldn't keep up with me.  Also, it gets kind of hard to dodge obstacles, and every now and then, you'll get stuck (often right when you don't want to); similarly, I found myself ducking (thanks to PS3 controls) when I didn't intend to, thus slowing my movement.  The Cover Mode (an otherwise ingenious invention that allows you to shoot from behind cover) also kicks in automatically; you get near the edge of cover, and whether you want to or not, you find yourself drifting into Cover Mode.  And then there's the usual bit about bodies disappearing...that's always bugged me in games.The flaws can be ignored, however; the game is definitely fun to play.  For most chapters, you get to choose which brother you want to be.  You can choose wisely, or do as I did, and play once through as Ray, and again as Thomas; Ray can wield two guns, as well as dynamite, is best with revolvers, and can carry the Gatling gun; Thomas is faster, better with rifles, can climb obstacles Ray can't (thus getting to places you can't go to as Ray), and wield the lasso and knives.  I should mention that my game froze up during the 4th chapter, and I ended up losing all my progress; the upside was that I replayed as a different character (when applicable), so that I got a richer experience.  CALL OF JUAREZ: BOUND IN BLOOD is perhaps one of the funnest games I've played.  But then, I was one of those kids who played cowboys and Indians and didn't give a damn about accuracy or political correctness.  If you're like me, then trust me, this is your game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2010"}

Smith \"Duster\"","summary":"Resident evil Revelations: judging a game for what it is, instead of what it is not.","reviewText":"I came into the Resident Evil franchise in its fourth iteration which I am sure most gamers will say was one of the best games in the series as well as one of the best games ever made. I must say I enjoyed that title many times over and am glad to see its legacy shine through in parts of RE: Revelations.Where to begin?The story is something I dont want to spoil here, but i am sure many of you reading this already know the direction of The RE series in terms of the stories. I may not have played any of the games before RE 4, but i have read about the story of the franchise and it doesnt always make sense. Alas, story is not why I play video games, although a good story always gives more meaning to what you are doing in your virtual adventure. I will just say that the story is nicely done and split between multiple characters. For a RE title, you shouldnt be too disappointed i you often shrug your shoulders at a cutscene and wonder what just happened. Its best to just keep playing and enjoy what RE brings to the table... The gameplay!The best way to describe the gameplay is a mix of RE 4 and RE 5. Sometimes you are alone and sometimes you are with a partner. There are your basic puzzles that were in RE 4 and then there are your all out action set pieces as in RE 5. This balance between the two game styles is a nice merge of previous RE titles which i find quite refreshing. If there is one thing i can't stand in games, it is boring repetition. Hardcore RE fans might not like the RE 5 inspired parts of the game as much, but I enjoy a nice action portion of the new RE games and I find it enjoyable.  I will admit that the sections of the game when you are alone are much more engrossing than the all out action scenes.The graphics are in a word, stunning, especially for a handheld game. Some parts of the game can look like RE5 quality graphics. I always say that graphics dont make a game, but in the RE universe they go a long way in helping with the creepy atmosphere and excellent character models. The 3D adds a nice depth effect and brings the scenery to life. They are not essential like Mario 3D land, but they are a nice touch.I believe sound is just as essential as graphics in a game of this nature. Do yourself a favor and use high quality headphones when playing this game. You will be so much more immersed and the scare factor will rise, the ambient noises are spectacular and overall sound quality is amazing.ControlsIf any of you took a spin with RE: The Mercenaries on the 3DS last year, then you will pretty much have a grasp on the control scheme. There are a few new mapped things to the touch screen as well as the D pad, but overall this control scheme works well for this type of game on a hand held game console. Moving while aiming is also in the game and its a much welcomed addition to this franchise.RE fans should not overlook this game just because its on a handheld. This is a full length RE experience with a nice mix of older RE and new action oriented RE, it is a nice balance that all 3DS owners should play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2012"}
{"product_name":"B007TYC8MI","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Good, but not Oh My God of War 3","reviewText":"First off, I'm a huge God of War fan. I've loved every game and God of War 3 is still my favorite PS3 console game. So needless to say I was excited when I heard a brand new GOW game was in the works. Trailers and teasers for Ascension promised big things, although the highlighting of multi-player didn't really do anything for me (for me, God of War is just fine as a single player hack & slash), and on launch day I went to my nearest store and bought the game. My thoughts? It's typical God of War, which is both a good and a bad thing. The graphics are just a smidgen better than its predecessor GOW3 and the game opens with the typically epic God of War boss battle. I must admit my jaw dropped several times playing the first boss, but found it eerily reminiscent of the Poseidon battle when you're placed on a slant trying to slay and avoid getting hit by gigantic claws. From that point onward, Ascension became less and less enthralling and I began to see the cracks so many critics have pointed out in their reviews, cracks that could've been tweaked to be less glaring and made playing the game more enjoyable. The gameplay is similar to any in the GOW canon and it's great to see Kratos' blades swinging all around his head, but I found so many small flaws during gameplay such as dropped frame rates, a first for me to experience in a GOW game, and odd camera angles, that it slowly began to get on my nerves. For me, I was disappointed Sony Santa Monica chose to do another prequel, since they've been there done that already (Ghost of Sparta anybody?), and it would've been nice to have continued where God of War 3 left Kratos off. We know Kratos is pissed and we know he's constantly been searching to forget killing his wife and daughter - you'd think they could've gone before that since we're just back to the Kratos we know and love, but one that brings nothing new to the table. Is Ascension bad? No, it's perfectly serviceable and looks amazing in true 1080 HD, but it's also the first God of War game in the series that I didn't look forward to coming back to every day. It plays as if it was rushed to release, rather than given some extra TLC that could've done a world of good to it. Interestingly, it follows suit to a couple #4 prequels that have followed in the footsteps of critically acclaimed best-selling trilogies, but haven't been able to deliver similarly themselves (Gears of War Judgement?). Maybe going in a completely different direction is the best way to avoid this hump (here's looking at you, Halo 4, which continued the original trilogy in an equally epic manner). Overall, God of War Ascension is most definitely good, but not great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2013"}

Conker's Bad Fur Day, despite some people saying it hasn't held up well, has held up well.  I don't think there's a videogame that is like this at all.  Part platformer, part shooter, part pop culture paradise, and part gleefully funny adult/gross out humor, Conker's Bad Fur Day still rules, and is a fine example of why the N64 is still my favorite console; I like it much better than the original Playstation back in the day, and I still think that way.I've always liked Rare, especially in the days of N64, where they made some of the funnnest platformer games ever, even though you did a lot of collecting most of the time.  I think I would rate the Banjo Kazooie series as the highlight of the N64 (for me, anyway), they were my personal favorites and I always loved Diddy Kong Racing (never got around to playing Donkey Kong  though).  Sure, I love Mario 64 well enough, but I love the characters, the humor, the oddball type of style the makers have, the graphics, and everything else of Rare's videogames.  Needless to say, they went out with a bang with Conker's Bad Fur Day, one of the N64's last games.  Too bad it didn't do well as anticipated. Oh well.  This game is almost a cult videogame of sorts, and I wouldn't have it any other way.Anyway, Conker was intended to be another franchise character, after the Donkey Kong/Diddy Kong games (?) and Banjo Kazooie (Perfect Dark in my opinion does not feature one of these, even though it's arguably a franchise as well).  COnker was originally going to be just another E-rated platformer, and probably a pretty bad one.  The original game was very bland, judging from the footage of the original at the E3.  Thankfully, Rare realized we already had many too furry, E-rated platformers, and Rare wisely decided to put their imagination to good use and make an all adult, all fun, and very crude plat-former, something that's probably not going to surface ever again.True, the game play for this game may not sit well with modern gamers.  It may be due to the fact that adventure games of its kind are floundering as a whole, given way to the western market's current obsession for FPS and brain dead action games, but I'm not sure (why these games don't click with gamers any more (look at what happened to Psychonauts).  However, the game play is still tight and easy as it was when it was first released.  Rare were fine masters at creating exciting platformer games, and Conkers Bad Fur Day represents this at their very best.  The game successfully mixes third person shooting with traditional platforming, and also manages not to dwell into a collect-a-thon most of the time.  You'd face plenty of absurd challenging tasks here, my favorite would have to be feeding villagers into a meat grinder.However, the real star of this game, of course, is the adult nature of the game, with lot's of blood, swearing, really retarded $#% and toilet humor, and a fine line of offbeat and absurd adult comedy.  A sexually amibigous cog, drunk squirrels, a queen bee with a self confidence problem and a big ***** gun, redneck barn tools, and giant robot balls, done right (Transformers 2 this aint).  Sure, some of the toilet humor goes off into being just gross out humor (the cow for example), but Conker's Bad Fur Day hardly ever feels lame, even when it focuses on an operatic, singing piece of s*** and $#% between a flower and a bee.Truth to be told, I didn't find this game to really that \"edgy\", but the truth is, I think Rare made the game Mature rated because it's a whole lot of fun to be bad.  The game clearly never takes itself that seriously, and unlike people who use this kind of humor to purely offend and shock others, Conkers Bad Fur Day, surprisingly, doesn't seem to aspire to that.  Okay fine, maybe they did have intentions to offend others, but I don't find the adult nature of this game to be forced like Tom Green's absurdly unfunny Freddy Got Fingered and the insufferably stupid crude humor in the Transformers film series (to name some examples).  It's closer to Meet the Feebles and Happy Tree Friends instead.  Also similar to South Park, which also knows the fine line between funny gross out humor and stays in that line.  It's not for the squemish, and it will offend some, but those who will laugh all the way through.Oh, and another cool thing is all of the movie references.  Everbody knows about this aspect of the game. The game successfully mixes up an array of movie references, from levels, to dialogue, to visual aspects of films.  Even some of the levels full on parody movies, such as Matrix (complete with Bullet Time!), as well as some of the characters. I mean come on, how can you go wrong with bosses that mimick The Terminator (right down to the Terminator's first person view and accent) and the Xenomorph from the Alien films.  Cutscenes mix up all kinds of movie references, including Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Godfather, and a Clockwork Orange.  They even parody the opening of Saving Private Ryan, right down the part when Tom Hanks enters shellshock mode, soldiers vomiting, \"thirty seconds!\", and when soldiers get hit underwater by bullets.One criticism I kind of have is the leven design, which can be sometimes kind of bland (though you can't possibly say Poo land is bland, come on).  But even moreso, this is one good looking game, as the graphics were some of the best on the N64, certainly benefiting from years of cracking the power of the N64 (and it looks even better in the remake).  The design of whole game is quite meticolous, down to little details everywhere.  The character design are pretty marvelous in itself, my favorites being the cog machine, the \"ganster\" bees, Gregg, the alien final boss (that's a given) and of course, The Great Mighty Poo.  Yes, he's been talked about excessively over the years, but this boss is one of a kind, and we'll probably never see something like that again.  I also love the music, my favorite song being the theme for Windy.I do recommend that you playConker: Live & Reloadedif you haven't tried this game yet, it has much better graphics as it's a remake of this game single player mode.  It's probably much easier to find as well, given the price of this right now on here (christ).  Either way, this is still one of the best 3-d Platform games, if you haven't tried this game yet, check it out.  Its tons of fun and there's nothing quite like it, even today.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2010"}

Set 2,000 years prior to the self-titled first game in theSacredseries,Fallen Angelis prequel to the events and quests of earlier RPG hit, that drops players in the midst of an epic struggle for control of elemental power on the grandest of scale.Caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Sacred 2: Fallen AngelPlayers:Offline 1-4; Online 1-4Other:Co-op multiplayer; HDTV 480p, 720p, 1080i; 16:9 widescreen; In-game Dolby Digital sound.6 stunning character classes.View larger.Battle using brute force &amp; steel.View larger.A massive weapons inventory.View larger.Master the lore of the ancients.View larger.Classic RPG character leveling.View larger.The StoryT-Energy has been flowing through Ancaria since time immemorial. This mysterious power forms the beginning of all life, is the source of all magic and the origin of all thought. For eons the angelic Seraphim watched over the T-Energy and therefore over the fate of the entire world. But eventually tiring of their burden, they passed their knowledge on to the High Elves. T-Energy helped the realm of the High Elves to experience an unimaginable boost of prosperity, making it the reigning culture in Ancaria. But a force as powerful as T-Energy carries great dangers. Not taught how to deal with this, no sooner did the Elves take control, then a heated dispute erupted among them as to how and to what purpose the T-Energy was to be used. Dispute morphed into irresolvable conflict, then rift and eventually to a civil war among the High Elves, where all participants were losers. Their realm collapsed and with it the entire power structure of Anacaria. In the turmoil all the peoples of Anacaria coveted the right, either openly or in secret, to wield the power of T-Energy and in the end, unmanaged, the T-Energy raged out of control warping creature and lands alike. Can anyone regain control over the T-Energy. And if so, will he/she strive to prevent the world from lapsing into final chaos, or deepen it?GameplayGameplay inSacred 2: Fallen Angelin divided into two campaign paths: Light and Dark. As the game begins players choose and customize their character and choose the path they will follow. This choice determines the ultimate goal and intentions of their character, and as the game progresses through literally hundreds of quests and side quests, the paths of different characters intersect at different junctions. Choose one way and you may be tasked to defend a town and its people, while another path could result in you attacking the same town. The choice is yours and the fate of the world and your well-being are at stake.Key Game Features:A massive, seamless and dynamic world delivering hundreds of hours of freeform exploration.Two deep campaigns: play as the 'Light' or 'Shadow' side, complete with distinct skills, rewards and story-elements tailored to the chosen path.Six exceptional, playable characters, each with a distinct look, capabilities and in-game motivation.Modifiable combat arts: change, upgrade and link together your alter ego's combat skills to match your playing style.Fight effectively from the back of a number of mounts under your control; equip and upgrade your character's unlockable special mount.Deities offer unique combat disciplines and unlock additional quests.Seamless transition between single and multiplayer gaming modes via Xbox LIVE.Captivating online modes of play challenge gamers in cooperative, PvP and PvE play.Extraordinary, cutting-edge graphics and Dolby 5.1 channel surround sound utilize the latest technologies for a truly immersive experience.Character ClassesInSacred 2: Fallen Angelplayers assume the role of one of six characters -- five of which are new to the franchise -- and delve into a thrilling story full of side quests and secrets that you will have to unravel. Breathtaking combat arts and sophisticated spells are waiting to be learned. A multitude of weapons and items will be available, and you will choose which of your character's attributes you will enhance with these items in order to create a unique and distinct hero.SeraphimOften referred to as 'Fallen Angels,' these mystical and angelic creatures are the oldest inhabitants of Ancaria. Fast, elegant and acrobatic warriors from a technological future they fight with light to medium weapons and, if required, with massive technological support. Players can assume the role of a Seraphim and protect the world from chaos.Shadow WarriorShadow Warriors were originally humans trained as elite soldiers in service to the High Elves. Upon their death their souls were stolen by an Elven general, bound to lifeless bodies and imbued with T-Energy. Now free, they travel between this world and the next as undead beings with only the desire to return to the peace of the golden halls of Elysium.High ElfThe best student at the ancient academy of magic in Thylysium, the High Elf character lives and breathes magic. Her hunger for adventure and her insatiable desire to increase her personal knowledge and the influence of her once-powerful house are the driving forces as she sets off into an Ancaria boiling over with turmoil.DryadMasters of the hunt and akin to the Elves, The Dryad are in tune with nature and are equipped with the strength of the forests. The most powerful and the strongest among them are knowledgeable of the dark art of voodoo and were chosen in order to save their peoples from extinction. All are expert with the bow, traps, poisons and lore of the forest.InquisitorThe Inquisitors are the High Priests of the High Elves. Arrogant and deadly, they are only committed to themselves and their ultimate goal of assume control over the T-Energy. Proficient in close combat and able to gain increasing power as damage is taken, their manipulative spells make them powerful fighters from the shadows.Temple GuardianSince the beginning of time the purpose of Temple Guardians were to maintain and protect the Great Machine, so that it could keep the world in balance. Neither fully flesh or mechanical, they are half human and half machine. Propelled by T-Energy and devoted to protecting it, they are part of the Great Machine and so able to use the T-Energy for their purposes.A Wide Variety of MountsAcross Ancaria you will find many horse dealers. They offer all kinds of animals, from the simple nag up to a real war horse. You can equip a war horse with bridle, saddle and even special armor. These special items can be found in the game just like player items, ranging in quality from regular to rare and even unique items. In addition, every character also has a unique mount created specifically for their character class. This mount not only fits the personality of the character, but also complements the various aspects of the character's playing style perfectly. All character classes can fight from a mounted position using a variety of tactics that the player chooses depending on the terrain and battle conditions.","reviewerName":"Suzanne Amara","summary":"It took me a while to realize how much I liked this game","reviewText":"Let me start by saying I am a Diablo II fanatic.  I judge all games based on that one---a good game for me is a game that's a lot like Diablo II.  I won't say I'm sorry about that---it's the level truth.  A friend of mine that feels similarly said this was the closest game he'd found to that Diablo feeling.  It's taken me a while to think this, but I think he's right.The big reason I think a lot of people don't like this game is that it's MUCH more complicated than it appears the first time you play.  It seems at first to be so simple it's almost boring---just hit a button to kill, do quests that are fairly easy to do, etc.  However, there is much more here than you realize.  I've probably play this about 50 hours so far, and I am still learning major new things---how to really use runes and relic right, how to understand the skill trees, how the different characters play so differently---it's really fun if you like to keep learning.  I'm just now feeling like I understand the game.I love the HUGE map.  I haven't seen even half of it yet.  It feels like you really are in a world that you can explore.Contrary to what another reviewer said, you can play this and save it WITHOUT XBox Live---I only just got XBox Live and I played and saved MANY times before getting it.  The neat thing is that once you do go live, you can use the characters you created offline to fight on-line.It's not a perfect game.  Sometimes the pathfinding is very annoying, and I keep hitting dead ends, even in areas I think I know well.  People are right that the storyline is not that exciting, but I really don't care about the storyline.  If you are someone that does, this might not be the game for you.  I'm more of a kill and collect player.  I also get annoyed when it's nighttime in the game---it's very hard to see what you are doing, which I guess is realistic but still not fun.If you are looking for a game that's easy to get into but has a lot of depth, if you like exploring and collecting and trying different character classes---this is a game you will probably like.  If you are really into plot lines and realism, probably not.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2009"}
{"product_name":"Assassin's Creed III Liberation PlayStation Vita Wi-Fi Bundle","description":"","reviewerName":"Jon L","summary":"The Playstation Vita has a limited amount of games","reviewText":"[Update 15 March 2013]:So I decided to revisit AC3:L since what I said about it was very limited and was only based on the first couple minutes of playing. By now, I've played hours of it.As far as the story goes, it's actually not *that* bad. There is an actual story which makes sense. Graphics are decent but many scenes have obvious spots where it didn't show correctly. Don't expect cut scenes like from the normal series of AC though, these are cut down and have small movements. Sound is absolutely horrendous. There's probably two different background musics to the game, making it a huge annoyance to listen to. Movement is frustrating to use since you will almost always use your \"R\" button to run. After a couple days of playing, it felt like my R was going to break off. R is used to outrun the \"police,\" jump over/on objects, basically anything to move faster. As far as *what* you can jump on, almost anything is \"climbable\" as long as you can reach it. Gameplay smoothness is very jumpy and teared up. Combat is very bad. It's really hard to counter/dodge/fight someone due to your character being slow. In a situation like the assassin vs. 3 others, buttons will get unresponsive.On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 5.> It makes me wonder why games for the PSVita need to be watered down so much but the WiiU can have full games such as AC3 and CoD:BO2. Sony is just embarrassing themselves when they can't push out complete series.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Original review:This is an excellent device, no doubt about it. You can surf the internet and play games with nearly no lag between switching apps (programs). There's a potential to be much, much better but alas, it's probably not going to be. So far, almost a year into release, there's been an estimated 30-40 games released. It's a joke really, to have this little games. They did however, allow you to buy Playstation, Playstation minis, Playstation Portable, and other apps for a rather annoying price (as they force you to buy the game again even if you already own say a PSP game). There's a YouTube app so you can watch YouTube videos, but you cannot watch videos via the web server because of there not being flash.The battery life is short. I can use it for 2 hours straight and this would burn more than half of its life. I was expecting for maybe 6-8 hours of use for one charge.For Assassin's Creed 3: Liberation, it's really not that good. It's much harder than it needs to be and is not what I was expecting for an AC game.Overall not a bad handheld, there just isn't enough games.Edit: I forgot to have mentioned that the Vita also has very overpriced memory cards. A simple 4GB card costs $20, over twice what it should be. Same goes with the rest of the memory cards.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00386VMWI","description":"","reviewerName":"Raul Vito","summary":"From the PS2 to PS3","reviewText":"I've read some pretty comprehensive reviews for this game but I guess this is aimed at someone like me; a veteran PS2 NCAA gamer who recently upgraded to the PS3. Obviously the graphics and animations are breathtaking, and the new running scheme is much more satisfying, but I want to touch some points that some of the other reviews have omitted that I found really hard to adjust to.First of all, the control scheme is customizable to a certain degree, but some of the actions are locked, especially those dependant of the analog controller; in the PS2 version you could assign the upper R & L button for jukes and cuts for running the ball, or swim moves & rips for fighting off a block in defense, and after more than 5 years of playing like that it took me quite a bit to become adjusted to having them only assigned to the analog stick.Second, while playbooks have become more tailored to each of the schools style of play, they seem to have removed the option to create your own playbook; which was a HUGE disappointment for me. I mean, I like having some Wishbone along with my Pistol sets for keeping my buddies of balance and I don't see how it could have been possible to not include it after all those years of having the option for the PS2.Third I don't care one bit about the Road to Glory option, and I spend most of my time in Dynasty mode and while the new recruiting system is really fun, there have been some omissions to the Dynasty that I have really missed; and the same as with the playbooks after having them for all those years is really hard to get adjusted to not having them anymore. The first thing is the omission of the spring practice drills; these were not only great to give a little stat boost to your players, but those drills really helped me get back into the rhythm of the game after a long time without playing, plus they were great teaching tools for newer players to get a hang of some skills that most casual players might not be bothered to learn at first, like pass coverage or punt returns. The second omission is the lack of the stat boots that players might show during the season, and it was really great watching the stats of some promising freshman rise during the season because you actually took the time to play him.And finally like most players I miss Lee Corso; lets face it the narrators for this game are there mostly for the gameday atmosphere because the commentary is kind of late and inaccurate anyway, but at least Corso made some comment or anecdote that occasionally could be fun, and his lines are sorely missed to somehow enliven the play by play commentary. If they didn't think he was that necessary for the actual ingame aspect at least they could have kept him for the pregame predictions or some live action footage.All in all I'm quite happy with the game and if they include Corso again next year, spruce up the commentary and include the custom playbook option again this could be the perfect college football game","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2010"}

Actually, quite the contrary, because Rise of Nightmares shows how Kinect can offer a meaty single player game and not just little mini-game collections. While Kinect has some fantastic games like The Gunstringer and Fruit Ninja Kinect, in addition to the upcoming Crimson Dragon from the creators of Panzer Dragoon, I think Rise of Nightmares is good proof that a game like this can work with motion controls. Similar to Haunt (another solid Kinect game, now available on Xbox Live Arcade) but with more depth, Rise of Kinect offers full 3D movement and lots of weapon and environmental interaction. With a fun and campy story, solid gameplay, some pretty good graphics, and some good ol' horror, I think Rise of Nightmares is a great game for fans of House of the Dead. My one and only complaint is that you can get a little sore playing it for extended lengths.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2012"}

I really enjoyed the game throughout the entire way. Then I got to the end, and once I had finished, I thought back and realized something. I distinctly didn't enjoy it as much as the other two. When I first finished GOW II I had to really think afterward about which of the two I liked better. It was that good! However, once I had finished this one I could make the call right off the bat that it was my least favorite of the trilogy. Now don't get me wrong! GOW III is an excellent game. The graphics have really been amped up, the kills are even more brutal, and your arsenal of weapons are way more useful that the previous iterations. You'll fight humongous bosses and lay waste to them in brutal fashion. Probably my biggest beef for this game would have to be the story. Not only is it very predictable (I expected it would be), but there isn't much of a story there. Even worse is when you get closer to the end of the game where Kratos almost seems to break character completely. It isn't a gradual change or anything. It seemed very abrupt and out of place.

With that said here is what I thought of the game.Upon hearing about this game I was obviously intrigued so I downloaded the afformentioned demo.  I was expecting a really cut and paste RPG with a silly puzzle element to it, but lo and behold I was blown away by the additional depth they put in to this game.  It's still no Morrowind or anything but it wasn't just wander around, fight, wander around, fight...  You can build up your fortress kind of like you can in Heros of Might and Magic which enable certain features like being able to capture and train mounts, research spells, and other features which I will leave to surprise for you.  There's plenty of equipment to find and utilize which I didn't really understand how it was going to play in to a puzzle battle but trust me it does and it works well.  Upon leveling up you choose where your stats go which will affect the potency of the puzzle items like increase the damage they do or give you bonus experience and such.My only gripe with this game is the lack of presentation.  You move from dot to dot on a map and menu surf through the whole game which kind of sucks.  It's really only a small fault though given how fun the game is.  If there's a sequel I think it would serve them well to create actual environments that you can navigate and explore but that's just my opinion.If nothing else this game serves as a HUGE breath of fresh air in two genres that have been nearly beat to death.  If you're bored of other RPGs or Puzzle Games than I highly recommend you pick this game up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2007"}

Guided by her sixth sense and armed only with an antique camera, Miku sets out to solve the mystery of her brother's sudden disappearance. As the story unfolds, she discovers gruesome details about the Himura mansion's troubled past. The property and surrounding area have a dark history involving grisly murders, an evil cult, and restless spirits.","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Great...and Really Scary!!","reviewText":"\"Fatal Frame\" is a game that definitely delivers. Although it does not have any particulary impressive premise (young girl with a camera investigates a haunted house) , it doesn't take long for you to really get into the game, and the scares start coming thick and fast.The plot is fairly simple: main character Miku has come to the house to find her missing brother, so it's mostly a matter of making your way through the mansion, solving puzzles that will open doors, and trying to piece together the grim history of the house. But to do this, you have to be prepared to encounter a wide variety of ghostly apparitions, and it's here that the game really excels. The appearances of the ghosts are almost always a surprise, and it has to be said that they look and sound terrifying. After recovering from the shock, your next task is to quickly equip your camera and try and snap the ghost within the frame. This task can be very challenging, as more often that not the ghost will dart around, disappear completely and materialize behind you, or lunge at you unexpectedly and start throttling the life out of you! The idea of using a camera to fight is unusual and works well...by holding the ghost in constant view as it approaches, the camera will \"charge up\" and you can release a more powerful attack when you finally press the shutter-but are you brave enough to do that?. The best thing is that once you have completed Miku's first night, the ghostly appearances are far more randomised, and as you search the house once again (every chapter has new items and tasks appearing in places you have already explored), you will feel the tension as your camera suddenly lights up, and the controller throbs in your hands...oh no, another one! But, in a great additional aspect, the more ghosts you snap, the more points you score, which can be used to enhance the capabilities of the camera, so you have an element of levelling up which heightens and extends gameplay.My only criticisms are that the game is quite short, and Miku is quite hard to control as you continually run in to bits of furniture, and she often rotates all over the place every time the camera angle changes. Plus, her \"run\" mode is no more than a gentle jog...no good for escaping evil ghosts! Still, I suppose it would have made the game even shorter were you able to dash through the mansion in no time at all...The graphics are great, the mansion looks suitably decrepit and sinister, and the secret behind the house's evil reputation (as it is slowly revealed) involves some truly sickening and creepy events...you have been warned!Do yourself a favour and ONLY play this game after dark, with the lights off, you won't be sorry. It's easily as scary as \"Silent Hill\", in places more so, so I wholeheartedly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2002"}

This, of course is the Sequal to the fabulous, gorgious ocarina of time, and is the start of the \"New\" theme of Zelda games (Nothing to do with predescor, More Japanese themed, More Child-Oriented), Thus starting the trend  towards the overly-colorful and strange two new game boy titles, and the cel-shaded cartoony gamecube title (yes, im going to hate it too). This game starts out as link is searching for Navi in some unchatred forest, only to be robbed by a colorfully masked bandit, who, is very short and wears a huge multi-colored mask with japanese designs on it. He steals link's Ocarina and horse, and runs off with them, with you chasing behind. Links possestion of the ocarina and horse are the only things that have anything to do with OcarinaOfTime, other than its THE EXACT SAME GAME with new places/quests/objects. Same character models, same animations, same songs/SFX, same objects, With only a small amount of new things to fit those categories, although i really didnt hear any new sounds, Oh well, on to the review. The gameplay and controls (Oooh, big suprise here) are the same as OOT, only now link is traversing through an ancient japan/europe type place, that is MUCH more technologicaly advanced than hyrule, with neon lights, large telescopes with blue star-patterend walls,  postal services, clock towers, and CAROUSEL MUSIC THAT KILLS ZOMBIES. If you havnt noticed the way this game is overunned with cartoony Japanese stuff, theres something wrong with you, just to let you know. OOT completly emmersed you into it's renesance english type city, complete with a marketplace, shrine, and castle. Majoras Mask substitutes that with a freezing cold mountain next door to a flaming hot beach. OK, so the world is very differnt, and alot like a Japanese Cartoon, so lets get to the gameplay. As I mentioned before, the gameplay is excactly the same as OOT's, same moves, controls, some new enimies, mostly old enimies, same old same old, only now the dungeons (Half the amount of 'em as OOT) are more combat oriented than puzzle based. But this time, there are more side-quests. Using a special notebook to keep track of what side quests you completed and who you still need to run errands for, you can embark on a jorney to save a farm from aliens trying to take it's cows, a little inocent (and suprisingly alive) girl heal her mutated, mummified dad, or stay awake while listing to grandma's storys (seriously, that Really IS a sub quest). The sound is nothing new, with many birds chirping and flapping in the background and water trickling down streams, thunder roaring up in the air, while this may sound great, you wont be impressed, because you already have been impressed by OOT's sound. Graphics- smae as above. I dont know about you, but I think this is still a good game, but when you really think about it, this game is overloaded with japanese and fantasy themes than the Renesance/ Medievil themes that OOT was placed with, wich I loved, and honestly, I just cant play this anymore and be excited about it, Im playing a Japanese cartoon, not an epic Medievil knight's tale filled with mysterous shrines, beautiful villages, adrenaline-pounding boss fights, no, im saving a worthless-anyway land from a moon that has a face, with yellow eyes, and teeth, anyway, if you already own OOT, dont get this because it's cheap, if you don't own OOT, get OOT, but if OOT is not even being selled used anymore, and you know its not, not anywhere, get this game as a small subsitute.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2003"}

For this game pak to operate, you must have an N64 expansion pak(sold separately installed in Your N64).","reviewerName":"John Salerno","summary":"Absolutely amazing...","reviewText":"I have said before that I think Ocarina of Time is an overall better game because of it's &quot;definitiveness&quot; in the Zelda series. But the more I play Majora's Mask and the more I uncover the depth and complexity of its plot, I sometimes wonder about that opinion. MM is truly the most innovative and unique game I have ever played, and this is due to its impressive structure. You probably already know that you must relive the same three days in order to solve the mystery of the mask, but what is not readily apparent from this premise is the extremely deep plot that materializes from it. I have already beat the main game, but there are still many puzzles left to solve that are just as involved and challenging as any of the &quot;main game&quot; puzzles. OoT has side quests, but nothing to this extent. The ability to observe people from different locations and at different times (over and over again) reveals endless plot points that would not be possible in a linear game. I am still finding new things from this game, more than a year later, and it is still not completely done.I have also mentioned, in my review of OoT, that a down-side to MM is that you have to move quickly in order to accomplish your goals in three days before you have to start a new cycle. While you aren't usually &quot;rushed,&quot; it is a bit frustrating that you can't do some things leisurely, like go slowly through the dungeons. But despite this, I really believe there is plenty of time to do what needs to be done, and there will *always* be time to explore and discover the seemingly endless secrets of this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2001"}

His wealth, which was once a source of pride, becomes his greatest foe. Now, Wario must scramble to recover his riches.Cranky CapitalistStep into an alternate world filled with quirky puzzles, swarming enemies and lots and lots of loot. You'll learn a multitude of cool moves as Wario progresses in the game. You can punch, kick, jump, grab monsters and objects and inhale surrounding coins like a two-legged vacuum cleaner. The game even has a wrestling game-ish feel, as you can string together combo attacks that The Rock would give his eyebrow for.Early on, you will learn the significance of special sticky balls that dot the landscape. Wario can cling to these balls to navigate tough spots, reach new areas, and even fight bosses.You can freely bash and manipulate your surroundings to discover secrets. For instance, you can pick up a stone pillar and swing it at your foes or spin a fallen monster to activate a switch that raises a gate.Perplexing PuzzlesThe side-scrolling action remains true to the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games that made Wario famous, but Wario's incredible range of motion gives him newfound freedom.Finding treasure often calls for flipping a colored switch, then searching high and low for the activated chest. Considering the size of the worlds and the plethora of hiding places, this can be quite a feat. When it comes to moolah, though, no task is too tough for Wario.Trap doors transport you to hidden worlds that offer mind-bending puzzles. Using your noggin' will yield some important items.

{"product_name":"B00095LIC0","reviewerName":"Bruce Aguilar","summary":"A Pink Ball of Fun","reviewText":"If you've played Yoshi Touch & Go for the Nintendo DS then you already have a basic idea of what this Kirby game is like.  Kirby will roll automatically, it's up to you to control his movements by touching him and drawing rainbow paths for him to cross.It will take agility and quick reflexes to safely guide Kirby through all the dangers that await ahead.  Younger and inexpereinced gamers might be vexed by the multiple strategies and different ways of control.  For example, you can just touch Kirby to make him roll with high speed and knock out enemies, or you can touch the enemy to stun him and then once Kirby hits him he will be taken out.Multiple unlockable mini-games give you reason to keep on playing once all the levels have been beaten.  They range from the tried and true time trail to a memory game where you have to connect the dots in the correct order.  These mini games are fun and I must confess I've had more fun with them than the main adventure.There's no doubt that the touch controls give Kirby a whole new level of interactivity, but make no mistake, this is your standard collect stars-destroy enemies-find hidden items-defeat boss-repeat, type game.  If you're a long-time gamer from the 80's like me then you may find the control mechanics aren't enough to hold your interest in this type of game.  I've simply played too many of them.  Kirby is a stong, polished title but not nearly as innovative with its gameplay as it is with it's control.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2005"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HJ68","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A great sequel","reviewText":"The Good: Excellent story telling, atmosphere, and riveting beginning and ending chapters, new Necromorphs are great additions, the multiplayer is surprisingly funThe Bad: Too much is the same, only one new weapon, the middle chapters are repetitive, the multiplayer is short livedEver since the entertainment industry was born man has always loved to be scared. Despite our curiosity for death we loath it every day yet we surround ourselves with it in an ironic twist. Dead Space 2 is just a dot on the time line of horror and death in media, and we suck it up like candy. What makes Dead Space 2 quench our curiosity for horror, and pushing the human mind to it's psychological limits? The story of Isaac Clarke aboard The Sprawl, and returning to the Ishimura, may hold the answers.Isaac Clarke wakes up in a straight jacket, and is being chased by Necromorphs once again. He has to destroy The Marker, but he doesn't know how. His journey through The Sprawl is very dangerous and gut wrenching, but  I guarantee you'll love it. The combat is pretty much the same but feels slightly tighter and a little more responsive this time around. De-limbing Necromorphs is as satisfying as ever and proves to be pretty scary and gruesome. You can now use your telekinesis module in combat such as throwing limbs and objects at enemies to kill them, but I rarely used this method.There are a ton of weapons at your disposal but upgrading them all takes a couple of play throughs since power nodes are harder to come by, and you really need to rely on buying them. The new weapon (there's only one sadly) is the javelin gun which lets you launch spears at enemies and lets you impale them to walls. A secondary fire mode allows you to electrify the spear to shock nearby enemies or do extra damage. It seems a little over powered but works well on larger enemies.Speaking of new Necromorphs there are a few new great ones. The Stalkers are really great enemies because they hide and peek around corners and rush you. Using the force gun, or the javelin gun and using alt fire are great ways to stop these guys, or just planting mines. The Pack are screaming evil morphed children that rush you in well...packs. The force gun is the best way around these guys or the flamethrower. Another new enemy are Crawlers which are morphed infants that cry like babies and their bodies can explode. Using the force gun or flamethrower works great here too.Despite the combat being the same the pacing is great, and the atmosphere is extremely haunting especially during the first few chapters. The story telling is deeper thanks to Isaac actually talking and interacting with characters. The ending is excellent, but the game runs out of steam after the first few chapters and just becomes a hallway grinding shooting fest. This isn't to say that's bad because the varied environments are nice to see, but I would have liked more scripted moments.Some other key elements have changed such as zero gravity game play. Instead of jumping from fixed point-to-point you can move around freely now and the sections are much longer and more involved. Some times a whole half chapter will be in zero gravity and this includes being out in deep space. I really liked this change and is probably one of the biggest in the game.I really feel as if the story mode was well planned out, but with the middle of the game being pretty straight forward, keeps the game from getting a higher score. The game is also a lot harder and is pretty much relentless in dolling out enemies at you without stopping. You really need to stay on your toes this time around and strategy is key to figuring out which weapons work in which situations. So, with the first few chapters and last few being the best the rest of the game is just mainly atmosphere, but it's paced well and that matters a lot.The multiplayer suite is unusual but only addictive for a little while. This isn't like Call of Duty or Halo where you'll be coming back for dozens of hours at a time. It plays a lot like the single player where you blast away Necromorphs, but human players control those too and they keep respawning until the objectives are met. You can collect health packs, ammo, etc, but Necromorphs are pretty relentless. There are four types you can play as, and each has their own unique abilities. Ganging up on humans is the best strategy, but some times the whole ordeal feels unbalanced since this is a tricky way of doing multiplayer for a game that wasn't designed for that. The multiplayer is thrilling after awhile, but once you play all the maps and classes for a few hours you'll be done.The visuals are slightly better then the first game, but show their age a bit. There are some nice lighting effects, but the textures can look down right ugly in spots and the the character models could use some cleaning up. The PC doesn't really get any enhanced features except some anti-aliasing and slightly better lighting effects. This was a huge disappointment and could have taken advantage of the new DirectX 11 graphics infrastructure. As it is, you can run this game on a mid-range PC and it will barely break a sweat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Resident Evil: Generic Action Shooter","reviewText":"The Resident Evil franchise is Capcom's storied survival-horror franchise that spawned a slew of sequels, copy-cat games, and an entire genre when the original Resident Evil was released for the PS1 in 1996. In the days of the PS1, Japanese developers often set the precedent that other developers in the West followed and Resident Evil was no exception. The series established survival-horror as a legitimate genre made up of careful story pacing, limited resources (e.g. ammunition) and careful use of fright elements (aka the \"horror\" element) to weave together a game that masterfully ratcheted up the tension as the player progressed. Fast forward to today and the gaming landscape has changed dramatically. Japanese developers while still relevant have largely taken a backseat to Western development studios and the mega-selling franchises made by the likes of Bethesda Softworks, Activision, 2K Games and more. Where once Capcom set precedent they are now followers chasing the elusive success that few developers dream of achieving. That is where we are today and that helps explain the \"why and where\" of Resident Evil.--------------------RE 6 STORY:I own and have played every numbered Resident Evil game on consoles and have played many of the series spin-off titles such as Resident Evil: Code Veronica, Raccoon City and many others. The original RE and main numbered sequels had a relatively straight forward premise - a series of unexplained events centered on what appeared to be a dilapidated mansion on the outskirts of Raccoon City was the epicenter of what turned out to be experiments by rogue company Umbrella. As the series progressed and grew in popularity the story had to expand to include more locations, characters and events. That brings us to RE6. To put it bluntly the story is a mess. If you're able to follow what's actually happening in RE6 with any frame of reference you're in the minority.RE6 presents 4 playable story arc's. Each features a main RE character with a partner with the exception of perhaps one. Chris Redfield & Piers; Leon Kennedy & Helena Harper; Sherry Birkin & Jake Muller; and finally (Spoiler ahead) Ada Wong and a partner. Each story is independent of each other and each plays out like it's own RE game. The stories intertwine and characters cross paths at various junctions and in brief moments help each other out. The more story arc's played the better your understanding of the events and motivations of the characters involved.The main issue here is presentation. Resident Evil and the simple story of a rogue company operating outside of the weapons program run by the government has evolved into multitudes of characters, events, locations, endless variations of the T-virus and so on. What's left is an utter mess and essentially an excuse to run through a game shooting stuff. Capcom has shed most of the survival horror elements in favor of trying to emulate action games in order to appeal to a wider (read: Western) audience. They fail miserably. Where Western developers can generally succeed in delivering some sort of coherent story that makes basic sense Capcom falls on their faces. RE6 is rife with terrible dialogue, poorly voice-acted segments, over-the-top melodrama, non-sequitur's, and classic Japanese nonsensical events.What this all boils down to is RE6 is a generic action shooter that tells a poor and confusing story in order to move characters from one over-wrought boss fight to the next. There is no pacing, no scares, just action scene after action scene. It's like watching a Michael Bay movie without the close-up, slow-motion shots of Megan Fox. Just explosions and gunfights, with helicopters and some giant monsters and helicopters exploding and more explosions... did I mention the game has explosions?The best story-arc is Sherry and Jake's simply because it adds a few interesting turns, dials down the explosions, and allows for a bit of dialogue and background change. It is of course capped (like all the other story arc's) with an over-the-top, \"he's not dead yet!\" boss fight.--------------------GRAPHICS:Similar to RE5 in a sense that the graphics engine seems to use a grain filter. Colors are earth tones, and generally dark. A lot of this game takes place outside at night and inside buildings. I would use the term 'adequate' to describe the graphics. They're neither outstanding nor poor.--------------------GAMEPLAY:Again this is very similar to RE5. Capcom received a lot of flak for failing to allow players to move and shoot in RE5. That gulf in technological know-how has finally been cracked by the ace team at Capcom HQ. So thankfully you can shoot and move, albeit awkwardly. There is also a cover system that tries to emulate what other shooters have been doing for years if not decades. Unfortunately it is both awkward and relatively pointless as the controller will put up more of a fight than the enemies anyway. So standing in place and shooting is a perfectly viable tactic.The inventory system in RE games has always been a point of contention. I felt that Capcom finally got the basics right in RE4. However, because not changing a good thing = a bad thing in the minds of the Capcom development studio an entirely new inventory system has been crafted. Gone are storage containers. Instead you have a \"on-the-fly\" inventory that is in a word, imperfect. Switching weapons is done by using the D-pad 'right' or 'left' buttons. Using the D-Pad 'up or 'down' buttons enables you to use healing items and explosives like grenades or remote bombs. The problem comes in whenever you need to access the deeper inventory. For example to use a green herb you have to stop, open the deeper inventory menu, select your herb, add it to your pill-capsule, exit the deeper inventory, and hit the R2 button to pop one pill at a time that regenerates one box of health. It's insane that this passes for an inventory system. It's awkward and interrupts gameplay more than assisting with it.QTEs or Quick-Time-Events. Capcom has a fetish for these and the QTE guy at Capcom HQ has really done a number here. This game is rife with QTEs. They're everywhere and used for everything. Boss fights will, after shooting hundreds and thousands of rounds, ultimately come down to a series of QTEs. The terrible vehicle segments (motorcycle, barge (yes barge), and more) are back-to-back-to-back... QTEs. Deaths will come often and cheaply until you memorize the QTE sequence. QTEs have their place in gaming, preferably in a gaming history book under the 'Things Players Hate' chapter. Capcom has really gone over the top here.--------------------ONLINE:I played through the game completely online with a friend (also a RE enthusiast) and we felt equally about this game's shortcomings. Mercenaries mode makes a comeback in RE6.--------------------THE GOOD:(+) Capcom has a perfect example of how not to make another Resident Evil game.(+) Graphics are adequate, if not a bit too dark.--------------------THE BAD:(-) The gameplay is terrible and needs major work. Shooting and moving is awkward and slow. The cover system is broken.(-) The story is both confusing and hard to follow. Simplify things and give people a compelling reason to play. We don't need 15 evil-masterminds per game just one really good one will do.(-) The camera is terrible in many spots giving very awkward viewpoints that will result in many cheap player deaths.(-) QTE's. Please just stop Capcom.(-) Waves of unrecognizable enemies. No tension just bullets flying at wave after wave of generic enemies.(-) Endlessly mutating and resurrecting boss battles.(-) The inventory system needs to be completely redone (again).(-) Stop trying to be Gears of War or CoD and slow down the pace of the game and the action needs to be strung along not back-to-back.--------------------CONCLUSION:If ever there was a candidate for a full series reset Resident Evil is the prime candidate. Capcom has demonstrated that they're out of touch with what fans and even what gamers want in a game. If the goal is to appeal to Western gamers and a wider audience then find a Western development studio and have them do a reset on the series. Otherwise return the series to its true roots and stop trying to be Gears of War or another generic shooter. Not recommended except to the most adamant Resident Evil fans.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2013"}

If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version.

The graphics are unbelievable, they match the films so closely. Star Wars fans will be treated to the attacks on both Death Stars, the Battle of Hoth, asteriod fields, Cloud City, an assault on a Star Destroyer, Tatooine, Darth Vader's Tie Fighter Advance, and the Falcon. At times, there can be hundreds or thousands of objects on the screen, each in high detail. Remember the trench run? It's in there! Remember the 50 Tie Fighters swarming the Falcon at the end of Jedi? It's in there! If it had anything to do with space ships, and it appeared in the first 3 Star Wars films, it's in this game.However, Rogue Leader, as a game, reminds me why some movies don't make good video games. Rogue Leader is basically a space fighter game, which means that you fly in circles around targets, hoping and praying for those brief moments when your sites line up. This game just doesn't play with the same thrill as the space scenes of the movies, and I found that I'd rather just watch the films again than endure the frustration.Plus, as great as the graphics are, you have to practically crash your ship to see them! For example, the Battle of Hoth had *thousands* of stormtroopers swarming under the feet of at least 100 AT-ATs and AT-STs in one valley, but even on my 32\" TV, the troopers are no more than dots until you literally crash into them. A huge effort wasted.Finally, the total gametime is no more than 10-12 hours in length. I finished most of Rogue Leader in 2 days. There were a few secret missions and ships left to unlock, but I had no desire to do so. Rent this game, see if it's worth your money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2001"}
{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will.

My fave level is easily HOTH. However, the plot is told just at screens or in your ship, it's not so well-written. A lot of the levels don't feel too STAR WARS-esque, I think they should have introduced some SW Prequel dogfights into this, along with those ships. The codes are really cool, you can get all sorts of different ships, but they should be easier to input and save so you don't have to do it all the time. I love how the time adjusts in-game to the time that your Gamecube has, so if you're playing at dusk, Tatooine is at dusk also, and that's great. It makes it seem at least somewhat fresh, though they have you do some of the same exact things you did last time out, like race Wedge through the canyon and some missions are nearly the same as well. Voice talent is first rate, they got the actual Wedge and a reliable Mark Hamill impersonator. Ultimately, I feel RS1 was more interesting, more fun, just more exciting, RS2 seems like it should be more fun, and it isn't quite, maybe it was seeing the landscapes of RS1 being done on the N64... At any rate, some levels are great, just like the movies, others are made up and it's not fun to play the made-up levels (or levels from SW books), they aren't distinct as something from STAR WARS, it's like playing any other sci-fi shooter, maybe character interaction is key. I prefer to do what I've seen done in the films, maybe those few fights should have been concentrated on, given a few levels based on one scene, so the graphics could be even better and the gameplay could be more epic. I'd love to play the CLONE WAR in RS3, maybe Rogues weren't really around back then, but they could work around it. Anyway, parts could've been changed, made less mathematical, but it's still a pretty decent thrill.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2002"}

Coming from the PC as an avid racing sim player, I had the Logitech G27 wheel/pedal/shifter set and would routinely play GTR2, GTR Evolution, Race 07 WTCC, Richard Burns Rally, and other driving games. I wasn't expecting much from Forza3 but after reading so many rave reviews, I gave it a shot.The controls are wonderful! Driving using the Xbox controller is absolutely fantastic, although it is still a step back from a G27, but it takes up a fraction of the space and is easy to learn.The number of cars is astounding, and although nowhere near as comprehensive as Gran Turismo, it focuses on variety and a lot of \"cool\" cars. While GT5 will provide 300 different varieties of Datsuns, Forza3 has cars like the Cobalt SS Supercharged, Toyota MR2, Focus RS, 2010 Taurus SHO, Dodge Ram SRT-10, Ferrari California, Audi S5, Mazdaspeed MX-5, etc... It is truly diverse. The cars are somewhat customizable with canned performance selections and engine/drivetrain swaps, and vinyl/paint upgrades.One of my complaints is that the game was made around the time the Cobalt SS Turbocharged was released in the market (2008). Turn 10 was able to include the 2010 Taurus SHO and Ferrari California, but kept only the Cobalt SS Supercharged and not the Cobalt SS Turbocharged. This was perplexing as the LNF powered Cobalt SS Turbocharged runs neck and neck with the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X MR / GSR which was included in the game. It would have been nice to see a lowly Chevy Cobalt in the C class of cars. However, one can purchase a Cobalt SS Supercharged and do an engine swap to the LNF. Forza3 incorrectly calls this a \"Pontiac\" LNF as the LNF was first used in the Opel GT, which we know as the Saturn Sky Redline. The Pontiac Solstice GXP also used this engine a few years before the 2008 Cobalt SS Turbocharged was released. I was able to upgrade a Cobalt SS Supercharged to the same level as the real-world SS/TC and it is a blast to drive.Forza3's limitations as a simulation come into play with how the cars handle and how the tracks are arranged. With a few tweaks, my Cobalt SS Turbocharged was an A class car, maxed out to the brim. While the massive torque steer made it a handful to drive on road courses, it was somehow able to stave off Corvette Z06s! A lot of the cars exhibited severe understeer, and the use of the e-brake (as gentle as possible) causes massive loss of rear traction. Throttle lift-off oversteer, commonly experienced on front-wheel drive performance-oriented cars, was strangely missing from a lot of the cars.The FIA curbs also somehow slow down your car in the game, and hitting certain surfaces of grass or concrete will cause your car to bog down. I suppose this was Turn 10's way of penalizing you for shaving corners vice deduction of points, but they also took a lot of liberties with the track layouts. The driver's head also doesn't follow the apex of the turn, which makes it hard to see where you are going during a turn.The various racing events inject variety. There are open sessions as well as specific class/performance limited events. There are also drag races and speedway events. The most exhilarating races are Nordschleife and that insane drifting course in Japan. I am impressed with the loading times of Forza3. Even on a relatively powerful PC, GTR2, GTR Evo, and other racing sims take awhile to load Nordschleife due to the massive course. Forza3 loads it up in the same time it takes to load up much smaller tracks.I have to deduct 1 star for some of the car selection choices, taking liberties with the track layouts, the driver's head not following the apex, and a somewhat confusing performance upgrade system. Putting on grippier tires seems to make my car have a much higher performance index than doing some massive power upgrades.Overall: 4/5 stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2011"}

The game features unlockable subquests, that allow you to play the game from the enemy's perspective, and a branching story line with unique encounters.","reviewerName":"Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"","summary":"Good, but not Zwei","reviewText":"Let's get something straight right now. Panzer Dragoon Zwei for Saturn is my favorite video game ever. The music, control, level design, and graphics (not to mention storyline, secrets and multiple endings!) of that game simply put every other 3D shooter to shame (well, Sky Gunner is pretty darn good too).When it was announced that another Panzer Dragoon game was beign made, I was going crazy with anticipation, daring to hope that a game surpassing (or at least equal to) the great Panzer Dragoon Zwei was going to come my way. Now, I own both games and I have to say that Panzer Dragoon Orta (while by no means a bad game) does NOT measure up.Any shooter fan can tell you that in the world of shooters, it really comes down to only a few things. Graphics, control, music, and gameplay. The graphics are the eye-candy that makes you play, great music is what sets the perfect mood, and without great gameplay and control there would be absolutely no point in playing.The first Panzer Dragoon had a gun shot and lock-ons. Panzer Dragoon Zwei had gun shots, lock-ons and berzerkers. Now, we have gun shots, lock-ons, berzerks, dragon morphs, speed-up, and slow-down. Call me crazy, but I DO think that you can have too much of a good thing. I mean, the berzerkers were great and really added to the second game. But when a big boss is killing me the last thing I want to do is slow-down instead of speeding-up while switching to the WRONG FORM OF DRAGON. Sadly, over and over again this is what ended up happening.Shooters are all about reflexes, shooting down all the enemies before they can attack you. This game makes it more about shooting the same enemy in the same way over and over and over. And what of the branching paths? While they add some to the game, there is nothing like the path branch from the second level of Panzer Dragoon Zwei (left take flight, right stay on the ground for the whole level).I have to also say that (sadly) while the visuals of the between-level movies are incredibly animated, they aren't worth watching more than once in most cases (the one in the snow is always cool to me). And why on earth should I watch cinemas when there is no compelling story? Don't even try to tell me that there is the same sort of story-telling in this game that there was in Panzer Dragoon Saga or Zwei (Azel blows Orta away and the intro movie to Zwei where the kid's village is destroyed is better than every cinema in this game combined).In the area of Graphics, Sound, and extras this game really shines. Not only  does this game feature some of the best graphics on the X-Box and feature some great sound effects (the music is okay), it also includes the complete first Panzer Dragoon game.Games like this are becoming more and more rare. If you're hungry for a 3D shooter fix give this game a try. It has awesome graphics, sweet sound, and IS set in the Panzer Dragoon world (and get a load of the Panzer Dragoon Encyclopedia in the extras!). Just don't expect more Zwei.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2004"}

By the final mission, the music and effects got me so pumped up that I was ready to go out and enlist.That being said, actual gameplay isn't that great. If you're expecting a good First Person Shooter, I was a little dissapointed. The game pretty much amounts to the same thing over and over: finding enemies and shooting them. I noticed that there's a srategy guide available for this game. For the life of me, I don't know why, seeing as how there's no real strategy involved. The AI also isn't very well done. Every enemy can be shot easily if you simply use a sniper rifle and stay a little bit out of site. The aiming system and HUD isn't that great either. I haven't tried multiplayer, but wouldn't be too interested in it given the gameplay.For the most part, this is a great game to see how advanced graphics and computer games have come, and one I'd definately show off to my non gameplaying friends.

Yes, the graphics are good; yes, there are quick time events; yes, there are rail shooting moments; and most importantly, yes, the controls suck.This game cannot be reviewed properly without mentioning the controls no matter how often fans try to dismiss it by saying none of the RE series allows you to run and shoot, or that they don't want another third person shooter like gears of war or that it adds to the suspense.  Flatout, there is no reason to justify having flawed controls and any of them are just poor excuses to have it developed properly.  I've adapted to the controls, but no matter how good you get there are just gameplay aspects that are negatively affected.  An example of what they had to do to compensate for these poor controls is to dumb down the AI. The \"zombies\" will either walk towards you or run to you and stop within 5 feet so you can can blast them with your guns.  Same goes for the bosses who will wait in front of you for a few seconds before attacking each successive time.  So I found myself running past them and around them...not too frightening.  These are the same \"zombies\" who can ride motorcycles and drive speed boats.  (I won't even get into the inventory management, but just know it gets annoying at moments.)So even with this qualifier, I still give it 4 stars.

As time passes, his lonely town of one becomes a town of two, three...until it grows into a town to behold. The town is not the only thing to behold. Among the newcomers are beautiful ladies who have moved to the town to start a new life. Which one will be our hero&rsquo;s lucky lady? However, our hero is soon faced with a problem. Creatures of the frontier, many of them hostile towards humans, pose a great threat to the safety of his townsfolk. To find a way to live in peaceful coexistence or perhaps destroy them along with the danger they bring &ndash; the decision is up to our hero.GameplayAs with previous related games,Rune Factory: Frontierfeatures a myriad of Life Sim activities like farming, raising livestock, building relationships with NPCs, etc., as well as role-playing elements like dungeon crawling and item collection and leveling, but in structuring gameplay it goes to great lengths to incorporate an open-ended structure that allows players to choose the type of game they wish to experience at all points in the game. This means that although at the beginning of the game players will find themselves presented with the familiar opportunity of starting a farm, selling their crops at market and by doing so improving the overall prosperity and size of their town, they are not necessarily tied to the land. Although farming is an excellent way to finance adventuring, the rich RPG elements of the game can be pursued at any time. These elements present themselves mostly in the form of battling monsters and bosses that have found their way into the land, but seem to be coming from the mysterious 'Whale Island,' which floats in the sky above your town. Players can either battle the monsters or make friends with them, raising them as a kind of livestock. As with everything inRune Factory: Frontier, the choice is yours. Whether it's growing crops, expanding the town, fighting (or befriending) monsters or even falling in love, the experience is unique to each player.Key Game Features:Lifelike Interactions- NPCs will come and go based on the player&rsquo;s actions. Want to get along with your neighbor? Want to give fellow townsfolk something they might hate? Go ahead, but they may get upset and leave the town. Be nice to attract more newcomers.Natural Ecosystem- Breathe life into the barren wilderness by cultivating it and planting crops. Small creatures (spirits) will gather first, triggering a food chain to later attract larger and rarer creatures. You are responsible for bringing more fertility to the land.Floating Island to Explore- There is an island that floats in the skies. When you see it, you must quickly find a way to get on it as new discoveries await.Intuitive Wii Controls- Use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to do everything. Plow the land, shake hands with townsfolk to strengthen relationships, or even wave it around when you&rsquo;re on a date with a girl.

I love this game because it reminds me of the classicThe Legend of Zelda - Link's Awakeningon my old GameBoy. My wife loves the game too because the soft graphics remind her of the girly anime series she enjoyed while in elementary school.You have been warned.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2011"}

A dramatic tale of revenge sees Nariko, a fiery red-haired heroine, embark on a quest for vengeance against an invading King and his army. The story builds around the ancient Heavenly Sword, which once belonged to a powerful deity. It can never be wielded by a mortal without it slowly but inevitably draining their life-force.When the invading King (played by Andy Serkis) destroys the warrior clan that guards the Heavenly Sword, the clan leader&#x2019;s daughter, Nariko, takes up the sword in a desperate fight for survival.

HOW ANNOYING!4.)The total gameplay is only around 6-8 hours;not at all worth the price that I paid.I think that when games are being sold for as much money as they are,there should be a requirement for the gameplay to last AT LEAST 20 hours.I don't care how beautiful the graphics are.Beautiful graphics alone does not make a great game;in fact,it doesn't even make a good game.There are alot of great ps1 and ps2 games out there that can average 40 to 60 hours of gameplay.They just don't make 'em like they used to.I guess it's just the new generation that has to have the \"oooooooo\" and \"ahhhhh\" effects of eye candy to replace other important elements.I am going to contact Sony and demand a refund.First of all because they mislead the consumers on what type of game this is,and second because the game was a rushed product with such a short value of gameplay.I've only played my copy once,and I don't want it in my collection.If there are enough fanboys out there to keep this game and praise it because of how Nariko looks (which is a pretty lame excuse),then they can do so.But I'm not going to support a below average product at an above average price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00004U5VK","description":"PlayStation2 owners with a passion forResident Evil's  genre-launching gameplay are in luck: Capcom delivers the same  world-famous gameplay style (sans zombies) in a beautiful action-adventure  set in a mystical medieval Japanese kingdom.Onimusha: Warlordsprobably won't win any awards for groundbreaking gameplay, but the  fast-paced action promises to overload the senses with more than enough  stimuli to notice.The experience is set in 16th-century Japan, a fantastical era in which  warlords clash for control of the country. As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords. A few minutes with this game may turn any  zombie gamer into a next-generation gaming system fan.--Eric  Twelker","reviewerName":"Tim Case","summary":"Awesome game","reviewText":"One of the first games I ever played for PS2 and I still love it.

There are a lot of complaints about constant, game-ending bugs.  I did experience freezes sometimes, but not really any more than in FO3.  I got stuck a few times, like once when I dropped off a short cliff and onto a tree to keep from taking damage, and I couldn't get out of the tree.  And the load times tended to be quite long, indeed.  One doesn't need to load often when traversing the open wasteland, but every entering or exiting of a building necessitates a load.  Though the developers' use of a slightly hypnotic roulette wheel in place of one of those agonizing bars was a good one.Those issues were pretty minor.  I don't remember those parts, just the hours exploring the vast landscape, sneaking around, shooting creatures, and picking up new and cool guns to play with.  If there were bad things I could say about the game, it would have to be the notable lack of ammunition and how hard it is to keep some firearms in decent repair.  For example: my shotguns would be in constant disrepair.  And considering one needs to load a shotgun much more frequently than other guns, you've got yourself a gun jamming every reload while you try to take down the tougher foes that you needed that shotgun for!  It's absolutely counter-intuitive.  Also notable: it seems to be very easy to run into lots of enemies that can kill you EASILY in the beginning of the game and there's not much you can do about it.  Namely Cazadors, or Deathclaws if you wander in the wrong areas.  It's highly recommended you find one of the game's helpers near the beginning if you can.  Also, save often and keep about five saves in rotation.  Another thing: I really liked clearing buildings, exploring caves, and finding all the little nooks and crannies of the Capital Wasteland.  Although there are a decent amount of enclosed spaces in Vegas to root through, there seem to be fewer.  And I miss going through historical American locations.That's about all I can say negatively.  For positives: the new soundtrack is nice.  I really got into the 40s big band music of FO3, and am happy to hear more.  A couple of the NV songs started to get on my nerves, but then again I'm sure we all heard enough hackin' and wackin' and smackin' in our times, too.  The western vibe and brown was a nice change from the gray of the Capital Wasteland.  Not better, just I spent many hours within the Capital, so the different scenery is nice.  Really what you're getting with Vegas is the same general stuff in a completely different setting, with new guns and characters.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  It feels more polished with what's included.  Like there were concepts in FO3 that weren't full realized, and with this new release the developers said, \"Let's sharpen these edges.\"  The game isn't without its faults, and if I had to pick whether FO3 or NV was superior, I would have to say that New Vegas has a superior design (minus bugs) but 3 works better in execution.This is a four star game, I believe quite firmly.  It just needs a few patches to fix the bugs, and a few DLCs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0IVC4","description":"","reviewerName":"J. E. Lin \"I'm too lazy for signature\"","summary":"I feel somewhat statisfied","reviewText":"Graphic: 8.5/10I picked up 3 games (this guy, monkey ball and ridge racer) with friends and this one definitely has the best graphic. At least it looks pretty close to the console version. Animations are fluid and the colors pop out. Backgrounds are details too but please note that all moving objects, such as lava from volcano, monkeys in jungle and npc on the streets are all non-moving now, due to the capacity cut I think. The background is only a pasted picture, which is not essential to a fighting game but sometimes does feel annoying.Game play: 9.5/10Very solid. In fact, as solid as the console version. The frame rates are good for the most of time, and the hitting feeling of punches and kicks are outstanding. You got the full roster of the console game which has 35 characters and the balance are made well. By \"balance\" I mean every character has his/her own strength and weakness and there's no such a character that way stronger than others. It is a matter of your skill.Talking about skill, it must be mentioned that the lower screen can be set for 4 moves. If you have trouble memorizing the move combination or using a hard move, you can put it in the lower screen, and simply touch that grid, your character will make that move. This is a controversial setting but given that 3ds is just a small handheld, I do like this setting because I don't have to mess up with the analog pad too much (plus, my little cousin can now use those move too, lol)Sound: 9/10Better than I expected. The upgrade of sound from DS to 3DS is obvious, and the game includes almost all sound effects from the console version such as the \"yells\" when your character do a move (hadooooooooooookeiiiiii things like that).3D function:It works for most of the time, you have a good sense of depth. There are clearly 3 layers: the HP bar and other icons, your fighter, and the background. There is an extra viewing angle which is 45 degrees behind your fighter. This angle gives even better 3D effect but you probably will just use to experience the 3D because it makes you very difficult to judge the distance between you and the opponent. Often times you think your kick can hit your opponent but you can't. In my opinion it is not necessary to use 3D for a 2D fighting game though, and street fighter is NOT the best to show off your new naked eye 3D devise. I think monkey ball is the best one.Other note:If you have big hands (as one of my friends), you may find using the L and R keys is a little hard. It won't be a big issue in other games, but for a fighting game you need very good timing and precise actions. My friend and I are at about same level in console version, however, he SUCKS in 3DS version because his fingers somewhat \"stuck\" in the LR keys, hahahah.Another note: Please take care your eyes. I had my cousins, parents, girlfriend(too bad it is not plural) and some other friends try the 3D, after about 25 mins they all felt some level of eye strain. Please do not use the 3D effect for a long time and don't play when you lay on bed or in a dark room.I haven't had a chance to test online multiplayer yet, but overall this is the strongest launch game for sure. There are some sacrifices here and there comparing to the console version, but overall it worth the money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

This is a game for anyone who enjoys playing videogames. A game as good as this is hard to find. It has a ton of variety, very good gameplay, immersive storyline, spectacular graphics, and more.One good thing about the storyline is that you don't have to play any of the prequels to this game in order to understand it. The game takes place in Cyrodiil, which is a province in the land of Tamriel. At the beginning of the game, the emperor of the land gets assassinated(don't worry, this isn't a big spoiler). As a result, portals to hell(or \"Oblivion\", as the game refers to it) start to manifest themselves all across Tamriel, and hostile demons come forth from them. You play as an unnamed character, and your job is to find the emperor's illegitimate hair and crown him, so that the demonic invasion will stop.The graphics in this game are very good, especially on a high end PC. There's a big variety of environments, such as open fields with forests and bushes, old ruined forts, stony damp caves, hellish planes, vast lakes, etc. One impressive thing about the game is the physics engine. Your enemies' bodies have ragdoll physics, which means that they move after they die. For example, if you kill someone at the top of a mountain, his body will tumble down and twist around as it falls. You can even manually move bodies around. One of my favorite features is that arrows actually stay stuck in their victims. As you can see, the graphics are quite amazing.The thing that makes this game so special is the tremendous variety. Basically, you can play this game any way you want to. You can sneak into people's homes and steal their stuff, you can do the Main Quest(the one related to the storyline), you can do sidequests, you can explore the land to find treasures, you can attack anyone you like, you can go around the cities talking to people, you can play as a good character, you can play as a bad character, and a lot more! There are also 4 different guilds you can join: Fighters' guild, mages' guild, thieves' guild, and Dark Brotherhood(assassins' guild). I won't tell you any more about the guilds, as I don't want to spoil them, but I can tell you their very fun, and they each have a very interesting storyline. There are also a ton of people in each of the major cities, and they each have full voice acting, and talking with them can often lead you to great rewards. You can also go to any of the houses (or stores) and see what they have to offer.The game has 10 different races you can play as:1. Orc- makes good fighters2.Breton-half human half elf. They usually have a higher magic resistance than other races.3.Imperial-human. a balanced race.4.Redguard-make very good fighters5.Nord-have high resistances to cold, and make good barbarians.6.High elf- specialise in casting spells, but have a low magic resistance.7.Dark elf-a balanced race. Specialises in using bows, swords, and magic altogether.8.Wood elf- specialises in sneaking around and using bows.9.Argonian- Reptilian race that is resistant to disease and can breathe underwater.10.Khajiit- a Tiger-like race that has night vision.Each race has a different thing in which it specialises, and each race also has 2 special abilities it can use. Not only is there a variety in the races, but there's also a variety in the character classes.There are a lot of skills in this game. Each character class has 7 major skills in which it specialises. For example: The thief class specialises in sneaking, lockpicking, marksman, acrobatics, etc. the warrior class specialises in using blades, axes, using heavy armor, and so on. There are about 20 different classes you can choose. However, the best thing to do is to create your own class. You can pick your major skills, specialisations, etc., and it's really the best option, as it lets you play the game like you want to. You can play as a powerful warrior, a wise mage, a stealthy assassin, etc.The action in this game is good enough to satisfy even non-RPG fans. There are basically 2 combat controls: block, which lets you use your shield, and attack, which lets you use any weapon you have equipped. But it's much more fun than it sounds: As your combat abilities progress, you gain better, more powerful attacks. You can use a power attack, which lets you do more damage, you can use an attack which lets you disarm your foes, an attack that paralyzes your enemies, etc. Not only that, but you have a variety of weapons to choose from. There are daggers, short swords , long swords, axes, maces, hammers, bows, magical staffs, and more. Other than physical combat, you also have magic and stealth. There are about 7 magic types, and the spells are things such as shooting fireballs, shooting lightning bolts, leting you breath underwater, using telekenisis on items, summoning creatures to fight for you, and a lot more. The stealth also works very good. If you sneak up behind someone undetected and attack them, you'll do extra damage. You can also hide behind corners and in shadows to remain undetected.So, how does this game revolutionise RPGs, you ask? Well, there are several reasons. You don't gain experience by killing creatures, you gain it by doing skill specific stuff. For example, you advance your sneak skill by sneaking around , you advance your blade skill by using swords, and so on.One very important thing about the game is taht it's VERY, VERY long. There are tens of sidequests, and above a hundred dungeons and places to explore. You can play for dozens of hours and not even touch the Main Quest. This is the sort of gam that can keep you preoccupied for well over 50 hours.So, if you're looking for a fun, long game with great graphics and a very good storyline, buy this game. Even if you don't like RPGs, I still recommend that you buy this game. Do yourself a favor.WARNING: Don't buy this game unless you have a very advanced computer. This game has very high system requirements, so not everyone will be able to run it on their PC. If you're unsure if you'll be able to run it, go here: [...] In the search feature, look for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2006"}

Some are excellent, some are boring.  Islands and Sketch are the cream of the crop in the multi-player games.  Both are fun, easy to use, and challenging at the same time.  Sketch is my favorite.  It is similar to Pictionary, and we played with 4 players.  Reaching the high score is the objective, but the coolest feature is the slideshow of your pictures at the game end.In single player mode, Shutter is my favorite.  It is sort of like a CSI adventure where you are photographing suspects (and there is not always a lot to time to do that).  As you solve one area you can progress to other scenarios.Next favorite is Gamer.  This is the funniest in a humorous manner of any game I've played in a long time.  You have to play a game within the game which requires you to watch for Mother who shows up at many locations trying to catch you not sleeping.  Sort of like an old game called Buzz where kids are in a hot tub with a gorilla who sleeps and when he awakes tries to catch the kids doing something wrong.Taxi is another fun game where you must shoot down UFO's and rescue the passengers stolen from your cab.The other games are all fun to try, but with each there seems to be some problems.

Maybe that's a bit harsh, but the fact that the Wii versions came 2 years after Corruption without any significant enhancements besides motion control and bloom lighting has curbed my enthusiasm.

All the Chozo Lore entries that defined the NTSC North American GCN version of the game were removed and replaced with the PAL entries which is UTTER BULLS***. Three of the Pirate Data entries suffered the same fate. If you live in the USA and are new to Prime, I urge you to get the GCN version instead before you get this. For the fans, this is a must-have, although Prime 1 is tarnished by the Rape of the Chozo Lore. I, it should be noted, have memorized all the Chozo Lore and Pirate Data entries over the course of many, many years playing them, so I recite the originals when I scan the the shit in the game.

Secondly the remote is not lit, I guess I'm spoiled by my Harmony 880.

P. Stathoulopoulos \"nick9155\"","summary":"The LC","reviewText":"It's a GTA game...what more could you need to know?This game is a big treat and very welcome to those who don't take full advantage of XBox live, and it continues the tradition of making 'ported' and 'download only' games eventually available on the console, and at a reduced price.  (Still no word on a console version of Chinatown Wars, though.)These 'spinoff' games are typically shorter than the main game, the missions tend to be easier, and the focus is on more immediate fun.  You don't have to unlock any parts of the city (everything is instantly available), and the missions are often focused on shooting up rival gangs and causing havoc, presumably to reduce frustration.  The two games here are very different in tone, but make no mistake, GTA-esque action abounds.  The stories are also interwoven with each other and with the original GTA IV story, meaning Niko and Roman Belic appear as side characters, in addition to Brucie and other Liberty City miscreants.The weapons may be the biggest improvement---we get a crop of new and very improved weapons that will ensure you spend that many more hours blowing up things real good.  There's an automatic pistol, a couple of ridiculous shotguns (an auto shotgun and then some kind of combat shotgun with explosive shotguns that feels like an earthquake when it strikes something), a M-60 or SAW-esque machine gun (similar to Ghost Recon), and even sticky bombs, which go a long way towards terrorizing Liberty City.  Just rampaging with these new toys alone will provide plenty of replay value.  Some new vehicles appear, including some very fast new sports cars, an AMC Gremlin-lookalike, an attack helicopter, and best of all...an APC / SWAT (or NOOSE) tank.Typically, there are new features and side missions.  I loved the gang war aspect of LaD and the similar drug war missions in TBoGT.  Too bad they haven't brought back the empire building element from Vice City Stories.  Oddly, you can't do vigilante missions this time around (nor taxi, or fire, or ambulance, etc).  Very surprised they didn't mess around with vehicle modification, either...the whole biker gang/chopper angle was ripe for it (or maybe the intentionally did not want to overlap with the Orange County Chopper obsessions).  TLaTt is the grungier and darker story, concerning an outlaw biker gang.  You play Jonny, a gang member caught between the recently released gang leader, rival factions, the mob, and the usual insanity.  TBoGT is decidedly less somber and features more ridiculous missions.  You play Luis, a bouncer in some of the biggest clubs in the city.  It inserts more of the earlier GTA humor into the proceedings.  The club angle is also fun as the protagonist can do shots, dance, and brawl...or play bouncer, instead.  There's also a cage fighting bit in TBoGT where you can hone your melee skills and earn a few extra bucks.As for the audio, we get the same stations as GTA IV, though with a couple of changes (the hardcore station is now death and black metal and blares constantly throughout TLatD, and The Journey changes in name only), but with all new songs.  Many of the commercials are the same, but the talk shows are all new.  Perhaps best of all is a belated take-off on the Howard Stern show called 'The Martin Serious Show' that pointedly rips the shock-jock by mocking the cynicism and 'funniness' of 'the show'.  There's also new material on the TV, highlighting just how much work goes into these games.Admittedly, while GTA IV was amazing in some regards, it was also a step back in others.  I still think the most 'packed' GTA game was San Andreas, in terms of the ridiculous amount of things you could do---missions, skills, side missions, and the incredible size of the playable game space (essentially three cities in one game).  To really pick on IV...what is up with the cheats?  The least amount of cheats of any GTA game, by far.  No flying cars...no ridiculous outfits for everyone else, no gang wars, no armed civilians, no airplanes!But let's give the game its due.  It's still GTA IV, but with new stories, and some new improvements.  This is a great way to feed your GTA addiction until the next game (new platform or ported) appears.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start.

If not for the mediocre controls, and the lack of fluidity that has become known to the Tekken series(the one exception would be Tekken 4), this game would be much better and may even merit a 5.

Gorgeous graphics and freeform gameplay make this great for teenagers and adults.To start out, you're a retired hitman, enjoying the beauty, peace, and serenity of Sicily, Italy. You talk with your friend, the priest, about your hope for being one with God. Unfortunately for you, this is when the bad guys show up and kidnap the priest.You don't have the $500,000 ransom they demand, so you call up your agency and arrange to do some missions for them in return for help rescuing the priest. And you're off! You're wandering through very well done maps, with a diverse collection of tools at your disposal. Do you pick the locks to go in the back way? Shoot the guy from the trees, sneak up and wire him, maybe chloroform him in a corner?The game is very open-pathed. You choose which way to approach a mission, what might work best. Your opponents are smart and react to finding bodies or to unusual behavior. This isn't a go-here-then-go-there game, it's a game where you're placed in the world and have to decide which approach works best for you. There's a stealth meter, you can hear your footsteps, you can see your shadow.Having just finished playing Splinter Cell, though, the game suffers a bit in comparison. The movements are more jerky, the lighting quality not nearly as good. You can peer through keyholes, but not around a partially opened door, or shoot around the door. You can't move along walls and peer around the corner. So some stealth techniques we found quite natural and helpful from Spliter Cell were impossible here.Also, the open-endedness of the missions can lead to frustration. Even taking one step two far or opening the wrong door can lead to mission failures, so you can spend hours on a single mission trying to figure out which technique will work. In essence you learn what each AI character does and then work around it - which isn't very realistic.Still, the game is quite fun to play, the graphics are very nice, and the missions are interested. Recommended for any fan of the stealth-fps genre.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2002"}

I borrowed this game from a friend who got it the day they released it.  He played the campaign for about an hour and then played the on-line multiplayer for a couple hours.  He said he didn't like it and loaned it to me the next day.  And, well, hate to say I didn't care for it either.Now I hardly play on-line.  If you do, this review probably doesn't have much to offer you in regards to this game.  I only played the campaign.  And, quite honestly, I now have zero interest in playing this title on-line after the disappointment of the campaign.Why?  Well...It was just plain cheesy.They tried to cram too many things into it.  Meaning, you fly a chopper, an SR22, operate several vehicle-mounted guns, different carry guns and I can't even remember all what else, but the problem is the way they only have you do each of those for a very short time.  Hardly enough to catch on to it before they switch you to something else.  I don't know, maybe they are catering to people's A.D.D.  I found it annoying.  Not much of what you get to do is really all that fun and even when it is (flying the choppers) it doesn't last long at all.The best graphics / action / scenes are the cut scenes.  Pretty much what you saw in the ads.  Forget about repelling like they showed i the ad and like you do in Rainbow Six.  Yea, you do that once or twice here.It was a very short campaign.  The cut scenes went on forever, however.  There is one part where you have to crawl around on the floor trying to get out of a building in slow motion.  Crap, that was boring and went on forever.Seriously, I understand that we all have likes and dislikes and I'm not trying to convince anyone to see things my way.  What I am saying is that I JUST finished the campaign.  I played it over about 3 or 4 days, playing an hour or 2 each time.  It was a real let down.  And then they topped it off at the end with zombie crap - which I hate.  I see that as a cheesy attempt to do that which you failed to do within the genre you chose, war in this case.  Don't get me wrong.  I can play Left For Dead because I expect Zombies.  Just like I can watch Night of the Living Dead because I expect Zombies.  But sorry, I don't want to see Zombies in a war video game...or \"police action\" as Vietnam was called...anymore than I want to see them in Saving Private Ryan.  Again, maybe you are different.  And note that the zombies are in the \"extra\" at the end, not in the campaign.Also (SPOILER ALERT), the line, \"We Won\" at the end is laughable.  But then again, maybe the folks who play this care not at all about that gross inaccuracy.  Or maybe I was just so let down by the campaign that I'm taking it too seriously.  Either way, it's back in the jewel case ready to go back to my friend.I can say that I really doubt I'm being too critical.  Look at how fast the price went down.  Hmmmmm.And let me head this off before it gets started.  If you're trolling, looking for an argument, I won't entertain you.  Again, this is a review -it is MY opinion- and I tried to give you my take on it.  It is neither fact nor fiction, but merely my opinion and feelings as I just finished the campaign, saw the zombies coming through the door in the \"extra\" at the end and put down the controller.BTW, from the same friend and at the same time as Black Ops, I also borrowed and have played Battlefield: Bad Company 2 (campaign and on-line).  I just put an order in for my own copy of that just today as we keep fighting over that one.Neither of us will be fighting over who gets to hang onto Black Ops.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2010"}

So after my wife hit up some crazy Coach sale, I decided it was time for me to take the plunge into full-on geekdom'. So after a little money, I found myself laying next to the pool with a PSPgo in hand.I must admit, I am impressed. Most of any mobile gaming experience I've had is just crappy cell phone games and a few decent ones on my wife's iPhone. I absolutely love this little device! Unlike the original PSP which is a bit clunkier and uses little discs for all its games (called UMD's), the PSPgo is lightweight, fits in your pocket and is truly powerful. This seems to have it all with built-in WiFi, Bluetooth and a stellar little sound system. You can play games on the device or via a PS3 controller and there is even an AV cable if you want to hook up your PSPgo to the TV for those times when you're away from home and want to play \"for real\" with the controller or watch a movie or two you have saved on the PSPgo. Besides playing some great game titles I can remotely access my PSN account to check messages; I can even turn on my PS3 over the internet to play files such as music and movies stored at home on my PS3. The PSPgo can also play online multiplayer games, access the PSN store, download tons of game demo's and with 32gb of possible storage (16gb device + 16gb memory card inserted) I can also listen to my entire MP3 library which is now stored on the device itself.

{"product_name":"B00CX8VY4S","description":"","reviewerName":"Bart Motes","summary":"Big but shallow world fails to hold your interest","reviewText":"tl;dr: It's okay--but the gonzo violence doesn't match with how serious the game wants to be. Four stars for technical excellence, only three for fun.There's much to like about Watch Dogs, an openish-world game set in a near future Chicago, but I didn't find it compelling. Decent graphics and interesting game play gives you lots of options to solve problems--you can walk in blazing, sneak around, and use environmental tools to distract and blow up your enemies. It's a rich world, but ultimately dissatisfying. Why?I think its because Watch Dogs sets itself to be a grim, serious, interesting techno-thriller, but ends up being a good but not great stealth and hacking themed Grand Theft Auto knockoff. The game opens with a very dark, well-produced segment where the player character faces some tragedy as the outcome for his hacking activities. Fast forward a year and you're trying to figure out what happened and get revenge for the death of your niece. Ok, motivation. Got it. From there, you get to run around hacking phones, jacking cars, doing minor and major missions.The main problem with the game is that is not nearly as serious as it would like to be. It is hard to take Watch Dogs seriously when you run over multiple civilians and have gun fights in the street without attracting police attention, but if you steal the wrong person's car, the wrath of justice falls down on you.That said, if you take it for what it is: which is a variation on the Grand Theft Auto theme with light collectible/role playing game elements (you can choose which skills to improve and buy weapons, all of which appear magically from your Trench Coat of Holding), Watch Dogs can hold your interest for a long time. Running enemies off the road, hacking cameras to blow up power grids and incapacitate bad guys, and hacking everything in sight is pretty fun.There's also an interesting aspect that other players can hack you during the game. This starts a mini-game in which you have to apprehend the other player before he finishes hacking you. On the downside, there do not appear to be enough players to make this viable. Although I got hacked a couple times, I haven't been able to find a game to hack myself.Overall, an interesting but not amazing game. It hits all the technical points but fails the basic test of making me want to keep playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience.

{"product_name":"B0050SZE2G","description":"","reviewerName":"A Gamer at Heart","summary":"GTA in the Jungle","reviewText":"OK, as you might guess from my Amazon screen name, I like to play games. I play primarily PC games, and within that genre, I primarily play shooters although I like to mix it up with a good action RPG every so often (Witcher 2, Skyrim). Because I am a bit older than your average gamer, I have played an awful lot of shooters. I played the first Far Cry back in the day and loved it. It was truly open world, with intelligent AI. I salivated at the thought of Far Cry 2, and wept in disappointment because I thought it was just so bad. So, when I read about Far Cry 3 last year, I sort of went \"meh.\" It sounded exactly like the Far Cry I played 10 years ago, and besides, the last one sucked. So I decided against getting it.Then, I ran out of games and Amazon had a great sale. I picked this up for under $20. I figured it was an acceptable risk in case it was a poor game, or just a rehash of the original. Glad I was wrong in my expectations - this game is really, really good. I thought for sure I would detest the hunting side games, which are necessary to increase the size of your weapon holsters (so you can carry up to 4 weapons), and I thought the game would quickly get tedious. Nope.The open world nature of this game is truly awe-inspiring. You travel among various islands, killing pirates who have wronged you and your friends. The weapons are great. The environment is even better. Once, I was trying to stealth up behind two enemies walking down a road. Suddenly, a tiger came out of no where and killed them both. There are random acts of awesome things like that every where. I have accidentally fallen off cliffs, landed in deep water, and found new places to explore. I have thrown a molotov cocktail at one enemy, and watched as the ensuing fire engulfed the jungle, huts, and other enemies as it spread. The physics in this game are amazing to watch.Best weapon? The bow. You can kill with stealth, but the real money shot is an arrow modified to have an explosive tip. A jeep full of enemies coming to kill you? Explosive arrow: it is just something you need to see to fully appreciate. You can drive the jungle roads (realistically I might add) in cars, jeeps, and ATV's. You can hang glide from tall cliffs. If you can see it, you can pretty much travel to it. Although Ubisoft marketed this game as \"Skyrim with guns!\" the open world really reminded me of the GTA series but in the jungle instead of the city. And, it has a decent story with quality voice acting.Truth be told, if I had purchased this game when it came out last year for full price, I would have felt I got my money's worth. I am still glad I waited because it was even sweeter to pick it up so cheap. So, if you are a bit jaded in the FPS realm like I am, you might want to give this a try when it is next on sale. (although its current price of around $30 is still a great deal) You might be pleasantly surprised like I was.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2013"}

Like other reviews have stated, this game is like a mini GTA with bikes and youngsters.  This game has a certain appealing charm to it.  There is always something to do, between going to class and your free time before curfew.  I didn't really care for the \"have to be to class on time\" aspect of the game.  I don't like feeling pressure to go to some animated video game class but this game manages to make you feel it.  The classes themselves are just mini-games and if completed with a high grade you will be rewarded with different items to enhance your inner bully.  I played this game for a few days and enjoyed it, but it didn't take long for the charm to wear off and i found myself wanting to move on to the next game.  It would be a good rental in my opinion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2009"}

Thiel\"","summary":"Outstanding quality and function, though I wish the controls were easier to understand.","reviewText":"The only other products I ever took to so completely were bicycles (I am a cycling freak), the Sony Playstation, and the Apple Computer.  I am proud to say I was there from the beginning with both the Playstation (and the Walkman) and Apple, I have stuck with both of these brands throughout my life, and only very rarely been disappointed.These headphones intensify the Playstation experience for both games and movies.  If you do not have a home theater system, this is your best alternative, and even if you do these are essential for anyone who lives in a household where not everyone shares your love for surround sound.And there's something for everyone on these headphones.  Personally, I'm not a fan of bass boost at all, but I can turn it off.  If I did want more bass, there is greater range via one of the sliders.  Volume as well is not a problem.  You can choose virtual surround or just plain stereo--both are excellent.  And there are several modes for everything from games and movies to specific kinds of audio experiences.OK, so the only thing I don't like on these headphones is that it's impossible to know which button or switch controls what without taking them off and reading the barely readable, tiny lettering next to each--until you memorize them of course, but then you might not use the set for a while and have to rememorize them.  They should at least put some raised shapes or bumps on each to differentiate one from the other by touch.One of the most impressive things about these headphones to me though is the total lack of signal noise.  I have another set of Sony wireless headphones which only play in stereo, and with those I often experience some crackling, whereas with these that's not a problem.  And the range is excellent.  I can be anywhere in the house and hear what's playing on the Playstation.  I haven't tested the limits by trying them outside the house, but so far no problems whatsoever.In terms of construction, they are solidly built.  I don't foresee them falling apart like other 'high end' headphones I've had in the last few years which failed on me.In addition to the wireless function via a USB port, they also come with a wire which you can use with portable devices such as the Sony VIA or an Apple iPod/iPhone.Bottom Line: These are an excellent choice for the avid gamer or movie addict, and will also serve those who want to use them for listening to music.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2012"}

I will note however that you don't really get too attached or care much about any of the characters, which was a missed opportunity.2) The atmosphere and general look of the game is very well done.  A lot of detail with a more vibrant color scheme than most games that have the washed out, bland look to them.3) Voice acting for the most part was fine though a few characters were a bit irritating and some of the comments were more than worthy of an eye-roll but overall it didn't really detract from the game.4) The enemy AI was done well - almost too well in parts, which added significantly to the frustration factor in a few areas but the game remained challenging throughout.5) The combat system is similar to the Batman Arkham Asylum game though it's not quite as good.  The dodging is spot-on and movement is very fluid.  The idea of customizing your combos to fit your gameplay style is a great idea though there is a bit of a learning curve.  You unlock more \"pressens\" (as they are called)  as you level up so you can really customize your combos as you get further into the game.  You also get special powers which add significantly to your arsenal during battle (more on that later).6) Graphics were also good - I have the PS3 version and experienced no frame rate issues at all, even when there were a lot of characters on screen.7) I know quite a few people complained about the climbing portions of the game and how they weren't challenging, which is true but it's not Uncharted so if you don't expect it to be, you'll be fine.8) The game is very linear - which could also be a con but its not an RPG with a massive world to explore so I didn't expect it to be.  There are a few extras to find - you'll see photos which will show you where to find a power up item or find some little screeching parasite thing, but other than that, it's linear but at least you always feel like you are moving forward.The Bad:1) Back to the combat - while you can customize your pressens into combos based on your gameplay, you often can't complete the combos because you are swamped with too many enemies or enemies you have to use special powers on, leaving you dodging or just running in circles trying to break up the pack or kill time before your special powers cool down.  Sure you can almost always get in a 3 or 4-hit combo but you don't get much of a payoff until you start getting 6 or 8-hit combos, leaving the whole idea a bit cumbersome to say the least.  The special power moves often have massive cool-down times and when you can't use a combo to knock the time down, you will end up running around a lot - especially early in the game.2) The camera angles were often a hot mess.  Mostly they were a mild annoyance but a few times they cause your demise during battle which is downright irritating.  There is no lock-on button and while you can reset the camera to be positioned behind you, during battle you are moving around too much for that to be of any use.  Often I found myself wailing on the wrong enemy, thus wasting my precious special power combo.3) There are no health packs or med kits  - except for a few health stations scattered here and there so if you get low on health during a battle, you have to use your regeneration combos to regain health.  Now that may sound good on paper - health at your command but just read the previous section again and see why that can be a problem.  Also, as your health gets low, the screen starts to scramble, filling with pixels that move around, which are distracting and sometimes actually block your view.4) The memory remixes - yes, sadly this ended up in the bad section even though I didn't want it to be here.  I loved this unique idea and it provides more insight to your character's struggle with morality than anything else, they are few and far between and end up being more trial and error than anything else. So you end up watching the original memory, rewinding, changing details, whoops screwed it up, rewinding, changing different details, whoops that didn't work, rewinding, lets try this instead, no still not quite there, rewinding, oh I see I missed that option, then finally getting it right. So in the end, you're just sick of the memory and want to move on.The Ugly:1) At last we come to it - the biggest and most annoyingly frustrating part of the game by far is the fact that there are serious glitches.  I'm not talking about little bugs, I'm talking about getting into a really difficult battle and finally, after getting killed repeatedly and going at it again and again until you finally beat it and are so relieved to be able to move on and then...nothing.  The \"battle\" music never ends, there are no enemies left alive but you are unable to move forward.  Instead you wander around aimlessly, stepping over the corpses of the enemies you fought so hard to destroy only to find that you simply cannot advance.  The cure (and you'll love this)  is restarting the last checkpoint which of course is at the very start of the battle, and you have to do it all over again.  This happened to me twice - both after major battles with totally annoying enemies that were difficult to beat and then I had to do it all over.  Seriously?  Completely unacceptable.So to summarize, I liked the story even though it probably isn't something I'll remember (pardon the pun) and I liked that you could customize your fighting style and the game looks great but those glitches - while it only happened twice, it was incredibly annoying and frustrating and every time I had another battle I was wondering just how many times I would have to play the same part over again before I could move on.  Is the game worth playing - yes but only if you get it at a serious discount.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2014"}

Badly. But frankly, I don't.I was really looking forward to this game, it's ideas, concepts, graphical design, gameplay in a very vertical city. But it just doesn't work out like it should have.I like the general idea of doing this in first person, and it certainly is the best first person jump & run game I've ever seen. What they did with that is really amazing. But you know what? Once this aspect wears off and you get over that they made a mechanic work that isn't supposed to work, you realize that even though the jumping aspects work well for a first person game, they are horrible compared to a third person approach. Too many times do you fall to your death because you can't tell whether you could make a jump or not and where to jump off. Are you at the edge yet? No idea unless you stop and look down at your feet, which is something you can't generally do as the game is all about momentum.The first person perspective also means that you can't see all the awesome stuff you supposedly do. I would really like to see Faith (your character) do all this amazing stuff, but all you can see is the world slide by.The graphics are nice. It's a really unique artistic touch. But it also wears off, and eventually, you are just in a much less realistic looking city than you should be in this day and age. At times, you even get the impression this could be a title for the old xbox. (And I explicitly use the word \"impression\", because I realize this wouldn't have worked on the xbox, but the art style makes it rather hard for the developers to impress you, since it is too comicy at times).I was also disappointed that I never really got all that much of a sense of verticality. Sure, you go up and down or climb up on pipes the side of buildings, but too often, you are just on the rooftops which seem to form a new \"bottom\". Everything is very linear. Since you do not have the choice to go elsewhere (down in particular), it doesn't matter much that you are on roofs.The real problem with this game is that it isn't fun. It is all trial and error and not often did I get a sense of achievement. At the end of a level you are relieved you did it, but not satisfied. Things just don't often flow well. It is like a throw-back into the old days of jump & run with pixel-perfect jumps you have no way to time. You fall to your death a lot or get shot all the time. Never do you get a sense of \"holy moly this was an incredible thing I just pulled off with ease\" like you do when you play Prince of Persia (for instance), a relatively old offering at this point.This is a real bummer. First disappointment of the year. Not a bad game. It is still quite unique. But not the stellar experience I had hoped for.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2008"}

Lindquist","summary":"Out of this world - Now a greatest hit!","reviewText":"No one used this title yet? Seriously? Anyhow, I figured I would write a small review for this game. I don't think I have reviewed many games that would fit under the horror genre and it just seemed overdue. Warning though people, possible spoilers here.Let me begin by saying that this game is outstanding. It's interesting playing this game along side Resident Evil 5 since they did launch very close to each other. The graphics and controls are just outstanding and though the graphics in Resident Evil 5 may be slightly better, the controls in Dead Space more than make up for the experience.It starts with a simple blue fuzzy screen where a zoom up of the main character's girl friend's face makes you terrified that the game's graphics are going to be awful. And then, when you think you wasted your cash, you are pleasantly surprised by some truly breathtaking visuals. Time to relax, you made a good choice. The relaxation doesn't last too long because two and a half minutes of talking and continued pretty visuals later the S word hits the fan and you are thrown into danger. It reminded me of Resident Evil 1 back in 1996 where you knew there was nothing good that could come out of your present location, but you felt that false sense of security was justified. Wrong. They not only don't let that feeling last, but they also prove that if you didn't read the instructions and figured out how to run, you'll die quickly (like first instance of seeing an enemy kind of early). At this point you are thrown into the fire, and you have to survive and do things to help your remaining crew. The thing I liked most about this game over others I have played like it is that it really feels like your actions have purpose. The objectives aren't things you could see yourself skipping. For instance, your partner radios you tell you that the engines are offline so the gravitation pull of the planet is pulling the ship in and soon it may start doing things like exploding or starting on fire. Stopping that from happening is a great objective! Never once did I go, \"Why\" when they asked me to do something. It just felt like a great story playing out.The ambience in the game was utterly outstanding. They had a ton of scares, some obvious and others not. With the incorporation of realistic physics, a good chunk scares are you just knocking into stuff and then freaking out thinking someone is behind you. Don't get me wrong though, it's done very well. The sound in the game helps a lot with the scare factors. You will be walking down what you assume is an empty hallway but you can hear the aliens crawling around in the vents above you, or in the walls. You will hear something crawling above you and suddenly be attacked from behind. It's not cheap though, they don't spawn out of nowhere, you just need to be aware of your surroundings and take note of vents, etc.Once again, the graphics are outstanding. The shadows, shading, and bump mapping are done very well and it's not ridiculous. Little effects that they didn't even need to put in are there and this is especially noticed when you go into zero gravity or any place that outer space is involved (\"but Garrett your on a space ship!\" I know). What I mean by this is when you go into certain halls there is damage to the hull and you get to travel around the debris and look at the insane detail that was put into making the atmosphere realistic. Things float around, planets are in the distance, water flows out of the pipe in super slow motion, and the sound is extremely muted. The muted sound not only creates an awesome ambience but also masks any monster trying to bite your bum off.Like mentioned earlier, the controls rock. Do not play this game then move to Resident Evil 5 because you will be quite displeased. You walk around and are able to do full 360s with the left analog stick while changing the camera with the right analog stick. They also help speed up your response time to danger by making it so you automatically turn and aim where you are looking. This is handy if you look over your shoulder, see someone and want to shoot them immediately instead of later on. Other aspects of gameplay were mentioned earlier like missions that actually mean something, but there is another thing that makes this game awesome. You have a series of technical abilities used for puzzles and combat that almost makes this game like 1/8th a Zelda title (I lol'ed at that so I kept it in). You can use them to lift and move objects, throw them and even slow down time. It's cool to see something about to impale you only to slow down its movements and blow it away ever so gracefully.I think I covered everything. We have graphics, gameplay, sound, controls.... Oh yeah I forgot!MENU and SHOPPING/WORKBENCH: The menu system is exactly what a game like this should have. Resident Evil 5 may have incorporated a real time menu that doesn't pause the game because you wouldn't want that in co-op play, but Dead space does it because it wouldn't make any sense to do otherwise! In space no one waits for your long paused decisions in order to maul you. That might be a bit extreme but this was the first game of this kind that I played that stripped the ability to pause it, pick your weapon carefully and then proceed. You have to think on your feet or die trying. Getting back on point, the actual menus are multi-layered holograms that just pop up wherever you need and actually shed light on the environment which I thought was an awesome detail. Audio and video messages not to mention any ship controls are all holograms as well and it really gives you an idea of how cool the technology is on this ship. The shopping which I mentioned in caps at the beginning of this paragraph is pretty cool too. Picture a robotic version of the merchant from RE4 and you pretty much got the idea of it. Cool thing is you can buy armor upgrades and actually see them applied to your character as well as buy, sell, store and hand in schematics to get upgrades, etc. It's been done before, but it works VERY well in Dead Space. Another interesting thing is the workbench. It's separate than the shopping center so you have to look out for them but you can use the work bench to upgrade such things as your suit's oxygen capacity, gun stats, armor stats, etc. This was very cool and it's also nice because if you don't want to use it, you don't have to. It's possible to beat the game without it, though you'd only be making it harder on yourself seeing its not very complex what so ever (which is a good thing).I think that is about it. I think this is an amazing title that is completely worth the $20. I would suggest exploring this game's story so you are ready for the next one because it is the same main character.So are you guys ready for the spoiler? Don't read past till you beat the game.Seriously,,The first letter of every mission in the game spells: Nicole is DeadEnjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2010"}

Doing battle is fun.You can use stealth and all kinds of different types of weapons to do the job (bow and arrows, sniper rifles, assault rifles, hand guns, knife melee, ect.).  It's silly that you can't go prone.  Going prone would be a great addition since your're in a foliage filled environment.  You can only stand and crouch.  He doesn't get low enough when he couches and would benefit from going prone.NEGATIVES:To much long traveling from a to be even with the fast traveling unlocks. The Island is very hilly, mountainous, and serpentine.Crafing is very silly. It just adds to more time wasting drudgery, pads the game play and keeps you away from the fun. You have about 10 or so different items that need to be crafted to upgraded. They each get upgraded by using skins from different animals.  The all get further upgraded by using different animals, and so on.Why can't you just use the skin from one animal to craft all items?If I want to upgrade my wallet to carry more cash or my weapons holster to carry more weapons, I would kill and skin this one animal for one upgrade, then kill and skin another animal for it to be upgraded further, and then skin a couple bull sharks to be upgraded further.  This is true for everything that can be crafted.  Why can't I buy these items from the local people or from stores.  Why can't I steel these items off my enemies?First person platforming crap, silly crafting crap, just adds to the drudgery game time (the game time in between the fun parts), and keeps you from enjoying the parts that are fun. To unlock more territory that will reveal more locations on the map, you must engage in tricky first person platforming to get to the top of the radio towers and reactivate the radio.  Most can be done.  But at least one can be very frustratingly tricky and the other one impossible. It's just a needless waste of time.  It just keeps you away from the more enjoyable parts of the game.They should have dropped the silly crafting and first person platforming crap and added in more fun, challenging and exiting missions instead.

Overall, I am very satisfied, although I have a few quibbles.What I like*Setup was easy. All you have to do is connect the PX4's base station to the PS3's Optical jack and to one of the USB ports. Then set the PS3 to send audio to the Optical jack, if it wasn't already configured to do so. If you have another A/V component that needs an optical audio signal, the base station passes the signal through, even when the headphones aren't being used.*The headset is reasonably well made and comfortable to wear for long periods. No, the build quality and materials are not up to the standard of those AKG or Denon studio cans you've had your eye on but the PX4 does the job well enough in my opinion.*There are lots of configuration options, including the placement of the virtual speakers in the soundfield, a volume limiter, peak sound limiting, and mic sensitivity.*I also have a home theater audio system hooked up to the PS3 and the PX4 works seamlessly alongside it. When I'm not using the headphones, the base station automatically turns itself off and doesn't interfere with anything.*Most importantly, the PX4 system generates a soundfield with good separation and presence for the virtual speakers and the headphones sound more than good enough for gaming.Caveats*The base station does not support DTS sound. This can be a pain if a game does not allow configuring its sound output within the game (this means YOU, Assassin's Creed IV!) because you then have to fiddle with the PS3's Optical output settings to force Dolby output. You also have to remember to return the settings to their original configuration.*For the most part, the wireless connectivity is clear and trouble-free. However, I live in an area where there are lots of Wi-Fi networks overlapping each other. When there is a lot of Wi-Fi activity going on, the sound can suffer from dropouts and static.*An extremely minimalistic Quick Start guide is the only documentation provided in the box. Turtle Bay should pack in at least a stripped-down manual so that quickly checking how a feature works or how to change a setting doesn't require firing up another device.Bottom line: all you need to know, really, is that once you start playing with the headphones on, you forget you're wearing them and quickly become immersed in the game. Four stars, keeping in mind that people living in places with a lot of Wi-Fi traffic might find wired headphones to be a better choice.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2013"}

David Swan","summary":"Excellent expansion up to Game of the Year","reviewText":"If you loved Call of Duty you're likely to enjoy the expansion pack, maybe even love it. It's more of the same and in this case that's a good thing, after all some game sites declared the original Call of Duty `Game of the Year'. There are, however, a few distractions that drop the expansion pack a level or two below its famous parent.Spawning enemies. At many locations in the game the Nazi enemies will continue to pour from the hills or buildings or wherever without end, ceaselessly and remorselessly as if there were a Nazi producing assembly line. A dirty little secret of the game is that sometimes you're supposed to advance on an enemy position and sometimes you aren't. It's pre-scripted. The designers deal with an unscripted advance by ripping your character to shreds with gunfire. At some point you'll find yourself trying to judge whether or not an enemy position spawns enemies or not in order to figure out whether to advance. If it's a spawning enemy position you'll need to advance or else run completely out of ammo. Non-spawning means you have to take out the enemies before advancing. Judging whether or not the enemy is spawning definitely breaks the illusion of the game. It's also tiresome and cheap.One of my least favorite scenarios in the original Call of Duty was the ones where you protect your position against an overwhelming advancing force. United Offensive is full of these and some are HARD. Anyone playing the original Call of Duty should remember the bridge scenario where you had to defend against endless advancing soldiers coming from all directions. It was my LEAST favorite scenario. The expansion pack features a pile of new ones. It does help somewhat that the game includes more save spots.The beginning and ending were duds particularly the ending where you protect a generic train station and then the game suddenly ends. Still, it's Call of Duty and it's a load of fun. There are some fun sniper scenarios and some great house to house assaults and lots of Nazi's. The good definitely outweigh the bad if you can get past some mind numbingly difficult section. The game was actually longer than I expected and could have passed for a full game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000JLIXIG","reviewerName":"gus-man \"Play nice.\"","summary":"One of the best shooters for PS3","reviewText":"This is one of the first games I bought for my PS3 and had no doubt it would be worth buying for my collection.  The single-player campaign is wonderful... I was going to say this is the \"Halo\" of PS3 games but the Halo franchise is too historically rich for that kind of comparison.  I will agree that Resistance does not break any new ground, but what it does, it does very well.  The framerate is solid, the graphics are sharp, the audio is crisp and powerful, the environments are detailed and interesting, the enemy AI is good and there's quite a variety of baddy enemies and cool weapons and various strategies for every battle situation... use those grenades!  The story is compelling enough, there are some good surprises, some challenging situations, and overall the game kept me immersed throughout the whole single-player campaign.  The most important thing for me is gameplay, and Resistance has it in spades... it all works so very well, Insomniac really did a great job with this game.  Also you can grab a friend and play a 2-player cooperative game through the same fantastic campaign!  So awesome!  There's a \"find your buddy\" feature so you and your friend can stay tight throughout the co-op game without getting separated in the expansive environments.  Every shooter game should have this cooperative campaign put into the game, but sadly not many do.  I haven't messed with the online play very much so I won't comment on that.  The only online gaming I do is racing on GT5.My only complaints about Resistance are these:The crouch button does *not* have a toggle option, so you have to hold the button to stay crouched.  Conversely, the aim/zoom button is *toggle only*, so you have to press the button a second time to un-zoom the view.  I feel these should be reversed -- crouch should toggle and aim should not toggle.  And there is no prone (lying down) option, your character is either standing or crouching.  (At least he can jump!  LOL)  The color palette is quite drab with lots of greys and browns, even the blood is kind of greyish brown instead of the bright red it really should be.  Finally, it would have been nice to see more vehicle missions in the mix.4 of 5 stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0001ADAME","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyableReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Regis","summary":"Red is the new Hero.","reviewText":"This is undoubtedly my favorite Western shooter of all time.

In some ways better, in some ways not. Graphics and sound are better this time around, but nothing that really blew my socks off--even then. Once again the story is dreadfully weak, but I don't really expect that much from an NES title. When you start off, Princess Zelda is unconscious or something--too many beers at the Ganon-is-dead party? Once again, Link goes out to save the world. The biggest change in this game is this: Maps are top-down like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy (semi-random battles, too), but the towns and dungeons are in the side-view. The side-view graphics are good, but I wish they'd stick to the original format that was used in the first game. Throughout the game, Link can learn different sword techniques--up thrust, down stab, maybe one other. It certainly adds more strategy to the game. Also, Link can use magic spells. Once again there're tons of dungeons to go into, with the only differences being the ending bosses, mazes, and colors. The last battle in this game is pretty interesting--Link fights his own shadow--but is either too hard or too easy. At first I had the hardest time because the shadow mirrors your every move. But after about the fifth time, I figured it out and whooped him good in under a minute. So much for the ever-so-difficult ending boss. I personally have never found the Zelda series all that exciting, but this game is not too bad.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2001"}

If you're a shooter fan, you'll enjoy this just fine. I like shooters so I thought I'd pick it up. The game isn't very long and the campaign isn't even that great, but the graphics and gameplay make the game fun. This game is showing where developers can really take the Vita as far as what it can technically do.The controls for a shooter on a handheld are hard to get right and this one is no exception. They feel kind of awkward and are hard to get used to at first. Once you get it down you shouldn't have an issue though. The thing I like most about this game is the number of options you have for customizing your mercenary. There are plenty of options for different guns, grenades, sidearms, armor, etc. It makes it fun to mess around with.I've only dipped into multiplayer a couple times but I will say it's fun WHEN IT WORKS. This game suffers terribly from a few multiplayer issues such as random glitches and lag problems that can make a winning team lose if they encounter them. The other thing is the spawns. The spawns in multiplayer are some of the worst I've ever seen. Multiple time I've spawned in the midst of bullets from enemy teams and died instantly. It's an issue that needs to be brought to attention.All in all it's a decent game though and worth the money if you like shooters.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00005NZ1K","description":"The power-packing Xbox hardware delivers the third Oddworld title in one of the most brilliantly realized settings to grace any gaming system. Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film. Prepare for gaming to get very odd indeed.","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"The Evolution of OddWorld","reviewText":"I've always been a big fan of the Oddworld series, ever since Abe underwent his first Oddysee, back in the glory days of the PSone. I think the real hook for me with that first game was realizing there was a button entirely dedicated to forcing your on-screen character to fart. I'd never seen anything like it before and it's one of the major reasons I went ahead and bought my first Playstation, along with Oddworld: Episode I as my first game. It had inspired gameplay, an offbeat sense of humor that hit all the right notes, great voice acting and incredible replay value.Fortunately enough, many of those qualities have remained intact beyond Abe's second game and now into Oddworld's third chapter. My one major qualm about Abe's Exoddus (the second game), the change in voice actors for Abe himself, has now been repaired. With the old feel back again, a new character, a stunning jump to 3-D and a continuation of the old story, there should be nothing holding this game back from perfection... right? Well, not entirely so.Despite everything it's got going for it, there are a few little factors about this game which serve to do nothing more than irritate. Nearly every operation required of your character is performed with one button. The Xbox controller's \"A\" Button is used to jump, press buttons, pick things up, pull switches, activate portals, climb into a wheelchair, operate machinery, or grab a drink from one of the game's vending machines. The rest of the controller's buttons are used for conversing with non-playable characters, a task which was completed by holding in one of the L or R buttons and pressing another button in earlier games in the series. As a result, you'll often jump to your doom when you'd rather lift something up or something equally as silly. In addition, controlling Abe in the open field is notably difficult. There are points where precision is an absolute necessity, but Abe's veering left when you want him to go forward. For a game of this magnitude, with a control system that was already tweaked to perfection, it's silly that they muddled things like that. You'll eventually get used to the inadequacies of the system, but will never get to the point where Abe or Munch does exactly what you want every single time.Another thing that slightly irked me was the length of the game. Though it's certainly nothing to sneeze at, I completed everything in around eight hours. Maybe nostalgia has fogged my mind, but I don't remember the first two games as being that short. But, as I said, it's a minor issue and not one I'll really take anything away for. Just don't go into this expecting an epic on par with Final Fantasy or Grand Theft Auto.The way this game looks is simply amazing. As a first-wave launch title for the Box, I'll admit I had set my expectations a little loftily, but Munch's Oddysee surpassed even my steep hopes and wishes. Every step of this world is visually stunning, from the soft gradient of the outdoor skies to the brown, crusty grime gathered around the toilets in the later stages. The attention to detail is off the charts, and I'd occasionally just set the controller down and take everything in. It's that good looking.In addition, the pre-rendered CGIs maintain the standard set forth by the previous episodes. The cinemas were always one of my favorite parts of Oddworld, and the envelope continued its trend of moving forward here. Just great, great stuff, brought full circle with some spot-on voice work.The audio tells you everything you need to know when first gaining your surroundings in a new area. With Dolby support, it's possible to locate a lost Mudokan with your eyes shut. You can hear the click-click-click of an enemy slig down the hallway. The music is fresh, maintaining a beat in the background but never overpowering the scene. It picks up when you're being assaulted or chased, and dips back down when you're just patiently exploring. The cartoony sound effects are occasionally out of place and unnecessary, but on the whole don't interfere. My one problem with the audio was more a planning issue than anything else. Every once in a while, you'll run into a 'spiritual advisor', who tells you what you need to be doing in that part of the stage. It's pretty important you understand what he's saying, yet subtitles aren't available in case someone you can't hear him for some reason. A vacuum cleaner was running elsewhere in the house one afternoon, and I had to wait for some time before I could continue because I needed to know what he was telling me. Subs should've at least been an alternative option...The story is pure Oddworld. It kept me intrigued every step of the way, even if what I was doing was repetitive. There's an overlying theme of lightheartedness, and the same issues of extinction and over industrialization are covered in a new and interesting way. With rumors claiming there are three alternate endings, depending on how many innocents you save through the game, there's also the promise of enjoyable replay value without identical results.All in all, the series has made a successful, albeit rocky, jump into the world of 3-D. The graphics are very impressive, even by today's unrealistic standards, the audio isn't flawless (though it's close), the controls need some work, and the story has never been better. This is a really fun game to play, and though it does get a little easy, there's always just enough challenge to keep veteran players occupied without losing interest. It's a great way to kick off your Xbox collection, whether you're young or old, new to gaming or hardened from years of battle.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2003"}

You fought The Murader. Hale only has a few hours before he turns fully Chimera. When he turns Joe Capeli does something he doesn't want to but he has to kill Nathan Hale. It's a great wtf ending. Check out my Resistance Fall Of Man & Resistance 2 reviews from May or June 09. Now Resistance 3 it is a great game It did things differentially some bad but some for the better. After what happened Capeli is looked at as the bad guy he is Dishonourbly Discharged & you feel bad for Capeli. Dr Malikov found a protien in Hale's body which is a cure for The Chimerian Virus. So yes he is human again so no more healing on the fly. So it's 4 years later & he has tried to move on he married  Susan who I think is Hale's sister. They have a kid named Jack. They are with a group of survivors in a town named Haven Oklahoma. About 90 percent of humans have been turned into Chimera or are dead. New York City has been taken over by The Chimera after Hale killed Deadilous it opened a worm hole which allowed The Chimera to get control of New York. So The Chimera are attacking Haven & you battle the new Stalker & I don't like the design. Dr Malikov returns & tells Capeli about the Chimerian  Tower in New York City. You have a level where you travel by boat you fight Grims which they improve on & aren't as hard as they were in R2. You also have these suicide bomber Grims as I like to call them. The bug creatures are so annoying now they just a  s  s  r  ape you. You go to ST Louis you meet some new characters. Malikov is sick which they help him but you have to help them get an engine from a Chimerian drop ship & they'll fly you to New York. You fight The Widowmaker it is a chore to kill them especially in New York.  but they did a good job on the redesgn. You have your 1st encounter with The Brawler & he's a good edition It slows down when you go to Pennsylvania. You get a new weapon called The Wildfire I personally missed The LAARK. But The Wildfire is ok. The Chimera with sniper rifles & Wildfire's are a pain in the a a  s The sub plot with these guys called The Wardens is sort od interesting  it does kind of pi  s  s  me off that prisoners are harder to kill than The Grims. You get  a gun called The Mutator it is awesome. I love the weapon selection. You still have Yhe Bullseye, The Carbine, Rossmoore, both sniper rifles & The Auger. But you get a gun that freezes stuff, The Mutator that I mentioned, The Wildfire & some kind o electrical gun. It picks back up in New York. It's a very good resolution story. I don't think you need a Resistance 4. Some of the enemies are harder than before They changed The Bullseye to fell more like a Pulse Rifle I didn't care either way. Some enemies pi  s  s  me off. But I love  Resistance 3 it is a game I want to replay soon. If you have a PS3 & don't have R3 check it out it's a great experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2011"}

You immediately can sense the irritating influences of trophy based game play in the single player and also online gaming.  Yes we can thank Microsoft for that horrible idea.  Am I the only person who thinks that trophy based game play is tedious and annoying?  I think I must be because it seems to so prevalent.  On the other hand reality TV is also very common, and asinine so perhaps we're just following the trend here.I'm not sure how Rock Star managed to screw up the big parts of this game up so badly.  2K games just demonstrated how incredibly fun multi-player gaming is done with Borderlands, but instead of taking a page from their book Rock Star has created a crappy Free Roam version of the single play area.  So instead of a seamless experience where I can just invite my friends to quest with me, I get a bag on the side unlock annoyfest.  Seriously, the single player stuff should have been unlocking cool stuff for online play all along.  Rock Star, you fail.I must stress that he graphics really are incredibly well done, and the writers of this game were talented, but with little room for humor.  Come on people, humor goes so far in a game to improve it.  I don't think I've even gotten one snicker out of this game yet.Over all I give this game a \"Rent, but don't bother buying it.\" rating of Weaksauce +1.Update: 6/8/2010.I've downgraded this game to one star after another week.  It has very little replay value, and when I think to myself \"Do I want to play RDR for a bit?\" my answer is \"Hell no, more boring crap!\"  I definitely regret paying full price for this game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2010"}

With a gift certificate I got this game on Amazon for $25 and I think it is worth the $300 you would pay for a new console. This was one of about 7 new games I bought when I purchased my new and first nextgen console (xbox 360) a month ago. I've about finished the campaign and there are very few cons I can think going against this game.. there are occasional bugs that pop up with the AI, but the game as a whole is so incredibly impressive overall that it is really barely noticable. To be honest, the game is actually pretty tasteful in comparison to GTA (and for a Rockstar game), which I found suprising. Of course there are some exceptions to that, but the setting and story set it apart from other rockstar and western games considerably. As if the Campaign wasn't awesome enough, the multiplayer for this game is just amazing and as fun as any game I have played online ever. Better still is that the online expereince caters to just about everyone, from the very experienced to the total noobs. If you are even remotely interested in this game / enjoyed Grand Theft Auto at all, I absolutely recommend it. You won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2010"}

I just picked this up and had a chance to play through the game. It was amazing and kept me entertained.Story: While the story of Mario having to save the princess is not original by any means, in this game, Bowser has taken her to the stars and you must take back enough Power Stars (lumas) from the enemy in order to power your ship. That is the only way you can travel to where Bowser has taken princess Peach. You are guided by Rosalina and she tells you a story throughout the game on stars called lumas by reading a storybook.Gameplay: This plays out a lot like Super Mario 64. You explore different galaxies and each one has muliple planets. On each planet, you can obtain several stars. You select which star you are going for and the level is setup for you for that star. There are hidden stars and special stars you get from a comet being in orbit around the planet. The comets make you play the level with a handicap such as having to race mirror Mario, only 1 hit, fast foes, time limit, etc. Gravity plays a big part of this game. In some platforms you can move to any side including the bottom. Mario will be upside down and controls can get a little tricky like this. During the game, you will encounter planets that let you race on a manti-ray, explore underwater, and other themed planets such as fire, ice, water, etc. Some special items you can get during the game include items that morph mario into a bee, a ghost, turn him to fire mario, ice mario, and even flying mario. You collect star bits during the game that help you open up new areas by feeding them to the lumas that will transform into special items or planets.Conclusion: This game will keep you hooked. All of the levels (galaxies) are a blast. What's nice is that you can choose to try difficult levels or just skip them. You don't have to get all the stars in the game to beat it. If you want a challenge, the game does offer that and it is a blast to try and get ever star in the game. If you stick around past the ending, you get the purple comet that lets you explore every galaxy again trying to get the 100 purple coins for another star. I would recommend this game to anyone whatever age they can figure out how to use a wii controller with the nunchuk.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2012"}

I would find myself staying up late hours into the night trying to get one more galaxy complete. I haven't been addicted to a game that much since Fallout 3, but after the first fifteen hours I began to play the game less and less until I barely played it at all. Maybe it was the fact that the levels started to look alike or maybe my PS3 won my favor for a while, I'm not really sure. I did end up beating the game though and overall I am very impressed with Mario Galaxy.I was worried about the nun-chuck controls and only having one joystick, but Mario handled beautifully most of the time. There were times while running upside down that the control would reverse or just not work in the manner that I would have guessed. Nothing that ruined the game, but there were times in moments of intensity that it would have been nice to have another joystick. The challenge throughout the game is pretty even with some bumps here and there with boss battles.The graphics look great for a Mario title and really bring out all that the Wii can do in this department. The cut scenes are rendered well and really look great. Some actual voices would have been nice instead of text boxes, but that was a style choice by the deveopers.The game's length is about fifteen hours in length in order to beat the story. There are about fifteen hours left after that for those that want to get all the stars. I don't know what the reward is, but it does add some game time none the less. As I said above the game really hooked me, but then I sort of lost interest near the end. I don't blame the game that much as the levels and suit upgrades that you can pick up are interesting enough to keep your attention. Overall this game was much better than Mario Sunshine and just a little bit below Mario 64. I think Mario 64 had a little more variety. Mario Galaxy should be sampled by anyone that owns a Wii or is at any degree a Mario fan. This game is worth the forty bucks.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2010"}

My understanding of the Japanese language is limited, which was probably why my translations of Peach's emotions (ok, \"vibes\") in the review didn't correspond with what's in the English version of the game. Anyhow, if you see the terms \"happiness, anger, sadness and delight\", simply substitute that with \"joy, rage, gloom, and calm\" respectively, and you should get the picture. With this settled, let's proceed to the review proper.Mario and Luigi have been kidnapped, and Princess Peach goes on a trip to rescue them. This, in a nutshell, describes Super Princess Peach, Nintendo's latest platformer for the DS. For too long, the princess has been troubling the Mario brothers simply by being regularly captured by Bowser and the likes, so it's only right for her to do some work this time round. The role reversal results in an adventure that's not unlike previous titles in the Mario series, but still engaging enough to keep you glued to your DS.True to the nature of the series, Peach's journey to achieve her objectives is divided into worlds of different themes. These worlds are in turn divided into stages. During these stages, Peach will need to fend off enemies, solve environmental puzzles, and rescue the many captured toads that will pave the way to the freedom of Mario and Luigi. Each world also has a boss at the end, which provides a more challenging sequence that requires Peach to pit her fighting skills against tougher opponents.To do all these, Peach is given an array of skills. Apart from the usual jumping and sliding, Peach also has an umbrella that doubles up as her weapon. As the game advances, Peach will unlock new moves, which allow her to challenge the environment better. One such moves, for example, allows Peach to use her umbrella to \"hang\" in the air longer, while another lets her perform a downward-stomping attack. Some of these moves are required to solve puzzles, and are therefore important for Peach's progress.Jumping, sliding and attacking, however, are not the only weapons in Peach's arsenal. It happens that Peach is also a highly emotional lady, and her emotions bear great powers. These emotions are happiness, anger, sadness and delight, and Peach can use them to work wonders. When Peach is happy, she doesn't actually clap her hands. Instead, she spins around until she begins to fly, and we all know that flying is good in a platformer. When she's angry, Peach turns into a human torch (take that, Johnny Storm!), and she can burn wooden bridges to reach hidden areas beneath them. When she's sad, she cries, and her tears are useful in growing giant beanstalks or creating an icy platform, which will in turn help her reach (yet) more hidden areas. Last but not least, when she's delighted, she'll laugh so much until her life bar gets replenished. With powers like this, you may begin to wonder how she managed to get kidnapped so many times in the past.Apart from solving puzzles, Peach's emotions are, as mentioned earlier, important during boss fights. Every boss she faces in the game will require some form of emotional attack or two, which makes mastering them a must for any player of this game. Thankfully, using emotions is as easy as tapping the four \"emoticons\" on the touch screen. Using them, however, also depletes her emotional health rapidly, so knowing when to use the correct emotion will definitely help conserve some energy. Nevertheless, replenishment are liberally scattered throughout the stages, so it's quite impossible to run out of ammunition. Even so, Peach can use her umbrella to scoop up most enemies and literally \"eat\" them to regain emotional strength. Now you know why they said that eating relieves stress.Your interaction with the touch screen doesn't just stop at controlling Peach's emotions though. Prior to facing a boss, Peach will have to navigate through a series of obstacles without the use of the D-pad. For example, in the first level, Peach has to jump up a series of elastic bands to take on the boss, but guarding the bands are some enemies. To make her jump up successfully, you'll have to hold and drag the band that Peach is on with the stylus, adjust the direction that you want her to jump while making sure that she won't hit an enemy on the way up, and then release the band so that she could be catapulted to a higher band. In other areas, Peach could be floating down from a hilltop, only to be greeted with projectiles underneath, and touching these projectiles with your stylus is the only way to prevent her from being hit. While these are not exactly difficult to do, they do add a new dimension to the gameplay, and make this rather simple game a little more challenging.The graphics in Super Princess Peach are visually appealing. Nintendo is keeping faith with the simple, yet stunning 2D graphics that made games like Super Mario Bros. III and Yoshi's Island great, and it's not difficult to see why. Watching the action in Super Princess Peach is like reading a beautifully colored fairytale - the pictures may not be top-notch, but the vibrancy of the presentation makes it an immersive experience. Needless to say, the approach may not be everyone's cup of tea, but fans of the series will no doubt appreciate the blast of nostalgia that Nintendo has introduced into this game. To make it an even more retrospective experience, the audios in this game also utilizes a classic cutesy approach. To sum up the sound effect in one sentence, just remember the all familiar \"ding\" when Peach jumps up to grab a coin.All in all, Super Princess Peach is a nice little adventure that should appeal to fans of the action platformer genre. The story mode itself is not exactly long, with an approximate life span of eight hours. However, completists could still find it worthwhile to spend time unlocking all items and enemies, as well as engaging in mini-games and bonus stages. The only gripe I've for this game is that it's perhaps a little too easy for seasoned gamers, and this could be a major hindrance for those who'd prefer a tougher challenge. Still, the gameplay, graphics and audios are more than adequate reasons for you to make a date with Princess Peach.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2006"}

Spotting beside them the only person he despises, his nephew-in-law Billy Candle, he decides to pursue his nephew across the Far West and attempts to gun him down so to avenge his brother's murder. The game revolves between two characters the player can control: Reverend Ray and Billy Candle. In its gameplay, Ray's levels are more action-oriented while Billy's levels are more stealth-like. Personally, I preferred Ray's levels for they were less complicated and frustrating to play unlike Billy's who's very weak in its endurance and whose stealth levels were a bit too long to play, especially when he has to get to the ranch where his girlfriend lives. Not only that, I felt, technically, that some of the animations were very stiff and not very credible. For instance, when the characters run, and you look down at their movements, they are more \"walking\" than \"running\". I also gasped when I saw Billy's movements as you make him climb and swing in the air with his lasso. It was unbelievable that the animators left him stand as stiff as a board and not make him at least more flexible in his movements as he climbs. Apart from those details, I loved this game's story and its visual designs. The first thing to applaud in this game is its wonderful visuals of the landscape and the houses, which are extremely realistic. It's almost as if you were riding in real Texas, Arizona, and Mexico. And I would also like to say how much I adored the soundtrack. Another addition that made the game more like a real western in its atmosphere.Again, although having weakness in some of its animations, and in its difficult and frustrating gameplay for Billy, I really loved playing this game. But then again, I felt I had to pinpoint out those few mistakes, as the reviewers need to know about them before playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"Theresa Winfrey","summary":"One small step for Nintendo, one giant step backward for Zelda games","reviewText":"Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a Nintendo and Zelda fan. I have played all the Zelda games except for the CD-i games, and have beaten \"Ocarina of Time\", \"Wind Waker\" and \"Twilight Princess\". When 3DS was released in North America, I did not get it on day one, but I did get it on day three, and when \"Ocarina of Time 3D\" was released, I beat it three times, one for each save file you get. I had to delete a save file to play it a fourth time.You are probably thinking that a main-series, console Zelda release can never be less than gaming perfection. However, I would beg to differ, pointing you to \"Zelda II: The Adventure of Link\". \"Skyward Sword\" is the second coming of \"Zelda II\" in that respect, and it has done the unthinkable and finally supplanted it as the most disappointing Zelda game of all time. If you have not played this game, you have no idea how terrible it is, so before you judge this review and vote it down, I implore you to read this review and other \"negative\" (I prefer the term \"honest\") reviews before making your own decision about purchasing this game. Nintendo has really dropped the ball with this game. The release of the MotionPlus accessory never really generated the second life for the Wii that they intended, so they forced it into a traditional core gaming franchise and the result is \"Skyward Sword\".The controls are very bad. Almost every action involving the Wii remote is filled with frustration and stress - from flying to just simply trying to cut grass. Very early on, you get a taste of flying. However, the controls are overly sensitive, yet unresponsive at the same time - the worst of both worlds. For example, you will tilt the controller to the left to turn left, but there will be slight lag until your bird actually turns. To make up for this lag, you will be tilting the controller even more than necessary. By the time you do this, your bird finally has turned, but the extra turning you have done to compensate for the lag has made the bird turn even more than necessary. It's not just the lag that accounts for the bad controls, either. It is just too sensitive. A slight tilt of the controller will cause it to turn a lot, and there is no way to adjust the sensitivity. This is not how we were taught how to fly in real life, or in video games. Flying by tilting a horizontally-aligned controller is simply unintuitive.The sword-controls are terrible as well. Cutting grass - something that has been a staple of the franchise since \"Link to the Past\", is now needlessly difficult. In Twilight Princess, one could simply shake the controller, and Link, your on-screen avatar, would effectively cut grass. In this game, simply shaking the controller is not enough; oh no. You must be precise and shake it horizontally, because grass grows vertically, and thus to cut it, you must chop it horizontally. Now this would not be that big of a deal if when every time or at least 90% of the time you performed a horizontal slice with your controller, Link did the same. However, this is not the case. Also, every little, seemingly innocuous enemy in the game now has become a mini-boss encounter, where precise timing and sword strokes are needed for victory. This is an extrinsic vicissitude for the Zelda series. It slows the gameplay down, and breaks up the pacing.Here are some more examples of the horrible controls:This is not so egregious in execution, but is in theory: walking across a tightrope. When Link walks across a tightrope, he will alternately teeter to the left and right - not because you are failing to hold the controller steady, but because Nintendo programmed him to do so. At first, I was wondering why I was teetering to the left and right when I was holding the controller steady. Then I realized that instead of programming tightrope sequences so that Link's movement intuitively mirrored the player, as in all the other actions, like flying and sword-swinging, they repudiated that philosophy for this one type of event, making the player react to Link's movements, rather than the other way around. This makes no sense in the commonsense, logical desire of having one theoretical, uniform game design philosophy.In another example of paradoxical, inconsistent game design philosophy, the \"Sheikah Stone\" makes a reappearance. It made its first appearance in \"Ocarina of Time 3D\", and it gives players hints when consulted. One of the caveats of this tool is that it is only accessible on Skyloft, the main hub area. The inclusion of the \"Sheikah Stone\" baffles me to a certain extent. I can see how this will help the more casual gamers, but when the controls are unresponsive, rendering the game difficult beyond the reach of casual gamers, I do not see the point of its inclusion. My point is that a \"Sheikah Stone\" should have been the last thing on Nintendo's list of considerations. Their priority should have been to fix the controls, and then a \"Sheikah Stone\" would have been unnecessary.Killing skulltulas is another thing that has been greatly overcomplexified. In \"Ocarina of Time\", killing skulltulas had a short learning curve, but it was understandable and intuitive: if you got too close, it faced you constantly, rendering it invulnerable to your sword. If you got too far from it, it retreated beyond your reach. At just the right distance, it would first drop down and then turn around, exposing its vulnerable underbelly for a brief moment, giving you an opportunity to strike. In \"Skyward Sword\", however even after much trial and error, I could not figure out how to defeat one. I soon ventured forth into the internet in search of a method, and was satisfied when I realized that I was not alone in my troubles. Of course, I also found snarky simpletons who, instead of helping people like me, proceeded to insult them for lack of \"skill\" and took their skulltula-killing troubles as an offensive gesture to their beloved God and king: the almighty Nintendo.One of the most egregious vicissitudes in \"Skyward Sword\" is save-points. Their philosophy was probably twofold: 1) it is not just a save point - you can do some other stuff, like taking to the skies, and it serving as a waypoint as well, and 2) maybe they found that people did not know how to save in Zelda games so they included save-points. The first reason is understandable - adding functionality. The second reason, however, is egregious. In other Zelda games, you can save nearly anywhere. You may not start at that exact location when you turn the system off and return, but your progress will be saved. In \"Skyward Sword\", you must first find a save point, and then when you want to stop playing and save, you must either keep playing and hope to find a save-point, or return to a save point you have already found and then save, wasting time that did not need to be wasted. This is an example of removing functionality: a bad thing.Navi-itis returns. You remember how annoying Navi was in \"Ocarina of Time\"? Well, the spiritual successor is here. I won't spoil anything but I will warn you that if your shield is about to break (yes, shields can break in this game - how asinine is that?), or even if you are low on hearts, this Navi-wannabe will annoy you. I think that the traditional pinging sound that was there from \"Zelda 1\" tells me all I need to know about how low on hearts I am!Nintendo seems to be feeling the pressure of being more like \"Monster Hunter\". They have unnecessarily added millions of little knick-knacky materials to collect through the course of your playthrough. These materials can be used to upgrade your items. This is not too bad, since it's optional, but when you come across a material, for example: a feather or a skull, the game must go into an animation of Link holding it up, then it tells you what it is, and then it goes into the menu, showing you how many of it you have. Then, you must exit the menu, if you want to keep playing. Every time you turn off your Wii or quit a play-sesion and then come back to play, if you find something for the first time for that playthrough, it does this again. It's unnecessary and annoying. The same thing happens for the higher-echelon rupees. At least it doesn't do it for blue rupees (worth 5) anymore like in \"Twilight Princess\".Another thing Nintendo has unnecessarily adopted into its game is a partial form of \"floating combat text\". In many other traditional RPGs, when you hit something or it hits you, numbers pop up indicating damage done or dealt. In this game, when you get hit, the same thing happens, but with hearts (e.g. if you lose two hearts, in addition to losing two hearts on your life meter, a \"- [heart icon][heart icon]\" will appear next to it). This is unnecessary and insults the player's intelligence. If I had five hearts and something hit me, and I now have three hearts, I can do the math and figure out that I lost two. I don't need the game to show me.Nintendo knew this game was hard. At first I was taken aback at how Link started off with six hearts. Usually he starts off with three, no? Then I played the first dungeon. \"Oh... That's why.\"Not all is bad in \"Skyward Sword\", however. Theoretically, I like the idea of taking a Zelda game into the sky, like how \"Wind Waker\" was an entire Zelda game built around the theme of wind and the ocean. Also, the new stamina-meter, which I disliked at first, grew on me, and I learned to appreciate it. For example, Link can now move faster than his run (let's call the faster run a \"sprint\") without having to roll around all over the place, and he can run into a wall at this speed without bumping into it and subsequently falling down, for the \"roll\" has been remapped to the nunchuk's accelerometer. To roll, all one has to do is sprint and then shake the nunchuk.A new Zelda game wouldn't be complete without some new puzzle-types. I liked moving the key around with the controller to fit into a lock, although it featured reverse controls (up is down, left is right, etc.). In this respect, it does a good job of creating some new puzzles. Incremental challenge is a good thing, as long as the controls don't get in the way of it. As you now know, however, it does get in the way of it. After getting through the first two dungeons, I realized that the most difficult small-fry enemy was one of the first ones you meet: the piranha-plant thingies. This is an example of incorrectly increasing the difficulty of a game.Also of positive note: the \"Deku Leaf\" makes a return, although it is called the \"Sailcloth\" now. Functionally, it works the same as the \"Deku Leaf\". Unfortunately, this welcome return is simultaneously met with an unwelcome alteration in the controls. This item is controlled with the \"Wii Remote Plus\", and, you guessed it, the controls are terrible. Near the beginning of the game, you must use this item to land on a small circle on the ground. I tried at least 20 times before I was able to land on it. Eventually, I realized that the less you moved the controller, the better off you were. You were not controlling the game; you were simply giving the game the input it desired to perform the output you wanted. This is a big change from how most video games are designed. Most video games empower the player and give them the illusion that they're imposing their will upon the game. \"Skyward Sword\", on the other hand, forces you to play by its rules and molds the player into its own, unwilling pawn. Maybe that's why some people like this game. They are unknowingly pawns and tools in the universe, and thus enjoy or are used to being in this position in the world.I found that the most effective way of fighting the Bokoblins (red bad-guys) was not to swing the controller at their weak points but to wait for them to drop their guard, and in that second before they attack, you the player should strike quickly. Waiting for an opening? I understand using that philosophy for designing boss battles, but small-fry enemies should not have been designed like this.The graphics are a mixed bag. Sometimes, especially during cutscenes, I was impressed at what the Wii was capable of. I found myself thinking, \"Is that FMV?\" However, at other times, these times being most of the time, I found myself thinking, \"This looks worse than 'Twilight Princess'.\" A lot of the animations and models seem to be ripped straight from that game, tweaked a negligible amount, and then daubed with a low-detail, saturated, faded-rainbow paintbrush. Everything looks washed-out and all the colors seem to bleed together, like a watercolor painting done by an elementary school student. It is hard to tell what is what from a distance. I know what Nintendo was thinking when they went in this artistic direction. They knew they could not compete graphically in the realism department with \"Xbox 360\" nor \"Playstation 3\", so they went in the opposite direction of accentuating their \"superior\" artistic vision, so that the Wii's graphical shortcomings would be ignored with a lush, unique, graphical style. However, it fails to deliver on its intentions. I am not opposed to non-realistic graphics. Oh no. \"Wind Waker\" is one of the most beautiful games ever created, and looks miles better than this game. \"Wind Waker\" was designed to be a \"cartoon that you play\" - this coming straight from Miyamoto's own mouth, and I wholeheartedly agree. \"Skyward Sword\", on the other hand, feels like a rainbow threw up on a Miyazaki film. It just doesn't work. Also, why does Link have to look so much like Michael Jackson? Could he not have looked a little more human, and less extra-terrestrial? Nintendo got his face wrong in \"Twilight Princess\", right in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", then even fixed \"Twilight Princess\" Link's face for the \"Wii U\" Zelda tech demo at E3 this year, but lost it again for Skyward Sword.The music is surprisingly bad as well. The soundtrack sounds less like a Zelda game, and more like a generic JRPG soundtrack. After looking up the credits online, I found that a whole stable of composers not named Koji Kondo was involved in it. \"Ah...\" My suspicions were correct.Nintendo needs to bring Miyamoto back to the director's chair. He understands that gameplay is paramount. When you first start up Skyward Sword, you are bogged down with cutscenes and meaningless fluff in the form of small-talk conversations with NPCs. You may have thought \"Twilight Princess\" got off to a slow start, but holy snap, \"Skyward Sword\" takes it to the next level. If the story and characters were half-interesting, maybe I would care, but unfortunately it is not. People play Zelda games for the gameplay, not the story and cinematic work.It is not the idea of motion-controls in a Zelda game that is the problem here. It is in the execution, which is very bad. If there is copious ambiguity whether my failure to succeed is because it is not what I am supposed to do (as in the proper method of solving a problem) or it is because the controls are not responding to what I want to do, it is a major problem. As the great James Rolfe (the \"Angry Video Game Nerd\") once said, the number one important thing about a game is \"being able to ****ing play it\". I would love to swing my controller and be able to hit the enemies in their weak-spots, quickly and deftly; however, this is not possible because of the horrible control-response. I would love to be able to quickly transition from a neutral state to a rolling state when dealing with bombs, and then dexterously aim it to my own choosing. Again, this is not possible because of the horrible controls. \"Twilight Princess\" was evidence of how motion-controls could enhance a game to make a game greater than the sum of its parts. \"Twilight Princess\" on the Wii was easily superior to the Gamecube version. \"Skyward Sword\", on the other hand, obtrudes the game with its motion-controls, effectively making a gamer lesser than the sum of its parts. I wish there was a Gamecube version of this game.Let me now discuss my rationale for giving it 1 star: If you mouse over the respective stars, from the fifth star to the first star (furthest to the right, to the star furthest to the left), the mouse-over descriptions are as follows: \"I love it\", \"I like it\", \"It's OK\", \"I don't like it\", and \"I hate it\".\"I love it\" would be something I would say about \"Ocarina of Time\", and I have thought it to myself, and have even said it out loud to my friend back in 1999 or 2000. These games leave you in awe, feeling like a kid again. Those memories of getting a brand-new game for Thanksgiving-break or Christmas and playing it after you rip through the plastic wrap come flooding back to you. \"Super Mario 64\" and \"Twilight Princess\" are more examples.\"I like it\" would be something I would say about \"Wind Waker\". The art direction was revolutionary, but the gameplay seemed to be an incremental evolution from \"Ocarina of Time\". In other words, it was good, but it did not blow my mind. That is fine; not every game can blow your mind.\"It's OK\" is something I would say about \"Metroid Prime\". I was never a big fan of the Metroid series, but I did give Metroid Prime a shot and eventually beat it, but sometimes people have different tastes. These tastes are not meant to offend anybody.\"I don't like it\" would be something I would say about \"The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\". It did not do much for me, coming from an MMORPG like \"World of Warcraft\" and trying to capture that magic in single-player form; I have since yet to find a single-player RPG that has really kept me engaged for as long as an MMORPG. I rue the day I ever bought that game (WoW); it spoiled me. Still, I would not say that I hate Oblivion, because there is nothing fundamentally flawed about it; it's just ugly, boring, and not for me.\"I hate it\" is not something I say often about video games. I do my research and I have a sixth sense when it comes to buying games and it does not involve internet game-reviews. But when a game is this fundamentally flawed, as in the controls don't work (forget about the design, which is secondary), we have a problem. The only thing I can compare \"Skyward Sword\" to off the top of my head is a really difficult NES game that is cheap (by cheap, I mean the AI is cheap) beyond imagination and is likely to have been reviewed by James Rolfe. Indeed, whilst playing \"Skyward Sword\", I found myself thinking and saying out loud many of his epithets like \"What were they thinking?\" and \"This game is horrible!\" I know there is a \"first impressions\" video on cinemassacre.com regarding this game, but it was made not by Rolfe, but by his friend Mike Matei. I would like to hear Rolfe's own opinions about this game.This has been the most disappointing holiday game lineup in recent history - from the overhyped \"Battlefield 3\", the most iterative game of all time: \"Modern Warfare 3\", the still-ugly-with-terrible-melee-combat Skyrim...

The info you get from hacking gives life to the world but it's not enough to flush out the game.One thing that might make or break this game for you are the stealth missions.  I don't mind a stealth mission if it can be either a stealth or a shoot out.  I'm not a fan of stealth missions where you fail if you are discovered.  There is always too much trial and error with little to no satisfaction at the end.  This game has a number of stealth missions.The main character is cookie cutter.  Most of the supporting characters are more interesting and better acted than your character.  That wouldn't be a big issue if the story was edgy or fun.  Sadly it's neither of those things.Overall, Watch Dogs is a great looking game that might be worth it if you REALLY like open world games.  Keep in mind, this is a good, not great, open world game.  If you are burned out on open world games, this game will not revive your desire to play one.  It gets old fast and the \"new\" things are not enough to make up for it's shortcomings.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2014"}

The sticks themselves can start randomly sending &#34;down&#34; signals to the point where they're unusable.Sony will require you pay for shipping on a replacement controller which I think is poor service. They also take 7-10 days to send you a replacement from the date they receive yours, also poor service.The design itself is superb as many others have stated. The triggers are fixed from DS3, the shape and feel is greatly improved, the sound adds a new cool effect for some games, and the button spacing is now even.

{"product_name":"B002BRZ6UE","description":"","reviewerName":"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF \"Wolf\"","summary":"GILTCHY GAMEPLAY, STUPID UNINSPIRED STORY, CONFUSING","reviewText":"I played Crysis 1 and it was quite good almost everything this game is not.  First the Crysis 2 story is painfully boring.  You spend most of the time running around cleaning up messes made by arrogant halfwits like Dr. Gould.  The good guys among the military are all dim wits and all the bad guys are criminal masterminds at plotting strikes against you.  The guns are all jokes as they are not powerful at all against enemies.  The Nanosuit is so weak and lame it is pathetic.  The controls for suit powers seldom work as they are supposed to.  The game freezes while you are taught things about the suit or given \"options\" that do not really change anything.  The game is more difficult that Crysis 1 not because it is better.  Crysis 2 is more difficult because it is so glitch ridden that you win battles only on the rare occasion when your powers and guns work as expected.  I think the graphics are good but Mass Effect 2 and even Infamous 2 had graphics on par with Crysis 2 without the glitch a minute features of Crysis 2.  In Crysis 2 the scenery changed often but the missions were all to often painfully similar.  The enemy almost always had the jump on you and seldom the other way around.  The cloak ran out just in time to not be useful.  The AI was stupid given that enemies who had no line of sight to your hiding place would suddenly appear to open fire on your the minute you engaged a target.  The stealth kill commands seldom worked as they should.  The rocket propelled grenade launcher did not cycle to the next warhead after the active one was used.  You had to shoot one enemy a dozen times before they went down.  The enemy could often kill you in a few shots or blows.  The autosaves were very far apart so if you did die in game you were thrown back to a point where it would take 25 minutes or more to get back to where you were before you died.The most annoying thing the Crysis 2 game does is as you move to new chapters you rarely get to keep the awesome guns you collect.  If you are like me when playing one of these games you develop a relationship with certain weapons.  Yes I can use any weapon in a well designed game that is not glitch which of course can't be said about Crysis 2.  However even in Crysis 2 there were some weapons that worked well every time.  The Mike X43 Cannon was particularly effective at toasting aliens ala-the popcorn achievement \\ trophy. The rocket ganade was great when it worked. The ranged and sniper Scarab were also nice.  All the pistols were weak and upon entering a new chapter you were always given a cheap pistol and had to hunt down great weapons all over again just to lose them all again next chapter.  Developers of Crysis 2 have excitement the definition of confused with tedium.  Finding the same weapons over and over again is just plain tedious and so not fun at all!The keys, dog tags and emails collectibles blended into the most of their backgrounds so completely they were almost cloaked.  The action buttons seldom appeared immediately when you had to interact with objects in the environment.  You had to wiggle the controller just right to get some interaction buttons to appear which often can get you killed trying because using a game object meant positioning yourself just right in relation to the buttons valid appear area. There were plenty of glitches where you could see enemies shooting at you while caught halfway between walls.  Of course there were glitches that caused me to restart whole chapters. EA does a terrible job of quality control, they need some autistic game testers in quality control we find all the flaws.  Crysis 2 was not a completely bad game but, Crysis 2 was nothing at all special.  If Crysis 2 was put out by a second tier studio on a budget it would have been a nice game.  However Crysis 2 was supposed to be a great game and it was painfully average to mediocre at best.  I did beat Crysis 2 so I am happy.  I got a few trophies not many because; so many trophies reward Multi-Player and being autistic I do not do multi-player.  If MultiPlayer mode in Crysis 2 is badly glitched-up as single player it is not worth it.Crysis 2 had lots of promise but very little of it was realized which is a shame because; Crysis 1 was an awesome start of what could have been a killer series.  I liked Crysis 2 but I wished I could have liked it a lot more.  the crippled Nanosuit, the weak guns, the repetitive story, and fetch this oops I forgot that, meet me here there and everywhere missions coupled with all powerful enemies just made for a boring game.  The FPS as a game of fetch this get that meet me here has been so over done it is time for something fresh because Crysis 2 was stale at the moment of conception and it appears the time leading to its birth did not improve the end product.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00309XHD0","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"\"How I Wonder What You Are...\"","reviewText":"Necromorph-blasting fans rejoice!Dead Space 2, the continuation of Dead Space, is upon us and has certainly upped the ante of the survival-horror genre.If you haven't purchased the original Dead Space, stop reading and play the first game.  You'll appreciate this game a LOT better and this review may spoil the first game a tad for you.  I'm writing this review from the point of view of someone who HAS played the first game.Story (potential, yet minor spoilers - skip ahead if you wish to the next section)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------First off, Isaac has extremely vague recollections at the beginning of the game of a \"therapy\" session with a psychiatrist who certainly sounds more like he's interrogating Isaac about the Marker from the first game.Shortly thereafter, Isaac Clarke is revived in the midst of an unknown location with Necromorphs roaming about causing chaos.  The game starts off with a bang and doesn't let up soon!  Not only does Isaac Clarke have to contend with Necromorphs, he stumbles across security/military personnel who also do their utmost to specifically eliminate him as well under the orders of a man named Tiedemann (sp?).Isaac Clarke is then contacted by a mysterious woman who informs him that he is located on a city-like outpost on Titan and claims that she will help him with his situation as well as his increasing dementia which results in hallucinations, including his long dead girlfriend, Nicole.That pretty much sums up the premise of Chapter 1 (there are a total of 15) and I won't spoil it beyond that.  Suffice it to say, however, that Isaac has a speaking role this time and you get to see a lot more of him then the first game.  It's quite a different take from our mute protagonist in the first game, but it's a quite welcome change and the story is immediately engaging and ratchets up further from there.Gameplay--------Superb!  Dead Space controls have returned.  However, there are several improvements:- The circle button actually acts as a shortcut for healing.  No more struggling to heal yourself in the middle of a battle by frantically searching your RIG.- There is a new hacking routine built in to the game, which requires Isaac to hack into consoles/systems in order to gain access to areas/items.  It's a rudimentary system of navigating your analog stick and hitting the \"x\" button at the appropriate times, but the animation showing Isaac trying various things to hotwire a console as you're doing it is quite cool and gives you something quite new to do.- New weapons!  In addition to the Javelin gun which can impale and, in turn, electrify your enemies with its secondary fire mode, there is also the Rivet gun which you could get if you pre-ordered with GameStop OR if you download one of the several available equipment packs that are available online for $[...]/per pack.Graphics/Sound--------------Dead Space was originally so effective because it utilized a color palette and lighting along with a sound ambience that constantly had you jumping at shadows, the clattering of a pipe, the skittering of \"something\" moving through the vents, etc.  Every corner and vent fan was a potential threat and the occasional outburst of sound, including the detonation of metal-clad windows in a long hallway, was enough to scare you out of your wits.  The original game took place on the USG Ishimura and even the environment of a wide open bridge was as frightening as a dimly lit hallway.Dead Space 2 wisely ratchets up the scares.  This game takes place on the \"Sprawl\", a city-like environment located on the Titan moon.  There, the seemingly mundane environments of a hospital (ok, granted, it was used in the 1st game, but this hospital is for civilians - seems a lot different with \"Get Well\" balloons!), a laundromat, an ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, etc. become horrifying places to traverse.  Early on in the game as citizens are told to evacuate, you sense the chaos going on around you and it seems more action packed at first, but then the scares become ever so much worse as you become more and more isolated.Dead Space's graphics and sounds were good.  The graphics and sound are even better in Dead Space 2.  Isaac moves a lot more smoothly and seemingly with more purpose and action.  Details are incredible and Visceral Games has really done an awesome job of creating a realistic environment where civilians would live, including the aforementioned \"Get Well\" balloons in the hospital reception area.  Not to go into many details, but the Elementary School is by far my favorite and yet devastating to see considering that I, myself, am a father and could not even imagine children being subjected to that hell.  Visceral does not hold the punches, however, since hell this is!  One minor detraction is that shadows, when viewed close up, are still quite rough, but that's typically the sacrifice you see to have everything else look as good as it does (especially the fire effects...in a word, WOW!).I will tell you this much.  If you have an extremely decent sound/HDTV setup, Dead Space 2 will make full use of what you have available.  Bass is quite deep and will punch hard to frighten you quite well.  Surround is fully engaging and will have you jumping around to the source of a sound.Graves' soundtrack is also quite good and complements the scares quite well.  It wouldn't be the same without a fully orchestrated soundtrack, but it's so easy to forget this because it's woven so well into the game.Multiplayer-----------Ok, this is a \"meh\" moment for me.  Don't get me wrong; it's fun playing a Necromorph or a security guard and running around utilizing your own unique sets of abilities.  That said, however, it's not Dead Space for me.While it's fun, it does not evoke the same kind of fear as the main game because it boils down to a bunch of people on each team.  If you're looking for the same kind of visceral fear in the single player campaign, don't look here.  If you want to see what it's like to try to dismember someone as a Necromorph, however, welcome to the party!Dead Space Extraction---------------------I was on the fence for a long time about whether or not I should get the Wii Dead Space Extraction game.  Now, I no longer have to worry.  Both the standard limited edition and Collector's edition game packages include it for free.  Oh, and it supports the Move controller, so it should be quite similar to the Wii experience!Collector's Goodies (THIS INFORMATION PERTAINS TO THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION ONLY AND IS INCLUDED HERE TO HELP YOU DECIDE WHETHER TO GET THE STANDARD VERSUS COLLECTOR'S EDITION)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you're on the fence about getting the Collector's Edition, here are the details:1.  PLASMA CUTTER.  Ok, there are pros and cons.  Pros:  it's pretty cool and the LEDs are EXTREMELY bright.  It's small and made of plastic, but I didn't expect much being packaged in a container that accommodated the Dead Space game container.  It was extremely well packaged and survived a UPS trip quite well.  Cons:  ok, it has the \"Made in China\" quite obsequiously stamped on the bottom of the gun handle.  Couldn't we have just lived with the small plastic lettering somewhere?  The fact that EA didn't include 2 cheap AAA batteries didn't exactly help either.  The cover of the gun handle, however, is quite easily removed with a small Philips.  Overall, I think it's quite cool despite the cons.  I think that some people must have been expecting a full-sizedreplica, but the product photos showed the game case and cutter in the same shot; the scale was fairly advertised.  With the quality of the LEDs and the cool collector factor, it's easily worth $[...].2.  SOUNDTRACK.  The 18-track soundtrack is included here and was quite as enjoyable as the first Dead Space game's soundtrack.  This fully orchestrated soundtrack is quite cool and also has additional CD-ROM content.  I'd say it's easily worth $[...].3.  DOWNLOADS.  The Collector's Edition includes the Unitology Suit and a Force Gun via a redeemable code included in package.  For 2 items, I would say it's worth about $[...]-$[...].4.  LITHOGRAPH.  It's nothing stunning, but it is a postcard sized piece illustrating some Necromorph artwork.With everything included, an additional $[...] for this edition of the game is a pretty fair price and includes a pretty cool box shell as well.  Considering how many $[...] - $[...] overpriced collector's offerings there are out there, I was surprised that EA only asked $[...] for this one.  Overall, I give it a 4.5/5 for the Collector's swag.Dead Space 2, by Visceral Games, has been one of my most anticipated titles to date.  The trailers have certainly hyped it quite a bit and, to be perfectly honest, the game has EXCEEDED my expectations - a first for me.This is a must-have if you own the first game.  You will not be disappoined.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2011"}

I usually get the hit games kind of late because I won't pay full price for them, but Starcraft is worth every penny I've spent. This game is the most addictive game I've ever played. There are so many things that make this game great and there are really no serious knocks that can be thrown at it.The story line to Starcraft is pretty simple. You can pick from three different races Terran, Zerg, and Protoss. In the stroyline they all have different goals they want to achieve. The terrans are the humans in the game. They have there pros and cons. They have medium range units that are pretty cheap to build and are all around pretty effective. The Zerg are the buglike species. They have cheap and quick units. The protoss are the alien species of the group. They have expensive but very powerful units.Single player mode is pretty fun. The missions aren't really all that bad. The story is decent and I enjoyed playing it all the way through. The gem to this game is the multiplayer options.If you get this game you definetly want to get on the internet and play on Battlenet. Thats what makes the game so addictive. It's a great game, but it gets even better when you can sign on and play against millions of other players. You can also get a hold of crazy maps on battlenet which add new and fun life to the game. We have a 20 port hub at home and this is are favorite multiplayer game to play. Like the guy in the review before me said, you really need to watch the clock when you get on battlenet because you will lose track of time. I will get so into this game, I'll stop for food and the bathroom. The rest of the time you are so engrossed in this awesome game.This is one of the best games I've ever played.

It improved upon its predecessor in every way imaginable. Here's a game that will satisfy you as a single-player experience, and will also become your go-to title for co-op play with friends.Visually, the game is clean and uncompromising. Textures have detail, and the mixture of colors gives this game a wonderful flair. The audio helps bring the entire presentation together with its well-fitted tracks. Heck, you can even make your own music in the online creator, so there's really no limit to this game.The gameplay is improved from the original LittleBigPlanet, and might feel a little slow to some, but I'd prefer to call it \"realistic\" versus other platformers such as Mario. The physics engine is powerful, and allows for hundreds of different scenarios when mixed together with the slew of textures, interactions, and more.If you're looking for a fun game that has tons content, this is it. The story mode is only about six hours in length, but includes a ton of unlockables. The multiplayer is another story. With so many options, the online experience is constantly evolving, and other players can provide you new experiences every time you log in. On top of that, you can choose to make a level yourself, and if you choose to do that, a robust level creator is waiting in-store for you.All in all, LittleBigPlanet 2 is a phenomenal game that entertains in the best of ways.

Which the sprint duration makes sense to make it more real instead of running all around without having to walk.The shots of gun fire and hearing it from a distance when not seeing who's shooting, it makes the actual sound you would hear of a gun firing from a ways a way with the crack-crack-crackle sound.Cons:Throwing a grenade..seems like 5 year old throwing a pebble. It seems like the grenade weighs 10 pounds or something when they throw, you can't throw so far.Overall, this game is great. Yes I am a player of Call of Duty but I'm not going to compare. I know that Battlefield 3 has better graphics and more of a realistic fit to it than CoD games do.Call of Duty is a fast pace game more so, it's not a walk around and shoot, its more who can gun down and earn kill streaks to have an advantage.In battlefield, no kill streaks is what makes it great, you go head to head with other people with tanks, planes, choppers, ride on ATv4's etc. you have a blast being able to ride things around and compete.

It was a blast. If you have a good HD set, you're friends will drool at the sight of this game in motion in glorious 1080p. If you own a 120hz set, grab a bucket.Now, the game has 1 big flaw. The controls are clunky and if you're used to play COD4, you will feel like you're playing underwater playing this game. You kind of get used to it during campaign. I tried the multiplayer and it was OK.  But the control issue makes you slow at reacting and you just can't move or dispatch enemies as fast as Modern Warfare has accustomed us to. Call of Duty 4 Still King of multiplayer.Because of these issues and with the graphics alone as an upside, I just don't see myself popping this game inside my PS3 for a multiplayer session instead of playing COD4, let alone paying 50-60 bucks to keep it after beating my rental copy.If you're a PS3 owner you owe it to yourself to play this game and see what your black shiny beast is capable of doing when the programmers know what they're doing and are competent enough to harness a big chuck of the untapped PS3 power.Now, graphics wise, this game has spoiled me by setting the bar so high that I won't settle for anything inferior from now on.From here on out,  every time a new PS3 game is released and does not look like this or better, I will deem the programmers incompetent and undeserving of their salaries.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2009"}

NOTHING BAD TO SAY. It's top notch.Weapons - you can only carry 2. But for some reason, you can carry mass amounts of ammo for any other weapons even though you don't have that weapon with you. On a positive, you can snipe a guy in the head with a silenced pistol from an unrealistic distance. I use pistols on a somewhat regular basis. I know.Shoot anything red to blow up everything around it. This includes non-red vehicles, large yellow canisters etc. If you think it will blow up if you shoot it enough, it probably will.I guess I'll call this a good thing.Cut scenes - Boring and badly acted. You can't stop the cutscene to jump ahead to the action. Even if you finished Easy mode and are now on normal or hard, you have to sit through the exact same scenes all over again.Movement - The ability to climb over things or jump...GONE, None, Nada, Ziltch.

{"product_name":"B002I0K1Y0","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Vita's Bestest","reviewText":"I don't know if Soul Sacrifice is going to turn Vita - the most advanced portable gaming platform in the known Universe - into the leading portable gaming machine but it is going to make my Vita experience a lot more enjoyable and it's the kind of game I wish there were a lot more. Here are my notes after playing full Sacrifice for a couple of days (played the demo prior to that).This long-awaited, at least by me, RPG has you playing as a guy about to be sacrificed by a crazy wizard. But... wait, it doesn't end there. A magic book shows up and trains you to fight him by reliving the events of the wizard who wrote the book. You have the option to fight the final boss whenever you feel ready but he is really tough so the story mode of the wizard who wrote the book and a lot of quest grinding is needed.The quest system  is similar to that of the \"Monster Hunter\" series, as in you have a menu of missions with objectives like 'kill a number of monsters', or 'kill this boss in this amount of time', and then you get dumped in a special area to complete the objective. By grinding quests you get some in-game currency and, more importantly, spell tokens (sacrifices) you earned based on your performance  You also have access to AI allies or find help from online players for any non-story mission (nice, nice, nice).You only fight with spells, but there is a lot of variety with projectiles, weapon supports for you and allies, transformations, summoning  and probably more - I haven't finished the game yet. There's a lot of verity with different elements, effects, and animations.The way the spell system works is a spell token has a certain amount of uses per mission and you swap them in and out of your six chamber spell belt. You only lose that spell token if you try to exceed the spell limit but it can be refreshed with the in-game currency.There are also spells that feed on your life bar instead of requiring uses. This along with the large variety of spells makes a lot strategies possibles such as using the life draining spell with healing, or only carry fire if fire is the weakness of the monster you are fighting.  Collecting too many tokens however can get confusing and frustrating om  the selecting screen. You also have some \"black rite\" spells, but they are one time use per mission and usually have a heavy price that carries to other missions like halving your defense until it is recharged.In battle, when a monster is killed, you have the option to sacrifice it, or save it. Sacrificing charges your spells uses and saving charges your life. Or... you leave them alone for too long and they come back. When an ally falls in battle you have the option to save them for half your life or sacrifice them for a super attack and then they watch as a ghost and offer slight help like boosting players and weakening monsters.The menu is completely integrated with the Vita touch screen and buttons  There are also some fun features that use the touch screen like squashing bugs in your cell or knocking the book over by taping it.The game graphics are... interesting.The environment and main characters look a little pixelated but the monsters themselves are shown in great detail and are sharper then your character which makes sense since you should be focusing on them.This game is fun if you don't mind some grinding. The battles are large and epic and the dark moody atmosphere is balanced with the clever and funny voice acting of the talking book. I love Soul Sacrifice unconditionally and it's probably one of the best games for the Vita so far but for anyone not sure, I suggest downloading the demo in the PS store since it is a good representation of the game, and your progress carries over should you get the game.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"M.

And while EA likes to boast the realism, frankly that only goes as far as the weapons, the launguages and the location.  The game is 100% linear and 99% predictable, and after finishing it, I feel more like I have finished reading a book, not playing a game.  Honestly, the mistakes are so glaring that EA really could have made a better game if they would have tried harder.  This is definatly one you will need to try for yourself, and reach your own conclusions on.The GOOD:- Missions remain interesting throughout the game.- Some wonderfully scripted encounters, and occasionally you will get to see wonderful character actions in your allies as well as your enemies.- Nice range of American and German weapons, and fairly accurate noises.  Tanks are fairly life-like as are aircraft.- Lots of speaking (English and German).  Scripts are correct for the locations, and you don't run into situations where dead soldiers are carrying on conversations and such, as you do in some other titles.- Accurate uniforms (within reason).- Sniper rifles are accurate, powerful and fun (and there are plenty of opportunities to use them, if that is your thing).The BAD:- The graphics are not as good as, for example, Return to Castle Wolfenstein on the Xbox (I'm using a Nvidia GeForce4 64mb DDR video card), or as nice as Delta Force Blackhawk down (which is a better game).- When shot, your character's aim flies across the screen.  This may enhance the realism, but when you are confronted with multiple enemies it makes it virtually impossible to hit anyone and soon becomes incredibly annoying.- Enemies have certain locations from which they spawn, in fact you can find them and stand there and gun them down as they suddenly materialize.  Also, some enemies (like snipers) have not materialized until you step past a certain point (into their line of fire) and then they spawn and fire.- Cannot interact with surroundings (doors, windows, etc.)- Lack of blood (to maintain the Teen rating).- Very linear.The UGLY:- MG42/44 is lethal in the hands of the enemy, but when you have the opportunity to man one the bullets fly everywhere but where you are aiming, in fact, the machine gun is only slightly more effective than any of your standard arms, and much more frustrating to try and use.- Allied AI is NIL, and considering some of these guys are supposed to be Rangers...they just run into the open and fire then stop, then fire and stop again while they are being gunned down.  I was happy to see them get slaughtered so at least I could move (oh yah, you are stuck behind any obstacle as if it were twice as wide as it really is).- Enemies continue to rush you with no regard to their own casualties, and will even run from around a corner straight into your fire, requiring no effort from you to gun down entire squads.- Shrubbery and leaves will block your bullets, but not the bullets of the enemies, making Snipers almost impossible to kill unless you rush their positions.- Snipers are way too good (even when I knew exactly where they were they could see me before I could see them).- The signifigant lack of an ending of any sort is unforgiveable.

I've owned this game for a good 6 years and it's just extraordinary and fun, but at the same time educational. In this game you must do alot of thinking and find out where the secrets are.

The controls are also simple and the whole storyline is just well thought out and I can definitely tell that they put alot of time into this game. In my opinion it's the best Zelda game so far.Now I will tell you the beginning of the Story so you can even feel more excited about getting this game.As a young baby boy, your mother was killed by an evil person. Now you have no home and have to move to a place called the Kokiri Forest. This is a place where people never grow up and aren't allowed to leave the forest. They're called the Kokiri. But you're different. You really don't belong in this forest, instead you belong out in a world called Hyrule. You're a Hylian (normal people who actually grow up). You're out there to defeat Ganondorf. Ganondorf, most likely the person who killed your mother, is a strong and evil person who wants to take over Hyrule and become the King. The only person that can stop him is you (Link). Now the question is, will you be able to defeat the mean and evil Ganondorf and save the world of Hyrule?If you think (or know) you can take that responsibility, then I suggest that you buy this game along with the N64 (if you don't have one) and experience something very special.

From the amazing graphics (for what it is; a N64 game), to the music, to the challenging gameplay, to the engulfing storyline, the \"Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\" is a must-play for any age. You start the game off as young Link (or whatever you want to call him), who lives in an enchanted forest where young never grow old. Inside the forest, there is a godly tree, who could be considered to be infinitly wise. The tree senses Link has the power to overthrow a great evil which is arising, and tests him to the dungeon inside of him. Link comes out, sucessful, and the tree tells him the story of the great evil which is arising. From then on, you play young Link, and must overcome many obstacles. As a child, there are 3 dungeons, and the tree's counts as one, so you're making some time, right? WRONG. There's much more to this game then beating dungeons. As a child, you can't acess as many of the things, but after you advance 7 years to the future and attain the Master Sword, many of these things are then open to you. As a child, you got an ocarina, in which you must learn songs on to access special places or do special things. Now, you can do all those things, and more. My personal favorite is Epona's song, in which you place a horse's (Epona) song, and it comes to you, in which you can ride across Hyrule Field to get to places twice as fast. As a child, you have weapons like a stick (whoopey), a sword, a shield, a sling-shot, and Duku Nuts. As an adult, you can handle 2 swords: the Master Sword, and the Giant Sword, which is so big you must handle it with 2 hands, which means no shield. You also have the hook-shot, Megaton Hammer, bow-and-arrows, and magic crystals you can do different things with. I cannot begin to explain how amazing this game is. I'd buy a Nintendo 64 all over again just for this. Now I have a Playstation 2, and I still have my Nintendo 64, but only play two games on it; this, of course, and Super Smash Brothers.

I like many others read most of the reviews and was set back from paying top dollar for the game.  Now something i wouldnt agree with is paying 60 for this game when it first came out, but being able to get it for 20 is a great buy.  This game has all the ships you would expect in the new updated xbox graphics.  The game is beautifully displayed with great visuals of explosions weaponfire and objects.  It adds a great ammount of detail and emersive gameplay to keep you entertained.  The ship variations are stunning from the first enterprise all the way up to the enterprise E.  Skirimish allows you to play with all the sub races from borg klingon and cardassian.  (nothing like using a borg tactical cube to wreck havoc)Pro-Loads of ships to play with new and old classics-Graphics are amazing-Story is entertaining and is pretty straight forward-Controls are very easy to work and runs smooth-Can controll 4 ships at once rather than the typical one-Adding things like in game repairs and capture of structures stays true-Ships show scars of damage (can loose warp boosters and have reduced speed)-Ability to target subsystems in ships-You can run away from battles and repair then come back again at fullCon-Missions are very long with no save points dont fail a mission or your screwed-Story is not believable at all and in no way goes with the series (still fun)-Units sometimes dont shoot when you tell them to and will sit there and watch you die-Ships that you buy in the beginning have 0 use at the end of the game so save your money-Enemies dont chase you at warp if you run away.

Groh","summary":"Really Challenging, Lots of Ways to Stay Playing","reviewText":"This is such a great game. I really like it because it is so unique to the gaming arena. The entire game is based on listening carefully to the rhythms of the music. I don't know anything about music so I can't tell you whether you need to do things on a full beat, half beat or off beat but I do know that it is difficult to get the timing perfect.Each level has a style of rhythm and a corresponding visual. It is your job to tap or \"flick\" on the screen after the appropriate cues based on the rhythm of the music. The better you do at matching the cues, the more you can advance.The visuals are good but sometimes it actually helps to just look away and respond based on the sound alone. That way you aren't looking at (and reacting too slowly) at the visual clues.The tunes are catchy and fun, some get into your head and don't get out.There is a large variety of levels and styles. Some can be mastered easily and others seem to really trip me up.There are times that if you can't advance after trying for awhile, the \"coffee barista\" at the \"coffee shop\" link will allow you to move forward anyway.Each level has three ways of improving: getting through with an OK (it allows for a few mistakes); getting a medal (a perfect run) and getting a perfect when prompted. If you get a perfect when prompted, it gives you bonuses in the \"coffee shop\" - music, little stories, etc.I have really enjoyed playing this and the only drawback is that you need to either wear headphones or do it where the music will not bother others. Since it is so repetitious, it will be annoying to others if you play it next to them for awhile.Lastly, my 5 year old has fun playing but it is very difficult for her. My avid video playing 10 year old is only slightly better. I think it is really hard for a child to get the timing as perfect as the game requires.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2009"}

I had planned to buy this the day it was released, but I was still wrapped up in Halo: Reach.  Thankfully, I heard about all the bugs a lot of people were experiencing, so I waited and abided my time with Black Ops.  After just finishing the game (along with the Dead Money DLC) last night and having spent 59 hours doing so, I can tell you that the second patch that was released must have been the one to finally fix this game.  I believe the second patch came out mid December (right before I bought the game).If you loved Fallout 3, there is even more to love in New Vegas.  I actually enjoyed New Vegas more than 3.  The iron sights were much appreciated.  The story was more fluid, more involving.  All in all, I am glad I waited, otherwise I might have given up on a great game before it was patched.  Hopefully they are working on another Fallout title, but do a little more testing/patching before releasing it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2010"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"Morgan Cahall \"so many books so little time\"","summary":"How can you set the past right, when your what's wrong?","reviewText":"Story:You are Captin Renko, part of a team scrambled to see what's going on with an abandoned Soviet Research station that appears to have a malfunctioning nuclear reactor that has suddenly become active.

{"product_name":"B004YVOCYG","description":"","reviewerName":"Bowman373","summary":"Not many changes have been made from the previous games, but it's still excellent nonetheless.","reviewText":"STORY:The game takes place many years after the events of Brotherhood, and Ezio is now in his early 50s. He is still as potent of an Assassin as ever, though, and the intro to the game is excellent. You soon find yourself in Constantinople, now occupied by the Ottomans. There's a power struggle between the contenders for the Sultanate, and you meet with a few cool historical figures on your journey. It wraps up the story of Ezio, and brings in many new characters into the game. At the same time, Desmond is still in the Animus immediately after the events of the previous game, trapped on an island within it. His mind is in pieces, and it's up to you to put them back together. The story, cutscenes, dialogue, and background are excellent as always, and you'll really start to grow on some of the new characters you meet. The ending is great, and it leaves you both satisfied with this one and looking forward to the next game.GAMEPLAY:To make a long story short, gameplay is essentially the same as within Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. Sure, a few new additions have been made, such as the new Hookblade (which allows you to free-run much faster), Master Assassin missions, and a Tower Defense mechanic, but nothing is really too groundbreaking. Some may see this as a negative, but since I absolutely loved Brotherhood, it's fine with me. You do a few side missions as Altair, the main Assassin of the first game in the series. The missions, while few and brief, are very cool, and chronicle Altair's life after the events of the first game. One big change in this game is how Notoriety works. It's called Templar Awareness now, and it increases whenever you're seen committing a crime. However, you aren't recognized by guards more easily if your Notoriety is higher. They react in the same way to your actions, regardless of your Notoriety level; they won't notice or bother you until you murder someone or something. Once your Notoriety reaches its peak level, the Templars become aware of the Assassins' presence in the city. They'll then attack one of your Assassin dens (which are the same as the Borgia towers from the last game), and you are required to defend your den from the Templars. As always, you can lower your Notoriety by bribing heralds or killing corrupt public officials. Bomb crafting has been added to the game as well, and it's a very detailed and complex system. Many materials can be collected and used to craft bombs that damage, distract, or blind enemies. It is a cool mechanic, but I never found myself in a situation where I absolutely NEEDED to use a bomb. In fact, that's how many of the things are in the game; it's easy to avoid them if you want to, but you'll be more rewarded if you take the time to invest in them. The visuals are stunning as usual in the game, and Constantinople is a nice change from the Italian cities that we've become so accustomed to. The city is noticeably smaller than the cities in the previous games, but it never feels too cramped. There's plenty of side missions to do, and many of these are surprisingly entertaining!OVERALL:This game is awesome! The gameplay is essentially the same as Brotherhood's, and the story is one of the stronger in the series. Although some additions have been made to the game, some of them seem pointless and out of place. For the price, it's a steal, and I recommend it to anyone who's a fan of the Assassin's Creed games. However, if you haven't played any yet, then I strongly recommend starting right from the beginning. It's fine to start on 2 as well, though. Hope this helped!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2013"}

That old keyboard started acting like it had a short. I use my keyboard in bed with my laptop, so I wanted one that was lighted so I can use it at night more easily. This one weighs less than the old one and has the number pad built in which is nice if I am banking. The USB audio is nice, seems to be better than what is included in my 4 year old Toshiba laptop. One complaint is that the default blue colored lighted keys are too subtle to see, at least for me. They seem like only a small step up from using the light coming off your computer screen to see the keys. Luckily you can change them to red which helps. In comparison, they aren't as easily readable as the Microsoft keyboard which were larger and brighter (but could be dimmed). I like the roll bar for the audio better than the old Microsoft board which had a knob that would get hit when the keyboard was sat down and change the volume. This keyboard seems to have a ton of gaming customizations, although that is not my purpose in getting it. The old Microsoft had some of the paint wear off the keys. Its early to see if this Logitech will suffer the same fate. Only other real gripe is the wrist bar which is cheap plastic, can pinch, and easily falls off. I discarded it. Oh, and the price is a little high, but then again, it includes a USB sound card so maybe its not too high. Works with my Vista and Windows 7 computers. There is no software to adjust the audio card properties, but its mostly geared toward a gaming headset, although I am using a pair of high end headphones with the headphone output and it sounds great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2013"}

{"product_name":"B005VKRGXI","description":"","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"Another solid Spider-Man game","reviewText":"It's been a while since we got a Spider-Man game set in the free-roaming environment of New York City, but now we finally got another one that follows in the footsteps of the classic Spider-Man 2 while melding in some new elements which were obviously inspired by the critically acclaimed Batman games. The Amazing Spider-Man is a game that certainly delivers on providing a web-swinging experience worthy of the titular superhero, but also needs a little fine tuning in some of its execution. While tied to the recent movie of the same name, this videogame is actually set several months after the events of the movie (I'll make sure not to include spoilers for those who have not yet seen the movie). Peter Parker and his little love-bunny, Gwen Stacy, are giving themselves a secret tour of Oscorp where they witness several cross-species creatures (similar to the Lizard) being prepared for extermination. Being a different sort of cross-species himself, Peter Parker's presence riles up some of the other cross-species and they soon break out of their containment units, spreading havoc throughout the Oscorp facility and even infecting a large number of the company's staff, including Gwen Stacy. Many of the cross-species manage to escape into the city and start infecting other citizens, so it's up to Spider-Man to find a way to prevent the whole city from becoming a new kind of animal kingdom. I'll just come right out and say that those who have played any of the previous Spider-Man games such as Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3, or Spider-Man: Web of Shadows won't find anything they haven't seen before in one form or another in The Amazing Spider-Man. Having said that, I must mention the new ability known as web rush. Basically, holding down the web rush button puts you into first-person view and slows everything down to a slow crawl for a limited time, during which the player can easily choose a spot for Spider-Man to web-zip himself to with pinpoint accuracy, whether he's high above the skyscrapers or crawling through a dank, underground tunnel. You can also do a quick web rush simply by pointing the cursor/crosshairs at any wall or perch and tapping the web rush button. Although this is basically a different version of the web-zipping abilities seen in Beenox's previous games, Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions and Spider-Man: Edge of Time, I liked the way they pulled off the web rush in this game and hope to see more of it in future installments.Aside from this particular gameplay element, this game doesn't feature anything revolutionary. As you would expect, Spider-Man can web-swing (which is as fun as ever) all around New York City and keep himself busy with all sorts of side missions. He can stop random crimes such as muggings, car chases, shootouts, and the occasional bank robbery; there are also sick people he can take to quarantine centers and escaped mental patients he can drop off at police stations. Spidey can also take part in side missions that have him taking pictures of specific occurrences (in a similar manner to Spider-Man 3) and he can even take pictures of his enemies to unlock character bios. There are even special collectibles to pick up in the game's main missions like magazines, audio logs, and tech pieces that provide Spidey with XP, although the special comic book pages you can find while free-roaming the city are way more fun to collect. Gathering enough of them allows you to read the actual comics in the extras menu, which was a nice touch for Spidey purists, however there are a lot of pages to collect before you can read all of the comics available. Even though all these things can be done while free-roaming the city, the main missions and some specialized side missions take place in more linear indoor areas, mainly secret facilities and sewers. Not sure if this is a pro or a con, but it's worth mentioning that these indoor areas cannot be revisited once the missions they're set in have been completed, at least not while in free-roam. Fortunately, you can go to Peter's apartment while in free-roam, which serves as an in-game hub, and replay earlier missions if you're one of those gamers who simply must find every collectible in every mission. These more linear indoor missions are just part of the gameplay elements influenced by the Batman games: the rest of them are tied to the game's camera and combat. When simply web-swinging or running around, the camera remains at a close right side angle behind Spider-Man and then pulls back when he's fighting bad guys. The camera works well for the most part, but can be disorienting when web-swinging up tall buildings and such.When in combat, Spidey can punch, dodge/counter-attack (physical attacks only), shoot webs, and vault over his enemies. Similarly to the Batman games, if you keep up an uninterrupted combo by attacking or dodging, Spidey will be able to stun his enemies, which allows him to take them out more quickly with specialized web attacks. He can use his web rush ability to interact with environmental objects such as dumpster bins and lockers and then toss them at his enemies to stun a large group in one fell swoop, or he can use web rush to target an enemy and hit them with a web strike. After gaining enough experience points, Spidey can purchase upgrades like increased resistance to physical and projectile attacks, impact web shots that can affect stronger enemies, and use a line of webbing to swing enemies around and throw them into other enemies. Spidey will also encounter enemies in situations that are better dealt with through stealth, normally when facing human enemies armed with guns or large groups of stronger infected enemies who can spit acid. After acquiring enough upgrades, Spidey will soon be able to web up two enemies at once and stick them to ceilings before other surrounding enemies even notice. Whether he's fighting enemies or sneaking up on them, Spidey can zip himself away from danger using web retreat if he needs a breather to recover some health, or avoid attacks that can't normally be dodged. As for the enemies themselves, most of them offer decent enough challenges. Just like in the Batman games, Spider-Man can't last long against armed enemies, but even against a large group of melee-type enemies, including guys with knives, guys with shields and batons, guys wearing body armor, infected enemies, and spider-legged robots, Spidey can easily be overwhelmed if he's not careful. However, a larger variety of enemies, especially more infected enemies, would have been a plus.The bosses are somewhat of a mixed bag. Spider-Man fights against several of his classic enemies, including Rhino, Scorpion, Vermin, Iguana, Black Cat, and a couple of other newer enemies. For the most part, fighting these guys consists mainly of dodging their attacks and then smacking them around a bit, making the fights rather straightforward, although a couple of the battles do require a small amount of strategy and timing. On the flip side, the boss battles where Spidey faces off against some Spider Slayer robots in the city are much more exciting and visually impressive. He'll fight against a couple of building-sized robots, one with multiple legs and another that can burrow itself underground and even through buildings, and he'll also fight smaller, jet-type of robots that fly around the air at blinding speeds, requiring Spidey to move just as quickly if he wants to survive. As fun as this all may sound, there's plenty of room for improvement. For one thing, the combat could have been executed more smoothly. Beating up large groups of enemies was fun in this game, but it felt rather stiff compared to the much more flowing combat in Spider-Man 2 and the Batman games, and I was also hoping for a wider array of stronger attacks that affect more enemies at once. The different number of side missions was rather paltry compared to what I've seen in the earlier free-roaming Spidey games, but thankfully they're still enjoyable. Finally, for those of you who are interested, the story keeps your attention, but doesn't provide quite enough memorable moments and can be somewhat predictable, not to mention it's a bit on the short side. Plus, I felt they could have added more characterization to some of the villains, like Rhino and Scorpion, but they've been degraded to simple, snarling beasts to fall in line with the whole \"cross-species\" plot tied to the movie. To sum up, this is a good game and Beenox is on the right track, but I feel they can make a truly great Spider-Man game if they incorporate a deeper and smoother combat system, and also add more variety to the missions in future installments. Since this game doesn't do anything new enough to justify a full price purchase, I recommend renting it first or waiting until a price drop of around $40 before purchasing it. But, if you're like me and you enjoy all things Spider-Man, then you can certainly do worse than this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2012"}

Looks more like an SNES game.Battle System 5/10 - Your typical turn based battle system with updated spell graphics.Game play 6/10 - This game took me 25 hours to complete.Special Feature - In the original NES Final Fantasy you had to walk everywhere you went. In this wonderfully remade version of Final Fantasy they added the run button. Hold it down and you can run. This cuts down on travel time in towns and dungeons.Overall 7/10 - For Final Fantasy I, all the updates to this game have truly made a great game into a classic.--- Final Fantasy II Prologue ---A long-lived peace is at an end. The Emperor of Palamecia has called forth monsters from the underworld and begun his campaign for world conquest.A rebel army arose in the kingdom of Fynn to thwart the emperor's plans. But the rebels' castle fell to an all out assault by the remote town of Altair.Four youths from Fynn also found themselves fleeing the imperial forces. They had lost their parents at the hands of the empire. But their escape wasn't over...Your party will consist of four people. Three of them will stay with you throughout the game, but the forth member will change throughout the game.You start with Firion, Maria, and Guy.The forth wheels are:Leon - A Dark KnightMinwu - A White WizardJosef - A MonkGordon - A PrinceRicard - A DragoonLeila - A Pirate CaptainYou will have complete control over how you mold your team. So, take some time to think how you want them to grow. \"E.g. to be a wizard or a sword fighter?\" You will be fighting a lot in this game, so take some time to attack your own team with your spells and weapons. This will help your team members to grow strong and powerful. You don't gain experience points in this game, you grow by casting spells, fighting, and taking damage.Story 8/10 - This game has betrayal, revenge and redemption. This game was well written and a delight to read. So far, this is my third favorite Final Fantasy story.Music 6/10 - I enjoyed the midi style of music that was used in this game.Game play 6/10 - This game took me 22 hours to complete the main quest.Graphics 6/10 - Were like some of the best graphics seen on the SNES. Eye candy is out there for you to find. The spells also gain levels by using them over and over, by doing so the animations also become flashier every 2 to 3 levels.Battle system 5/10 - Typical turn based attack system. Note: Building your team is slow and painful, but well worth the effort.Special Mention--- After you complete Final Fantasy II watch the credits till they end and the game will ask you to save. Save your game and you will return to the main Final Fantasy II start screen with 3 options, \"Congrats!\" You just unlocked the \"Soul of Rebirth\" mini quest!This Soul of Rebirth side quest is tough, it also added 10 hours of game play and a great side story to Final Fantasy II.I would like to see more of this kind of treatment to the remakes of RPGs.Overall Time: 32+ hours to finish this game and 57+ hours to finish Final Fantasy Dawn of Souls is a great length for a GBA game.I truly liked this game. It was a challenge to complete and that is its charm.PS: Don't forget to get a copy of the strategy guide for this game.Official Nintendo Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls Player's Guide","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2007"}

My 60GB launch model is still going strong, from rocking UC3 to playing Blu-rays.  I would definitely recommend one of these new models if you are on the fence.  Having had my PS3 for five years now, here are some thoughts and things that separate the PS3 from the competition:1  PS3 has better quality and variety on first party exclusives -- for instance you have games like Heavy Rain, Uncharted 1, 2, & 3, Resistance, MGS, etc...  Xbox has mostly run and gun or tactical first/third person shooters.2  PS3 does more stuff -- for instance you can get DirecTV NFL Sunday Ticket on PS3, along with many movie/TV/music services.  I use DirecTV and Hulu Plus.  PS3 plays Blu-rays which is the de-facto standard today for physical disc media movies.  And the redesigned Playstation Home is pretty good...  I can waste a day on there just messing around, shopping for my avatars, and talking to other gamers.3  PS3 has a better track record with hardware non-failure by far.  My launch system 60GB is still going strong, five years later, and my controllers that I got/bought with the system are still going strong too...  That built in battery is the cats-meow.Overall the PS3 is well worth the money, especially at the price they are selling for today.  I paid over $600 for mine...  no regrets though.  I would still be willing to pay $600 for this quality system.  My Xbox 360 was in the grave years ago.  I observe a moment of silence every once in a while between switching discs on my PS3.If you are on the fence, this system is the one to get.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EB70","description":"","reviewerName":"Neoncloudff","summary":"Irrational Games returns, and with them an unforgettable adventure","reviewText":"Pros:+ Phenomenal story+ Fantastically realized new \"Bioshockian\" world+ Deep Characters+ Tight, polished gameplay and absurdly fun (if limited) skyline combat+ Gorgeous, creative visuals and incredible art style+ Finally a game that knows how to end its story with style and substance+ Paced just rightCons:- Low Res textures are a bummer- Elizabeth can feel \"artificial\" at times- Some frame rate loss (surprisingly not as much as I was expecting)- That it ends, and the fact that we have to wait a good long time until the next Bioshock mind tripI start with a conclusion.As I sit here, writing this review, my head is spinning from the ending.  It will leave you enthralled, enthused, emotional, and shaking.  Bioshock Infinite, despite its lofty expectations and undeniably \"sky high\" promises from creative powerhouse Irrational Games (formerly known as 2K Boston), is an incredible achievement in interactive entertainment.  From the incredible art style to the story, the well written script to Columbia itself, Bioshock Infinite is more than just a game on disc; it's an incredibly and thoughtfully created world quite unlike most games of today, and it's just waiting to be explored.  Being a Bioshock mega fan (I've gotten my brass balls twice and just completed my 5th run), I also was worried that it just wouldn't deliver.  But by the time the credits roll, my jaw hit the floor.First and foremost, Bioshock Infinite must be applauded for its incredible story.  From mysterious start to its whirlwind finale, Bioshock will \"enrapture\" you right away with its unique themes and stellar characters.  From the zealot and main antagonist Zachary Hale Comstock to revolutionist Daisy Fitzroy, the old war dog Slate to the Lutece siblings and Alexander Fink, the story has plenty of catalysts to tell a deep and engaging story which Infinite does without a hitch.  At points, it may seem like too much to process, and that is why Bioshock is so great.  It warrants multiple play-throughs simply to catch everything the story is telling.  There are small subtleties and twists along the way, tugging at your mind.  It's a story that is heavily laced with themes as well, which transcend simple dialogue and enter the realm of art.  Infinite, at points, doesn't even tell a story with words but through its remarkable visuals.  Not photo-realistic graphics or dramatic over the top violence, but through its striking art style.  You'll feel the oppression of this seemingly tranquil haven, the disturbing discourse of its inhabitants and the feelings towards certain concepts such as racism.  By the time you reach the end of your journey, everything and I mean EVERYTHING hits the fan.  (A side note: I am a Christian, and for those worrying the religious content is attacking and taking cheap punches, see through it that you reach the end.  If anything it's a profound and important ending.)And speaking of visuals, Columbia is nothing short of a looker.  The world feels alive, from the propaganda-covered buildings to the way Elizabeth reacts to certain discoveries while you both slowly crawl around Columbia's cityscape.  It's a game that doesn't hold your hand, freely allowing you to explore this fascinating and fantastical world at your own pace. There's plenty off the beaten path, but it never forces the player to find it. You have to be invested, curious, and interested.  Playing Bioshock just to get to the next shootout is not playing Bioshock Infinite at all.  Sure, you can blast through Infinite in less than 10 hours but that would be a horrendous mistake.  Similar to the original Bioshock, Infinite places a major emphasis on world building and exploration as much as its story and gameplay.  Voxophones lay hidden throughout Columbia, providing little snippets of lore and exposition from main characters, while propaganda and period art brings the world to life.  Columbia feels a little more linear as compared to the original, but it no doubt pays off when trying to tell an engaging story.  When it comes to creating a fascinating and ingenious world, Bioshock still is the reigning champion.It wouldn't be a masterpiece without some innovations in the gameplay department, which Bioshock brings in spades.  The classic Power/Weapon combo is back, but this time ups the pace of play and intensity up to 11.  From your first \"shocking\" introduction into the brutal combat all the way up to the later battles, Bioshock's combat never dulls and is fairly challenging to boot.  That being said, the combat deviates from the \"think preemptively and plan\" style that was so very entertaining in the original.  I do miss the mechanics of that, but the trade off is a much tighter and intense combat system that finds a good balance of trap setting and all out gunfighting.  The big addition is undoubtedly the skylines and skyline combat.  Spectacular, visceral, and absurdly fun, the skyhook battles are some of the coolest and most entertaining moments of Bioshock Infinite, and the miracle here is that it actually works.  Many were the promises of these epic and wildly fast paced battles in previous interviews and demos, and when something like this is actually made reality and it just plain works, it's an achievement in itself.  Enemies will fly in on barges, utilize skylines to get the advantage on you, and you must zoom around on these rollercoaster-like rails and dispatch of your foes in some of the most memorable fights in the game.  The AI is smart and deadly too, so watch out.  It really is too bad that there weren't more of these moments.  Hopefully DLC will add some new battle scenarios or areas that didn't fit into the game's narrative but will no doubt fit into a challenge arena type zone.So, Infinite's story strikes the profound notes it promised, its world is incredibly well realized and stands along side of FPS greats such as City 17 and Rapture, and its gameplay is fresh and invigorating.  What else is there to talk about?Well, how about Gary Schyman's incredible original score?  Just like Bioshock, Infinite's score is just as creepy, brooding and anarchist as the original but is gladly more present, featuring a combination of folk tunes and light orchestrated ambience to truly bring Columbia to life, but not without hinting at its darker secretes lying within.  Contrasting the almost ethereal exploration music, Schyman's score becomes belligerent and terrifying during battles.  It also adapts depending on the action on screen as well.  The sound design is also incredibly fantastic, boasting and incredible array of sound effects that really bring Columbia alive with mechanic growls from megaphones alerting enemies to your presence to the \"chick chick chick\" as you slowly climb to the roller coaster-like skylines.  Spot on audio editing rounds out the auditory experience.  Voice acting peerless across the board, with a seemingly \"dude-bro\" performance from Troy Baker (as Booker DeWitt) at first but transforms into something unique by the end.  Courtney Baker is also fantastic as Elizabeth, inflecting emotion and intensity in a performance that needed to be 100% spot on.And speaking of Elizabeth, you won't look at an FPS NPC the same way again after having journeyed through Columbia.  Living and breathing in this incredible world, Elizabeth reacts to the surroundings, is pivotal to the story and gameplay, and truly becomes a companion.  Her animations are so well done that she really feels like a living character instead of a hollow and soulless character, and along with the brilliant performance from Baker, Elizabeth is the culmination of many years of work and creation, and it shows.  Her unique AI does tears at the seams only slightly, but despite that tiny shortcoming Elizabeth will no doubt be a character remembered for decades to come.Despite all of the praise, I have some gripes.  Small ones to be sure, but things that shouldn't be looked over, no matter how glazed over you become while playing through Infinite.  Flat textures rears its ugly head throughout the game on consoles, and while vistas and detail is profound, the same can't be said as you approach an object or sign super close.  As mentioned before, Elizabeth does have a few hiccups here and there.  She sometimes moves around way too much (I assume she is attempting to focus on the player's location, and the AI engine can't decide what to do), giving her a sense of a hyper curious person.  It doesn't ruin the experience, but it is a little jarring as at certain points she is incredibly life like, and others feels like a NPC deciding where to stand.  Elizabeth is still absolutely impressive and lovable though.  A couple (and I mean only 3, maybe 4 instnaces max) bugs also pop up, such as an enemy standing still not recognizing your presence or a weird invisible wall where one shouldn't be.  Despite the length of this paragraph, the flaws of Bioshock Infinite are mere scratches on its shining golden surface, and none ruined the experience, but rather sucked me out of an otherwise completely mesmerizing experience.IN CONCLUSION:It's especially weird to be playing this game.  When a game promises so much, even more so than most developers and publishers would hope to dream of, and comes through on all of them you just know a game is good.  I have come away from my play through feeling one thing specifically: satisfaction.  All the time spent waiting, watching, wondering, worrying: \"Will Infinite come through?\" \"How can Irrational top the first one?\"  Well, one thing is for certain...Irrational Games now has one of the toughest acts to follow in gaming.  The wait has been worth it, and I can't wait for the next adventure, wherever Ken Levine and the brilliant minds at Irrational take us next.10/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"\"They're not ALLOWED to be so fast!\"","reviewText":"If you think about it, the zombie survival genre has a lot in common with first-person shooters (FPS).  Granted, it didn't start out that way - Night of the Living Dead was more focused on the survival than the zombies, and with slow-moving zombies our protagonists could run right past the hordes of undead.  With fast zombies all the rage, most prominently on display in the remake of Dawn of the Dead, the distinction between zombies and hordes of mooks is even less apparent. Its surprising it took this long for someone to finally make a FPS that's just about killing zombies.===========\"I'll see peace back on Earth if I gotta murder every one of these bastards with my bare g-ddamn hands!\"--Bill===========Left 4 Dead takes the FPS genre one step further and makes it a four-player team (the \"4\" in the title is no accident) that can be played co-op, online, or even multiplayer teams of four survivors vs. four player-controlled zombies. Divided into chapters and presented like a movie, the action starts immediately with four zombie survival stereotypes: the combat-weary war veteran (Bill, voiced by Jim French), the white collar black guy (Louis, voiced by Earl Alexander), the tough-as-nails biker dude (Francis, voiced by Vince Valensuela), and the hot chick (Zoey, voiced by Jen Taylor). Their goal is simply to survive by fighting their way through wave after wave of zombies, with the occasional super-zombie thrown in to spice things up.That's it. That's all there is to Left 4 Dead.And yet that simple summary doesn't do the game justice.  Just as Gears of War revolutionized how cover and reloading was handled in FPS, Left 4 Dead is first and foremost a perfected multiplayer experience.===========\"Look on the bright side; even if you guys die, I'll still be really handsome!\"--Francis===========Friends can take over one of the four characters at any time, and if they're idle too long, the computer takes over. Players vote on everything, including when to skip boring sequences like summaries.  And yet combat summaries are there if the group is so inclined, ranging from headshots to number of zombies killed to the amount of damage taken.For the players who are fond of running off and being a hero, Left 4 Dead forces group teamwork: Smoker and Hunter zombies pick off loners and are a death sentence for the victim unless comrades come to his aid. Idiots who run off by themselves are dead meat. Witch zombies, which attack whomever disturbs them, forces the team to stop and think about what they shoot.  Even death isn't permanent - players reappear in safe houses as survivors (who just happen to be exact copies of the original cast) so that everyone can get back to doing what they love most: killing the killed.Left 4 Dead is light on back-story, but that's not important to the multiplayer genre either. There's enough graffiti on the walls to figure out what happened, which in case you didn't guess already, involves people getting infected and becoming zombies. What makes Left 4 Dead even sweeter is how it embraces all its zombie tropes, from the levels (escape from a hospital, from a cabin in the woods, from the top of a skyscraper) to the characters (are all reminiscent of zombie movie tropes), to little touches like how the perspective shifts to black and white when a character is about to die - shades of Night of the Living Dead!===========\"Mister, if one of us gets killed out here, I'm gonna shoot my way in there and beat you to death with my gun!\"--Louis===========Even the zombies themselves behave like bad actors.  Although they can move fast when they sense prey, they die in all kinds of glorious and inglorious ways, stumbling as they lose unlife and limb. They can't even open doors, instead tearing at it with their bare hands.The voice acting is superb, including the refreshingly confident yet feminine voice of Cortana from Halo 3, Jen Taylor. The dialogue is hilarious - Zoey's rant about \"fast-moving zombies\" is priceless.  And there's even a Game Master-like AI Director who determines when and how to ramp up the tension against the players, precipitated by the appropriate horror-style music.Left 4 Dead is so good that it's replaced my weekly Gears of War 2 games as the co-op game of choice.  Look for Talien if you want some help surviving the zombie apocalypse.===========\"I just can't get over how FAST they all are, it's not even fair. I'm calling zombie bull$#!+ on that, you know? They're not...ALLOWED to be so fast.\" --Zoey===========","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Barry Robinson","summary":"Super Smash Bros. -  The return of a classic.

{"product_name":"B0014UGK8G","reviewerName":"0ktopi \"MumblyJoe\"","summary":"What Mercenaries 2 should have been.","reviewText":"If you like great big maps and endless amounts of destruction, this game is for you.  The Geo-mod 2.0 system works incredibly well, and though I do miss the ability to tunnel through walls/hills etc. as in the other Red Faction games I don't know that it would be particularly useful in this one.The game play is very good.  Controlling your character feels a bit like Mercenaries or Lost Planet, but much smoother.  The vehicle physics are also very good, though I've noticed a glitch where smaller vehicles abruptly and inexplicably accelerate forward from a dead stop.  It is rare, however and helps as often as it hurts. The ability to stick to walls is kind of useless, considering that 90% of the time you're working to demolish every wall in sight, and the rest of the time enemies are rapidly demolishing any walls you use as cover.  Perhaps they could've found a better function to assign to that button.The story line is ok.  Is it on par with Fallout 3? Not a chance.  While they worked in a little bit with an  \"ancient\" race descended from the Ultor Corporation of the earlier games, I think there was probably more potential in that particular vein than they made use of.  Otherwise the story of Martian colonization is fairly interesting.  The use of modern news-media jargon on the bad guys' broadcasting system as they put their own spin on you and the Red Faction's exploits is a nice touch.  Story is very much secondary to the action, however and there are some pretty big holes in the plot. You have to wonder why your character quits using the awesome satellite guided artillery, for instance, in favor of driving a tank through swarms of enemy soldiers who could have easily been vaporized with said artillery.The visuals are pretty good.  Of course, the game takes place on Mars, so if you're expecting something other than lots and lots of rocks you clearly need to spend more time familiarizing yourself with the solar system than you do playing video games.  The Martian sunsets are brief but if you catch one from atop a big rock in the Badlands its kind of pretty.  The character graphics are also pretty good.Bottom line- is this game fun? Lots.Is it worth $60? It depends what kind of game you like. If you like open worlds and lots of destruction, then yes.  And though I have not taken it online yet there is some good replay value in the single player alone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2009"}

Its very approachable and friendly. The Balance Board is a tremendous piece of kit - rock solid and absolutely excellent at what its supposed to do.As a product dedicated to fitness, though, its pretty lacking. Now, don't get me wrong - it is far better than doing nothing (what I am used to doing), and actually has some nice perks to keep you going (like score tracking and an unlock mechanic). But it doesn't let you customize a workout, and progression advice is minimal. It literally just lets you do whatever activities at any time. Now, I could go to the gym and do exactly the same thing, but I still would want to get some advice from someone or something. Wii Fit doesn't do it!Another problem is that between activities, you have to stop and navigate menus. It'd be much better if there was a flowchart like menu for setting up workouts so you can go one after the other, keeping the heart rate up. This is a very serious deficiency and I wonder why Nintendo didn't put it in.All in all, as an introduction to fitness, its pretty good, and at $90 its really pretty affordable if you have a Wii already. but I really hope some other company comes out with a good fitness videogame using the balance board, with more workout and eating tips.

{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Swift Ryan \"Angel\"","summary":"Awe Inspiring Fun!!!","reviewText":"I got into the beta for this game in the last part of July 2011.  I knew from the moment I signed in that this game was the best.  The more I played it the more I want to play it.  Of course, I love BioWare's other titles as well Mass Effect and Dragon Age;  So I suppose calling me a FanBoy may be accurate.  However I believe that I have very good reasons for what I enjoy.  Every game has been loads of fun to play and I think there are millions of others who agree.First off the quests and the world itself are dynamic and based upon how you play the game.  The choices you make in the quests have a very real impact upon the rest of the story.  Now at launch that is mostly just esoterically apparent.  However judging by how BioWare's other success with Mass Effect and Dragon Age franchise the Devs for \"Star Wars: The Old Republic\" will be very busy adding more visible and dramatic changes to our ingame experience.  I believe that Blizzard's success with the phasing technology will be incorporated as well as the planets change and adapt to the choices we make.Both Empire and Republic have four base classes.  Each class is roughly equivalent to a uniquely named class on the opposing faction.  For instance Troopers and Bounty Hunters are roughly the same gameplay and style.  Each after level ten players must choose between two base Advanced Classes before proceeding further into the game.  Choose carefully because the game is void of any way to change your choice of class after you make it.  BioWare has hinted that there are more base classes, advanced classes, and races to come.Players in each faction roughly have access to six species.  Some species are unique to specific base classes though.  For instance, Miraluka can only be Jedi.  Some species are also faction specific: for instance Sith Pureblood can only be Sith.  Though the choice of species is largely just cosmetic and story, and has almost zero impact upon the game mechanics.There are two \"Origin Planets\" {Starting Areas} for each planet.  Each Origin Planet currently hosts two base classes as they season from one to ten.  Hutta is for Imperial Agents' and Bounty Hunters'.  Tython is for Jedi Counsulars' and Knights'.Prospective players want a computer with good gaming capabilities but the game is built for the Average gaming computer.  Currently BioWare/EA has zero intention of importing the game to consoles like the XBox 360 and/or PS3.I absolutely and abundantly love and adore Star Wars: The Old Republic.  I recommend it for any and all.  Those who are new to gaming, or veterans, will enjoy the game from character creation to level fifty and beyond.  There have been a lot of games claiming to be the \"WoW Killer\" BioWare avoided making such claims and have let their product speak for itself... and it is definitely speaking.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0006SST9U","description":"Gaming&#146;s notoriously naughty squirrel--Conker--arrives on the Xbox with a bang in an all-new Xbox Live-enabled team-based shooter,Conker: Live and Reloaded.The game features intense Deathmatch and Campaign story-line modes via Xbox Live and System Link, and players can compete as one of six combat specialists across multi-mission campaigns covering Old War and Future War. The warfare promises to deliver the non-stop action, humor, and innuendos Conker is famous for.Also included is the critically acclaimed single-player game,Conker&#146;s Bad Fur Day,completely recreated for the Xbox with stunning graphics and unparalleled attitude.Features:Team-focused, story-driven, Xbox Live gameplay: Team-based gameplay is at the heart of this shooter, pitting the noble Squirrels against the evil Tediz. Players can choose from a variety of scenario-based missions featuring two unique campaigns--Old War and Future War--with each mission featuring its own distinctly challenging gameplay mode. Campaign story lines, comprised of multiple missions played progressively, bring an innovative and fresh approach to team-based shooters and Xbox Live, supporting up to 16 players.Elite squad action: Players choose from six character classes, including Skyjockey, Long Ranger, Grunt, Demolisher, Thermophile, and Sneaker, each with its own signature weapons and abilities. InConker: Live and Reloaded,team composition has strategic and tactical advantages and implications.Xbox Live gameplay: Team-based gameplay, innovative campaign story lines, and distinctive humor all make for a great experience on Xbox Live. Online players strategize, cooperate, and communicate as a team in Campaign mode, or venture out solo against buddies in Deathmatch.

Operate five types of vehicles including Sky Steed, Mule Bomber, R-Hog, Toad, and Tankus, and various types of equipment such as anti-infantry sentries, medi-guns, and a snoop camera. Special abilities allow players to disguise themselves or feign death and sneak up on unsuspecting foes to unload a demoralizing array of attacks.Twisted and irreverent world of Conker: Over-the-top humor, characters, and gameplay dominate in every way with rude wit, lewd innuendoes, and ridiculous violence. The juxtaposition of the characters, Squirrels and Tediz, and their world is at the heart of the humor. The expressions, exclamations, and special effects bring out the true Conker flavor.Wildly bizarre single-player adventure: The critically acclaimed single-player gameConker&#146;s Bad Fur Dayis now on Xbox, fully recreated with amazing graphics and enhanced profanity. The game is full of hilarious situations, movie pastiches, off-the-wall puzzles, and crazy characters in an offbeat world, including horny bees, voluptuous sun flowers, singing piles of poo, and even Death himself.","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Excellent mix of genres","reviewText":"This review is only for the single player portion of the game.  I haven't had enough time clocked into the Multiplayer yet to give it a score.When Conker's Bad Fur Day came out on the N64 back in 01, it had the unfortunate luck to come out toward the end of game development.  Nintendo had started promoting their next console, the Gamecube and this fact, coupled with the fact that Conker was retailing for an ungodly $70+ made many people miss this game.  What a treasure it was to be missed.It is the first game that meshed the genre of platforming with third person shooting.  It also introduced context sensitive situations where, at the push of a button, different things would happen.  Both of these have become old hat now, especially the mixing of genres.  You can look at Jak and Daxter for the PS2 to find that.  On top of revolutions of gameplay, this was the funniest game I have ever played.And so it's out again on the Xbox, bearing beautiful graphics, re-recorded dialogue and some shifting of difficulties.  The graphics in this game are probably some of the best, if not the best, seen in an Xbox game to date.  This doesn't surprise me, though, given that Rare creates beautiful games.  What did surprise me was how they toned the game down as far as difficulty goes.  The original game was hard, downright frustrating in some parts.  Now, Rare either tamed down the difficulty (as in the Saving Private Ryan level) or completely cut out a section (as in a sequence involving underwater travel and an electric eel used to power different generators).  Both sections were insanely difficult and not forgiving in the least.Part of the problem of the first game was the pacing at the beginning.  Some reviewers here are misinformed when they say the game is not a \"shooter\" that it is a \"platformer.\"  The beginning levels are very platform heavy, true, but give it some time.  It isn't until later stages where you are facing zombies and tediz that the gameplay focus switches to a shooter type from platforming.  I enjoy both parts but it would have been nice to have a better mixing of the two genres.  However, since this is basically a port of that game I'm glad they didn't change it.Along with awesome graphics, the audio portion of the game has been completely redone.  The dialogue has been re-recorded (using the same people), and the music has been redone to perfection.  All of this in Dolby Digital surround.Basically, my biggest recommendation for the single player comes in the form of what is in this game.  Where else, for instance, can you fight the operatic Great Mighty Poo, hit a boiler plant in his brass balls, ride a raptor, bite a caveman in the ass with said raptor, lava surf, be a bat, ride in a tank, have bullet time, hit on a cavewoman, jump on a female flower's \"petals,\" shoot zombies, meet Death, get drunk, urinate on Fire Imps and partake in many movie parodies?  Honestly, the list can go on and on.Then, on top of this wonderful single player game, a game I have played over and over on the N64 and will probably play over and over on the Xbox, is the Live portion.I haven't played the Live portion too much but I think people will be divided on it.  Especially the console gamers used to games like Halo 2.  There are six classes that range from the bazooka carrying demolitionists to the airplane flying sky jockeys.  Each character has their own weapon set complete with upgrades and special abilities.  All of this in an arena that is objective based instead of simply death match based.  This involves large arenas to play CTF and other games similar to this.  But there's strategy involved not only in how to get the flag from point A to point B but also in the classes which opens up a variety of ways to accomplish your tasks.For instance, do you have your sky jockey transport troops into the thick of things and provide cover fire?  Do you have your Sneeker troops sneak in with their up close and personal melee weapons?  Or do you rain devastation with your bazookas?  There's so many choices for tactical strategy.  Conversely, there's a lot of room for things to go sour.  I think the quality of the people playing, not only in how they play but also in personality, will determine whether this Live experience will be a fun one or a horrible one.The Live portion seems to be more in line with PC online games, like Counter Strike, where there's a little more strategy involved.  Don't get me wrong, Halo 2 has strategy but if you play Counter Strike the way most Live people play Halo 2, you wouldn't last very long.  And I think that same type of strategy will carry over into Conker's Live portion.  I could be wrong.  I hope it's very successful because Rare put a lot of time and effort into fine tuning it.  We'll see.Anyway, I look forward to seeing you online and I hope you pick up this game because the quality inside it shines.  Look to Rare to lead the way into Xbox 360.  Not only with Conker but in the games they have ready for X360 Launch.  Thanks, Rare, for bringing Conker to a new generation of players who probably missed out of the game the first go around.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2005"}

OK, so I am a little behind on the game playing these days, but in an effort to catch up on some games I own but haven't played yet, I recently finished Uncharted 1, 2, and 3 which were all amazing!!! Queue, Tomb Raider. I have been a fan of tomb raider since it first was available on the PS 1. Though there were some games in the series that I tried to play but did not care for.This is by far the best Tomb Raider to date! The story line, the acting, the game play...all amazing.There was a sense that Uncharted was inspired by the Tomb Raider series, but just did a overall better job at implementing top quality controls and game play amongst many other great things about the game. Its nice to see that the new Tomb Raider has seemed to be inspired by the success of Uncharted and made the game play VERY similar. The controls and movements were almost identical. It was very easy to pick this game up and already feel like I knew how to play.As much as I like the Uncharted series, they did seem a little too streamlined. Also, Drakes abilities were lacking. It was the same thing throughout all 3 games.Tomb Raider boasts many more weapons and abilities with the ability to upgrade and expand on your arsenal. To do this however, you are going to have to do a lot of searching around which was a nice addition. There are items ALL OVER this beautiful island they created. And although its not a complete open world, its a big one.Also, the side mission of raiding the tombs made the game feel like....well...like Tomb Raider. The puzzles were hard, but not to hard you were pulling your hair out. I figured out most of them after a few tries.The only thing I did not like so much in this game was sometimes the controls were annoying on certain parts of the game. Particularly when your floating down in the rapids which wasn't too bad, just very hard to see where you were going bc of the camera angle they chose. But the parachute part....COMPLETELY UNENJOYABLE!!! I spent over a half our and died about 50 times just trying to get through that 40 second sequence bc the controls were not responsive. The with that sequence is they obviously put boundaries on where you glide. So it was very hard to tell where to go. The controls were also horrible on that part.I'm sure some people got through it pretty easily, but there are a ton of people who had a problem and it was so annoying that I almost gave up on the whole game.Other than that, the sound track is pretty simple. Not as epic as Uncharted or full of lush instruments like Final Fantasy, but I really did enjoy it a lot.As for the collectors edition, I was a little disappointed with the play arts figure. The construction was good, but I feel like they could have done a better job on making it look exactly like the character in the game. I actually seen a picture online of the same figure that someone repainted to make it more similar and it looked amazingly identical.Overall, a great game that I highly recommend. As for the collectors edition, I traded it into amazon since they were offering $75 for it and I only paid $80. I have a lot of play arts figures and I just didn't feel like the paint job on this one was that great.Hope this helps.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00DV16N6U","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles Smartt","summary":"This game is fun, but the fun is short lived.","reviewText":"This is a &#34;real&#34; Ratchet and Clank game.The last two Ratchet and Clank titles were hardly worth calling entries in the Ratchet and Clank franchise because they lacked any sort of meaningful game-play mechanics. Fortunately, this game is true to form and it a genuine Ratchet and Clank game - there is a meaningful, although painfully short and stripped down single player campaign (no online multiplayer).The positives - This game looks absolutely fantastic on the PS3, this is Insomniac's best work artistically on this console. The weapons are fantastic, some are recreations of past classics whereas others are brand new - to the &#34;ironically named Peacemaker&#34; to the &#34;Zircon Family&#34;, the weapons are fun and easy to use. To that point, excluding the jet boots, the controls are fantastic. There is mild exploration, and there is good reward for finding everything because there are powerful, powerful weapons to be unlocked. Arena combat returns, some item collection missions return (huge open area where you look for things), and there is a challenge mode as in previous titles. There is also a difficulty setting, which is nice (easy, medium, hard).Unfortunately, however, there are some problems with this game that don't bring it to the caliber of &#34;Crack in Time&#34;. First, flying between planets is not the really cool &#34;oh, wow, you're flying your ship in space&#34; that was introduced in &#34;Crack in Time&#34;, rather, it is a meaningless &#34;move your ship icon to the planet you want to go to&#34;. I was sorely disappointed. Level design is mostly okay, except for one particular level: in certain situations on Planet Sixon doors would be open allowing me to explore regions I shouldn't, doors would be closed when they should be open preventing me from exploring regions, and it was difficult to figure out how to re-explore past areas on that particular world. Also, diversity is limited. There are no grind boot challenge, no vehicle piloting - it is get your gun and fire (and there is little to no strategy for weapon selection either).The price tag is what you get: a quickly made extremely short romp that is entertaining enough to have a second play through. The game comes with a download code for a previous Ratchet and Clank title - that isn't a half bad game makes up for what I feel is the high price point for this game (this should really be a $15.00 title, not a $30.00 title). The game is fun, but the fun is short lived.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001IK5TJI","reviewerName":"bluehobbes_7","summary":"Dragon Age: Origins Review","reviewText":"Probably the best straight-up RPG I've played in a while, Dragon Age: Origins is a very well put-together game that combines great storytelling, difficult situations, customization, and gameplay to provide fantastic experience.The game follows your character's journey as a special kind of warrior who is tasked with driving back a terrible, evil force (known as the \"Blight\") threatening the land. It may sound like an uninspired set-up (I shared the same thoughts), but it the story is actually told so well that it feels fresh and not like the same-old tune. There are many unique touches that set this game apart in that regard.Dragon Age is very good a placing your character into very difficult dilemmas. The lines between good and evil are definitely blurred, which is different and refreshing from most games that offer morality dilemmas. There is often no clear-cut answer where you say to yourself, oh that's the \"good\" choice and that's the \"evil\" choice. Instead, you may spend quite a while agonizing over what to do. These dilemmas woven into the story are extremely well done, and are what make Dragon Age stand out and really shine.The gameplay and battles are also quite fun, and there are tons of customization options and trees to follow, the system is strikingly similar to another BioWare masterpiece, Knights of the Old Republic. One problem I did have was that there was no chest or cache to store your excess items in, items that you didn't want to carry with you but didn't necessarily want to sell yet. This is a feature that seems common in RPGs and I feel that Dragon Age would have benefited from its inclusion.The only other issue with Dragon Age I had was its occasional bugginess. The graphics aren't bad by any means, but they certainly aren't the best around, and the occasional graphical bugs can really destroy a scene at times. I also experienced some weird crashes in the middle of some conversations.Overall though, the magnificent storytelling, gameplay, and character development won me over enough to overlook the game's occasional technical issues. This is a must for RPG fans, and a great game to try if one is interested in getting their feet wet with RPGs. The story and characters will win you over and keep you coming back for more all the way to the end of the game, and the fun gameplay successfully drives the story and the game foward. BioWare has done it again!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2011"}

But, having already spent the money, I played on. Happy to say, within 2-3 hours I was glad I'd bought it. This is a fun game, and the story is pretty much the strongest point about it. I don't like the RPG-style combat, but you get used to it (and besides, fighting isn't the main point of the game). At the end of the day, you'll like this game if you liked Fallout 3, Oblivion, and the like. It's nowhere near as awesome as Demon's Souls (a common comparison, so I thought I'd weigh in). My primary complaint is that by now we should see more innovation in a game based almost entirely on a great story and character interactions than a limited selection of text-based dialogue and stodgy choices with few consequences to the decisions being made. Graphics are decent (not great), gameplay is OK, interfacing and game complexity are difficult, and the story is great. Worth the full price? Maybe.

{"product_name":"B0050SY4DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"Signatures are onerous.\"","summary":"Prepare for some culture shock","reviewText":"I submitted my original review for RE 6 several months ago. I decided to do some serious editing on it because I realized I had been too hard on the game. Yes, it has some problems, but it isn't the absolute travesty that I made it sound like in my original review. From a production quality standpoint RE 6 is top notch. It is a very well constructed game, especially when one compares it to the production quality of most of the other crap that is out there. RE 6's problems lie not in technical execution but in stylistic approach. This game is so different from any in the series before it that for all practical purposes it is NOT a Resident Evil game. It's an action game, not a RE game. And it's not only an action game, but a completely over-the-top, Steven Spielbergish, oh-come-on-no-way-that-can-happen action game. The things that happen in this game are just too nuts to believe, and that has the effect of disengaging the player from the story. Once you've seen a character fall fifty feet for the third time with no injuries whatsoever, you just go, \"Okay, I'm not on this boat anymore.\" Instead of fighting zombies, the player finds himself fighting crazy chinese dudes that wear ridiculous masks and shout really annoying, unintelligible things. The story doesn't make a whole lot of sense, even after you've played all the scenarios, and there are things that remain unexplained. For example, when one particular character undergoes his C-virus transformation, there are definite indications of machinery or robotic parts inside him. Why is this? What makes his transformation different from that of the Chrysalids? It is never explained.Apart from the way-off-track stylistic approach, the game also has a couple of issues with the mechanics of play. For one, aiming your weapon is way more challenging than it should be, even with the proper options adjusted for sucky aimers. Also, character movement works in such a way that it is difficult to make fine adjustments to the position of your character in a small spot. For example, if you were to stand with your back facing a ladder, in order to get your character to climb the ladder you would have to run away from it, turn around in a circle, and run back to the ladder. Also, the dash-cam which takes over when your character is running is very inconvenient; it hinders your situational awareness and makes turning less accurate. The left and right shoulder buttons are meant for quickly turning your character while dashing, but for some reason this only works with the left button, so if you need to go right you have to stop dashing. But these control snafoos are compensated for by the incredible range of abilities your character has in combat. Characters can perform a large number of evasive and offensive moves that are easy to do. And the game is very good at reading these moves in terms of their context in the environment. What might have been a normal coup de grace in one situation becomes a shove off a high ledge in another, or a headbash on a metal railing. I'm actually surprised at how well Capcom got all the different aspects of combat to work.No review of RE 6 would be complete without mentioning Agent Hunt, an online mode that lets you play as the monsters. Once you become accustomed to how poorly the monsters control, you will have great fun in this mode. There's nothing more satisfying than finally landing that kill on an agent, especially when yourself and another player-controlled monster cooperate. Agent Hunt also gives the player the opportunity to get to know the creatures better, which increases your survival chances in the campaign.Onslaught is another fun multiplayer mode, in which you send more zombies to your opponent's side of the map by pulling off combos. Predator mode stinks--Ustanak is simply too powerful to fight. In Mercenaries mode, the balance of stage difficulty varies greatly. Some stages, like the Catacombs, are not too difficult to acheive an S rank; others, like Urban Chaos, are a challenge to even finish.Overall RE 6 is a good action game that offers a lot of entertainment both offline and online. Just prepare for a lot of craziness in the story, some very difficult aiming, and a camera that can be very annoying.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2013"}

{"product_name":"B006ZPAYD2","description":"","reviewerName":"Micheal Hunt","summary":"Dananananananananna.... Batman","reviewText":"This is the first Lego title I have played on PS3, and it's proven to be a lot of fun and made me interested in finding other Lego games on PS3 now.You can probably guess already what the game is about, and how it works, so I won't bore you with plot details or anything. The game allows you to start off on campaign mode with Batman and Robin, and the further into the game you get, the more characters you can earn/unlock. Completing story mode will eventually unlock a lot of extra Justice League heroes, but mainly you just wanna get your hands on Superman who has the ability to fly to really get the game going. Unfortunately he doesn't come in until about the 9th level. You can unlock freeplay mode after completing each level. There is where you can use whatever character you want that you have unlocked so far. The rest can be found in freeplay mode where you have to find them by either having enough gold to unlock superheroes, or fight the villains and then buy them.I don't think they have forgotten too many DC super heroes... the only one I don't think is in it that I noticed was Captain Marvel, but still, had it not been for Mortal Kombat vs DC I still wouldn't know who the heck that was anyway?The game took me about 2 weeks to complete, but for people who have more time, it can be done much quicker. The story mode doesn't last that long. It's only 15 levels, however once you have completed it, you can play story mode to get 100% in each story by replaying it, now being able to switch to whatever character you want this time (if you have access to them) and you can explore and break new things which individual characters powers.The only thing that lets the game down is the replay value. Yes, replaying the stories after finishing the game does expand it a bit, however I found it a bit too easy to unlock the necessary characters needed to complete the free mode replays of the 15 levels. You only really need Batman, Robin, Superman, Aqua Man, Lex Luther, The Joker, Killer Crock and Man Bat to get 100% in all the levels. After the 15 levels are completed at 100% each, you have the whole city to explore and find certain items and characters to buy. The thing that puzzles me tho is you need to obtain all 250 gold bricks in order to unlock a few characters, one being Supergirl. Her powers are no different to Superman, so it puzzles me why she is kind of the ultimate, or hardest, or perhaps most patient thing to unlock? You can just create your own superwoman in the create a character area of the Batcave. (with red hair instead of blonde, does a graphics color really matter?)I played through free play around the city collecting various things, I found all the red bricks needed to unlock cheats, I saved all the citizens in peril, and found all of the villains, the only thing I have not done is collected all 250 gold bricks just to unlock about 3 or 4 more characters.... and quite frankly, even with a cheat that allows the map to show you where the bricks are located, I have done about 130 and am just tired of it, and I really have no ambition to finish it just to unlock Supergirl and a few other characters not even needed to complete the main objectives of the game. So what is the point of having to find them all, really? Just so my entire save file says 100% complete or to unlock the 100% platinum trophy that means nothing to most PS3 gamers? The developers really should have either lessened the amount of gold bricks to find, or have a point to why you need to find 250 bricks, one at a time, scattered all over the city, just to unlock Supergirl in the end? What is so special about that? So I don't feel the need to play this game anymore now that I have completed it, and found all the bonus things necessary, and also found the little bonus level.The DLC for the game is just a couple of extra characters. One being Night Wing, another being Batmans son, and a few others I have never heard of. I don't see the point in it that either, as they don't add anything new to the game in abilities, nor do they add extra things to do in levels only their powers can unlock.What the game needed as DLC was more vehicles and costumes. It would have been really cool to be able to dress batman up as all versions of the batman, or at least the Adam West and the current look. And it would also have been nice to have ALL the batmobiles and transports available. As this game does have a big mix of all versions of batman from the movies, to comic books, being able to drive a bunch of different Batmobiles might have been a much better idea than the almost pointless mini kit pieces you find throughout the levels that unlock miniature versions of the larger vehicles in the game. It's just not that much fun after the first test drive of one. By the time I was done with the game I wasn't even using any vehicles,  and just flying around with any character that could do so.Lego should really think about that in future to keep people interested in the game after completion, or finding out that doing a long and tiring task like finding 250 gold bricks is pretty much pointless to unlock characters you just don't need.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2014"}

Dominant games like The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess and the definitive Super Mario Galaxy, really proved the Wii with its ultimate gameplay. But, that success has also been as a dominant question with Super Smash Brothers Brawl. While its prequel, Smash Brothers Melee was the biggest-selling title from Nintendo's last home console, the Gamecube, many still had wondered if Nintendo was going to be able to top that outrageous game of madness and excitement. Well, Nintendo has done it, and taken the brawl to a whole new level of fierceness. Its time to brawl!!Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Nintendo Wii, is one of the most anticipated games to be released this year, and it absolutely dominates the competition. The gameplay is very addictive as you play with all your favorite classics characters like Mario, the adorable Yoshi, Link, the fierce Bowser and many others. There are also a lot of new characters here to unlock too like Sonic The Hedgehog, Wario, King Dedede from Kirby's Dream Land, Diddy Kong and Olimar from the overlooked Pikmin series. There are also secondary characters which have been added as well, that come and assist you to the depth of the gameplay like the Nintendogs, which block the screen so you can't see where your opponents are during the game, and Andross from the Star Fox series. The graphics look great, and appeal to each and every level you can challenge on from the abstractism of Warioware, to the madness of racing along the Mario Raceway from Mario Kart. Each level is packed with excitement for gamers of all ages.The control is also new to some gamers, and traditional for veterans too, as you can manuver your favorite characters 4 different ways: the Wii Remote alone, the Wii and Nunchuck controller, the Wii's classic controller and even the Nintendo Gamecube controller. The Wii controller and nunchuck take awhile to get used to, but the classic and Gamecube controllers work very well, making it simple and addictive gameplay. On top of that, you also can now challenge against others not just in the living room, but you can now also play against other Brawlers online through Nintendo's Wi-Fi connection, which makes the gameplay even more addictive for anyone who wants to brawl farther than they've ever done before.All in all, Super Smash Brothers Brawl is a must buy for anyone who owns the Nintendo Wii. It is just great from start to finish and brings in every depth of excitment and gameplay for a super smash for anyone who has the need to smash the competition. It is definitely a great game all around and a great addition to your Wii video game library.Graphics: A-Sound: A-Control: A for Gamecube and Classic Controller; B for Wii Remote & NunchuckFun & Enjoyment: B+ for solo gamers; A for multiplayer actionOverall: A-","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2008"}

With so many options it really allows you to play different styles that fit you.  My only complaint here would be that I would have liked to have seen even more options, especially with force powers as well as lightsabre options.The effects and graphics were very good in my opinion and I always enjoyed going through the different levels.  Though I do wish there had been a few more levels as some got recycled later on in the game.The story line was really well done.  It fit style wise more with the original 3 movies than the new garbage that Lucas put out.  In fact it fit so well, I would welcome this one to being made into a movie.The down side to having such a solid story line though is it takes the decisions out of the players hands.  So instead of being like the Knights of the Old Republic where you can choose a path and move down it, this game moves you along s pre-set path and gives you no options on how the story progresses.Overall this is a great game and a must have for anybody that loves the original Star Wars or is just a fan of fun action games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2009"}

There's some love, and there's a lot of hate. The game's biggest critics take no prisoners: if you listen to them, this game has an insulting story, broken controls, and ugly graphics. While I agree the the story is lacking in some areas, it more than makes up for them in others. One major beef people have is a sequence in which Samus cowers in fear in the face of her famous foe, Riddley. 'Why is she afraid? hasn't she beaten this guy four times by this point?' What cynics like to leave out is that Samus CONQUERS her fears and blows Ridley's brains out moments later, showing us that while the bounty hunter isunquestionably brave, bounty hunters are human beings that think and feel like the rest of us. If that's the point Sakamoto was trying to get across, I think he succeeded. As for the gameplay aspect, the traditional Metroid gameplay has been pushed aside in favor for an action filled approach. I understand this has upset a number of fans, but if you want to play a game like Super Metroid, then by all means, play that game. I want new experiences, and these guys delivered. The action here is very smooth and Samus performs like Samus used to back in the good old days, fast and agile. Changing from first person view to third is incredibly fun and intuitive. Some people complain about a lack of nunchuck support, but after playing this game extensively, it's very apparent that it wouldn't work in this context. Lastly, the graphics. The environments are plain and textures can be rough, yes. But on the flipside, these are perhaps the best looking character models on the platform. So, its a mixed bag.In the end, this game has its flaws, to be sure, but it's much better than it's been given credit. If I had one major complaint, it's that I only wish it had lasted longer (albeit there is a stunning experience to be had after the credits roll). Truly a flawed masterpiece.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2011"}

And since I have over 1500 games and spent 8 years as a professional game critic, that's saying something. Other M is supposedly a direct sequel. I couldn't ask for much more. Until I played through it.Metroid: Other M disappointed me. I was excited to see a return to third-person, 2D gameplay, and intrigued by the potential of adding more story elements. The former worked okay, but lacked smoothness. Controlling Samus in 3D space with a controller as simple as the Wii's is not optimal. I found the auto-targeting wrong often and movement wonky. But once you get your weapons powered-up -- including some old favorites -- it really starts to shine. By then, though, the game is almost done.The story wasn't what I hoped. As a bounty hunter, Samus shines when it's her alone against the world. In Other M, it's her and a platoon of marines and their bossy commanding officer against the world. It just doesn't work as well -- especially since Samus is forced to do whatever the boss says.\"Look, I'm being destroyed by fire monsters, but I can't use my ice beam because Adam didn't tell me it's okay. Oh, fiddlesticks!\" Give me a break! One of the main story elements doesn't even reach an actual resolution -- as if the writer just forgot about it.On the positive tip, the boss fights are pretty slick, holding their own against other recent action games. Also, this is a very pretty Wii game. The map is huge, with lots of ground to cover.It'll take about 10 hours to beat if you're not rushing, and there's an epilogue which adds more longevity. There isn't as much tedious back-tracking like in Prime, thankfully. Getting 100% will be no easy task, though the game as a whole is easier than I thought it would be.It's novel to point the Wii remote at your TV to scan objects and fire missiles, but it can be clunky. I really wish there were more things to scan and read about -- like in the Prime series. I want to learn more about Bottle Ship and the creatures I'm fighting!If you temper your expectations, you'll find a lot to like in Metroid: Other M.

With 16 classic Nintendo characters on hand, ranging from  Bowser to Baby Mario, the crux of the game is the standard game of tennis, with  its break points, deuces, and double faults, but also with the added bonus of  power-ups and special moves.The game revolves around the individual players, and, as in other Mario  adventures, the characters all have their own strengths and weaknesses. Bowser  is great for the sheer strength and his powerful smashes, while other characters  survive on speed and agility, rather like inMario KartorMario  Golf.With Exhibition, Tournament, and Multiplayer modes, the game does have a number  of options to keep you busy. The chance to play with up to three other players  makes this game great to play with your friends.With this game, Nintendo has done to tennis what it did to kart racing and golf,  by producing a fun spin on what's not usually the most fun in computer games.  This is how tennis should be: super smashes, special combos, and Mario running  around in circles.--Stuart Miles--Amazon.co.ukNintendo has incorporated characters from the Super Mario Brothers series into a tennis simulation game for up to 4 players.  Each player manipulates a selected character from the 13 in the series.  There are multiple levels of difficulty.  Players need to learn the types of strategies used in traditional tennis; each can choose how to hit the ball over the net by selecting from a wide range of moves, some of which may be unique to the character each has chosen.  Lobs, smashes, and cross-court shots are among the options.Mario Tennis 64 taps the controlled challenge of real-life tennis, and intertwines light-hearted graphics with good game play.  A 2000 Parents' Choice&#174; Approved winner.Reviewed by Jason R. Rich, Parents' Choice&#174; 2000--FromParents' Choice&#174;","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Ace","reviewText":"When Nintendo stopped making games for their Nintendo 64, many people seemed to balme it on the Playstation 2. Ironically there are many video games that were still worth the price. For the good games, like Mario Tennis, it does suit that field just fine. The game features 14 different characters to serve up your life, including Mario and his brother Luigi, Yoshi, Bowser and Peach, Princess Toadstool for those die hard Mario Brothers fans. The game also features amazing details of games including skilled ring games, and tournaments and hidden courses with zany Mario themes.Although many people still don't give sanction to cartridge games anymore, unless they are on Game Boy Advance, Mario Tennis is dull for a one-player game, but a smash for four.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00004U1R3","description":"Paper Mariohas a 2-D look in a 3-D game world--an aesthetic designed to make players feel as if they've entered an animated pop-up book. A stationary camera helps reinforce this storybook illusion. The game's title is taken from the paper-thin characters inhabiting the Mushroom Kingdom. For example, when Mario is sleeping, he flips and flutters through the air like a leaf falling from a tree.Paper Mariois the sequel to the classic Super NES role-playing gameSuper Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. Like the original, it contains a mix of turn-based battles and intricate puzzles, as well as timed attacks. Players time their attacks by moving the D-pad and pressing the A button at exactly the right moment to inflict maximum damage. This seasonsPaper Mariowith a little action/adventure flavor. Classic characters, such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, and Toad, are joined by the likes of Goombario and Kammy Koopa.","reviewerName":"Mark E. Valenti \"FireMarioGalaxy64\"","summary":"Very fun game","reviewText":"Paper Mario is a fun game because it's got great battles, a good storyline, and a lot of replay value. The graphics and sound fit the game well. Mario gets a variety of Partners that help him on his adventure. There are a lot of secrets to find inthis game too. I rate this game 93/100.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002MED6EO","description":"Midnight Club: Hits PS3","reviewerName":"hammodi","summary":"Just awful","reviewText":"I gave this game 1 star because Rockstar always makes almost near perfect games. GTA, RDR. and other games. but this. this didn't change anything about racing games and why they'll never be a big thing if they kept going this track. it really didn't change anything. and the way this game is. made it worse. here is why.1) Opponents do 90 turns at max SPEEDS. and without slowing down and they never fail at it. ofcourse. you see that at almost all racing games2) Opponents will not stop or lose control on their car even if they hit a car. while your car will go off control and start doing 360 turns when you hit another car3) the ending of every game is filled with spots to hit, walls, cars. sometimes cars drive from the side for no reason and you'd get hit4) as an open-world racer. lol. too many cars. its almost impossible to not get hit. while enemies. never hit cars. absolutely never even at max speeds unless you try to tackle them with your car to hit a car. and nothing happens there. the other car flies off and nothing will happen5) trying to push off the opponents car with yours is almost like trying to push off a tank. it won't move6) at the end of the race. you will see the opponents driving past you so fast. so fast. its like they're at 600 miles per hour7) just like other racing games. only 1 opponent beats you. the others are slow and let you take the 2nd spot. always . either first or second unless your terrible.8) upgrades are useless. its costs more to upgrade then buy a new car that is better than your car with upgrades which make this FUTILE.9) escaping from police is impossible. yes. it is impossible. Today. I was chased twice from the police. one time. I was driving around the city and being chased by the police for TWO HOURS. two hours. until i just gave up and let them fine me.10) you get so little money. I am getting something like 300 dollars. SERIOUSLY. 300 dollars if I win or lose (you get a little less) and you have to repair your car. really.11) control delay. there is a slight delay. I'd say about 0.1-0.2 seconds that it takes for your controls to work. even tho this doesn't sound much. it is. it is essential for accurate control in a high speed racing game around a city and USUALLY ON A HIGHWAY WITH 200 CARS AROUND YOU.12). getting hit. even if your car touches something else by 1 centimeter makes you go turn 360 flips . I said that before but its fraustrating.13) other cars get to burn rubber before races. while you don't makes you ALWAYS. every single time start off the last. every single time.14) too many cars in the street. I understand its an open world racing game. but its too fast to try to avoid 23 cars right in-front of you. hundreds through the whole race. how am I suppose to do that?.15) the game uses checkpoint race system. means there are points on the street that you have to GO THROUGH TO WIN. some of them are outside of the mini map. and you just don't know if the road is going to lead there or not. makes it so CONFUSING.16) your only chance at winning is by racing through a straight street. no turns. because opponents are slow even if they're driving with a Ferrari and your driving an old chevy. They probably did that to give you a chance. but even with that. after the first few races. its almost impossible to win races.17) the city your at is so boring. just cars moving around. the while atmosphere is the same. no different areas. just large streets and large buildings. very bland and nothing special about the enviroment.18) using breaks for acute turns sends your car sliding until you hit a wall. hopefully. even if you tap the breaks for a second. or hold the button .you go off controls anyways.19) opponents drive around the city. to start a race. you have to drive all the way through. and about 99% of the time. they're on the highway. driving so fast makes it hard to catch up. and you will usually get caught by the police before you even start the race20) all races are in the north-east side of the map. which i really don't know why. and if you highlight one to go to. it shows you a point on your mini map. no highlighted route. there are no highlighted routes in this game. makes it frustrating to go there.21) Some upgrades are COMPLETELY POINTLESS. they should add speed or control. but they don't do anything.22) there are different car pieces brands. which is stupid because they're all the same.and here is why this game is just an average racer. you will say why did I give it 2 stars. BECAUSE ITS ROCKSTAR. they make good games. this is not Rockstar. this is something else.23) A.I knows all shortcuts. and shorter roads.24) Races are designed so YOU CRASH AT THE END. YEAHH. just 10 seconds before the END. every single time. you get to the point where you just have to go max SPEED to beat your opponent before the end. use Nitro and all that because you have to. the enemy will double its speeds at the end for no obvious reason. and you will crash at the end because the road before the end is RIDDLED with obstacles. its virtually impossible to turn on max speeds and not lose. one of two will happen. either you will crash into a wall sideways. and THE CAR WILL ROLL. HOW? IDK its against physics. or . Crash into an object because there is many of them25)few game mechanics work and not work whenever they want to. for example there is a powerup ability which let you choose of 4 power ups. they don't work when the meter goes full. sometimes they do sometimes they don't, and there is a boost meter. goes up and down for NO REASON. and sometimes it tells you to use it but when you click. it uses the nito because they're in the same BUTTONUPDATE.this is the most frustrating game I've ever put my hands on. this is basically. win the race until your 50 ft from the end. and then there are almost inevitable obstacles that you will hit and you will lose. every single time.playing this game is gambling. I just played a pinkslip mission. which i basically had to play because everything else was impossible to win and i will tell you why later. so a pinkslip race means that you get your opponents car if you win. or the other way if you lose. so i had a 28k car with about 20k worth of upgrades. and i was winning the race. and ofcourse i crashed about 3 seconds away from the finish line just like every other time. and i lost. i had a cheap 4k car. and i was sick of the game. i quit the game and took it out of the try and threw it away to collect dust. won't play this anymore. now why was everything else impossible. hmm. well. when you upgrade your car. the difficulty increases. exponentially. the opponents turned from hard to beat to practically impossible to beat. haven't won a single race since i upgraded my car from Class C to B. that makes the joy of having a great car futile. whats the point of buying better cars and upgrading them if your going to make the game EVEN HARDER? whats the point Rockstar. what is IT??????. this is a waste of money and more importantly. time. please stay away or you will regret this when its too late.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2014"}
