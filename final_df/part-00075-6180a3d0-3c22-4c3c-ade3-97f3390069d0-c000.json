David Swan","summary":"Mario Kart rediscovers the fun","reviewText":"My personal opinion is that the N64 Mario Kart was the apex of the series (until now). Double Dash had much better graphics but was a letdown in so many ways. First they got rid of my all time favorite weapon, the triple shells. Jumping was removed and the battle mode arenas were simply awful. My favorite part of battle mode was sending shells off the second or third tier and letting them bounce around like crazy to my opponents' dismay. Nintendo removed multi-tier arenas and made shells shatter after one bounce. It was as if Nintendo researched exactly what it was about Mario Kart that I loved... and removed it.With the DS version of Mario Kart all is forgiven. Triple shells and jumps are back and the battle mode arenas are vastly improved. I also discovered that the directional pad controls just as well as the analog stick and power slides are a breeze to pull off. There are 32 unique tracks with 16 retro tracks and 16 brand new. The retro tracks are taken from the four previous version of MK including NES, N64, GCN and GBA. Most tracks are completed overhauled and upgraded for the power of the DS while the GCN tracks are reduced somewhat. The all new tracks are terrific with a lot more moving environments than in older MK tracks. There are a few new weapons, the most unique being a blooper that sprays ink on the screen to obscure the drivers view. Although the touch screen is unused the map on the second screen is a tremendous help for a lot of different reasons.The biggest addition to the game is internet connectivity which I haven't had a chance to try out. The other addition is a series of missions that actually add little to the game except for perhaps honing your driving skills. Players can also play battle mode against Bots if that's what you want to do. It's really not too much fun without a human opponent.Mario Kart was pushed back nearly a year and the extra time shows in the quality of the product. This is a well polished piece of software that delivers a stellar Kart experience. If you're reading reviews to decide whether the game is worth it STOP and get the game. You're only wasting valuable playtime. Now I just need to find some free WiFi hotspots.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2005"}

Seems like they can't do great things any more.This is basically just Borderlands and Fallout 3/New Vegas done in a slightly different way, only not as well and way too late.The game is not horrible, just kind of empty and lackluster.PROs -INVENTORY - Simple, easy inventory. No 'weight limit' baloney!ENEMIES - Some new creeps with some OK moves to dodge me.WEAPONS - A new idea called a Wing Stick. Essentially a boomerang. Kind of fun.WEAPONS - You get a sniper rifle early in the game!ROBOTS - Having turrets or bots to assist your battles was great fun and I felt this should be done again in future games.CONs -RAGE = LAME CORRIDOR SHOOTER - This is an old school gaming term that means you cannot really go where you want and have few options with how to fight the enemy. Take some cover or fight head on. Nothing creative or cutting edge about that. id/Bethesda phoned it in big time.ENVIRONMENT - It is completely non-destructible.  No breaking down walls or smashing through doors to gain an edge or explore. No shooting ceilings or large objects to make them crumble, then fall upon the enemy for a crush kill.RACES - Lots of races attempt to fill up the lack of game substance.RACES 2 - Once you have enough credits for vehicle upgrades, there is no incentive to race any more.RECYCLING - You wind up repeating a lot of levels for meager reasons!WEAPONS - The sniper rifle is ALMOST the ONLY weapon you really need. I found I could advance slowly, engaging a few enemies at a time and do head shots without even getting touched or being at risk.WEAPONS AGAIN - You don't get the best weapon (Authority Pulse Cannon)until the very end. This might be good thing though, since the enemy AI and battles were not that tough even on the hardest setting.WHIMPY WEAPONS - A few weapons and a few meager upgrades for them....YAWN!!!!!!!!!!!VISUALS - Poorly done graphics on a supposed 'cutting edge' gaming engine.VISUALS 2 - This has the identical cartoon/cell look of Borderlands.VISUALS 3 - This looks identical to Fallout 3/New Vegas.ENEMIES - Crappy AI. Easy to beat on the hardest settings.OUTER MAP - There is no map for you for the wasteland. I WANT A MAP I CAN PUT WAY POINTS ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!INNER MAP - There is no map in the villages to show you locations or guide you.MISSION MAP - There is no indicator or guide as to who is offering missions. So, out of fear of missing everything, you have to drag yourself all over town regularly talking with every character to see if they are offering a mission, 99% of the time there is nothing. Thanks id!INCENTIVE - There is very little incentive to explore the outside world. Therefore, this makes the game linear. There are a few flowers to collect. Hoopity do!VENDORS - I find it annoying that I cannot just walk up and purchase. They have to say something first to you and when they are done, you can interact. Petty complaint but annoying nonetheless!BAD DLC - Did you play the 'sewer missions'? If not, you did not miss anything. If you did, can you even remember them? No, you can't because there was NOTHING interesting or worthwhile about them. First, you have to find them. This was not fun, it was just annoying. Once you clear them there will be jobs on the board asking you to go back (more recycling of levels...YAWN) and clean them out of all mutants. The problem is, this time there is even less challenge, fewer enemies, no extra treasure or goodies that make it worth going back and doing it!BAD ENDING - The ending is just that...an ending. It felt rushed, unplanned and you don't even have any real good battles! You fight off some teched-up muties and then it ends. No big bosses, nothing you did not fight already. The game just ends. The critics slammed the game for it's bad ending and now that I experienced it, I agree. In like a wimpy lion, out like a diseased kitten.WOLFENSTEIN 3D - Overall, I felt like I was playing a game that should have been released 10 years ago. Then it would have been impressive.I could think of another 5 or 6 more CONs, but I think I have made my point.id is what I grew up on! Wolfenstein 3D on floppy disks delivered via the mail! id is like a family member, but now Thanksgiving is coming and I am not sure if I want to invite id to the table this year!Really good DLC might just save this game if they release something with new weapons and enough substance and challenge to it to motivate you to play it some more. Though, with Borderlands 2, coming....and with Battlefield 3 and COD:MW3 and Skyrim all within 30 days of being released, I doubt most gamers will care.Mostly, this game just made me nostalgic for Borderlands. My only solace is that Borderlands 2 is coming and they will show id how it is done, because RAGE just does not deliver!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SVGU0","description":"Mario Party 9","reviewerName":"R. McAdams","summary":"5 stars for children under 10, 1 or 2 stars for adult players. Your mileage may vary.","reviewText":"So,... we playedMario Party 9this last Saturday. My family is a strong proponent for the Mario Party games. We have been addicted to the series sinceMario Party 4came out on the GameCube, and we even went out and boughtMario Party 2&Mario Party 3for the 64 after the fact. We lovedMario Party 8, and have been waiting for an update, ever since. After playing Mario Party 9, though, I have to say that the adult players were disappointed.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR THE IMPATIENT ^_^:PROS:-Still fun (for all ages).-Some genuine gems in the mini-games you shouldn't miss, if you are a fan of the series-Kids will love it, and young kids can play fairly well on their own (your mileage may vary)-Bright, colorful, cheerful-Easy to play, quality game (no bugs, no glitches, quality Nintendo software)-Cooperative play (for kids)CONS:-Strategy elements pretty much gone (will disappoint long-time, adult fans)-Game controls for motion still lacking (also, no motion plus offered, or required)-Only one trip through the board, on rails, very little control for the player-Limited customization options for the game type you wish to play-Limited number of mini-games played per each game session (they obviously wanted to speed up the time it takes to play a session)-Forced cooperation (for adults [yes, I listed this twice, once as a positive for kids, and here again as a negative for adults])----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We played 2 copies of the game over the weekend in a tournament (THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!!!) setup, since there were 6 of us wanting to play.  And, what I can say after playing it, is that this version of the game has been strongly redesigned to be kid friendly. If you have children under the age of 10 who want to play, this will be a 5 star game for them, the 3 year-old (almost 4) we had playing with us confirmed this.However, if you are an adult player, especially if you are a long time fan of the series, if you are not playing for the sake of a child, you will at best be bored with the game, if not actually frustrated.  This version of the game has removed pretty much all of the strategy elements, and it actually forces cooperation in various ways.  The first, most shocking change, is that players are no longer free to move around the board as they choose.  Every single board we played (and we played all of the boards that come unlocked with the game as new) was the same setup: all players ride together in a car themed for the level (a boat, a mine-cart, a gadget-gizmo, etc.) and take turns being the \"team captain.\"  When your character is the captain, you roll the dice, and ... that is about it.  Even decisions like which branch in the road to take are put up to a vote.  If there is a reward on the board when you are captain, and you land on it, you get it -- same goes for penalties.The strategy of which path to take, and what items to use, and when, are all gone. You cannot affect the board (or other players) in any meaningful way. The only items you can get are dice blocks, which can either roll slow or have only certain numbers on them, etc. Additionally, the stars are just scattered around on the board now, instead of in one place.  You can get anywhere from 3-10 stars at a time, depending on the board, and what stage of the game you are in. They are referred to as \"mini-stars\" but they are the only stars in this version of the game (that we saw), and what is being competed for.Additionally, they have taken away the ability to set how long the game will last (the game is estimated in time based on the board chosen, as the number of rounds is fixed by the time to complete the board -- you do not go around and around the board until the rounds are up. Instead, you make ONE trip through the board, together with your group, in your shared car you all ride in.  You can control whether bonus stars are on, and whether you have a computer player in your group, etc.The final nail in the coffin for adult players, is the lack of mini games to play during a play session.  Instead of having a mini-game at the end of each round, with additional games scattered into the play experience for special powers, and spaces -- the game now only presents a mini-game to be played when a mini-game space has been landed on by the car your entire group is in -- or when your group reaches a stopping point with a predetermined \"boss\" mini-game.  More often than not, your entire group will be tasked with battling a \"boss\" creature in the mini-game, together. Your group will still be competing for points, and stars, but with the shared goal of beating the boss together. (Very kid friendly, but very frustrating for adult players used to the previous versions of this game).Finally, we were all surprised that the game plays very similarly toMario Party 8, in that there is still very limited support for motion controlled games.  The game, like version 8, is still relying on holding thewii-motesideways and using it like a standard controller much of the time. The game doesn't use (or offer) \"Motion Plus\" or even thewii-nunchuk-- just like with version 8, it is all still done with thewii-motealone.The game has obviously been reconfigured to match more with player needs and expectations of the very young, instead of adult players. I ended up donating my copy of the game to a family with a young child, as they will enjoy it, whereas after one play-through, I had no interest in playing it again.5 stars if you have young children to play with.1 or 2 stars if you are an adult player who wishes to play with other adults.3 or 4 stars, if you fall anywhere between those extremes.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2012"}

I had previously given this game 3 stars just because I've been a huge fan of the &#34;Battlefield&#34; series especially with both Bad Company games and Battlefield 3 from 2011. I was very excited for &#34;Battlefield 4&#34; since I was still playing the multiplayer of it's predecessor &#34;Battlefield 3&#34; long after finishing the campaign mode of that very game. Since I was excited for BF4, I was hoping for another great addition to the franchise.Sadly, now that months have gone since the original game came out, and there are so many technical problems with the entire game, that couldn't be any farther from the truth. I had previous defended this game for a while as I had enjoyed it despite the technical issues that had surrounded it.However, thanks to some 'patches' and DLC issues, the games functionality has now deteriorated to the point that it now actually freezes up the entire console to where I had to restart the entire system as many as six times in a single day. I don't know what on Earth is going on at EA, DICE, or whatever companies were involved in the production and release of &#34;Battlefield 4&#34; but this game's glitches and terrible lag issues have now been compounded to the point that they are now virtually irreparable and killed anything that I previously liked with the game.First off, the graphics take way too long to load up. I found myself having to wait in order for the graphics to load up right as the iron sights on the respective weapons were nothing more than 'opaque plates' that blocked the view of the target enemy players. But that's not the worst of the issues. At least when it finally loads up, I can actually play the game and have a good time. Right?WRONG! Beyond just that, the game engine's are so messed up. I've lost track of how many times I've aimed the damn gun at the enemy players and the gun just will not fire, even after I pressed the button. Then there's the problem of no hit-markers. I can't tell you how much this has just about ruined the entire game experience.The campaign version has beautiful graphics but the damn game will not save over and if you turn off the console or switch to multiplayer, the campaign mode has to be completely restarted. This literally puts entire weapon categories out of the question. There is NO excuse for this kind of glitch to go on this long! NONE! I've unlocked all the weapons from the Co-Op version of BF3 and for the most part, are fun to play multiplayer with. Yet they are out of reach due to this horrendous glitch that deletes the campaign saves. I had to restart the campaign mode at least seven times because of the saves being lost. I finally simply gave up on the campaign mode. This was the first time I ever truly gave up on a campaign mode of a video game in over 15 years.Finally, and likely the two most inexcusable glitches that have turned BF4 into a horrendous pile of electronic cyber-debris is that the first is the graphics suddenly turn into a bizarre palette of psychedelic colors similar to when a camera does not work properly and all of the environments in the games servers turns into a visually-disorienting screen full of colored shapes. Even aiming down the sights, such as sniper rifles gives you an opaque shape of colors that obscure the targets. There is no excuse for this! It is 2014 and these graphics at times looks either like 2003 or earlier-quality (no offense to Battlefield 1943) or like some amateur's prototype beta that was made in someone's bedroom computer. The second, and ultimately fatal glitch is that the entire game freezes up along with the entire console, which can only be dealt with by shutting off the console and restarting. This happened as many as eight times in one day for me and finally after a second consecutive day of this happening at least six times within a single day, I have had enough of dealing with this.As I said earlier, I have no idea what on Earth is going on at EA but there was zero, I repeat, ZERO excuse for screwing up so badly on handling this game, especially a game that is part of a series as popular and loved as &#34;Battlefield&#34; is.I gave this game many chances hoping that something would be done to make this game finally worthy of my time and functional again but as mentioned earlier, too many instances of it freezing up, and potentially damaging the console's very system, has made BF4 into a gaming disaster of near-monumental proportions. Much worse than &#34;Aliens:Colonial Marines&#34; and worse than any other EA title, BF4 has left me incredibly angry and let down on all fronts. I had very high expectations for another great additions to the Battlefield saga but this game and all of it's horrible glitches has really damaged my faith in EA, DICE, and the Battlefield series. There were other games in the past that had problems but eventually were fixed and previous disasters were finally made playable. Not BF4. The game was glitchy when it came out but the problems have only gotten worse since and now after so much anguish, I'm ready just move on to other games.It pains me to say this but BF4 could just about cause greater damage to the Battlefield series than even &#34;Medal of Honor: Warfighter&#34; which I actually enjoyed, did to the &#34;Medal of Honor&#34; series over a year earlier. &#34;Medal of Honor: Warfighter&#34; did not deserve the harsh criticism it got. &#34;Battlefield 4&#34; deserves to be taken out of circulation, the entire EA/DICE house needs to be cleaned out, a fresh new crew needs to be brought in, and either &#34;Bad Company 3&#34; needs to be released or else an entirely new Battlefield spin-off series needs to be started in order to salvage this franchise as BF4 is hands down, the worst handled game I've ever dealt with and probably one of the worst games to have infected my console.I'm so angry right now, that the Battlefield series has been damaged, if not nearly killed, by such a crushing and ignominious disaster such as this. Avoid &#34;Battlefield 4&#34; and stick with BF3. Even &#34;Need for Speed: Rivals&#34;, as problematic as that was, was light years above this.Now excuse me while I go back to playing both &#34;Bad Company&#34; games and BF3 and try to erase this disaster from my console and make it a painful chapter that has finally closed in my gaming history. EA/DICE has a huge mess to clean up from.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2014"}

You must escape the doomed city or become part of a ghastly new food chain: one with you at the bottom.You play as either Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop who's having areallybad first day on the job, or Claire Redfield, sister of one of the stars of the originalResident Evil. Leon and Claire's meeting is depicted in a visually stunning, B-movie cutscene. They're quickly separated, but occasionally meet up throughout the game.Right after the gruesome intro, you're dumped into the thick of things and have to dash through the devastated city streets, fleeing from one horde of zombies after another. As you make your way to a supposed refuge--the city police station--you find evidence that the citizenry fought bravely against the undead menace--and lost. Smashed barricades, abandoned police cars, boarded-up stores, dismembered bodies, and hundreds of expended bullet shell casings are all-too-common sights. Once you reach the station, you discover the remains of a siege. The defenders' desperate final hours are recorded in a fragmented journal. Its pages detail a possible escape route through an underground passage. Did the cops make it out? The alarming number of zombies wearing tattered police uniforms may be a clue.Resident Evil 2keeps the terrific puzzles and action of the original while vastly improving cinematic qualities such as dialogue, camera angles, cutscenes, atmosphere, and location design.

Everything made me jump, now I have sort of gotten over that, I am 15 and although the music and sound(zombie moaning and feet stepping) creates this scary atmosphere, it is not THAT scary. Most of you can handle it.Anyways, I needed a strategy guide for some of it. It just, it just is unrealistic. Yea to put out a fire you need a crank in a cabin? Why was the crank removed in the first place. \"We need to make it so if there is a fire of some sort, this hose we have hooked up, will release some water.\" Yea they happened to put a handy dandy hose thingy in the ceiling, so just incase a helicopter crashed under it, or there was a mass fire under it, the hose would put it out. Yea right. Ok you need a cord just to close some shutters so zombies won't attack you? If the police were fighting, they should of closed these shutters beforehand, so less zombies came in. Instead, they decided to put the cord in an office about a mile away. Wanna get into that room? You need the crest and key and plugs buddy! How did the police actually get around this police station.Moving off of that, the game is alright. You have alot of ammo on easy, although I fear I will run out alot of the time, I usually find a pack or 2 to keep me going. The zombies themselves can take quite alot, like 5 hits to kill them. However once you get the pistol modification for Leon, they become a whole lot easier. The story is nice. 2 people trying to escape a city full of undead living thingy creatures and such. Theres alot of other characters though, you aren't the last 2 humans alive in the city. The game even though was known to have a sequel considering tremendous profits, finishes great. It starts randomly, but then ends where it should. It succeeds in making a good game. Good story, some action, you get to kill some of those evil zombies, and good package.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2003"}

Your actions define your character, and your gameplay changes and evolves in response to your actions. Confront the assassins' guild, and they take out a contract on you; impress them, and they try to recruit you instead. No two sagas are the same in the world of Morrowind.Players can choose to follow the intriguing main story line or set off to explore the province of Morrowind and the many interesting people and exotic locations it contains. Vast cities and remote villages dot the landscape, each with its own unique look and feel. Hundreds of quests and adventures await as you interact with characters and learn more. Regardless of whether you play a murdering assassin or a noble knight, the game holds endless possibilities and allows you to revisit the main story line at any time.With Morrowind, the Elder Scrolls character system is coupled with an increase in the world's richness of detail. Utilizing advanced 3-D technology, Morrowind features hyperrealistic textures and polygon counts, real-time shadows, vast landscapes, skeletal-based animation, and a complete weather system. Gameplay is further extended with the inclusion of The Elder Scrolls Construction Set, which allows players to modify and add to Morrowind in any way they see fit.

Morrowind, the third chapter in the Elder Scrolls saga, has proven to be one of the biggest PC let-downs in history. The game is a definitive example of what happens when endless opportunities meet horrible gameplay. By endless opportunities I mean that our good friends at Bethesda Softworks spent countless hours developing an amazingly beautiful and immersive 3d world...one in which you can go anywhere and do almost anything.-Open ended, epic world and events. - Though I did also say horrible gameplay...and Morrowind suffers immeasurably from just that. The fighting system is agonizingly weak. Unless you have a great weapon and awesome abilities with that weapon, you're going to spend a great deal of time getting [beat] by some of the games lowliest creatures.  Also - There are so many spells and enchantments to use that it gets overwhelming trying to remember what does what and how to use it. Not only are the spells too many, but the interface with which to use them is cumbersome and annoying as well. You get stuck in these skirmishes, and you're struggling to attack and switch spells at the same time while your enemy(impossible to outrun) beats you down with little effort. _ Like I said, the world is very beautiful and the characters are amazingly detailed, but all this is lost as the game tries to run before it can walk.  I'm sure geeks with nothing to do with their lives will have a fun time modding this one to death and spending every hour playing it until their character can stand up to the game's foes.  But for the rest of us, crap on that. - - In short, Morrowind's designers tried to stuff 5 pounds worth of greatness into an 11 ounce box.** Too much at once for any gamer who doesn't think an aggravation induced stroke should be part of epic fantasy gameplaying. - Buy at your own risk.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2003"}

The graphics for 2 are above par even for Sony studios despite no Anti-Aliasing for jaggies and the games have a fairly good story that is developed more in the second one. Both of these will hit 20 dollars in no time at all so I am giving 5 stars as they make a great piece of work to have on one disc. I would say I like them both about the same with some things better in 2, namely the powers and missions and overall gameplay, but I prefer some aspects of the design of the more vertical city in the first one. The first is also a little rougher than the second but you really cannot go wrong here. I just wish the jaggies are going to be cleaned up for the 3 with some post processing AA that Sony teams are now using.

{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"AWGamer11","summary":"Finally they didn't ruin it!","reviewText":"When sequels come out to awesome games often times the publisher tries to alter the game to make it seem like people are buying something \"new\" versus an expansion pack. This sometimes results in uncomfortable gameplay and people putting the old game in after  few hours of playing the new version. This could have been the case for Call of Duty 5 World At War. However the publishers KNEW that the controls, game play, systems that were in COD4 were a huge hit...so they left the game mostly the same, just changing the era (world war II vs modern). The maps are  a bit larger (more like Battlefield series) with incredible detail. The WWII maps provide plenty more places to move around in, and the drivable tanks are a ton of fun to drive. The \"create a class\" is similar, most of the perks from COD4 are in this game with the addition of new ones, and the ranking system is similar. The weapons are WWII era, so they aren't as advanced, but as you rank up you once again unlock better weapons. The multiplayer setup is similar with the ability to choose what type of game you enjoy most and matches you up and gets you in a game just as quickly as COD4. The single player is excellent though I haven't spent enough time on it to get a real feel, but it seems like it's well done.Overall I would sum the game up by saying it's a very COD4 like game with some improvements and set in WWII maps.

This game is far beyond inventive when it comes to looks. And most all of the gameplay mechanics are solid as well. One of this game's best features is also its worst though. I'm talking about the difficulty of course. You can't die. And that's wonderful if you're playing with a gamer who isn't very skilled at platforming or if you're just playing with a young child. The game attempts to make up for this by challenging you with bead collecting in order to earn secrets stages, etc. When you get hit, you lose coins. So the idea is to not get hit if you're going for the real meat and potatoes of the game. And it's a decent challenge overall. It's just that the rest of the game is so easy that one would hope for a real challenge (the likes of which you find in New Super Mario Bros and Donkey Kong Country Returns). You also collect treasures which are used to decorate Kirby's pad. Most Wii games suffer from the same collecting failure. What I mean is that players are not given any real incentive to attempt the real collecting challenges of the game. The end payoff just feels pointless. There are also a power mechanic or two amidst the mostly amazing powerups that only feel half-realized (such as the drawing of train tracks when Kirby turns into a train). Still, this is a great platformer and a must-own Wii game. Casual gamers and art lovers will say this is one of the best and, in more ways than one, they're right.

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"DB \"aspiring part time free lance consultant\"","summary":"Live and breath the Star Wars universe!","reviewText":"No other Star Wars game makes you feel a part of the Star Wars universe better than KOTOR.

However, this is not the controller that I wish Nintendo would make. Be that as it may, I have to review this controller for what it is. For the sake of reference, I own all three modern game consoles and can compare controllers with each other.The controller currently comes in either white or black. The black controller is actually that piano black glossy style that tends to be a fingerprint collector. The most obvious change is that Nintendo added a couple of curved grips on either side of the controller that strongly resemble those found on PlayStation controllers. The ZL and ZR buttons went from tiny nubs to full fledged shoulder buttons and are now purely digital as opposed to the low quality analog from the previous Classic Controller. The analog sticks are spaced a bit further apart and some people claim that this leads to less thumb clash. I wouldn't go that far, my thumbs can easily come into contact with each other on this controller but to be fair the sticks are further apart than they are on the PS3 controller. For some odd reason, it seems that Microsoft was the only one to get it right when it comes down to placement of the two analog sticks.The Classic Controller Pro is not a truly wireless controller because you still have to plug it into the Wii Remote. For a $19.99 price tag, I wasn't expecting much in that regard. It actually feels great in my hands. The four shoulder buttons and the four face buttons are easy to access and the analog sticks have a nice feel to them. I don't like how closely spaced the Select, Start and Home buttons are on this controller. The face of the controller is still essentially the same bean shape as the previous controller but now you have those grips instead of wrapping your hands around that bean shape which I always felt was a bit uncomfortable.While the Classic Controller Pro is larger than the PS3 controller, it is noticeably lighter and weighs far less than the Xbox 360 controller. I personally like a bit more heft to my controllers but that is an individual preference. What really matters is how well the controller works during gameplay. I would say that the controller meets my expectations. I played Gate of Thunder, Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Super Mario 64 and had no problems switching weapons or executing precision jumping that is needed for Mario games. As it happens, my tournament fighting games are on the Xbox 360 so I won't comment on the D-pad and how easy it is to perform special moves with it. Given the fact that there are only four buttons on the face, I don't think that Street Fighter fans would be particularly happy with this controller anyways.All in all, I'd say that the Classic Controller Pro is worth the money though I wish that Nintendo would have made a truly wireless controller with rumble.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001CM62UM","description":"Thanks to Square-Enix, the original Star Ocean has finally made it to the United States in the form of Star Ocean: First Departure. A PSP remake of Star Ocean, which was never released in the U.S., First Departure adds several new elements, including all new backgrounds and a tweaked battle system, while still preserving the exciting storyline and themes of the original.Star Ocean: First Departure has been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes.View larger.Enter battle with basic melee attacks, special arts, or spellsView larger.In battle, you can control a character while the AI handles your teammates.View larger.Back to the BeginningIt is Space Date 346, and in a sleepy town on the planet Roak, defense-force members Roddick, Millie, and Dorn are on yet another dull patrol when a mysterious plague begins turning people to stone. Fortunately, Ronyx and Ilia, members of a Terran Alliance reconnaissance mission, beam down to the surface just in time. They explain that the plague is actually a biological weapon, and they take the defense-force to the space vessel to discuss how to save Roak from this mysterious attack.The majority of this role-playing game (RPG) actually takes place in the past, because the party realizes that the only way to save the people of Roak is to collect a particular genetic sample from the Roak of old. The game play of First Departure is fairly traditional RPG that has you moving about the world map on your journey, traversing towns and dungeons, progressing the plot as you go.Choose the Right StrategyYou enter battle either using basic melee attacks, special arts that require MP points and that can grow more powerful with use, or spells that also require MP points but take time to cast and can be interrupted before completion.Tactics let you set strategy commands for your characters before they enter battle and can be changed in the middle of battle. All characters will fight according to their set strategy, with different situations requiring different strategies.Private actions are sometimes offered as a character approaches a town on the world map. These private actions depend on timing as well as which characters you have with you as you enter town.. The outcome of these private actions will affect subsequent private actions, for better or worse.All New Artwork and New CharactersStar Ocean: First Departure uses a slightly altered version of the engine used for Star Ocean: The Second Story, but with many similar features. However, the pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D battle fields have been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes, and new playable characters have been added.First Departure has been given a much more dynamic battle system, letting you control a character while the AI handles your teammates. During battle, characters can move freely about the field, executing normal attacks with the X button, and performing special attacks with the L or R triggers. What's more, you can switch characters at any time with a quick press of the Circle button.First Departure also features an item creation system that lets you create new weapons and items to help you in battle, and an extensive skill system for developing your character as you play. You can boost certain party attributes, spending SP on skills to increase your fighters' speed in battle, for example, or spend points that develop your item creation ability and raise your character's strength.","reviewerName":"RPGee Wiz \"MondoJohnny\"","summary":"Take off for the first time, again!","reviewText":"For many the Star Ocean for the PS provided a brand new role playing experience! It was vast, it was fast paced, it was complex, it had a guy with dragons attached to his back... the list goes on. I can remember the first time I played this game. I went through all the dialogue in the beginning and talked, and walked and shopped like you do. Finally I was set upon by some brown cowled ruffians with wicked scimitars and black hearts. I took a deep breath clutched my starter long sword with all my level 1 might and proceeded to have the living crap kicked out of me. What? These enemies aren't waiting their turn? Just what the heck is this?Flash forward a month later. Claude the almighty stands beside the defeated body of the biggest threat the universe has ever known. All is well... Or it should have been! It was around this time that I first was told that Star Ocean as I knew it was actually the sequel to a popular Japanese Rpg! As the horror of what i had done gripped me, i realized that the space time continuum would soon collapse if i did not quickly gain access to and complete the first game!This is a typical tale for us American RPG maniacs. I myself like to play a series from the beginning even if its outdated or the stories are not contingent on each other! I just like to see the progression. Finally my beloved PSP affords me that chance! I ripped into this game like a giant ravenous alien bunny!Graphics: They look just like the one from PS! Awesome! From what I understand the game was overhauled, but instead of force feeding me some feeble attempt at 3d they just kept it nice and simple. I like that. I'm a simple kinda guy. The game has sort of a top down view that many RPG fans are familiar with. The graphics are really not amazing, but are distinct enough and don't hurt your eyes. In order to make characters personalities come across better the creators have even put character portraits in place that change slightly with the mood of the character which to me is a great idea. It helps quite a bit, and I think it is a fine alternative to having full on voice acted cinemas.Sound:Star Ocean has some great sound. Or at least the second one did. I can't say how much of the sound in this version is original. I can however say that what is in this version of the game is great. Its totally on par with the sequel and veterans may hear a few familiar tunes here and there.The main characters are all voice acted as well, and there is a large amount of spoken dialogue in the game. In this case its a good thing. All the characters have voices that work well with their personalities. The main character sounds a bit wimpy, but he is a bit wimpy so it works. The character Ronyx Kenny (Who may be familiar to fans of the PS classic.) is particularly well voiced.Characters and Plot:Its good. Just like the sequel there are lots of interesting people to meet and more than a few will join up with you. Also like the other, is the fact that you must make a few tough choices as to who to recruit. You only have 8 character slots, and at least four are claimed, so that means you have to leave some characters behind for the adventure. It is no complaint to say that this choice is hard, because most all the characters are interesting, and would make a fine addition to the party.The plot itself is fairly similar to the sequel, if a little more basic. You are after the Demon Lord, but along the way you discover that things may not be exactly as you thought. The blend of Sci Fi and Fantasy is seamless and well played. Ronyx Kenny the father of the character in the sequel is a main character in this game, and so is Claude's mom. Its fun to play these characters, and actually its more fun playing this after playing the sequel.The character interaction is once again moved forward through the use of Private Actions or PAs. These are a huge part of the game, often allowing players to view humorous or romantic exchanges between the various main characters.The plot does seem to be just slightly blander than the other one, but only just and its still a great game for what its worth.Gameplay:The game play is exactly the same as the PS sequel! If you loved that one, you will love this one. You still have all the crafting. You still have the fully active battles. You still get a bevvy of punishing Killer moves to unleash on all the rabbits witches and weird contortionist knights you could ever want. If you have played the other one you should easily and painlessly slip into this one.The game seemed a bit easier to me than the other one. Part of that might have been the easy learning curve considering I was fully familiar with the controls, but I think for the most part it was just shorter and simpler. The last boss was no problem whatsoever for me, and I bowled him over hardly breaking a sweat. There does however seem to be a secret dungeon to explore as in the first one so perhaps there will be additional challenge.Whether or not to buy this game really comes down to a simple question. Did you like the PS one game? If you did then you certainly should pick this one up as well. If you didn't then avoid it, and if you never played the PS version, pick it up and give it a try. Just be aware that the graphics are PS caliber. Really though if you are an RPG fan this shouldn't bother you at all.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2010"}

The game is themed with soccer through Nintendo's uniqueness without any loss. In the game, you can choose your captain from Mario or Luigi, to characters like Donkey Kong and Yoshi. The game also features methods of tricking your opponents from scoring a goal with weapons like the koopa shells, electric fences, and banana peels, similar to Mario Power Tennis. The control is a bit complex at first, but it is very easy to pick up with a little practice, and the graphics are really superb for anybody who loves to score a goal. The game also includes some terrific mini-games to help you score and control your characters.All in all, Super Mario Strikers is a well-recognized soccer game for anybody who owns the Nintendo Gamecube.

If I had paid more than $5 I would've felt ripped off.  At first it's relaxing and enjoyable.  The environment is beautiful, the combat is simple, the story draws me in... I'm having fun.  After that first hour or so it goes downhill.  The NPC interactions are the dumbest I've ever seen.  The main story is good, but really short, and every side quest feels like like pointless grinding.  To make the grinding worse, the navigation is really frustrating.  There's no minimap and the menu map is useless.  There's a line to follow to your objective which frequently glitches out for no apparent reason.  The ending feels anticlimactic.  There's no replay value.  The co-op is pointless because it's just one person joining another person's game grinding away at the same campaign.  There's also a stupid butler constantly reminding you that there's DLC to buy.  On the bright side, the environment is really beautiful.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0012N3ZXS","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Online play saves this game from Seth and cheap AI","reviewText":"Street Fighter 2 was and still is my favorite fighting game of all time.  And while I wasn't as excited as some about SF4, I was very eager to play it whenever I could get my hands on a copy at the local video store.  This past Friday they had both the 360 and PS3 version in stock so I decided to try the 360 version first...Starting the game for the first time you will have access to the 12 original characters from Street Fighter 2 as well as four completely new ones (some admittedly uninspired).  As you complete the game with different characters you can unlock additional characters.  However unlocking certain characters like Akuma, require a bit more than just beating the game but I won't get into that here.Personally I have no problem with the anime theme that seems to be the style Capcom was aiming for in their presentation.  Fight locations are beautifully done and Capcom seemed to utilize the XBOX 360's power well.  Frame rates are silky smooth and there is no slowdown whatsoever in the action even as people in the background react to the fight at hand.  The characters themselves are also done very well and quite detailed in their uniforms as well as facial expressions.  I also like the background music though it's not as epic or memorable as the BGM on SFII.As good as the game looks the game play suffers a bit on the XBOX 360 version.  To me, it seems that the standard XBOX 360 controller does not work as well with the game as I would have liked.  I recall on the SNES version of SF2 I could pull off any special move at will, however many times I find myself having to try a motion two and three times before being able to pull it off; other times attempting to execute a move results in another move being performed.  In the heat of battle things like this mean the difference between winning and losing.  You have the option of using the D-Pad or the analogue stick to control your character, but neither offers the pinpoint accuracy needed to pull of the more complicated special moves on cue.  Most of the time, I find myself using the D-pad because the placement of it on the controller is what I am used to and it's slightly less cumbersome than the analogue stick.As far as Single Player mode goes the game offers a somewhat of a balance between being fair and challenging.  Some characters are incredibly cheap like Abel and Zangief that just continue to charge towards you and grab you all day. C. Viper is cheap as well but as someone who mastered the SNES version of SFII on the hardest difficulty (7 stars); I enjoyed the challenge of most characters despite the cheapness of others; that is until I got to Seth.Seth has virtually ruined the single player mode.  Like many game makers today, Capcom sacrificed fun for needless difficulty when creating him.  Difficult games should be still FUN, not so frustrating as to make one want to throw their controller across the room.  Seth is by far the cheapest boss in fighting game history; more so than M.Bison from the original SF2, and any cheesy boss from Mortal Kombat series.  He basically has ALL the best moves of every character and uses them relentlessly.  For example, while it takes a couple of seconds for a HUMAN player to charge Guile's Sonic Boom, Seth can miraculously throw three of these in a matter of a second.  He spams special moves all day, and can execute spinning pile drivers even while he's falling back after being kicked in the face.  If you are far from him then he will just suck you into to him and then grab you for another spinning pile driver.  To make matters worse, even when you have a clear opportunity to knock him down with a sweep, the game occasionally will momentarily render your controls unresponsive giving him ample opportunity to pile drive you AGAIN.  There are exploits you can use to beat him, but unless you are able to do them, playing against this guy is nothing but hair-pulling, controller-slamming frustration.  There are many times I just turned the game off mid fight because I had enough of his crap.  I finally beat him with Ryu and Ken (luck) by combating his cheese with cheese of my own; not fun.  Aside from looking almost as cheesy as he fights, Seth adds virtually NOTHING to the ongoing SF story and it seems Capcom added him because they had nothing better to do.For me, the only thing saving this game from being a big disappointment is the lag-free online multi-player mode.  I tried my hand at a few online matches and got my butt kicked the first few times, but unlike Seth it was a good old fashioned butt whoppin' instead of a computer assisted cheese fest.  After a while I started handing out butt whoopins' of my own and the experience was very rewarding after I got my first win.  The great thing about online play is that you NEVER know what to expect as there are potentially millions of players out there ready to fight you.In conclusion, had it not been for Seth and the cheap AI overall, I would have given this game a buy recommendation for Single Player mode alone, but since the single player mode is ruined because of these things, the only way I can honestly recommend a purchase is if you really are into online play.  My overall/fun rating is based on the average of the following:  Online: 4/5, Offline 3/3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2009"}

If a game is to be a single player, offline experience only, then it had better be huge, with plenty of replay value.  If a game is designed for online play, then it must feature a ton of modes, maps, and incentives to keep the online community coming back for more months (and sometimes even years) after release.  The amazing thing about Halo: Reach is that it has both!The single player game is solid.  The story is well crafted, and really hits great heights in the latter half.  For Halo fans who enjoy the mythology of the Halo series, this story will not dissapoint.  The gameplay is tight, and really hasn't changed since the first Halo game.  New weapons, vehicles, and armor abilities have been added (although duel wielding has been removed), but the core gameplay is still as sharp as when the first Halo wowed the world.  One new concept is teamwork, where in previous Halo games Master Chief was a lone wolf hero, in Halo: Reach you play as Noble 6, the sixth and newest member to Noble Team, an elite team of Spartan super soldiers whose job it is to protect planet Reach.  Noble 6 is your character, and you can customize everything from armor, color, emblem, and even gender.  Throughout the 15 hour campaign, you'll encounter all types of friends and foes, from the citizens who need your help evacuating from a burning city, to the fearsome Elite Covenant soldiers who are hell-bent on your demise.  The most fleshed out off all is Noble Team, all of whome have unique personalities and are brought to life with amazing facial animation and voice acting.  In addition to a fully realized world filled with believeable characters and an engaging story, the level design is the best in the series.  Halo is known for massive battlefields, and indeed that is what Halo: Reach does best.  The game also features some welcome new vehicle levels; one in particular that has you dogfighting in outer space is especially fun.  Multiple difficulty levels ensure that no matter what kind of gamer you are, you will have a good time.  Legendary mode is now harder than ever, and provides a real challange for anyone who considers themselves hardcore.  My only gripe with the campaign is that checkpoints will activate even if you're dying, and I've already had to start a level over several times because a checkpoint kept respawing me the moment as I died, making progression impossible.  Besides that little nitpick, the campaign is fantastic.Firefight, if you're not familliar with it, is Halo's survival mode, where you are placed in a single map and are tasked with fighting wave after wave of increasingly difficult enemies in an effort to rack up a high score.  It is a supliment to the single player mode that will keep you playing long after the credits have rolled.  The icing on the cake is that Firefight is fully customizable, allowing you to set every detail of a game, from what enemies appear, how much health they have, how accurate they are, to fun stuff like invincibility, invisibility, and infinite ammo.Multiplayer in Halo: Reach is the most robust I've seen in a console game yet.  Two players can play split screen through the camapign and in Firefight, and up to four players can play co-op online.  Playing 4 player co-op makes the already amazing campaign even better, and Firefight was built with 4 player in mind.  If co-op isn't your thing, and you prefer human competition to artifical intelligence, Multiplayer Matchmaking is more your speed.  Jump online and battle it out with up to 16 players in all kinds of modes ranging from simple Slayer deathmatch to Invasion, an objective based big team battle.  There are plenty of maps to play with, and even an improved Forge map editor that lets you design and edit objects on top of existing maps for an endless number of varaitions.  The best new addition to Multiplayer is the Psych Profile, that helps to match you up with like-minded players.  Like talking trash and running around lone wolf style?  You can set your prefrences up for that style.  Like polite conversation with your teammates who play to win?  Also possible.  I have found my experience online to be more enjoyable than any other online game thanks to the type of players Halo: Reach's matchmaking sets me up with.  It is the way all matchmaking should be done.Halo is the most complete package I've ever played.  An engaging single player campaign that's worth the price of admission on it's own, a robust multiplayer suite that will satisify every type of gamer, 4 player co-op support for campaign and firefight, and the ability to customize your character, firefight, multiplayer maps, and game types all work to ensure you won't get bored anytime soon.  Truly, Halo: Reach has it all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00000J9J9","description":"One of the best things about the Game Boy Color is that it's  basically an original Nintendo Entertainment System that can fit in  your pocket. What this means for gamers is that many of the great games  for the classic system are being ported to the Game Boy Color, giving  us a chance to re-play (or in some cases discover) the best game titles  from the '80s.Nintendo's ownSuper Mario Bros. Deluxeis among the first of  these conversions, and it certainly remains one of the best. Actually,  calling this game a conversion really doesn't do it justice. This  version actually contains more levels than the original game, including  the entire Japanese version and a slew of extras (such as a two-player  mode).The controls in this game are easy to grasp--even for novice gamers.  All Mario can do is jump (and shoot fireballs with the right power- ups), but it is amazing to see how much gameplay can be squeezed from  these simple actions when the controls work in direct harmony with a  player's thoughts. The only element of this game that could have been  better is that the Game Boy Color's screen isn't quite large enough to  show the entire layout of the original game screen, so players may  occasionally need to press up and down on the control pad to see some  offscreen action. While this can be distracting, it ultimately has  minimal impact on gameplay. If you are looking for the quintessential  side-scrolling platform game, you can't do much better thanSuper  Mario Bros. Deluxe.--T.

I can say without a doubt that the Kinect is an amazing technological achievement and truly pushes gaming to a whole new level. I have the Wii and love everything about the direction Nintendo pushed gaming. The Kinect, in my opinion, is the natural next step to enhance what Nintendo started, but without controls or attachments in your pockets, hands, or attached to a limb. This tech makes you and your body the controller--think of it as the closest thing you'll find as an alternative to actually being outside and exercising or participating in sports.The only issue or cause for concern is the distance you need to be from the Kinect sensor in order to get a great experience. In my opinion this is a small issue since anyone interested in Kinect and Kinect games know this is Motion Gaming--in other words, if you're buying the Kinect you know you need a decent sized space to run in place, jump, wave your hands, bend down, etc. in order to play and have fun.I look forward to using and enjoying this technological marvel for years to come and I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to have a lot of laughs, cheers, and good times with their kids, friends, spouse, and loved ones this Holiday Season.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2010"}

How easy is it to charge a Playstation Move Controller (either kind) without a docking station? Not easy, is it? It rolls around, falls on the floor, your dog eats it, then you have to clean up glowing poo in the back yard... ok, maybe not that last part, but you get the idea. And, while I had a dreamGEAR charging dock that had room for one Move Motion and one Move Navigation Controller, but since I had two Motion controllers, this posed a problem. Thus, I browsed around online and settled on the Sony Playstation Move Charging Station.ConstructionThe Sony Playstation Move Charging Station (henceforth referred to as the PMCS) is constructed from heavy-duty plastic and includes an A/C charger which plugs into the back of the unit. The two grooves have a contact at the bottom to charge the controller once it is seated within the unit.PerformanceThere is not really a lot to elaborate upon here. Simply put, the PMCS functions as it is designed to; plug it in, pop in your two controllers (note that the ports can charge both the Move Motion and Navigation controllers interchangeably), and anywhere from a half-hour to an hour later and you will have a charged (set of) controller(s) ready to go for a gaming session. With the flexibility to charge either controller in each port, you will always have whichever device that you use most often at hand!So, What's the Verdict?If you have more than one Sony Playstation Move Motion and/or Navigation Controllers, this charging dock becomes indispensable. It keeps your controllers upright and stored neatly, and can accommodate two of the same or one of each of the controllers for charging. The ultimate in simplicity, you just set the controllers in the grooves in the dock, ensure that the dock is plugged in and getting juice, and let it go!

One game that I had read about a lot prior to buying a Playstation 3 was Folklore, an RPG with a different battle system than selecting Attack or Item and a great visual style. So it naturally became one of the first few games that I played and while I'll admit the game has some pluses, the game also has its share of flaws that prevented me from being completely immersed into the experience which was disheartening because I wanted to like it but the game did things where I just couldn't.Story: You play as 2 characters: Ellen, a soft-spoken young woman who receives a letter from her mother who's supposed to be dead and wants her to come to the village of Doolin and Keats, a writer for Unknown Realms, a magazine dealing in the paranormal who receives a strange phone call requesting he come to the village as well. When the 2 meet, they become investigators into the village's past and the many mysteries that lay in its home and roads.The story is essentially a murder mystery so it's hard to tell whether the limited replay value will be an issue but my biggest concern is that in order to progress through the game, Ellen and Keats both have to finish each chapter separately which basically means going through the same paths, potentially picking up the same abilities (though slight deviations are found) and finishing the same boss fight with a different strategy than the other. On one hand it's fun to see some background into the parts where you don't see the other character or explanations for certain events, it makes the game feel a bit repetitive and also a bit slow since I couldn't bring myself to complete a chapter at a time, if that. It's intriguing sure but I didn't find it a page-turner, mainly due to the gameplay.Graphics: Folklore is a game similar to the recently-released Valkyria Chronicles or Okami where the graphics look utterly gorgeous on HDTV sets. Mainly this is due to the color palette which is sharp, incredibly vibrant and well-presented with my favorite being the ethereal Faery Forest which has an absolutely beautiful flower field halfway through. Each chapter takes place in a different realm which are also stunning from the hellish Warcadia to the tranquil Undersea Palace. It's not exactly system-pushing but it's still great to look at.Sound/Music: The music as well is especially pleasing to the hear from big orchestral scores during battles and the end-level boss to the melancholy piano playing during travels around Doolin which sounds similar to a sad freeform jazz playing. There's no real rousing tunes and the atmosphere created by the soundtrack is like a quiet evening at home with maybe some rain outside. There's some voice acting as well which is fine though it's rather infrequent and there's characters that have barely any lines to be said.Gameplay: Putting the repetitiveness of replaying the same realm twice, Folklore's main draw is the combo system which uses customizable buttons for attacking. Basically your 4 face buttons acts as a way to initiate an ability that you've mapped onto that button. Throughout the realms are what's known as \"ids\" which when absorbed gain you access to that creature's ability so some create bombing runs, shoot missiles, powerful punches or act as a shield. With plenty to choose from, it's easy to customize your skills for the most effective though there's some that frankly, are kind of useless. You can also upgrade them by either absorbing a certain amount of them, killing a certain amount of ids with them or using items found in the realms.And how do you absorb them? Well when you attack, a little blue ghost pops up but when it turns pink, you press R1 and jerk the controller upwards to \"yank\" their souls out of their bodies. They can also be combined with others showing the pink ghost for more exp though it's a little cumbersome to reposition your character so you'll get them all. There's also some enemies with special R1 tactics where one requires you to yank when it turns red, move the controller back and forth like a driving wheel to slam them into the ground while another has you position them exactly straight up for the greatest of damage. It's one of the few Sixaxis features found in PS3 games that actually has use as opposed to Ratchet and Clank's freefall or Heavenly Sword's Aftertouch system where you can use it though using the analog works better. My one problem is that the process is somewhat lengthy and trying to extract an id doesn't pause the enemies and the effect isn't cumulative so should you get hit, you have to start the whole process over from the beginning so it's best to get rid of the pesky ones before attempting it.Part of me wants to recommend Folklore since it does quite a few things right, namely the graphics and music, but the incredibly linear story progression as well as the slowness of the story itself kind of prevents this. You don't feel like this is a game you wouldn't mind if you never beat it but if you do want to make it to the end, it's kind of a long, patient affair.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"A generational review; a comparison of how bettered [sic] this next generation is.","reviewText":"First and foremost, besides the PSN being pretty well broke, I had very little issue with getting my PS4 up and going. I bought four release date games: Knack, Assassin's Creed, Killzone and Injustice. Two are original and exclusive (Knack and Killzone), the other two have Playstation 3 versions.I did not expect expect much out of the non-exclusives, and I got what I expected - in AC's defense, I'm very pleased with what they had done on previous generations, however, looking at the PS4 version, it looked like the poly-count, was improved - perhaps it was simply system level tessellation (allows you to make lower poly models look smoother). Injustice was just disappointing graphically - I'd be hard pressed to spot the differences between PS generations.As for the exclusives, I was very pleased graphically. Killzone looks fantastic, and Knack, not even a game I thought I'd care for, was pretty - and pretty fun (pretty simple too, for those who are controller challenged). So, in summary of improved graphics, and load times, so far so good - but time will tell. I expect more. I don't think it's a coincidence that both the PS3 and the PS4 versions of AC, and other cross platform titles, are the same price - there is little difference that I can tell. Oh yeah, 1080p - on my 60 inch plasma, I didn't really see it all that much. Perhaps in a side-by-side, it would be more obvious.If game potential were the only criteria for review, I'd have to give the system 4 to 5 stars. I'm happy with load times on the exclusives, and the graphics. Regardless of the lack of depth in the actual games' game-play. However, I'm looking at this system based on my ability to replace the old with the new, and here, it's only the graphical power that prevents me from giving this system a thumbs down...I used my PS3 predominately as a DLNA and Bluray player. I'm tech savvy, and so I acquire my media digital - on my own terms. Out of box, the PS4 does not support DLNA. I saw this coming, and there is potential for an update to support this, to me, necessary feature. It's a giant step back for this new system that claims to want to own the home space.So, then there was the surprise moment... The PS4 doesn't support 3D Blurays. This is a technology that Sony had been pushing very strongly. It's like a car without a cup holder, not something you'd probably notice when shopping cars, but something you definitely notice when you go to use it.The controller is almost the same, with the inclusion of the &#34;that makes sense&#34; touch-pad. I think we can look forward to better use of that area of the controller - as it stands it's a novelty. Most of the time it makes to the X button and L-stick (like in AC, where it let you navigate the map, when the map was up), some games it's used like a gimmick; yet another place to force a player to touch during &#34;quick time&#34; events (those horrible places in games where you can't just enjoy the cinema... no, you have to press a button or set of buttons instead of being able to run to the kitchen and top up your drink).The general system interface is simpler - yet I'm looking forward to the bugs being fixed. Don't dare go into the Library.I was expecting the future with the PS4, however, if you were a casual observer, you'd be hard pressed to tell which of this lineage is that - with the PS3 much more polished, and working out of box, and the features removed, or simply abandoned in this new generation, the PS3 looks like the improved system. So far, there are no leaps here - perhaps time will tell. Perhaps as more exclusives that take advantage of the hardware, we can see this generation show it's true potential. As it stands, the PS3 is still the clear winner.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2013"}

Wang \"nycmode\"","summary":"Great game, TOO SHORT!!","reviewText":"It's been echoed here by many others, but I'm also writing to back up what everyone has been saying - THIS GAME IS WAY TOO SHORT!!To be totally honest, I have the video game version of ADD.  That means, I often don't have the patience to play games like Fallout or others that require 80 or 100 hours of gameplay to get through (Oblivion being the only exception for me).  However, even for a guy with an itchy trigger finger and the attention span of a gnat - I found that this game was just way too short.It only took me like 5 hours to finish the entire game.  I wacked through everything on Hard and I found very little in the way of challenge.  Yes I did die a few times when I was thickheaded and ran into a hail of laser fire and missiles.  But otherwise, I felt the game was just way too easy.  You can easily hack through a legion of stormtroopers, AT-STs whatever.  I like how you start the game pretty much a badass and can do whatever you want, but even that got old after awhile.Part of the problem is the repetitive level design.  Every level was gorgeous and you could tell that the programmers really wanted to put a lot of detail in as a measure of respect to the Star Wars universe.  But many of the stages had a lot of (literally) carbon copy areas where you just slog through nonstop over and over again the same enemies etc.At least the game LOOKED awesome.  The graphics were pretty top notch (looking at the lightsabers whirl in the air and hearing that trademark sound never got old).  The voice acting was decent and overall it felt like you were playing a movie, which was cool.  But the story was sort of lame (kind of like a poor-man's star wars tale full of tangents and familiar names/places, rather than an original coherent story).  Even the folks from the previous game didn't get much screen time, which is a shame.In fairness, the gameplay is good.  The controls are easy to learn, and combos are easy to pull off and the moves are very satisfying.But yes, this game is short.  I don't think it justifies a full-priced purchase.  But is it worth playing?  100% definitely yes indeed.  Even though it does get repetitive, there are times when killing people with force lightning and lightsabers just is too darn fun to pass up.In short:PROS:- Amazing graphics, great voicework, familiar Star Wars music/canon/universe- GREAT combat mechanics.  The controls are tight, combos are easy to execute- Using force powers never really gets old- It's cool to do all sorts of fun things with your jedi/sith powers- Boss fights are cool- Yoda is awesomeCONS:- Ridiculously short.  The brevity ruins the value of the game by a longshot- Short gameplay = not a buy (at full price), definitely a rental at least- Levels are insanely repetitive and it gets annoying- Enemies are brain dead, easy to figure out and kill- Even kicking ass gets boring after awhile when it's too easy- Not a whole lot of replay value (you get a light/dark ending to choose from if you want to play both but that's about it, other than the lame challenges)- Needs James Earl Jones as Vader.In summary, it's worth playing despite the weak story.  But it's just too short and not worth buying at full price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2010"}

That's what Sony thought would happen back in the day.  After all, they promoted the game to death.  Well look at that... didn't happen!  And with good reason.  The game is horrible.  I can't believe ANYONE would prefer this junk over Sonic the Hedgehog or, especially, the Mario Bros. series.You have to give Sony a LOT of credit for all the attention they put into Crash Bandicoot in an attempt to put the game on the same extraordinary level as Mario and Sonic, but gamers never really caught on to Crash the same way.  When you think about it, the Playstation already HAD a huge selection of games to choose from around the time Crash was released, therefore Sony didn't even NEED a mascot.  People were buying Playstation games like crazy anyway!  Crash Bandicoot never even had to exist.You'd think for a debut game (a BIG debut, considering all the advertisements on TV commercials) Sony would have made the game a *little* easier for younger or inexperienced gamers to play.  Instead, Sony started off the Crash series with impossible bonus levels (impossible to complete AND find- I didn't even KNOW the game had bonus levels until I looked it up in the instruction booklet!)Even if you ignore the bonus levels, the challenge overall is pretty high anyway thanks to all the difficult stages (such as the one where you're crossing a bridge way up in the sky and continue falling through the wooden cracks- a NIGHTMARE of a level!)  All the lives you earned up to this point in the game will go away.  A mascot debut game shouldn't have the difficulty THIS high because the idea is for players of ALL ages to enjoy the game.  Children will not like the nonstop frustration.I think the biggest reason Crash Bandicoot isn't remembered today the same way Mario and Sonic's debut games are is because Crash is basically just a blend of Mario and Sonic, but featured in a 3D world.  Think about it.  Crash collects berries throughout the game (Mario collects coins, Sonic collects rings).  Crash has a spin attack (Mario and Sonic already had spin attacks YEARS before Crash's existence).  Sony just didn't have enough creative ideas to come up with something entirely different, and that's why most gamers tend to ignore Crash Bandicoot.  When you already have the best (Mario and Sonic) you don't need imitations.Crash Bandicoot may have improved later on (not enough of an improvement to earn its mascot reputation, however) but the series certainly did NOT start with a bang.  I will always remember the very first Crash Bandicoot game as being this uninteresting, frustrating experience.  Heck, just the fact that only 62 reviewers have submitted reviews for the game right here on amazon goes to show Crash Bandicoot's first adventure was meant to be gone and forgotten.  Add to the fact that right now in the year 2006 NO ONE is talking about ANY Crash Bandicoot game anymore.  This means you can ignore Crash Bandicoot entirely, and not really miss out on anything.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2006"}

They should be cheaper than or at least on par with dvds. $29.99 for a movie is ridiculous.it connects to the internet, and its decent looking. except for flash images, which won't even appear. you can't watch youtube videos there...lol.you can use software to rip dvds on your computer and transfer them to the psp for watching on the go. i can fit 4 movies on 1 gb card. amazing right?

If you grab the the  wrong way, they break. I have repaired them with magic tape though and they keep playing, but they could have done a better job on such expensive discs.I haven't really used the online play. I have tried it, and it seems to work alright with the WSOP game, but it drops in ATV off-rod fury game, and my lynsis is the best wireless router, so you can't blame it on my equipment. that's a server issue.overall, its a great game console. the rest are just bonuses that sony put there for your enjoyment.so, as a console is a GREAT console.But they need to improve the build of UMDs, and make the $39.99 per game be worth the price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2008"}

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

The game is a mix of action and puzzles where Link must travel between the Light and Dark worlds to rescue Princess Zelda.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"A classic coming back with extra stuff","reviewText":"Most gamers refer to that period between 1990-1997 as \"the good old days\", some even earlier. You had Super Metroid, Chrono Trigger, Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, Final Fantasy VI(III on SNES, don't ask it's complicated), and the Sonic and Mario games. Another one that came out was Link to the Past, the 16 bit sequel to the 2 NES and some Gameboy installments. Probably the first to develop the light/dark world theme seen in the recent Metroid Prime sequel, it's been widely considered as a classic and try it out for ourselves.Story: Basically, there's not a lot to the story but boy is it interesting. Princesses are being kidnapped by a wizard named Aghanim(or was it Ganondorf? Anyway). Zelda telepathically speaks to Link who's sleeping to come rescue her. He does so and she tells him he must stop Aghanim from obtaining the Triforce, a mystical item with the ability to grant the wish of anyone who touches it.The real only story developments come from the instruction manual, Zelda after rescuing her and when you complete a dungeon. It's not full of twists but it's so interesting to read.Sound/Music: All the classics are here: the Overworld theme, the Kakariko Village theme, even that fluttery piano thing that plays during the opening which was last heard in Wind Waker. One complaint: using soundbytes from the Nintendo 64 installments, Link yells at EACH sword thrust, which means if you're someone who likes to go nuts with the sword, he yells each time which got really annoying.Gameplay: A huge assortment of items to use. You got your 3 Medallions, a Book, 2 Magic Rods, a Cape, Mirror, and of course the classic Bow and Arrows and Boomerang. Your one complaint would definately be having to go into the menu and selecting it each time you want to switch. So unlike Ocarina/Majora/Wind Waker, you have only one slot, which means you have to keep going into menu. It's not as bad as the Oracle series where your sword had to be selected, here it's your default B button.One thing that made this game such a huge play was like Metroid, the huge amount of things that were thrown into the game deliberately. See that area with the huge stone? Once you get power gloves, you'll be able to lift it but there's always an area in Hyrule(the world of course) taunting you, making you figure out, just what item you need to get over there and where to find it. Not to mention magic meter upgrades and heart pieces; collect 4 and your health goes up by one(like Metroid's energy tanks).You should definately check this out but bit of a warning. Enemies earlier on can very easily kill you as one hit can take off one heart just like that. Aside from that, definately pick this up, and if you have friends with the game, check out the multiplayer Four Swords as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Evan M.","summary":"A game that you Can't put down","reviewText":"The game that continues the line of epic FPS games, Halo 2 is a great buy if you love a series that has a great core storyline as well as fun plot twists and side missions.

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Oblivion vs. GOTY","reviewText":"I played the 'Game of the Year' edition on our PS3 and, before ordering theElder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Game of the Year EditionI wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the $50+ for the full thing or maybe start with this, less expensive, configuration and then add the Shivering Isles to it. It was a difficult decision to make because there wasn't enough information available at the time or I could not find it and, in the end, I decided to live dangerously :) and went for the GOTY. Now, that the happy Oblivion-playing days are behind me, I believe that it was the right thing to do but I would like to help, if I can, anyone who may not be so sure of what to order, make the right decision.What you get in this edition:-------------------------------This edition has the plain-vanilla 'Oblivion' AND a relatively small expansion called 'Knights of the Nine' which was available separately on other platforms.Knights of the Nine integrates seamlessly into the Oblivion universe and it's really a set of additional quests, all taking place inside the 'original' Oblivion universe.The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles:-------------------------------Is part of GOTY but it is not included in this package. In the PS3 world, this represents the difference between the plain Oblivion and the GOTY.The Shivering Isles are a different realm. The world's texture is different, the characters behave in a different manner, you encounter different monsters and you travel on the path of a different story line. While you can take you weapons and your skills with you, the Shivering Isles is a world onto itself and you go in and out of it through a gateway so you are either in Cyrodiil or you are in the Shivering Isles.If you are thinking in terms of 'is it worth it?', you should be aware that the Shivering Isles does not double your universe. It is a relatively small world and it has a smaller number of quests. My estimation is that it's probably 1/5 the size of Cyrodiil proper, possibly smaller. In my view, purchasing the GOTY edition was worth it and I have little doubt that, once I was almost done with the main Oblivion I would have ordered the Shivering Isles, regardless of the price but, for anyone who's more cautious, there seems to be no price penalty for purchasing them as separate packages. However, given the convenience of having everything on one disk and given the likelihood that, if you love Oblivion you would buy the Shivering Isles anyway, I would recommend the GOTY.See my GOTY review below._________________________________________________Oblivion is EXACTLY how I imagined an RPG should be like back in the 80's, while playing Ultimas on Commodore 64s and Atari STs.Oblivion has weather. While there is no wind other than a constant, gentle breeze, you do get rain/thunderstorms, fog, snow (no blizzards though, because there's not much wind). You don't slip and fall on ice but the sound of your steps is different whether you walk on the road, on grass, on snow or on ice.The world of Cyrodill is not exactly continent-size, maybe some 20-30 miles in any direction from downtown Imperial City but... what a world this is. Cities, settlements, camps, estates, roadside inns, ruins, caves, dungeons, mines, shrines. The landscape is made up of plains, hard-to-climb mountains, rivers, swamps, waterfalls, seas. You can travel on foot or you can ride a horse. You can fight your way into fame and fortune while doing good or you can sneak into other people's houses or pickpocket the unsuspecting. The guards will chase you and throw you in jail if you do illegal things but, if they like you enough, maybe they will look the other way sometimes. Powerful gods or humble people will ask you do 'little things' for them and, if you can make them happy, they will reward you according to their abilities. You can raise to the top of your profession, as a fighter, as a mage, as a thief or as an assassin or you can assemble your own little gang of dreamy crusaders so that you can fight evil and recover the relics of a legendary knight. Or you can do them all and become all, in sequence or make progress in all paths more or less simultaneously while moonlighting as a gladiator as well and, if still bored, how about helping a lady take care of the rats in her basement (that's NOT what you think) or some drunk guy at the inn get rid of the Trolls that took over his daddy's country estate? Oh and, I forgot, there's a world to save or... wait... there's TWO worlds, thanks to the Shivering Isles extension.This game is so huge, I can't see how you could really 'finish' it. After more than 2 months of almost daily playing, I am maybe 75-80% into the main quest, half a way through the Knights of the Nine, only started the Shivering Isles adventures. I did become the realm's Chief Mage (and the titles earns me no respect from the scholar mages) and the grand master at the Fighters league, got myself 350,000 gold coins in my pocket, 2 comfortable houses and 2 nice offices, completed close to 100 quests, slaughtered 2000 creatures and hundreds of humans, murdered 4 or 5 and all but one by mistake (friendly fire), didn't even come close to the Thieves guild and, foolishly, made it impossible for me to ever join the Dark Brotherhood (these are the assassins). Also, I've never been a vampire and didn't yet start my career as a professional gladiator. I did massacre the peaceful dwellers of a small village but I did that under the influence of some drugs that made them look to me like bloody Orcs - that was the price to pay for infiltrating and destroying the source of that scourge. Oh, and while briefly in the land of Dementia - or was it Mania? - I did, willingly, push buttons that caused a few careless adventurers to go insane and I watched as they were becoming so. I humiliated a lovely princess - or was it a duchess? - and I killed so many fearsome monsters, I lost count myself but the game does keep a count so it's easy to know. In fact, the game keeps track of so many things... I could easily find out how many jokes I told, how many potions I made, how many horses I've stolen (one), how many hours I slept or how many books I read.Well...? What do you think?On the 'not so good' side, the game does slow down when you are fighting 4-5 monsters at the same time or when there are other things that keep the PS3 busy while you are fighting the baddies - like a fire burning. Loading/saving times are a bit too long but, while this is happening, you do get to read some randomly selected good advice on the screen.The other thing that saddens me is that I don't believe the good people at Bethesda are working on the next chapter yet. I do hope that, as soon as they are done with Fallout-3, they are going to get busy with another adventure in Cyrodill or thereabouts.My other problem is that I am now fighting with my kids over time on the PS3. We have a bunch of other games but, since Oblivion came into our house, I would say that 95%+ of our PS3 time was on Oblivion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2008"}

So went back to the roots and try Final Fantasy Tactics. I think there are really some people who enjoy frustrations in games and think that this is the only way to consider a game fun. Final Fantasy Tactics is annoying, frustrating and unrewarding. I don't know what's wrong with people who think that this is a great game. You think you can spend time to level up the characters to make the story battles easier? You are completely wrong. I'm stuck in a boss battle that after a 100 hours of level up you thought you have characters 30 levels higher than the enemies, you should be ok? You are wrong. The boss is so strong that despite you are 30 levels higher than them, it can wipe out your whole party in one go - despite all of them are 30 levels higher and have the best equipment on them at that point of the game. What's the point? I think I'll give up the Final Fantasy frachise for good now if the next game is by the same producer. It's not worth it at all. For people who think this kind of game challenging and fun, I think I'd rather not be a gamer anymore. If I can, I want to give -5 stars to this game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2007"}

Although it has shown its highs like Need For Speed III did with Hot Pursuit and its sequel Hot Pursuit 2, there also have been some versions with absolute lowpoints as well like Need For Speed Porsche Unlimited, and other smaller versions of the game too. Although the game remains a popular favorite, there have also been times where the need to be fast and furious can also be told in the shadows of the underground racing scene. That is said with this game.Need For Speed Underground for the Playstation 2, is a game that does try to deliver into the need for being the fastest in the underworld. The game of course shows you as you try to work your way to the top by earning points to pimp up your look of your car, and the style as well from bumpers and spoilers, to faster engines and weight reductions. The game handles well in the graphics and the music as you go through several different races from sprints and circuits, to lap knockouts and the thrill of the drag racing scene too. Sadly, there are a lot of unfortunate disadvantages to this edition. One of them is the lack of courses. Even though they are all set in one big city, you will be battling the same courses more than once in each match of the game. Not only that, the controls are also a bit shallow too in some cars, where you might lose your grip and crash into an oncoming vehicle or train.All in all, Need For Speed Underground isn't a bad game, but it just could've used some more variety. Instead, I really suggest you buy its sequel Need For Speed Underground 2, or Need For Speed: Most Wanted. There are much more thrills and challenges in those editions, that this one. This edition just misses the need for real speed.Graphics: BSound: BControl: C 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: COverall: C 1/2+","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2006"}

It took my system around 4-5 hrs to update and I don't have the lowest speed connection either...but i'm doing it wireless so that may be some of it.Gameplay is not as fun as I thought it was going to be.  I have had all the previous Gran Turismos and loved them.  They were always fun to me.  So far I just can't get into GT5.  It isn't very fun.  I guess that's the drawback to a simulator.  Of course, I did get this game for the cars and there is supposed to be a ton of them.  I was still hoping for some fun though.  I have been playing Shift and having a blast.I don't like the way the cars handle against the road in GT5.  It doesn't feel right to me.  Shift feels much better when driving.Graphics are awesome and detailed.  Shift has great graphics as well, but not as great as GT5.  But great graphics does not necessarily equal great gameplay.As others have mentioned, you don't get a cockpit view of all cars in the game which stinks in my opinion.  I want to be able to drive inside all cars no matter which ones I drive.  Shift has a cockpit view in all cars.Sound isn't too bad, but Shift sounds way better.  Get a copy of Shift and rev up the engine and see what I mean. =)Shift doesn't have near as many cars as GT5, but that doesn't really matter when it comes down to it.  You can have 2000 cars and the game still stink, not that either one of these have 2000 cars. =)Shift has a pretty good damage and crash system, where GT5 does not.All in all, my first impression is that I regret buying GT5 and wish I would have waited for Shift 2 or even Test Drive Unlimited 2 for that matter (not sure how good TDU2 is, but it looks decent enough).  I played the first Test Drive Unlimited on the PS2 and it was pretty good.I may change my review later the more I get into GT5 but I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.  At this point, I can't recommend the new GT5 no matter how good the graphics are.  It just doesn't seem to be much fun so far.  I recommend Need for Speed Shift instead.  Shift is way cheaper too!Update:  I gave GT5 another chance and played it all night tonight.  It's still not much fun and feels like i'm wasting my time when there are more fun games out there, especially for those of us who don't have many hours to play each week.  After I finished playing GT5 tonight, I put in my copy of Shift and had a blast.  Shift is soooo much more fun.  I thought the new GT5 would be similar but with more cars.  Gee was I wrong!  The new GT5 is just the old GTs with better graphics...even the older GTs were more fun to me.  So i'm taking the hit and my copy of GT5 is being sent back as a trade-in and I ordered a copy of TDU2 after doing much more research and watching more videos and reading the varying reviews and then basing that on my past experience with the first TDU.  But anywho, my suggestion still stands.  Get Shift instead! =)  Buy a copy of Need for Speed Shift, rev the engine to hear it roar, and then floor it!  Get your race on!Update 2:  I left my previous comments on this game to show you that your original opinion of the game can change as mine did.  I was all set to trade in my copy at first.  Well I decided to give it another go.  And it's hooking me in.  Still it's no adrenaline fueled racing game and not full of excitement, but it has an appeal that keeps you coming back for the next car or upgrades to your current cars.  I keep checking the used car lot each time I race looking forward to see what cars \"just in\". =)  The more I play, the more I see it's not a bad game at all even though it wasn't what I hoped it would be.  Shift is still more fun and exciting, but GT5 keeps me coming back for more.  So what I do is play Shift for exciting, fueled racing with ability to really jam up my car with exterior/interior mods and GT5 for car collecting and more peaceful racing...more so the car collecting aspect.  My advice if you can only get one, rent both, play them both for a week each, and then decide.  If you can get both and you love racing and cars, I recommend both of them at some point.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2011"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

The choice is yours ininfamous.caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Everyman turned superhero Cole.View larger.Devastating electricity-based powers.View larger.Go anywhere open-world design.View larger.An organic urban environment.View larger.StoryEmpire City was a run of the mill metropolis, until one day a massive explosion rips through six square blocks of its bustling downtown real-estate, seemingly leveling everything and everyone in its path. Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

He is the last of a noble and respected line. Raised in a series of safehouses by families loyal to his father's memory, Lucas will not rest until the Legion is rebuilt, and his family's honor is restored. Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword. While slower to swing and less practical for one-on-one combat, it can strike multiple foes and knock them back, making it an ideal weapon for crowd control.AnjaliAnjali is an archon - a legend, come to life.

But Anjali was raised by friends of the Legion, and she does not know how she came to this world, or what happened to the others of her kind.Anjali can shift freely between her human form and an incarnation of elemental fire. In human form, she fights with a staff or a spear, allowing her to fend off multiple attackers while leaping in and out of the fray.

Personally, I will remain the guitar/bass player while Hubby loves to rock out on the drums.  Are they fun? Yes.  Is it tricky? At first, as in most things.  Are they noisy?  Oh my... are they!  It gets to the point that his drumming or my own, drowns out every other sound making us blast the surround sound.  The drum kit is composed of rubber pieces, and in retrospect it shouldn't make noise, but it does because of the plastic rim that may be accidently hit with each \"tap\".Now onto my serious issues with this drum set.  That footpedal drives me insane, and not because I can't remember it; but rather because it shifts around my hardwood floors while my foot moves up and down making me bang down my foot so that it will record my \"hits\".  I feel that it may be remedied only if you have carpeting in your home, but not by placing a small moveable rug underneath.  I have tried to tighten/loosen the tension but it does nothing because I have to put all my might into stepping down, which doesn't equate to nice easy flow drumming.  This footpedal also contributes to a lot of the noise because of the banging of my stepping down and it jumping off the ground.  It is the most annoying & noisy thing!The next very serious issue is the fact that the drums and cymbals to do not stay tight.  We have improved in not banging & beating on them but I still find the cymbals turning/floating to the right as we play.  The bottom drums (round red, blue & green) start off at the same level but throughout game play they will all be on different levels.  Tightening the bolts at this point no longer keeps them snug and there is give/play now to shift a bit up and down; whereas before when you tightened they would not budge.  It seems that with playing and the repetitive motions they will eventually crack.  The stand that holds all the pieces up seems sturdy up until you accidently hit one of the legs; you will then discover that the whole drum controller will tip forward and come crashing to the floor (true story!)multiple times.  We can't play in a corner tucked away, but rather in the middle of the living room. I assume that most play in the same living room scenario in front of their television.  If that is the case, lock up the doggies, children & klutzy adults that may kick one of the rotating legs.As far as game play goes, they respond and are fully compatible with Rock Band & Guitar Hero.  We have played along with Guitar Hero World Tour, GH 5, Rock Band & The Beatles:Rock Band.Recommend only for the \"drummers\" out there that enjoy this instruments play in these game series.  Not for an in-experienced first time buyer who want to \"try out\" the drums for the game.  The price point is rather steep and I hope that Logitech will make a point of replacing those bolts that pretty much keep the whole controller alive and redesigning the pedal.  Logitech is a great company that listens to it's consumers; hopefully they will see the error in a cool accessory that needs a little more tweaking to put it where it belongs price-wise.  I also wanted to mention that the kit collapses down for easy storage underneath a bed; but I do not recommend constantly turning those plastic bolts.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2009"}

{"product_name":"B008CP6RWU","description":"","reviewerName":"Private Quentin Tarantino Fan","summary":"Superb Collection From A Great Company!","reviewText":"If you have been following the Independent game scene, you you know that this industry is no longer fully underground.  Within it, no game developer on the scene has succeeded with that they do as well as thatgamecompany.  This company, founded by Jenova Chen, is becoming one of the most promising and exciting game developers in the video game industry.  thatgamecompany's games teem with life, beauty, and emotion.  Now, they just seem to be getting started. As the company is no longer tied down to a single developer with a small budget, I don't see their vision conforming to any sort of regression.  I can only see their visions for gaming going through the roof.  If they are able to do so, thatgamecompany could be THE indie game company to beat.First, before I dive in, I want to take a route and warn customers: This package may not have value if you own a lot of the material.  First, though, the contents of the collection themselves.  I divided the review in three sections, so feel free to skip which sections you are not interested in.THE GAMES THEMSELVESFor those of you who aren't familiar with this company, thatgamecompany focuses on delivering games that provide emotion, beauty, meaning, non-violent experiences, and communication.  All of their games are highly worth playing, emphasizing a quality experience over other re-playability factors such as extra goals and side challenges.  None of the games are particularly lengthy, and none of their games really have much traditional replay value (\"unlockables\", \"pointless simulators of real life menial labor\" \"high score achievements\", \"collecting\", etc.  Actually, personally, I dislike most of these game play elements).  But that's not a bad thing.  As a matter of fact, these games prove that a gaming experience is galaxy more valuable than any thing else in gaming.  Read Jonathan Blow's blog post entitled \"Why Aren't Video Games Satisfying?\" (on the website for his new game, The Witness), and you might understand why these games are very special.thatgamecompany's video games, here on one disc, are all excellent.  Journey is easily the star here, as Journey is definitely one of the most amazing games in recent memory.  In fact, it's easily the best game I've played in 2012 so far (though my prediction for GOTY will be Dishonored).  Journey is an interactive parable, designed to be ambiguous and open ended, so the player himself can make the work truly his own personal journey (yes, the title of the game is very accurate).  It's praise for the game is really not hyperbole, it's an amazing melange of music, visuals, game play, and sound, all come together and mesh into one.  While it's much too in depth to get into here, Journey also uses multi-player in one of the most meaningful ways in gaming (read up Chen's explanation on that).  I don't want to spoil too much, but as an allegory released in the 21st century, Journey is one of the best games I've experienced.  No joke, it's that good.  Yeah, no matter your feeling towards \"artistic\" games, make the exception.  Journey is a must play experience.The other two titles are much smaller in content, but still terrific.  fl0w, which was part of Jenova Chen's master thesis regarding Dynamic difficulty adjustment, deals with using an aquatic micro-organism, which grows as it consumes other micro-organisms.  It's simple enough, but it's also a wonderfully soothing.  Visually, it does a wonderful job with capturing the experience of evolution and the biology of life itself, like a more evocative Spore.  Flower, one of the most well known indie titles on the Playstation platform, is also gorgeous.  Flower also has a terrific sound track to back up the visuals, I definitely do feel that these two games show their budget, as both games sometimes feel more like experimental pieces.  Having that said, I think that's a good thing.  Even better, both games are also short and memorable, like a great animated short.  Needless to say, all three games are unique, and worth the price for any gamer.In fact, each of the games here really do have a personal meaning, especially to the makers who created the video games.  Flower, for example, is pretty much akin to Chen's experience with moving to California from China, and what the settings and environment meant to him.  At the same time, the games are also a personal experience, letting players themselves get what they want out of the games.  Personally, that's the great thing about these games.  Aside from the fact that they play well, feel unique and fresh, you really can't go wrong with games that are almost guaranteed to move you and are specifically made to inspire a wide range of emotions in their works.  If this sounds even remotely appealing to you, then these games were made for you.  Oh, and if you are a fan of Team Ico, also give these games a try.  Chen considers Fumito Ueda one of his prime influences.BONUS FEATURESFirst, I do think that one set of the features are sort of lackluster.  The three little mini-games, created as small diversions from the main games, are nice enough.  Unfortunately, I found their appeal to be extremely limited.  They aren't too much different from a flash game, and I find flash games extremely limited in replay value, and these ones were no exception.  Worse, the games have little to nothing artistic about them, and they don't provide all that much emotional depth, and really just feel like they are just a way pass the time.  Fun, but mostly a waste of time.  Needless to say, it's not worth buying the collection for them, and I don't see myself ever playing these games regularly.Fortunately though, everything else is great.  In particular, the play through commentary is one of the strongest points, as it truly gives out some great anecdotes regarding the nature of the games on display.  Like you might expect from a director's commentary, the commentary provided here provides for some truly interesting details, one that really inflates your appreciation for the games.  I also particularly enjoyed the concept art, given that the artistic style is a huge influence on what makes these games brilliant.  Flipping through them gives the same thrill you might get from enjoying a concept art book or a bonus gallery on a DVD.  There's not too much to say here, other than the fact you get it for all three games, and they are highly worth going back to again and again.  After all, the art in these games are so gorgeous as it is; I think they pretty much belong in a museum.  Heck, it's better than most things you find in a modern museum.The sound tracks that are included are beautiful.  I won't comment on each individual track, but the music is beautiful, inspiring, heart-rendering, and absolutely lovely.  Just take a listen for yourself, and you will understand.  On the XMB side, the collection offers special Crossbar themes and avatars.  As someone who has about twenty unique Crossbar themes on his hard drive, I can't help but get excited at what you get in the package, as they are all terrific.  Avatars, ditto, as they often can say a lot about who you are as a gamer based on the picture (a picture, as they say, is a thousand words).The trailer and developer diaries are also well developed, and the trailers themselves capture the game rather well.  After all, some video game trailers (Dishonored, BioShock Infinite) are works of art in themselves, and it highly applies to these trailers as well.  They are definitely worth viewing on their own.  The developers diaries I also particularly enjoyed.  Too often I feel that the developers themselves have no love at all for their audience, and never at once care about sharing what makes the games they make special.  Well, thatgamecompany is different.  When they speak, they provide some insight, and they never wasted my time here.  They are definitely worth watching, and they really do a great job showing what drives the company in their quest to make personal games.Finally, the 30 minute Journey documentary follows suit. It was clear that Journey was primed to be a great experience from the beginning, with each member on the team with the intention to do so.  Thankfully, the 30 minute documentary definitely fleshes this one out, and by the end of the documentary, you will definitely appreciate the game much more.Finally, the package contains a one month free subscription to PlaystationPlus.  I'm not going to waste your time explaining the benefits of PP, so if you are interested, check out the benefits, which include, among other things, free downloadable games, as well as discounts and special online features.

Elevators, sliding doors, Fetch quests.","reviewText":"It almost feels like Visceral pulled a Resident Evil 6 and threw everything that made Dead Space so paramount to the side and turned this game into an action shooter with little or no real creepy horror elements. Dead Space and Dead Space 2 had that creep factor with chilling random noises that built tension.  In Dead Space 3, you're basically FETCHING this from point A to B to C and back again. And the elevators. Good gosh. I mean, there was one chapter that had me going up 4 or 5 elevators and rappel up a side of 5 different mountains. The game got pretty darn annoying and became more of a chore than it was fun.  Practically each time Isaac finishes reaching a certain point, he's attacked by a small army of Necromorphs. In DS and DS2, there was tension built up and the element of surprise was not so obvious. In DS3, you can almost EXPECT an army of Necromorphs attacking you each time you reach a specific checkpoint or you're about to fetch yet another thing. It got downright annoying that basically this is 90% of the game. FETCH QUESTS. Simply a ton of FETCH QUESTS.  Halfway through the game, I was wondering if there was an option to yell at the NPCs and say \"Get it yourself!!!!!!\" What a horrible way to make a game following 3 excellent games (Dead Space, Dead Space 2, and Dead Space Extraction for the Wii).  It was just downright horrible in my opinion.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0017HIIWW","description":"Transformed and unleashed, Sonic races to save the world...and himself. Sonic the Hedgehog is on an adventure unlike any other. Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"irukandji","summary":"Fun plus Frustrating","reviewText":"This game has a rating of Everyone 10+. There is a reason for the 10 and up, it is kind of hard. Not too hard where the average dogged person can't beat it though.The game has two main parts, Sonic the Hedgehog where you speed and race to get rings or beat the stage in the specified time limit. And the Werehog, which is a beat-em-up, jumping, climbing, platformer type style.  You spin and rotate a planet-globe to select your destination. In each destination is a village with people you can talk to and stages, which are split Hedgehog/Werehog. The cutscenes are unskippable and occasionally you may have watch one you already have seen, depending on when you exit the game and what you accomplished. I did not find the story or cutscenes irritating, and I hated Metal Gear Solid 4's cutscenes. The voice acting was good and story helps you get into the game and they're not too long. I didn't mind them.Honestly, I prefer the Werehog, contrary to the public opinion. The early Sonic the Hedgehog stages (the normal racing ones), were easy but didn't seem like I had much control. Just get from point A to point B and they'd show him racing through loops and such, although it does look good. Later on they get difficult, especially the last ones. I replayed the same Hedgehog stage over and over again, because I didn't know what to do. Very unfamiliar and unprepared for the type of moves they wanted me to pull off. I'd get up to a point and make one mistake and lose too many lives or in the case of the time attack, lose too much time, and have to start over. They expect you to make a 1/2 second decision as your racing along, and when its your first time, you'll mess up and have to start over. And then get to a point later in the stage and encounter the same 1/2 decision and start all over again. Once you've beaten it though it is easier.The whole game is easy up until a point. It starts to get hard at the Chinese-type Chunun village. When things started to get difficult, I preferred Werehog stages because I had so much more control and didn't have to restart so many times. You only have 2 lives, which means if you die that much, you have to restart the whole stage. Frustrating when you suck and aren't that good yet and trying to figure out what they want you to do. However, you can get more lives by getting a certain amount of Sun & Moon medals, by completing the Hedgehog & Werehog stages, and those medals will allow you to open the doors in the temples. And once you mess around with jumping around or solving the little puzzle you can get a sonic life. I unlocked 7 sonic lives towards the end of the game, they come in handy during the Werehog stages.The big boss of the whole game was hard at first because it is unlike Werehog or Hedgehog mode. I got frustrated because it takes awhile and is broken up into 3 parts, which you will have to replay if you fail. I didn't understand what exactly to do, I had to look it up online in a walkthrough and it was much clearer. I didn't need to read much, just point me in the right direction, and I beat it much easier.This game would be a lot easier if I had to beat it all over again, since I know what to do and how to do it. It's playable and shouldn't be rated below 3 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2009"}

Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"","summary":"Hype of Nations","reviewText":"I've never considered myself a real-time strategist. Since Westwood's seminal *Dune II*, I've beaten about every major RTS on the American market. Yet game play hasn't evolved enough to sustain my interest.Same goes for turned-based strategy, though I've been clicking \"Next Turn\" since the original *Civilization*. These too, have stuck by the formula with insufficient innovations to maintain replay value.So when PC journalists began to herald an RTS/TBS revolution last year, I took notice. Developer Big Huge Games and game 'zines alike trumpeted a game to bridge the gap between the excitement and mechanics of real-time war games with the scope and sophistication of turned-based empire builders.Folks, I am still waiting. In the meantime, I received Big Huge Games' *Rise of Nations*; beneath all the hype it's a disappointingly conventional RTS.&lt;Build, and They Will Rush&gt;From the get-go, it's necessary to sort game from advertisement. Favorable reviewers all around have gushed some variation of the following:1. *RoN* is a sophisticated RTS.2. *RoN* is an epic RTS.3. *RoN* is a hybrid between RTS and TBS game types.4. *RoN* is a sophisticated, epic hybrid between RTS and TBS types.While I haven't tested these claims online, my single-player conquests invalidated these claims.*RoN* rigidly adheres to RTS tradition. Gameplay confines to the B3 principle: Build bases, Build units, Blow up. The developers include a Risk-style \"Conquer the World\" mode which offers raiding party actions, but otherwise missions are solved by building a base, amassing resources, and then smashing a computer-controlled base with a large, clumsy army. Like most modern RTS games, *RoN* offers rudimentary diplomacy, research, and economic features to upgrade your forces. Likewise, it offers a choice of combatants distinguished mainly by military power and texture skins variations. Finally, *RoN* arrays stereotypical unit types and superfluous gimmicks... like most RTS games, the player will quickly learn that building a bunch of tanks and rushing the enemy base works most of the time.*RoN* rushes with Blizzard-style play mechanics founded back with the original *Warcraft*. Players use a central building to generate labor units, units who mine a small range of archetypal resources from battlemap hotspots and typically hoof them back to the central building (though *RoN* mercifully permits players to build collection camps on-site). Players then spend these resources by ordering labor units to build factories, laboratories, and fortifications around the central building. Each has its own build queue for military units, and/or unit upgrades as well.Bases are not sprawling, well-defend affairs as in the Westwood model. Fortifications lack sufficient range and hit points while costing too much to build; discouraging base-camping and encouraging aggressive play. One usually wins by destroying selected enemy buildings. A 200-unit population cap per player constrains their entire infrastructures.Frankly, I find this game-style dated. That doesn't stop Big Huge Games from trying to adorn their product with trappings of the turned-based empire genre. *RoN* notably introduces a \"library\" of additional building and unit upgrades. This library also improves caps and modifiers for resources, and improves the next notable introduction, national borders. National borders act strictly as a weapon, by inflicting \"attrition\" damage on any enemy unit or building caught on the wrong side of a shift. Per *Civilization*, a number of \"wonder\" buildings unlock special powers and modifications. And the players can advance through levels of technology called \"Ages\". BHG emulates Stainless Steel Studios in offering peaceful technology or resource races as an endgame option for skirmish and multiplayer modes.And that's it. Big Huge Games might call its combatants \"civilizations\", its labor units \"citizens\", and its bases \"cities\"; in practice it's still the Blizzard RTS military model. The intricate tech trees of the *Civ* and *MOO* series are here trimmed down to lines of yet more unit upgrades. Borders have no cultural or political purpose-they just act as a force shield. Economy is still a shallow matter of collecting resources and uncovering crates to build powerful armies. Missions are limited mostly to combat, the non-military options being woefully underdeveloped. Yes, *Rise of Nations* is straight RTS, no more sophisticated than *Starcraft* or epic than *Empire Earth*.&lt;Rise Above&gt;With *RoN* put into perspective, I can see its virtues more clearly. It's a fast-paced entry into the \"historical\" genre, for those who want to upgrade armies from the stone age to modern times in an afternoon. A plethora of civilization-specific units and advantages lends a style choice to whichever side you play. BHG keeps base buildings to a minimum, and players can immediately build all units available for a given age, so long as they have the resources and the factories. Resources are widely available and players have plenty of room on each map to spread their bases and amass armies. BHG also incorporates good unit AI and path-finding. If the player doesn't want to worry about an extended campaign or story-line, *RoN* is all about skirmishes and multiplayer.&lt;Fall of Nations&gt;Perhaps as much as the hype these traditions fail to please me. I'm tired of the arbitrary 200-unit population caps and mindless B3 routine. Westwood games may be even more dated in their play mechanics, but at least they concentrated each game on a story and well-executed themes, instead of developing a loose collection of skirmish variations beneath a thread-bare claim of being \"historical\".BHG could have broke the mold; the idea of a true epic RTS is one of the great unrealized ideas in PC gaming. They played it safe instead-but had the gall to call it something it is not. Make no mistake; dedicated RTS gamers will probably love this game for the same reasons I dislike it. But serious TBS gamers may be disappointed all around. *Rise of Nations* is no real-time *Civilization*; it's as conventional a military RTS as they come. Just don't buy the hype if you buy this game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000HCMR8E","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Fun and Challenging","reviewText":"Ridge Racer 7 PS3 is a car racing game that relies on drift. You don't just race in a straight line around a track - you have to skid along the corners in order to win.Much of how much you like or dislike this game is going to come down to how much you enjoy that idea. If you're the kind of person who plays \"regular\" racing games all the time and enjoy that straight blast of speed, you might be frustrated in trying to get your car to drift properly. It might go against what you want to do, and you just won't enjoy the play.Also, the game isn't meant to be a realistic racing sim. You can easily ping-pong off of the side barriers and walls and other cars. They simply nudge you back into line to keep going. So if part of your skill is in talented avoidance of other cars, or perhaps scaring them into easing off, that won't work here.So, that being said, Ridge Racer 7 is quite good at what it does offer. For that fun action-movie style of racing where you're skidding with squealing tires around a curve, knocking your opponent off-line and then nitro-zipping to victory, you'll have it made. The cars' traits are customizeable. You can even change how they look. You've got a selection of tracks to work with as part of the single-player game, and then you can take it online to challenge other top notch racers.Yes, the game isn't easy. You'll have to practice a fair amount to get deep into the game. I don't consider that a bad thing. It lets you build up the skill set necessary to win and it keeps you interested in moving forward.I wasn't personally fond of the music, but they do have an option to turn it off. So I simply did that and played my own MP3s while I raced. Not really a bit issue.So, in the end, well recommended for someone who enjoys this type of racing. If you're not sure it will match up with your racing style, rent it - but be sure to play it for a solid weekend at least before you give up on it. It'll be tricky at first. Hang in there and give it a solid test, to build up your skills, before you decide if it's for you or not.Rating: 8/10I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2012"}

The game is long enough already, having to stop every 5 minutes at every checkpoint (another annoyance) to repair your vehicle or switch to another one only adds to the tedium.  Also irritating are the regular weapon jammmings you have to deal with, and any weapons you pick up from defeated enemies are almost always in as bad a shape as the one you have, or worse.  You can purchase better weapons, reliability upgrades, etc.. so there are ways around that but even these seem to degrade at an unrealistic rate.  The previously mentioned enemy checkpoints just seem to drag things out even further.  You can completely destroy these checkpoints only to come back later and find them completely rebuilt and fully staffed with more enemies to fill your vehicle full of lead.  Yawn..

It's worth the money because unlike such games as Gears of War (1 and 2), the single player mode delivers a serious amount of game. I call it Grand Theft Auto Goes to Africa.I couldn't get over the lighting effects and shadows. Truly, some scenes almost looked photo-realistic. And the way sunrise and sunset change the overall appearance of the environment must be seen to be appreciated. My one complaint would be the night sequence because it just didn't appear as alive as daytime. I think the PC version is better than the 360's in this regard.My gripes:Repetitive missions: you'll be doing the same thing many times no matter what mission it is. This, however, is a lot of fun although it's basically the same every time. The sandbox design lets you approach a mission from several different avenues. You can drive up to a checkpoint, bail out, sneak past guards, steal their gunboat, pilot to an arms dealer, stock up, hanglide over bad guys et al.Strange save feature: game saves normally but if you fail to complete a mission, sometimes it would send you way back to a point where you might not remember what was going on.Little replayability: FC2 takes a lot of time to finish, and doing it again, discovering all the diamonds and such just isn't fun the second time around. In fact, it feels like work.In all, buy this game. The visuals are so awesome that you will ignore the sameness of missions.

{"product_name":"B00008QOL6","description":"When it comes to first-person shooters, there are two schools of thought. One harkens back to the originalDoom--frantic action, scary monsters, big weapons, and story is given short shrift. The second school is best exemplified byHalf-Life: strong narrative, consistent real-world weapons, consistent monsters, and settings.Doom'sheirs up until now have beenQuakeandSerious Sam, but nowPainkillercomes onto the scene leaving bloody footprints, and &#x85; let the carnage begin!You play a man who dies in a pathetic car crash (he's distracted because he's holding his girl's hand) and has spent a long time in purgatory. He thinks this is unfair because, despite being well-schooled in the art of killing, he maintains that he's done nothing wrong. Heaven makes a deal with him. Take care of a little invasion problem concerning Hell, and our hero can enter those pearly gates.Weak storyline aside,Painkillerbasically amounts to a brilliant series of arcade-style levels and challenges. The settings include darkened monasteries, graveyards, a horrifying asylum, a medieval town under siege, and even H-E-Double Hockey Sticks itself. The level design is brilliant, varied, and jam-packed with enemies. There seems to be no end to the amount and variety of cool monsters to fight, and they each explode into chunks of blood and gore in a most disturbingly satisfying manner. At the end of each level is a challenge, such as collecting a certain amount of gold or killing a Boss within a time limit. Winning the challenge gives you tarot cards you can use to make the game easier. The different cards bring haste, double-damage, invulnerability, and so on. This simple mechanic makes the game far more replayable than your average shooter.The graphics are first rate, which means you need a powerful PC to run the game with all the detail settings maxed out. The only other problem is a CD-copy protection bug that makes the game unplayable for some (a patch is available).Painkillermay seem a bit silly at first glance. But the gameplay mechanics, replayability (full multiplayer is also available), variety, and brilliant level design make it one of the finest and most satisfying shooters ever made. -Andrew S.

Yes, there have been a few minor annoyances with it, but assuming you have a decent computer, you should love this game.The main problems with this game that I've experienced are fairly minor and remedied easy enough that I don't feel justified in lowering the rating for this game due to their presence. These problems include a wierd system memory leak game texture issue that doesn't appear to have been patched yet, and the fact that this game contains the annoying SecuROM DRM system. Some other problems many people like to complain about include the requirement that you create a Rockstar Social Club account before playing the game's multiplayer component (it doesn't effect single player at all - so single player gamers need not worry about this), and the requirement that you login with a Windows Live account before you can save your game progress and get the game's achievements (the achievements aren't required either... its just a fun option for people who enjoy doing that sort of thing).All of these issues are minor and easily remedied. As I mentioned, you don't even need the Rockstar Social Club account if all you intend to do is play single player. The memory leak issue appears to be remedied by just closing the game and re-opening it periodically between missions. The Windows Live ID takes only minutes to sign up for (it's a minor annoyance at most). The only remaining issue is SecuROM. Yeah it's annoying, but I'm not going to let it stop me from enjoying this SWEET game.Grand Theft Auto 4 is an amazing game. Most of the negative reviews for the game address peripheral concerns about the software you buy such as the DRM method used and other minor annoyances that shouldn't hinder most people from enjoying this. Grand Theft Auto 4 is a worthy successor (in my mind a better game) than its predecessors.GTAIV has vastly improved graphics, physics, sound effects, resolution support, controller support, and gameplay than its older cousins. I was a big fan of San Andreas and Vice City, and was worried that with all the bad reviews GTAIV would be a terrible successor to these games. To be sure, R* needs to patch the memory leak issue, and it would be nice if they'd make it so that SecuROM removes itself when the game uninstalls, but that's no reason for me to not give this game the 5 stars that the actual game content deserves for its vast improvements over many areas and its sweet storyline.The controller support in this game is phenomenal. Totally native support for the XBOX 360 Controller - so you can play with it even if you are on the PC version (I do this myself)! The resolution appears to be unlocked, meaning people with HDTVs or ultra high-resolution displays should have quite a lot of fun with this game. To get the most out of the game, you'll need a high-end system. However, if you have merely decent computer hardware (as I'd say I do), you should be able to run this fine - albeit not on maxed settings.I enthusiastically recommend GTAIV. I don't feel right in letting the minor inconveniences and annoyances that come with such a superb addition to the PC's GTAIV lineup get in the way of a 5-star rating for this game, so I'm going to go ahead and give it the full rating. There just aren't that many games that are this good out there - and it isn't right to trash a good game while focusing only on a few minor flaws that are easily dwarfed by the game's other positive qualities.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2010"}

The overhaul Tomb Raider needed","reviewText":"I've played a few Tomb Raider games in the past and was never really impressed.  In the midst of the seventh generation of video game systems, I had hoped that Tomb Raider might be releasing a new game worthy of the current graphics capabilities.  Finally, this game is up to par with your PS3 or Xbox 360.The look and sound of the overall game is fantastic.  Lara is given a totally new look which makes her much more realistic looking.  Stating the obvious, her chest is even \"reduced\" to make her seem more human rather than a lonely man's dirty fantasy.  There's also a certain level of vulnerability to her character that helps you to connect with her on a much more personal level.  The look of the environment also looks great graphically, though the entire game seems a little too dark (I don't know why she can't do more during the day time).The overall story of the game feels much like a movie.  The central theme is that you're stranded on an island and you're trying to signal for help or get off the island.  Every little \"mission\" in the game somehow involves that main goal.  i.e., climb to the top of the tower to send a radio signal, find the tools to fix the boat, etc.  The only element lacking is getting to know the other characters involved in the story.  Most of the game is played on your own, so there's little interaction between you and the other characters, so you don't know who they are or why they're with you.  This makes it less meaningful when one of them is killed by the enemies.Some complaints have been regarding how long it takes to get through the entire game.  I'm not sure what the expectation is of other players, but I pre-ordered this game so I've had it since it came out.  I've been playing a little bit every week and I'm still only 50% through the whole thing.  In my opinion, this is more than enough.Even if you weren't a fan of previous Tomb Raider games, you might enjoy this installment since it's a complete reboot of the series and is vastly different then the previous versions.  Now that the retail price has come down, there is no reason NOT to pick up this game immediately.UPDATE: I recently got to the end, and now it's saying that I'm 68% finished with the game.  This is because throughout the island, there are mini tombs to explore and boxes with XP points.  After you finish the game, you now have the ability to go back and search for these items by starting at any campground on the map.  Point being, even after \"finishing\" the game, there's still much to explore.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2013"}

Back then I gave up on this game as I could not solve the last riddle and was not familiar with online strategy guides.Since Prime series came out as Trilogy on Wii, I feld obligated to give it another shot and here is what I experienced.----------------------------METROID PRIME 1--------------------------------------------------PROS.-BLOW JOUR MIND: The environment, the scene and the experience you get through them is just amazing. I still can't believe that they created such effect using gamecube technology. JUST MARVELOUS.-Gadgets: Different beams, missles upgrades, suit upgrades, double jump, powerbomb, combo attack, morphball upgrades, grapple beam. JUST AMAZING.-Story: This is what I like. For those who don't care much about the story, you don't have to read it all. But to those who do, everything will be explained in the FINEST DETAILS. VERY WELL DONE.-Bosses: Again very creative. The final battles are probably THE MOST CREATIVE in the trilogy.-Length: Areas are fairly huge. If you go after majority of items which is highly recommended as final bosses can be tough, it will take you a while to explore them all.-Bonuses: More you explore, more endings you get to uncover. EXTREMELY REWARDING EXPERIENCE.CONS.- LOTS OF BACKTRACKING: Without a guide, this can be really irritating. Even with a guide, I hated how you have to back track a lot of areas in the ending.- Annoying double jumps: Some upgrades require morphball double jumps. Failure to do so will punish you (harshly at times.-Too many words: Story is really good, but I wish they had more cut scenes.----------------------------METROID PRIME 2--------------------------------------------------PROS.-COOLER THAN THE 1st GAME: The environment, the sceneries, the characters and theme are darker than the first game (and by that I don't mean they are black in color, they are more shady, the tone is a bit more serious).-Gadgets: Cooler beams, awesome visors (actually useful in this one), missles, powerbombs, grapplebeam, PLUS MOST IMPORTANTLY YOU HAVE SCREW ATTACK. JUST LOVE IT.-Bosses: While final fight was not as great as 1st (Still pretty good), the rest of the bosses are THE BEST IN THE TRILOGY. I mean the first time you encounter dark Samus is just EPIC. And other bosses especially in the dark world are very fun.-Length: Greater thanks to dark world-Bonuses: same is firstCONS.-Same as first, LOTS OF BACKTRACKING, ANNOYING DOUBLE JUMPS, OTHER DIFFICULT MANEUVERS and TOO MANY WORDS-Dark world is a wonderful creation, but as you lose health while playing in it causes constant stress in your mind and can make the experience torturous in the beginning. Don't worry, towards the end you get upgrades to counter it.----------------------------METROID PRIME 3--------------------------------------------------PROS.-A WHOLE DIFFERENT VIBE: While the first two game are mainly solo mission where don't get to interact that much with other living beings, this one is completely opposite. This game has quite a few interesting characters with awesome abilities (Unfortunately not playable though)-Gadgets: Again newer beams and other goodies.-Hypermode: LOVE IT. New and most welcome addition. Don't want to spoil it for you.-YOUR SHIP IS ACTUALLY USEFUL: HA HA play to find it out.-Very Creative use of Wii mote: Yup. You will be using wii mote in different ways to perform different actions. I liked it.-Bosses: They are good. I like their abilities more than the fights themselves. Like in 1st and 2nd, you can't just shoot them to kill them, you'll have to use your nugget.-Length: Only slightly longer than the first (definitely shorter than second)-Bonuses: Same as first two (Love the 100% ending though.CONS.-Same as first two, LOTS OF BACKTRACKING, ANNOYING DOUBLE JUMPS (most annoying of trilogy, horrible), TOO MANY WORDS-NO POWER-BOMB and NO COMBO SHOT ...... WHAT THE HELL???-Not that Metroid games are that adult, but this one felt a bit childish, art style is bit cartoonish-Easy to miss USING AN UPGRADE: Upgrades in this game are very useful, but if you are not reading their details, you won't utilize them fully making the experience dull. HIGHLY RECOMMEND USE GUIDE OR EXPLORE YOUR ABILITIES A LOT--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Common Conclusion:-Even with Wii's inferior technology, the graphics are updated (look pretty good on my HDTV).-The use of wii mote makes shooting and other actions easier and fun (While making few actions difficult and annoying).-As for the trilogy itself, it's pretty amazing. While all three games do have some setbacks as described above PROS OUTWEIGHS CONS BY A HUGE MARGIN SO BUT IT AND HAVE ~50-80 HOURS WORTH OF BLAST.YOU WILL NOT REGRET BUYING THIS ONE.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2010"}

First off the Maps, They are so big that they promote camping and getting shot at the back and it gets annoying. This game is so boring i almost fell asleep playing it, if i wanted a battlefield game i would buy it. But for some reason they thought it was cool to map the game like battlefield, but it backfired because the game feels broken, Its like a kids version of battlefield.

Although it has some nudity / blood, I think it's tame enough and reminiscent of the original era that it's more education than anything for youngsters under 10.  The music is probably one of the major perks.  I've downloaded and listened to the music on MP3 players driving around because it's THAT good.  The gameplay is simple as can be:  sidescroller, jump, attack, item, and magic.  There are literally hundreds of weapons, armor, etc items to find, it's amazing what some of the more rare special weaps do.  The game itself is pretty long too, once you beat it, you beat it again upside down and all monsters/music/items are changed to reflect your stronger levels.Anyway, there's lots and lots to describe of how awesome this game is.

This review is about an upgraded service. This is called Playstation Plus. As many people have stated, it IS optional to have. (however i think it may be mandatory for PS4, but lets not worry about that right now). This is not really like xbox live. You do not have to pay any monthly fee(actually i don't think you have to do that either for LIVE) anyway--Just buy this card, and for the price of a relatively new game($50), you will be happy through the next year! But this IS defferent from LIVE! Sony did an exceptional job with this service. For one-let me tell you the best thing about PS+. FREE STUFF. I'm not talkinf about just free avatars or themes, im talking about video games, and good ones too!! About every month, Plus releases a set number of games for free for you to play, these are not trials- these are the FULL games, no tricks(long install times though..) in the last 2 months ive used Plus- ive played Sleeping Dogs, Uncharted 3, LBP 2, Saints Row 3, X-Com, the list goes on! Since ive had this service ive had to consider upgrading my hard drive as i need to delete stuff in order to get new things, in short-- my storage is filling up, quickly. This is not all. Plus members get discounts(pretty good ones too) off games & entertainment. The one awesome exploit of this is that if you buy a discounted game, and keep it. Let me do an example, with lets say-- Assasins Creed 2.  The original price is $25. Plus discounts this to $15. If you buy AC2 at this price while you're on plus, you will keep it forever, even when your plus membership expires. This is different for free content. You may keep it for as long as you have youre membership active. Once it expires, you cannot play it again, and pay the original price. Aside from that small negative, plus has free trials (only for one hour though, i don't like that), exclusives, and other cool features. In theory, ive saved maybe $70+ by using Plus, and my membership isn't even halfway over!! I highly reccomendthis service. It is such an awesome thing to have, and im disapointed that i had not tried this amazing service earlier.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2013"}

To be on the safe side, you should enter the code you get here on a PS3 or PSV.The one-year PS+ subscription gives you a total of 18 games, 12 for the PS3 and 6 for the PSV (PS Vita). As Sony has increased their network speeds and also offerings over the last year, PS+ is becoming better and better. I used to prefer Xbox Live but now I prefer PS+ because the latter is easier to use and manage. The two platform-specific plans really give you different values.

{"product_name":"B003O6E800","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"Arguably the best game ever, but do you need to buy it again?","reviewText":"Answer: that depends. If you have a copy (whether a ROM, a download from Wii, or on an original N64), then probably not. If you don't currently have a copy, then you really should get this title. I'm not big on $39.99 MSRP re-releases (unless the developers completely revamp the game), but this is arguably the best game ever made (arguably! though my vote goes to FF7), and one should play this title at least once, preferable more than once. I have been playing through a copy checked out from my local library (gotta love Portland libraries!).Here is what you get: a 3-d enhanced version of the original. There are a few extras, namely the boss rush (kind of boring) and the Master mode, which is a mirror image of the original game with enemies doing 2x damage. Interesting, but not the kind of additions I would have hoped for. I would have liked perhaps an additional new dungeon or two, or maybe a new little branch of the world, perhaps a fishing side quest beyond the in game one. It IS widescreen though! Whereas the original N64 version was the square screen size.Regardless, the game is amazing, and better to have few minor extras than none at all! The 3-d really works for this title, though it's not as amazing compared to some of the games made specifically for 3ds such as Super Mario 3d land or Mario Kart 7. And with the slider, one can take the 3d off and play basically the same version as the N64, just in widescreen.The controls are different than N64, but of course they had to be thanks to the different control setup. I liked some of the changes. Having the touch screen for a few extra quick weapons was nice. The other weapons go on the X and Y keys. I kept mixing up A and B, I might go back and look at the N64 version, but I think these were backwards on the old system. L button is for targeting. In the options you can invert Y axis and set the L target to lock (recommend you do this!) instead of hold. The ability of the game to pan the camera when moving the 3ds is nice in theory, but works best when not in 3d mode. When you start moving the 3ds you lose your 3d sweet spot... But nice try.And for those who haven't played the game... It is classic Zelda in a way. It does have the 3-d environment (unlike the previous Zelda titles) and was the first true Zelda game in the 3-d style (don't talk to me about the CDi Zelda games!). But it is still hack and slash action adventure. No exp, no hp (only heart containers), and a steep difficulty ramp starting at about the Water Palace. Heck, the last boss is easy compared to the last few dungeons!If you go about finding all of the heart pieces and maxing out your inventory, this game could take 40 hours or so. I recommend not using a guide when doing this, as it's a lot of fun finding these on your own. And the world is smaller than in Twilight Princess, so it's not as exasperating trying to explore.Bottom line: buy it if you don't own it. Otherwise weight the pros and cons. Do you need to spend $40 for true 3-d as well as a Master mode? That depends on your super fan level. I won't be buying it myself thanks to ready availability at my local library. If they didn't have a copy, I would probably have broken down and bought another despite having the game already. It's fun to play it on the handheld in 3d and is a winning trip down memory lane!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2012"}

Games like this do not come around often. Ocarina Of Time is considered to be one of the most amazing video games in history. Perfectly balanced of adventure, action, puzzle solving and a very in-depth and intriguing storyline. It's also one of the most beloved games to grace any game system, but this is what made the N64 what it is today, legendary.I didn't really think this game would play so well as it does on the portable, but it does, and it feels almost as good as the N64 controller. I do miss the \"control stick\" a bit at times, but the analog pad on the 3Ds works pretty darn good. Ocarina had a lot of controls and on paper, you'd think this would be very convoluted on the 3DS, but everything works perfectly on it once you get the knack of all the controls.While I thought the 3D aspect was a gimmick before I bought the system, I can tell you, it really looks 3D on Zelda. I have to admit, I had to tone down the 3D intensity a bit, I have some minor issues with my eyes and I get headaches. When I had the 3D at max, my eyes started to hurt. I play Zelda on about 25% of the 3D engaged and seems to look and play great. The game really does look 3D and it looks a LOT better than it did on the N64. Link looks more, well, like Link, the environments are very well detailed and I appreciate what they've done, this is anything but a simple port. Sound is pretty much identical to the N64 game. Very memorable tunes and sounds great on a pair of good headphones or stereo.The game is somewhat difficult, probably not good for kids under the age of 7 or so. But anyone else should be able to jump on in. Unlike the N64, if you get stuck, there are secret caves scattered along your journey to help you on your journey. Great for the youngsters who get stuck or for those who just need some assistance.Probably until Mario, this is the best game you can get for your 3DS. Proves that newer games don't always mean better. This 1996 gem has been revamped and brought down to the portable market in amazing glory. Buy it now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2011"}

The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

On technical merits, there is no argument that any person can make that this isn't the greatest game in the series to the point that it was made.  To put it simply, the graphics are mind-blowing.  I started this game IMMEDIATELY after finishing seven, and from the opening scene, I can assure you that you won't find better in the earlier series.  As always, the sound is solid and the gameplay is well structured, so what you end up with is a game that is, in fact, technically superior to anything Square had done to that point, and is still impressive today.The concern that most people have with this game, however, has nothing to do with the technical merits, and I'll admit that there's some merit to complaints about the game's story.  While the idea that Square set out with in development is fine, ultimately, the tale fails to break out of the same old pattern that's been carved out for Final Fantasy games from the beginning.  Ostensibly a love story (and I can assure you that it works well in that regard, as the individual character development and storytelling is honest and well paced), the plot seems to vascilate schizophrenically between a poorly described threat to the survival of the world and the plight of the individual characters.  This can get frustrating at times, especially considering the fact that the story could have been told just as effectively if the writers had never worried about introducing the notion of saving the world.  In the end, however, the plot confusion turned out to be a wash for me, since the real story (the love story) is told as adeptly as the genre and cultural incompatibilities will allow.Considering the price that this game carries right now, the sheer technical impressiveness that it shows, and the great history of the series, it's probably fair to say that any Playstation gamer should add this to their collection.  At twenty dollars, just the CG movies alone are worth the price of admission, and if you're willing to learn a new advancement system (the junction system, while it infringes upon the uniqueness of individual characters, is fun in its own right), you should find that the game itself is entertaining and enjoyable to play.  While there may be some plot mistakes, in total, this game still has to be considered a smashing success, and a welcome addition to any gamer's library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2002"}

After all, its predescessor was one of the most revolutionary and best game ever created for the Dreamcast. I was not disappointed, although I would have liked some more things that the game didn't have. For one, I wish that they had released all three games on the three different platforms. Gamecube and PS2 owners got the shaft there. I bought the game for Gamecube because it had Link as an extra character. PS2 had Heihachi from the Tekken series, but I am not a fan of the Tekken series, so I didn't ncare for him. Now, I didn't think that SCII would work out well on the Gamecube. For one thing, I thought that the controls would suck. In the end, they are very comfotable and I have not noticed any big problems with the controls. On gamecube, the graphics are very clean. I also buy a lot of Gamecube games now, not being an X-Box owner, because the PS2 has very jaggy graphics. The sound on this game is pretty good. The voices are well-done, but the msuic isn't anything that sticks in your head. One big problem I have with this game is that you have to go through all of Weapon master mode to get the stages and different characters, which seems to take forever. i wish that you could just play through Arcade mode and unlock everything that way. Most fighters don't take more than a couple of hours to unlock all of the goodies. SCII does! The characters are pretty good, it's just that some are lame. Like with the little girl, I don't remember the name, who's honestly going to play as some little asian girl? I sure wouldn't. She isn't strong either. Some of the characters like that are lame. The stages are very cool, they just don't seem very real. The stages never break apart, and really aren't very critical to winning a match here, other than knocking your opponent off the edge or smashing them into a wall. One more thing. In weapon master mode, some of the goals are dumb. I wish that every stage was just normal fighting. But some are dumb, like the opponent is invincible until you knock them off of the stage or use aerial combos to KO them. Of course, the opponent does normal damage to you. It's not a fair fight! Oh well...apart from the bad things aside, Soul Calibur II will appeal to anyone who loved the first game, or any arcade fighting fanatic. My Rating-8.6.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2003"}

You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge.

Like Crystal Chronicles, Tactics uses a completely different approach in terms of battle system. Battles are still turn based but the way you control the party is very different. Regular FF games in the numbered series have your party and the enemies lined up on different sides and take turns to attack. However, in Tactics, it employed a similar system with the N64 RPG Aidyn Chronicles: you have you to move around the battle field, find vantage points to get the highest damage rate to yoru enemies. Unlike Aidyn Chronicles, which you have a very free choice of locality in terms of positioning your party, Tactics employed the grid system. So instead of a battle arena, you have your party standing on a grid battle field with varied landscape and how many grid squares you could move will depend on how fast and what level and jobs your characters are. Similar to Aidyn Chronicles, you need to position your characters at favourable spots e.g. at the back of your enemies, or standing on a higher ground in order to score the best possible damage on your enemies. The good part is the system will show you the possible hit rate and damage you would score so that you can trial and error before actually carry out the actions. It might sound hideous to taditional turn based RPG players, especially hard core FF players, but it does provide you a lot more fun in determining what kind of strategy you should use: team work or individual attacks.Battles are carried out in form of clan wars and clan mission. Clans are basically yoru party. You can have any number of people in your clan as long as you welcome them into your party, however, at the most you would only be able to use 6 in any battle. There is a huge variety and combination possibility for clan members as there are Human, Viera, Ni Mu, Bangaa and Moogle for you to choose from, and each race have their strength and weaknesses that are compatible with a huge variety of jobs to be mastered. So you would need to plan on how you want your clan to develop in the long run.Clans earn their living by taking up missions and involving in clan wars. Missions are in the form of action mission, dispatch mission and negotiation mission. Action mission involves real battle controlled by yourself but the other two involve dispatching your clan members to handle them themselves. So the more well trained your clan members are the higher chance for you to be successful in those missions. Again this involves the tactics and strategies of developing your clan members.The story is unfolded during different missions (and they tend to me more expensive ones too) so if you want to proceed with the story you would definitely need to buy missions from the pub. Also your characters will level up automatically provided they score experience points with successful actions during the battles. So if you intend to train up a strong clan make sure everyone got a chance to participate in various battles. Further the stronger your clan, the bigger is the sphere of influence of your clan and the better negotiation power your clan will have in the world of Ivalice (your clan will level up in a similar manner as your character).In all, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is a very strategic RPG game which is pretty addictive to players. Nonetheless, when you first start the games, battles might take ages to finish until your characters are strong enought to cause one or two hit kills. Lastly, always advice team works in battle and the most important is, you can link up with another GBA game with your friends and use two clans or more together to explore the world of Ivalice. Doesn't this sound cool?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2003"}

The Removable PS Vita mini-system case protects the PS Vita system and holds up to 4 game cards.","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"The Case for Everything","reviewText":"The short version of my review is this: The PSVita Pull 'N Go Folio is now my one-and-only way for me to store my PSV when I'm not using it and to carry it around. It's also where all my game cards and memory expansions are stored.The following are the main reasons I am likely to use the Pull 'N Go Folio for as long as I'll be using my Vita:_________________________________________________* STORES EVERYTHING *The folio has room for a separate Vita-only storage case that can stay Velcro attached to it or removed when needed. The Vita case should deserve its own review because it offers sufficient protection to shield your precious from harm if accidentally dropped and it's well designed built. The insides are super-smooth so there's no danger of scratching your PSV, there is a tab that helps pulling the PSV out of the case and it even has 2 grooves carved in to allow for the analog joysticks to slide in a stress-free way. It also comes with its own 4 slots for storing games.There is a mesh pocket where your power supply and related wires go. You need to be very good at packing things to fit the brick and everything else but it is doable.The inside of the opposite flap has pockets for 19 (nineteen) game cartridges. I only have 4 card-based games at this time so it should be a long time before I run out of storage - remember, there are 4 more slots at the Vita case itself.There are 2 memory card storage compartments. This is very important to us because there are 3 PSV users in our family, each using a separate card and until now storing these microscopic thingies was a concern. Now it's a concern no more.Everything is pretty tight inside when the mesh pocket has the power supply in but there was still room for a pair of in-ear headphones.* PROTECTION *The first layer of protection is the outside quilted cover. Then there is a more rigid layer underneath. Then, the PSV itself goes inside its own case which has its own soft layer with a harder base underneath. When the PSV is inside its case which is inside the folio it should survive most accidents.The soft interior protects the PSV from being scratched while going in/out of its own case and the 2 memory card pockets are the safest place for storing them that I can think of.The folio's 'looks' should make it less likely for it to be the victim of a snatch attack. There are discrete PSV logos on the zipper and embossed on the cover but 'discrete' is the word. The dark-grey quilted looks while not 'ugly' do not scream 'valuable stuff inside' while you're carrying it.* BUILD AND DESIGN *Yes, it's dark grey and yes it's quilted but almost everything appears to be good quality materials, inside and out. The plastic zippers are the kind that are not likely to jam the soft, velvety interior meets my expectations. The mesh pocket is probably the most likely to break if you are not careful but it should last if you handle it with care.The folio's size approaches the threshold of 'handle needed' but it's not there in my view. A usable handle would make it even bigger but, the way it is, the folio is small enough to be carried in one hand without effort. The quilted surface helps with the grip.* THE LOOKS *Yes, it's not the flashiest looking storage solution but I am glad it is not that way. I do not want to attract attention when I'm carrying several hundred dollars worth of PSV hardware and games in my hand.On the inside, the velvet-like interior and especially the Velcros are likely to attract dirt/lint particles and hold them there. They are hard to removed, especially those caught by the Velcros. It's one problem and I don't know how to address it other than keeping the folio and its contents away from dirt as much as possible._________________________________________________The only possible 'cons' for the folio are its size and the lint problem. The size is what it is. You need room if you want to store 'everything'. In fact, a half-inch wider portfolio that allowed more room for storing the power supply and its wires might have been the better design. The way it is, the folio is about twice the size of a Vita-only case. But let's remember that it actually has a Vita-only case that can be used independently so I mention size as a possible issue but it's not one for me. As for the lint, we'll have to live with it.I find the  Pull 'N Go Folio to be the near-perfect storage and carry accessory for our PSV and until I become aware of anything better, this is the best I know of.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000CQIDTC","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Still hard to believe that Half-Life 2: Episode One is just a game!","reviewText":"You don't have to buy HL2:EP1 on DVD, you can purchase it for download with Steam. Now, to the story so far... In the Beginning... There was nothing new much in the Half-Life game engine which was essentially just a modern hack of the Quake game engine, so how could a game that based itself on software that others developed succeed in becoming the biggest selling game of all time? When Half-Life first came out it did a couple of things right that most other first person shooters failed to do... (1)Story,(2)Story and (3)Story. Valve created Half-Life in a period of our lives when Area 51 was a hot topic among UFO buffs and the X-Files was to become mainstream family television viewing. Alien based entertainment media was a craze in the mid and late 1990's, unprecedented since the 1950s. Smack in the middle of what could be considered the most influential era for UFO enthusiasts came HALF-LIFE where YOU get to play as Gordon Freeman, a physics researcher who witnesses a freak accident in an Area 51 type facility. All hell breaks loose and YOU have to survive. No cut scenes. No initial story. No explanation. You where just there and you had to escape. Cue interactive characters that could follow you around and say a few things, maps rich in objects that you could break eventually leading up to rapid action shootouts with monsters and marines. The GOOD NEWS was that Half-Life 2 is another world beyond HL1 and was like nothing you have ever played before. It was the first person shooter 'Game of games', hands down, period. As a stand alone game, HL2 was 100% pure adrenaline, no holds barred, from start to finish. If you own a PC or Xbox then you owned HL2 because you knew your world will never be the same again after playing it. Half-Life 2 did destroy lives, educations and marriages and......WAS MORE THAN JUST A GAME! ... or at least that was the net result. Take any of the best pixel pushers out there and HL2 just mashed `em into the ground and then sets off an amazing fireworks display to welcome everyone back. How many games within the first two levels had you literally calling friends, family and neighbours to have a look at it? You had to LIVE that game. Nowhere else would you see anything as amazing as City 17. The game starts right where the previous one left off, as you are dumped into this futuristic eastern European city like something out of Orwell's 1984 following a brief meeting with the GMAN. Learning that citizens are slowly going missing from City 17 you must meet up with old friends - scientists from the first game including security guard Barney. As soon as your teleporter went wonky you where landed right in on the action with soldiers storming apartments looking for you. On the run you managed to land a hovercraft and go on to tear through flood channels ramping over obstacles while seeing full scale battlecrafts flying overhead... and when you hit them, bits break off and explode... slowly... so you give `em more heat... and more bits break off... and then they crash and burn with a roaaaaarrr! The gem of the game though was when you play with DOG and learn a neat trick with the new Gravity gun weapon. Let a few disc saws whirl and watch what happened to the bad guys or even throw a petrol canister into a group of zombies and hear them scream. The animation was hyper-realistic and your fps matched your heartbeat. It was the real deal. The characters all had their own unique personality and walk, talk and act differently. The cut scenes all looked great and where done in 1st person as you walk around the event. Like its predecessor, each level is designed with plenty of tasks to do, puzzles to solve and bad guys to mow down. Join the resistance in City 17 and win the war! If you have a thing for 1984, conspiracy theory or the New World Order, then HL2 had it all! HL2 also borrows HUGELY from other games and films you have seen, but that just makes it all the better because it seems somewhat familiar, yet ABSOLUTELY NEW. Episode One is a legit Half-Life entry in the series from Valve. It is not just a quick fix like the dissapointing \"Lost Coast\" was. This is a fully fledged game with new graphics, dynamic lighting and expansions to the plot that makes it an all important HL2.5 and quite possibly, the FPS game of 2006! Picking up where HL2 left off, Gordon and Alyx have survived the reactor explosion. A self destruction sequence is initiated in the Citadel. The two must get out of there before City-17 becomes a pile of ash. This episode opens with a helping alien hand getting you away from the GMAN and back into City-17 when Alyx's father, Eli Vance, tells you that the whole city is about blow. You are sent back into the Citadel (With DOG giving you a helping launch followed by a quick surprise ride down some tunnels) to deactivate the latest problem. The actual chamber where the orb device is being primed to detonation has some outstanding bleached out type lighting effects. There quite a few puzzles to solve along the way, some quite well thought out. The game design is also very well conceived. You can tell that lots of top designers have sat down and planned this one to the last detail. After the Citadel escapade there are some scary tunnel sequences without much lighting and some new and improved variations in the Zombie hybrids that you will enjoy. You also make lots of use of the gravity gun in HL2:EP1. Making your way through the tunnels eventually you are back out in the city. Stick around for the emergency Dr. Kleiner speech over the large public video screens. It is funny and well worth watching. The vortex of the reactor explosion is some of best rendered environmental effects seen in a game ever. It will have you in awe. There is a cool sequence through the city apartments, meeting up with Barney again, and helping groups of people evacuate by getting them through the train yards before the final escape through the country while the Citedel goes wipeout. A great finale, but much like HL2, HL2:EP1 ends rather quickly. I guess Valve probably want to do EP2 and EP3 and so on. To be honest, we should not be complaining. It is all great suspense for the price. The bottom line is that Half-Life 2: EP1 is hands down, the best 1st person shooter you can find around at the moment. It plays more like a movie than any other game to date. HL2 lovers MUST PLAY THIS. It is an official valve release and well worth the price-tag for the quality of the graphics and adventure. Just remember that it is not a full blown game, but for the price you get around 6 hours of solid all new Half-Life game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2006"}
{"product_name":"B001QXNBJM","reviewerName":"J. Shafer","summary":"Still In Good Company","reviewText":"Battlefield Bad Company 2 is the in-direct sequel to the original game that came out a few years ago.  With a few exceptions, this game surpasses its predecessor in every way.When I say that this is an indirect sequel, I mean it in the sense that the story has no relation at all to the story from the original and the personalities of the characters are almost entirely different.  The story from the first game was the same plot of the movies Kellys Heroes and Three Kings; a ragtag squad go behind enemy lines in order to steal a large sum of gold for an early retirement.  At the end the heroes get the gold and drive off into the sunset to start a new life and go their seperate ways, however the person they steal it from still wants to his revenge.  For some reason, the writers decided to scrap everything that we knew and instead came up with something different.  At no point in Bad Company 2 do we ever see or so much as hear about the gold or the person that they stole it from.  Your given a sense of the original game never happening at all.  I understand that they tried to take a more serious approach for this game, but when you make a sequel, the story should be a direct continuation of what happened before instead of completely trashing it and starting something new.  Also the story has been done a hundred times before and there is nothing new or original here.  Youd be better off watching any two random war movies and you would get the same, if not a better experience that you would from the story of this game.  Not to mention that the length of the story is stupid short and can easily be completed in an afternoon.The characters took a turn for the worse, even though they are still a likeable cast.  Preston is now a gung-ho who makes everyone continue on for the sake of the country.  Sweetwater is still the big nerd.  Haggard is now a right-wing redneck that acts his part way to effectively and too often.  Sarge is the gritty black sergeant that still orders everyone around with a bad attitude.  While their personalities are still similiar, they act too serious.  There is still some humor around but not as often and not as funny as the first game.  The witty bantor between Sweetwater and Haggard is no longer there and instead there now a relationship based almost entirely off of friendly abuse.  What made these characters likeable was their snarky attitude towards everything and the ability to randomly interject humor throughout the game.  They were too direct with what they said or did instead of giving us a sense as to who they were without saying anything like the first game did.  While they are still likeable in this game, they just arent the same as before.Despite having a mediocre story and a cast that has partially changed, the multiplyaer is still what stands out as the best FPS multiplayer on the Xbox today.  All of the issues from the first game have now been fixed and there is now a sense of balance between the classes.  No longer is the assault class worthless.  No longer can sub-machine guns snipe people from the opposite side of the map.  No longer can a single person take out an objective in Rush by themselves.  Every class is effective in their own way and you get a better sense of teamwork than you did in the first game.  If you want to live, you need the skills of all classes in order to do so instead of one or two from the last game.  My only real complaint that I have for multiplayer is that you cant access all of the maps for all modes.  Conquest easily surpases Rush, however Rush arguably has the better maps to play on.  I think it would make the game alot better if the different modes werent restricted to certain maps.Overall, this game is great.  While the single player is lacking, the multiplayer more than makes up for it.  If you dont have this game, go buy it now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2010"}

I personally always have one master save and one auto save feature. Anymore than 6 different save files with 3 different characters is when things get iffy. Also don't litter items around towns/dungeons/etc, instead think of a way to get rid of them. Examples: give them to your partner, sell them at a store, or collect stuff in a chest at your house.

{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"J. Gordon","summary":"The GTA series gets a \"reboot\"- EDITED 9/29/13","reviewText":"EDIT: It's been over 5 years since GTA IV came out.  In the interim, I've replayed some of the prior GTA games, as well as a bit of the newest one, GTA V (hopefully I'll get to reviewing it in the forseeable future).  I've also played Saints Row 2 and 3, Just Cause 2, and Rockstar's open world western, Red Dead Redemption.  Having re-examined the game in both the light of what came before and after it, I felt the 5 star rating I gave it was too high.Outside of Halo 3, GTA IV was perhaps one of the most hyped games of this generation; in fact, some would say it was overhyped.  Glowing, almost slobbering previews from the press helped create expectations that could never be met.  The question is, how does it stack up to the journalistic praise?First of all, I have to note that there have been both a lot of \"revisionist\" positive reviews that tell us that less variety and content (as compared to GTA: San Andreas) is somehow a good thing, and a lot of excessively negative reviews that gloss over the positive changes this entry has made.  The truth is that while the game could've been more (and needed to be if it was to truly win all the perfect reviews it got), what we got was not at all a poor or skimpy game.  And it all starts with the city.Like the first game in the GTA III trilogy (GTA 3, Vice City, San Andreas), GTA IV takes place in Liberty City, a fictional, crime-ridden metropolis.  This time, however, Liberty City is a much bigger place than before.  The scale of the environment compared to your character is much larger than before, and the maps you may have seen of Liberty City don't really convey this.  In addition, things such as the level of detail, lighting, and other graphical effects have been pumped up more than a little.  Night-time now makes the same area you saw in the daytime look completely different than before, while the lighting and weather engine upgrades make every day a potentially unique experience, and really accentuate the early morning and late afternoon periods with some dramatic effects.  People are now animated much better than before (and are affected by the new physics engine), and the whole game has an interesting look that's almost akin to impressionistic oil paintings.  The game environments are divided into 5 districts, which are distorted and compacted versions of real life counterparts: Broker (Brooklyn), Dukes (Queens), Bohan (the Bronx), Algonquin (Manhattan), and Alderney (Eastern New Jersey).  Unlike the disappointing (and buggy) True Crime: NYC, the areas have been streamlined and altered enough so that you don't end up driving through endless, identical, flat, square city blocks put in there just because they're present in real life.  Fans of the original GTA III will see a few familiar-looking sights, as Broker's elevated train tracks and brownstones will bring back memories of Portland.  Other than that type of basic similarity, Liberty City is a whole new animal.And as a result, you're also given new game mechanics to survive.  The most notable are the aiming system (allowing for both autotargeting using an instinctual flick of the right stick combined with the triggers, and a manual aim similar to Gears of War), and the cover system (which allows you to take cover behind a large percentage of objects, including cars).  This transforms firefights from the almost random shootouts of the past into more dynamic, entertaining, and tactical encounters.  However, the bad news is that it's still not as intuitive in terms of aiming as Saints Row 2, or Just Cause 2.  You also have a cell phone, which is a big part of the game.  GTA IV relies heavily on your relationships with characters, and you'll find yourself both calling them, and getting called by them.  The downside is that these calls are a bit too frequent, especially when you just want to wander around, and cause mayhem (although you can put the phone on sleep mode), and ignoring phone calls can have consequences for the goodwill you'll be trying to maintain with these people.  I would say that the handling of the cell phone in this game was a real lost opportunity, as it became a source of annoyance, rather than a cool way to open up optional interaction with the other characters.  Car physics have been altered, and can be hard to adjust to. At first, I actually liked the handling better in this game than prior installments, as using the handbrake results in some truly great cornering.  However, after not only revisiting the GTA 3 trilogy, but also seeing how Rockstar improved handling in GTA V, it ends up still feeling somewhat cumbersome.  Both swimming and climbing over objects are still in the game, with swimming simplified, and the climbing mechanic developed more fully than before.  However, overall movement in the game, while it looks much more cool and realistic than in the past entries, feels somewhat slow and clumsy.As Niko Bellic, an Eastern European veteran of an unnamed war who is lured to America by his cousin's exaggerated promises of success, the player is given both a reason for being an expert at combat, and a great starting point for the story.  The characters are some of the best the series has seen, whether it's your likeable, debt-ridden cousin Roman, the hilarious Brucie (I can't even begin to describe him), or \"community activist\" Manny.  There are also some \"random missions\" that are triggered by your choice of whether to spare some of your mission targets throughout the game.  Furthermore, the new wanted level system (in which the police have a specific search radius you must escape, as opposed to the random cop spawning of the past) makes the chaotic gunfights of both the story missions and extracurricular chaos less of a potential buzzkill when the cops take notice.  The story is further enhanced by features such as a number of parodic TV shows you can watch, a functional in-game Internet (complete with all manner of spot-on websites), and other social entertainment, such as comedy clubs, a cabaret show, and even the ability to get drunk with a friend or a girl (with a swaying camera effect not designed for the easily nauseated).The bad news is that some of the variety and content that you've come to expect is MIA.  While the new, two-tiered vigilante system is great, for some reason, you don't get any money or other rewards from it.  Standbys such as ambulance, firefighter, and even pizza delivery missions are missing, while the taxi missions are not only only present for a short period of time, but are also a pain to start.  While I wasn't a huge fan of a number of those side missions, they did add to the variety of the prior games.  Also, while the new Liberty City isn't that incredibly small compared to San Andreas (the consensus appears to be that it's about 60-75% the size of San Andreas), the fact that it's mostly urban areas lends a bit of monotony to the experience (even if there's identifiable and distinct looks to the various areas, and plenty of trees, parks and beaches).  You won't be finding any flyable airplanes here, and the variety of helicopters is markedly lower than in San Andreas.  I also miss the flamethrowers from past games, and despite what the apologists may say, the jetpack from San Andreas would've been a cool carryover to this game.  And this is where, in comparison, I realize my prior rating of 5 stars for GTA IV was excessive.  While I understand that this was the first GTA of the HD generation, and there was an inevitable learning curve, it still doesn't eliminate that nagging feeling of claustrophobia in not only the smaller, less varied (if very authentically detailed) environment, but also in the range of what you could do.  Less weapons, no stats, no planes, less types of activities, less clothing options, less safehouses- the loss of content becomes palpable after playing through GTA IV and then revisiting San Andreas.Despite these (and other) issues and the game's overhype, the game is still a pretty good game if you take it for what it is. There's also a multiplayer mode that I haven't played myself, but sounds fun for people who are into social gaming.  As far as the version to get, I chose the Xbox 360 version mostly due to the ability to have a custom soundtrack, which wasn't present on the PS3 version (at least at launch- for all I know, there could be a downloadable update).  Beyond that, the choice of version appears to come down to nitpicking graphical differences, and what console you feel more comfortable with.In the end, while this isn't the \"greatest game of all time\" that people claim it is, it really is quite good. If you're looking for a game a bit more for the atmosphere than just raw gameplay fun, it's worth the price.  It won't knock San Andreas off its throne due to its scaled back ambition, but it has its own place.  For the first time, a game really created a city that feels like, well, a real modern city.  Putting aside the fact that this game doesn't have much scope outside the hefty storyline, it's still a game I'd recommend.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"Semschy \"Gamer\"","summary":"Can I give it 6 out of 5 stars?","reviewText":"First off, if you're reading these reviews, trying to decide whether to get this game, stop reading now and BUY IT!!  You will NOT be disappointed.FIRST IMPRESSIONThis must be one of the first reviews because I must be one of the few who can tear myself away from playing long enough to write a review.  I purchased GTA IV at midnight and only got to play a few hours before the thought of getting no sleep before work the next day caught up with me.First impressions:  does it live up to the hype?  Yes!  I was afraid GTA IV would be over hyped and would be a disappointment.  It has the same feel as previous GTA's.  I was also afraid they would change the controls too much in going to a new system, but the controls are very comfortable and feel familiar.I haven't had a chance to play any of the multiplayer content, but any time during single player all you do is hit up on your d-pad to bring up your cell phone and select multiplayer.  (I accidentally did this trying to change the radio)Based on what I've seen so far I will be spending many hours playing through the single player campaign, playing online multiplayer with friends and beating up hookers when I'm frustrated with either one.END FIRST IMPRESSIONUpdate:  As impressed as I was with the beginning of the game, it only gets better and better.  GTA IV is EVERYTHING you love about the previous GTA chapters, but EVERYTHING is bigger and better.  The actions of NPCs are more realistic too.  For example you can't pull into Pay n Spray right in front of a cop and get off Scott free.  You have to make sure no cop sees you pull in.  To start a vigilante mission you come to a complete stop in a police car and access the onboard laptop.  From here you can pull up crimes in progress, the most wanted list and even call for backup.  Unlike previous games, when you're hunting criminals as a vigilante the police are actually on your side instead of trying to stop you.You can watch TV, access the internet at internet cafes.  You can go bowling, play darts, watch an on stage performance.  You can even pick up bricks from a construction yard and throw them through shop windows.Story:  This is a very deep drama.  For the first time in a video game I heard the mention of a soul.  You no longer come in contact with one dimensional caricatures.  All of the main characters are complex individuals.  If the GTA III series was a goofy cartoon, then GTA IV is a serious dramatic action movie.Sound:  The song list is awesome!  You wake up in your crappy apartment to the sound of  Smashing Pumpkins - \"1979\" or ELO - \"Evil Woman\" playing on the radio.  The internet caf&eacute; has the song from the first trailer playing.  While playing Vice City I would change the station every time the Giggle Cream commercial came on.  I haven't heard anything on the radio annoying enough to make me change it.Graphics:  The graphics are awesome!  GTA IV won't dethrone Gears of War or Assassin's Creed as the best next gen graphics, but if Gears of War is a 10 then GTA IV is a 9.  Of course keep in mind that GTA IV has a HUGE draw distance and NO load screens while in Gears of War you have to wait for relatively small maps to load.Gameplay:  This is what matters the most.  Is the game fun to play?  YES!  You are set loose in a huge adult playground where you can do just about anything you can think of.  You want to punch someone for looking at you funny as you walk by?  Go for it!  You want to steal any vehicle you see? Do it!  You want to go on a date?  Call up your girlfriend.  You want to go shoot darts with Roman?  Give him a buzz.Controls:  I played all of the previous GTA's on PS2 so I can't compare the current controls to Xbox controls.  (From what I hear you had to have a third hand to do a driveby without the extra shoulder buttons)  On foot the controls are about the same as San Andreas.  You use LT (L1) to auto aim and RT (R1) to shoot.  A cover system has been added, which makes shootouts a lot more dynamic.  Blind firing around a corner is really cool.Driving is a LOT different though.  RT is gas, LT is brake, RB is E-brake and LB is shoot.  You no longer use L2 and R2 to aim 90 degrees left and right to do a drive by.  You can lean out the window and use the right thumb stick to move the camera and shoot cars in front of you and to the side.  This is really hard to get used to, but I have a feeling once I figure it out, it will be VERY rewarding later on.  (You can pick the classic control setup, but I can't comment on this as I haven't tried it yet)  Also all of the cars have REALLY loose suspension and lots of momentum.  This means pulling the E-brake to make a turn causes you to do a 180 and slide past your turn.  You have to actually slow down to make turns.The Bad:  After singing its praises I have to mention at least one bad thing.  I've only noticed VERY minor visual glitches.  For example as I crouched next to a building my face went through the wall.  Another bad thing about GTA IV is that it's too good.  It will totally ruin every other \"Urban Shooter\" out there.  It has set the standard for next gen video game quality.  I predict that no other game will even be able to touch GTA IV for a VERY long time.If you're still undecided about whether to get GTA IV after reading my review and several other glowing reviews, then check out what the pros say.  Check out metacritic.com.  As of posting this review it is THE highest rated game on there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000F3AADE","description":"Dead Rising follows the harrowing tale of Frank West, a freelance photojournalist after the scoop of a lifetime. In a small suburban town that's overrun by zombies, he escapes to the local shopping mall, thinking it will be safe. Now it's a standoff, with zombies unable to get Frank, but him unable to get out & escape. Fortunately, he's got an entire mall at his disposal. Utilize everything you can find to fight off the flesh-hungry mob and search for the truth behind the horrendous epidemic.","reviewerName":"Lestor neeker Wong","summary":"Dawn of the Dead","reviewText":"Killing zombies is a fun activity, and Capcom certainly knows that. The makers of the immensely popular Resident Evil series return with a new zombie fest, Dead Rising, exclusively for Microsoft's XBox 360. Unlike Resident Evil, however, Dead Rising is not exactly a \"survival horror\" game. Survival, yes, since the game requires you to stay alive for as long as possible, so that you can discover the truth behind a zombie infestation in a fictitious town in Colorado. Horror, not a hint of it, since the zombies are more comical than scary. Still, the game takes the zombies genre, and throw them into a free-roaming, sandbox adventure environment, and the result is remarkable. In fact, Dead Rising is so good, it has already taken its place in my top five games of the year.Playing as freelance photojournalist Frank West, you begin the game by stumbling upon a military quarantine in the sleepy town of Willamette. Sensing something amiss, you hire a chopper to take you up for an overview of the happenings in the town. Not surprisingly, you see zombies everywhere, and you decide that you should infiltrate the area to find out more, just so that you can take some pictures for your story. You land on a helipad on the rooftop of a shopping mall, instruct the pilot to return in three days, and begin your quest to the truth surrounding this mess.With the pilot due to return in three days, you've 72 hours (in-game time - 24 hours in the game take roughly two real hours to complete) to solve the mystery, Very soon into the game, you'll get to meet many survivors from the zombies onslaught, and some of these people will be involved in the \"cases\" of this game. To find out the truth, you'll need to complete all these cases (eight of them in all), and be at the helipad at the agreed time when the pilot returns. While doing cases, you'll also come across scoop missions, which are optional side quests that fill up the gaps in between (and sometimes contradicting) cases. Scoops usually take the form of escorting survivors, but they also involve the occasional fetch missions, and boss fights.The game plays like an action RPG, as Frank earns Prestige Points (PP) as you progress. Solving cases, doing scoops and fight bosses obviously bring in the bulk of the PP. However, you can also earn additional PP by doing simple things like heating up a stove in the restaurant, and taking a space ride in the wonderland of the mall. The mall itself is reasonable large enough for exploration, but you'd probably not have enough time to see it all if you intend to get the best ending for the game, since the compulsory missions are all time-based, and have time limits. For example, if the game requires you to be at a certain location at a certain time to initiate a case, not being there at that time will render all future cases expired, and \"the truth will vanish into the darkness\". Such is the pressure exerted by Capcom, you'd probably have to replay the game a few times to explore the various secrets and Easter Eggs that are littered around in the mall.This game also has a highly publicized save system. For the uninitiated, the game only allows one save slot, which tends to make things more difficult than they should. Since missions are time-sensitive, there's always the possibility of saving your game at a \"wrong time\", thus rendering all future cases redundant if you didn't give yourself enough time to start the next case. Capcom have admitted that this is a deliberate move to up the game's difficulty level, but despite the kind intentions, it still feels like a cheap move to lengthen the game's eight hours (if you're going for the best ending) of gameplay. Nevertheless, if you've to restart the game all over again (which I did), take heart that you'll at least keep your current level, skills and statistics for the new game. These make it easier to blast through missions already completed before in a faster fashion.Apart from slaying zombies and rescuing survivors, there are also some useless, but fun things to do in the mall. For example, the game includes plenty of outfits for you to change into. Don't like the costume that you begin with? No worries. Head down to any of the plazas, and check out the shops there. Chances are, you'll find something that suits your tastes. Don't like your hair color? Well, you can dye your hair. Want some cool accessories? How about some sunglasses and caps? It's all in the mall, and it'd take you some time before you can wear them all. If you're absolutely free, and aren't concerned with solving the cases, you can go on a run like this just to try out all the available clothes. The game also has unlockable costumes, usually unlocked after you gain an achievement. One of these is a Mega Man costume, and the accompanying Mega Buster. Fancy running around the mall, and shooting zombies as Mega Man? You can do it, if you manage to do the required achievements.Clothes are not the only distraction in the game. The mall also has a collection of food, and eating them all results in another achievement unlocked. Food replenishes your health, and mixing them with a blender will also create juices that you can use to fight better. For example, mixing two packets of milk will create the Quickstep Juice, which allows you to run faster than normal. Trying out the different combination for juices, as such, become another sidetrack task to do.To make the task of killing zombies less tedious, Capcom also throws in plenty of weapons at your disposal. You'll begin with simple baseball bats and 2X4s, but as you progress, almost everything that can be held in your hands will become your weapons. Handguns, chainsaws and even stuffed toys are just some of the example of the wide array of arsenal at your disposal. Whether you prefer melee style fighting, or long-range FPS style of taking down your opponents, Dead Rising will have something for you. It also helps when the killing processes are so beautifully presented.Talking about presentations, Dead Rising is a game that combines great graphics and audio effects. The colors are vibrant, and are a joy to look at. The music scores are great, throwing in different themes for different areas of the mall. The voice-acting is awesome, telling the story superbly without sounding awkward. In a nutshell, the presentation is what you'd expect from a next-gen game. Unfortunately, Capcom have taken this next-gen thing a little too far, by including texts that can only be read legibly on a HDTV. Yes, we know that this is a next-gen game, but not everyone owns a HDTV. What's wrong with having a SDTV option for people like, you know, us? Also, while voice-overs are included for the cut-scenes, the in-game conversations are all text-based. If you don't have a HDTV, chances are you'll miss out some parts of the story, just because Capcom got lazy.Still, Dead Rising is a really great game despite its flaws. Its issues are unfortunate (and you can tell Capcom about them by doing an online survey), but it strengths make it a must-play if you own an X360. Just make sure you save up for a HDTV if you want a better experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2006"}

That's where things get interesting.While I've been a Kingdom Hearts fan since the beginning, I'll be quite honest in saying that not every game (since the first) has moved me in anyway. I did like KH:358/2 Days but only because it had mission-based gameplay(like FFVII:Crisis Core on the PSP) and I like that kind of gameplay. When I purchased Kingdom Hearts Re:coded, I wasn't expecting too much from it as (seeing screenshots on the game) I was expecting it to be the first Kingdom Hearts all over again with a little new gameplay added on. I'm quite surprised as it's quite different than what I was expecting. Sure, the environments are recycled and the story is a little thin but the gamplay is what saves the day with this game. There's quite a bit of variety in the gameplay in this game and that's what's the saving grace in the game. You have 2-D platforming, turn-based battles and more. I've had a great time playing the game as it provided me some good challenge. Square needs to explore this alot more in future KH titles.As for the graphics, I don't know how Square Enix keeps on doing it. They did faithful recreations of the worlds from the first Kingdom Hearts and it looks absolutely stunning, easily besting 358/2 Days.The only quibble I have with the game(which seems to be everyones' gripe) is with the camera. You'd think, after so many KH games, Square Enix would finally get the camera right. Nope.Honestly, in my opinion, this has be the second best game in the Kingdom Hearts series.

It is equally pleasurable to play a game that unfolds with all the tongue-in-cheek seediness of a revisionist gangster film like Grand Theft Auto 3.  Bloody (bloodier with the codes) good fun.  I'm still overjoyed that companies like Rock Star (the blokes who made this classic) are starting to make video games for adults that A)don't insult the intellect, and B)aren't concerned in the least with pleasing the parents of a damned six-year-old boy.  I would have to rank this as the second-best game I have ever played, behind only Perfect Dark (which is showing its years).  I do think the gunfights are poorly designed, but the racing engine is balls-out.  The graphics are above-average PS2 quality, but if you are looking for visuals, check out GT3:A-Spec.

Just take Grand Theft Auto 3 for a spin and after 5 minutes, you'll see what I mean. Because this isn't the 2D paper graphic crime-sim found in the first two instalments that made you sick to your stomach trying to move around the city. Third times the charm they say, as now there's a huge 3D world of pedestrians, mobsters, cars, guns and even pimps just waiting to be mauled by your hand. Tempted? Who wouldn't be? After all Grand Theft Auto 3 is the most incredible game I've seen in a long time, it shattered all expectations I had for it, and let me tell you I was expecting a hell of a lot from this one.You're the nameless thug once again, a small-time crook who's betrayed and left for dead during a bank robbery gone stale. Now, an escaped convict, with the help of a bombs expert 8-Ball, you'll easily become Liberty Cities number one with a bullet in no time. Jobs begin small, giving rides to various mafia members, stealing cars and occasionally clubbing someone to \"customers\" of your employers, but as you move you're way up, you'll soon find yourself performing tasks worthy of \"The Professional\" stature. There are various people and organizations who will offer jobs around the city; these can be accepted by stopping by their place of business or answering pay phones on the street. And if completed you'll be rewarded with cold hard cash and accomplishing certain mission's gives you access to new weapons and safe houses.Along with money, comes protection just like the others which is a very nice addition to Grand Theft's gameplay, if the cops are after you and are led to an area where you have accomplished missions (Lets say the Mafia area) the mobsters walking on the street will help kill them off. However, along with this comes my first complaint with Grand Theft Auto 3, progressing through the story you're bound to make one group pissed off, therefore, any time you may be walking through they'll try to kill you, which is believable when you're on foot since they have a face to see but these people even know it's you when you're in a car with tinted windows! This makes in extremely frustrating when certain missions require you to back track. Apparently they still haven't seen a need to fix that problem that even plagued the first two.The missions offered contain a nice versatile selection, throughout the game so you won't feel like you're repeating the same task again and again just with the difficulty levelled up. It can vary from little tasks like swatting some annoying drug dealers scattered around the city, stealing fancy automobiles for a collector and escorting your mob bosses in a limo to a meeting. However, once the kiddy work is over, things really heat up, blowing up a docked ship in the harbor, breaking someone out of prison and holding off a group of heavily armed Columbians with military class weaponry. Fortunately these missions increase at a nice pace so you'll never feel that the task is too hard and way out of your leagueA very helpful addition to Grand Theft Auto's gameplay is the ability to prepare for you missions, if you play through once and fail, you can take the job again, but this time around if you now what to expect you can literally use the city to your advantage. For example, in one mission you must kill a Godfather like character before he reaches his mansion; he has two escort cars containing armed personnel. So, remember where his house was and utilizing the gate that leads into his mansion, I set two vans in the way of the entrance so his limo would have to push pretty hard to break through. Using this time, I jumped on top of one of the parked vans and shot his guards, then dropped a grenade onto his hood and ran for cover. And you'd better believe it worked.This game has so much freedom in all the things you can do, as you probably guess from what I said above, it seems like the game that contains all of those times when you said \"I wish I could do that\" in a game. You can steal any car you want and even keep it by parking it in a garage so it's there whenever you want it, plow down sidewalks, leap off of ramps, ride in a police boat armed with machine guns or find a nice rooftop and pick off people with a sniper rifle. So much freedom, you'll say this is a \"real\" world.The cities are huge and connected in three parts, and get this the only time this game has to load (which is only about 6 seconds within itself) is when you go to a different part of the city you could spend as long as you want in one area and never have a loading time, or even a split-second of slowdown. Every you'll visit is huge with people littering the streets, some of which may even try to steal your car if you're not paying attention. There's dozens of classes for pedestrians you'll encounter, the rich girl, hillbilly, gangster, prostitutes, bums (some even have a bottle of alcohol that can be used as a Molotov cocktail) and my favourite the gay construction worker. All of them spit out various one liners that are quite amusing, as are the many radio ads and call-in-shows like Chatterbox, they all work to give things a better sense of reality.But cause enough trouble and the boys in blue will come running. Your \"Wanted Meter\" is displayed by 6 stars, if one lights up you'll have officers on foot who'll try to beat you down, get two stars and they'll use guns, three and the police helicopters come as well as the S.W.A.T. teams. And if you survive four, the fifth will bring M-16 toting F.B.I. agents and if all else fails, six stars brings in the tanks, by then, you're pretty much screwed, buy kudos for lasting that long. When arrested you'll automatically fail any mission that's in progress and wind up at the police station (feel free to take one of the parked police cars if you'd like), or when you're life reaches zero you'll wind up at the hospital, but rest easy knowing there's no lives or the number of chances you get. You can keep coming back as often as you want.Here I've written two pages and almost on my third, and there's still so much to tell about what Grand Theft Auto 3 has to offer. So I'm better off just saying that Grand Theft Auto 3 is by far the most fun I've had in years. A fan of the first two or not, I can guarantee everyone will love this game as much as I did, you'd be insane not to add this to your PS2 collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2002"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GX88","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Infamous 2 = Infamous 1.5","reviewText":"Infamous 2 continues the tale of Cole MacGrath, traveling to New Marais ahead of the Beast, a monster bent on destroying the world, and only Cole can stop it with the help of his best friend Zeke and a handful of allies.The story picks up fairly well, though I scratch my head as to why they bent over backwards to avoid spoiling the plot of the original. While I can appereciate the effort, given how long the original Infamous has been out, it doesn't seem necessary. This apparently also gives them the latitude to assume that everyone playing the current incarnation has no idea what was contained in the original, and allows them to repeat the entire initial game. All of the powers are repeats, with the exception of a handful of add-ons and the new elemental power that can be acquired later in the game. So you're left with the feeling that you're playing the exact same game for a second time for the majority. While I can understand that they need to allow you to continue building your character and his abilities, there were far more options than hitting the \"reset\" button.Also missing are the multiple factions. Rather than multiple groups competing against one another, your left with 2, and both against Cole. While it simplifies certain things and helps drive the story, its bizzare when yo reach a certain point. The Godzilla-like boss encounters are a nice deviation, but the mini-boss Conduit encounters are tedious in the extreme. Also absent are all the other Conduits, which I expected far more of given the overall storyline.Graphics are a surprising let-down. While the environments are great, especially the water-flooded bayou which is anathema to Cole, there are oceans of clipping and catchment errors. I pulled myself over a ledge and into a building several times, resulting in odd glitches and crashes without any efforts to seek them out. Probably the best portion comes with character editing, but even there its something of a misnomer, as you recieve every side quest from the same 3 people, with the exception that they wear fake mustaches and wigs that don't move in time with their faces.Audio is spot-on, but thats not really a bar anymore. Given tech, bad audio is more a rarity than decent.Gameplay is hit-and-miss. Its in true form to Infamous 1, in that there are really 3 side quests that're repeatedly repackaged and spoon-fed to you. There are a few exceptions, but sadly those writers with original ideas were apparently shouted down in favor of tedious monotony and pointless mass fight missions. The karma missions lift the bar slightly, but only just.Karma manages to be handled far better, as its more between selfishness and selflessness, so you're not devouring babies, but you're still hated for solely looking out for No. 1. And character modification is toned down slightly, so you no longer look like Darth Vader if you choose to be Infamous.Overall, a repackage, which is a shame. Given a little more freedom, this could've be handled in much better style, and without forcing you to replay the same missions over and over. Better writing, more characters, and mission design would've launched this easily to 5 stars, but its left as a mush of a good story struggling under the weight of its monotony. Slinging lightning is as fun as ever, but outside of the main story missions the game is just... boring.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2011"}

And in fact I only played it for a short time before I moved on to other games. I've since tried to get back into it, but since I had issues getting the game running again (odd patch issues), I haven't done so.So when Spec Ops: The Line was available for free for PlayStation Plus, and I saw that it was similar to SOCOM (3rd-person, with squad-based gameplay) I was intrigued. A quick look at a YouTube review which noted the story this game borrows from, and I was interested.That was Saturday morning. By Saturday night I had finished the game on the second hardest difficulty (the highest initially unlocked) and just picked the remaining trophies that I'll grab this morning.Outside of thinking that the main character's name is Nathan Drake (same voice actor), I have to say Spec Ops: The Line was a great choice, and something I would have absolutely paid money for.Despite being a squad-based shooter, the game plays farily fast, with the 15 chapters and epilogue flying by.The story is top rate, because of where it draws inspiration from, and as the game progresses you really feel it, especially during some of the decisions you're allowed to make. There's a couple obvious points where you know how it's going to end, but despite that it was still interesting to see how it got there, and what happened to the characters when it did.The voice actors across the board are extremely good, with the voices matching well how the characters should actually be feeling had this really happened to them.There is a multiplayer component, but I didn't bother with it. After the fact I actually read that an individual tied to the game was disappointed in it, and felt it was needlessly tacked on.There's no doubt in my mind that I'm giving Spec Ops: The Line 5 of 5 stars. The story is top-notch, and it doesn't needlessly waste your time by dragging things out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2013"}

The guns sound convincing and the bullets hit with a satisfying \"thup\". I played Max Payne 3 immediately after this and was disappointed with it's gameplay at first (it grew on me eventually). The campaign's length was a good 6 to 8 hours and the multiple endings gave the game some replay value.I have no great love for military shooters but Spec Ops: The Line is an exception.

I LOVED my old PS2, and was waiting for the price to come down on the PS3. Not only did the price come, but they added the 120gb hard drive. I own no PS2 games anymore, so backwards compatible means nothing to me as I bought this to play PS3 games and watch Blu Ray movies.I love this consoles. I own Buzz (5 stars), Motorstorm (4) and Madden NFL 10 (5 - best football game ever) and am very pleased.The only negatives I have for the console is having to install the demos after they are downloaded and before you can play them. {EDIT: This seems to have changed as you no longer have to do a manual install of downloaded demos/games.} Can be 3-6 minutes per game. Same thing with most disc games there is a small install once. Not a huge issue, but a bit annoying.This is a super QUITE console, and does not get that hot. The classic PlayStation controller is still here, and I still love it.All in all, for [...], this is the best console for the money. Blu-Ray, free online and built in wireless alone will have you getting your money worth, and to me, making it a MUCH better deal over the 360.Many things can be argued about the quality of the 360 exclusives vs. the PS3 exclusives (including the downloadable games). That being said, MOST games are cross platform or will eventually go cross platform. Just WAY too many users on each system to shut out the potential revenue streams by making a game an exclusive for either console (360 or PS3, Wii is not in this league).Heck, I originally bought a 360 for BioShock, then it came out for PS3 months (year?) later.

While it is extremely fun, it has technical problems which should be noticed and penalised.  For example, your team will take reaction shots through solid walls and tanks, so there are serious line-of-sight issues.  The camera is also known to show some terrible angles or get glitchy.  Another problem that a lot of people are complaining about online is the mobile high-powered gun turrets, called SHIVs in the game.  They just don't work.  There are reports of various problems including SHIVs that cannot be selected to go on a mission.  I built a hover SHIV, which would neither hover nor shoot.

After I flushed Rage on eBay, I went back to R3 for some online play here and there and it is a lot of fun.  After the fixes I am upgrading the review one star since it plays pretty much perfect now.****A quick note:  The game manual comes with an online pass code you redeem through PSN to play competitive multiplayer.  If you want to buy this used down the line to just play through the campaign and pick up the trophies, it's no big deal.  But you probably won't be able to play online unless you buy the game new.Ok on to business...I did not like Resistance 2.  In fact, I never finished the game.  The whole thing felt unfinished - big time.  The guns were creative, but never felt very powerful.  Graphically, it looked ok in spots, but there were so many rough edges and glitches, it was a disappointing release for insomniac.  The Co-op was good in some ways, bad in others.  This mode felt more like World of Warcraft than it did Resistance because every single bullet spray produced rampant amounts of XP.  Also it felt like a totally different game on the gameplay side.  The online MP could be fun, but the bullet damage needed to bring an enemy down was frustrating sometimes.  I played the demo for the very first game waaay back when, but it didn't ever grab me.  The third installment in a series can be the weakest, but this is not the case with Resistance 3.  This is a really good game.First my favorite aspect of Resistance 3, is naturally the shooting.  The weapons are all excellent.  Each shot feels powerful from the trigger to the sound.  And you have many weapons to use.  This is not like a lot of other FPS games where you carry two, Insomniac loads you up and you can carry tons.  The Chimera AI isn't bad, they don't do the side step dance the Brutes in Halo Reach avoid shots with, but they can still be formidable in numbers.  The levels are pretty well laid out.  There isn't much in the way of exploration, but there is plenty in the way of bullet fodder to keep you moving. There are some dark levels that feel a lot like Left4Dead that keep you on the run too.  Start playing the game on HARD difficulty - it feels right.  I think it should have been the \"Normal\" setting from the get go.  The visuals are a big improvement from before - there is a very gritty feel to everything.  The story?  Meh, but if you are going to tell me with a straight face Killzone, Gears of War or even any of the HALO games were more than a total nonsense excuse to kill aliens either - I will call shenanigans.  This is not Uncharted 2 granted, but it would be hard to find this type of firepower anywhere else.Multiplayer is pretty much what every other FPS or Third person action game has these days - I prefer the Breach mode where you have to destroy an opposing team's reactors, but in a few weeks there will DLC coming, which normally I would be agnostic to, but in this game, I feel it would be a lot of fun with the style of enemies and the wicked weapons at your disposal.  Bring it on.If you were on the fence on this one, I'd say go for it.  This is such a big step from the last game you can't go wrong.***Just to clarify.  The PSN pass is FREE for online play with purchase.  The issue would be if you bought a copy used and the code had already been redeemed.  If you do buy it used, its $10 for the pass on he PSN Store.***edit: Ive read a few reviews unhappy with the ending.  Spoilers) because there really isnt a final boss.

{"product_name":"B00001X50M","description":"You are Solid Snake, a superspy who's half James Bond, half Snake Plissken, and you are mean. Your mission isn't terribly new (infiltrate a terrorist base and blow everything up), but the gameplay is: your numerous enemies are watching for you, and you are encouraged to sneak rather than simply charge in. Every level brings new challenges. You fight snipers, invisible ninjas, psychic warriors, and even an M-1 tank! As the father of the modern spy game genre, this game is an instant classic.Your allies and superiors speak to you via a cool, implanted radio,  monitoring your progress, offering  tips--but failing to give you the full story. The combination of a mysterious and engaging plot and high in-game tension makes this a thrilling ride. Campy humor also abounds as you rescue beautiful women, verbally spar with your allies, and blow up enemies in the bathroom. A user-friendly control interface allows for sniping, hiding, crawling, and running, and the graphics leave nothing to be desired. If you like espionage, spy movies, or just want to own and play a piece of gaming history, then this is a must have.Metal Gear Solidis one of the all-time greats. Game tip: Secretly attach plastic explosives behind an enemy, sneak out of the room, and see what happens.--Allen StewartPros:Story well-integrated into gameplayStealth favored over brute forceChallenging puzzlesCons:Puzzles can be frustratingTorture scene too intense for younger gamers","reviewerName":"Xider \"MWAHAHAHAHA!\"","summary":"Hideo Kojima brings another gripping story to the table!","reviewText":"I decided just out of curiosity to check out the reviews of people who gave this game 1 and 2 stars. They all said the same thing, and I agreed with some of it. I'll be the first to admit that Metal Gear Solid is short. Skipping cut scenes, I can be the game in about 2 and a half hours now. I'll also admit that the graphics are dated, however for their time they were amazing! Sure, I'll even admit that some of the dialogue was cheesy.But I will never agree that the plotline of Metal Gear Solid is stupid, slow, or senseless. As a matter of fact, I don't think there is a better story. Of all the movies I've watched, books I've read, and games I've played, I've never expierienced anything like Metal Gear Solid's storyline. Twists, turns, shocks, and surprises are all through it. Sure, there is a lot of watching, but it's worth it in my humble opinion.For those of you who for some reason are unaware, Metal Gear Solid is about a \"hero\" named Solid Snake. He is sent in (despite retirement) to rescue two people from a nuclear disposal facility on an island called Shadow Moses. The place is under control by the group Snake used to work for, FOXHOUND. Leading this rag-tag bunch of freaks is Liquid Snake, a man with the exact same face as Solid.But Liquid is not alone. Psycho Mantis is one of the game's most intriguing bosses. He is a telekenetic with a love for throwing furniture with his mind. The battle with him actually requires you to change your controller to another port so he can't dodge your bullets. Sniper Wolf is a beautiful but deadly assassin who's target becomes her obsession once she marks it. Vulcan Raven is a giant Shaman who loves heavy weaponry and can survive freezing temperatures with no problem. And then, there is Revolver. Good old Ocelot makes sure to cause you all kinds of trouble throughout the course of the game, including torturing you with electro-shock! And how could I forget Ninja? Although this mysterious villain is not with Liquid, he seems determined to slice and dice you! Oh yeah, and Decoy Octopus. But you won't know much about him until it's too late.But you aren't alone. There are two people who are physcially there for you. One is Meryl, a red-headed babe who just so happens to be your colonel's neice. Then there is Hal Emmerich, also known as Otacon. This geeky hacker gets you out of a ton of sticky situations in this game. Even though they aren't actually there, the people you contact by Codec help you out bunches. The colonel, despite being quite shady, gives you a plethora of tips to get you out of bad spots. Mei Ling, a cute little Chinese girl, saves your game and fills your mind with interesting proverbs. \"Master\" McMiller is an interesting old friends of Snake's who knows a lot of about the Alaskan wildlife and wilderness. Then there is Deepthroat. This guy is quite mysterious, but very helpful. Oh, and Naomi. This sexy and sophisticated scientist is the reason for the technology that is keeping you warm in the cold climate of Alaska.The things I've mentioned don't even scratch the surface of MGS's story, characters, and twists. Don't trust anybody. That is my best advice.Gameplay? Amazing. You'll get use to the layout of the controls very quickly. Soon, you'll be quick reloding and popping around corners like a pro. You can shimmy walls, knock on them to distract guards, come up behind a guard and choke them until they pass out or just snap their neck. What about A.I? It isn't terrible. On Easy it's a joke. However the guards can see your footprints in the snow, and track you. They can also hear your footsteps on certain kind of terrain, and when they group up it can be scary.It can make you laugh, cry, or piss your pants. Listen to naysayers if you please, but listen to me more! You cannot go wrong with Metal Gear Solid, unless you aren't an action gamer. It has lots of cinematics, old school graphics, and some cheesy dialouge...but those faults don't overshadow the amazing characters, storyline, and gameplay. The game is super cheap used now...so go buy it. Thank you for reading this also.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000BWZY7Q","reviewerName":"Mitchell M. Tse \"mitchelltse\"","summary":"Very convenient design of Outland","reviewText":"With 139 other reviews, I didn't see a need to add my 2 cents, but after reading some, I noticed that no one really mentioned the design of Outland.One issue I had with the original lands of WoW (Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms) was the travel time from place to place.  If you were Alliance, and ever had to travel to Tanaris or Un'Goro Crater, you're talking about 5 full minutes just to fly there (about 20 minutes by land) from any of the main cities (Ironforge, Stormwind, and Darnassus).  And setting a hometown just to be closer to Tanaris would mean taking a long time to reach any Eastern Kingdom land, so that wasn't a viable option either.With the expansion, however, Outland is designed such that the main city, Shattrath, is pretty much in the center of the entire continent, so that travelling from one area to another is much easier.  Add to that epic flying mounts, and then traveling from one corner to another is much faster.  Additionally, in Outland, each dungeon area was actually a dungeon portal in that there were actually 3 or 4 dungeons right next to each other, so that they're easily accessible (geographically, at least, since some required certain quests and levels to unlock).  This meant that you had over a dozen dungeons for 5-man groups, as well as half a dozen or so raid instances added with this expansion.A second feature that wasn't really mentioned is the reputation rewards.  You now really have three ways to get very good equipment.  One way is to join big groups (raids), and hit the big areas and get the big loot.  Another way is to do lots of PVP (battle grounds and arenas) and get PVP based equipment rewards.  A new, third viable way is to repeatedly do solo and/or small group (5-man) adventures and grind your way toward epic reputation rewards.  (There's of course a 4th way, where you buy, swindle, or flirt your way to a lot of gold and buy epic equipment, but that's of course heavily discouraged and may get you in trouble if the transactions are illegal.)Again, very good expansion.  If you own WoW and are still playing it, buying this expansion is a must.  Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00064MUIA","reviewerName":"DeRosset Myers \"DeRo\"","summary":"Two screens and almost twice the fun ... almost","reviewText":"If you read my review of the Red DS Mario Kart bundle pak and think I'm going to just continue to rattle off all the horrible things about the DS, you're wrong. That review was in regards to the connection between the unit and the included game pak. I don't actually own the silver DS, but since it probably acts exactly like the red one, I figured I'd review it anyway. Now let's get startedWhile it's true that the DS is not the first hand-held unit to have a touch-screen, it is the first unit to use the touch feature in combination with a non-touch-screen to bring gaming to a new level. Some titles make good use of this feature (Bust-A-Move DS; Metroid Prime Hunters; Super Princess Peach), some do not (Mario Kart DS), and some simply use the other screen and touch feature as an excuse to be on Nintendo's non-patriarchal-named unit (Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow).It is said that the Nintendo DS is slightly more powerful than the 64-bit Nintendo 64, which I think is a poor comparison considering the Sony PSP is only slightly less powerful than the 128-bit Sony PlayStation 2, but the Nintendo DS does seem to have more interesting video games that have encouraged originality. I'd stay away from the DS version of Whack-A-Mole if I were you though. I never played it, but I feel uncomfortable recommending a game that has you constantly smacking the touchscreen. The DS also has a more friendly price tag -- at least until Tuesday, April 4th, 2006, and very likely thereafter.The unit is incompatible with past GB games prior to Advance. I haven't tested this because GB cartridges won't fit into the slot. You could try altering your old carts or taking the chips out of their shells, but do you really want to bother? On a side note, the GB Micro does not play non-Advance GB games either, making it ideal only for face-plate customization and easy use of Drill Dozer.The DS is not a bad system; it just has a bad falling with GBA games and most current DS games in the play-control department, given the repositioning of the A and B buttons. Although it's not a total pain using A for jump and B for attack, I still think using Y for attack and B for jump would be much more comfortable.The pearl pink and blue DS's are not sold anymore, except from money-hungry collectors, so if you want one in one of those colors, I suggest you get a regular DS, some white model paint, and acrylic nail polish in your desired color ... and be careful. This will very likely void your warrenty.I forgot to mention some extra features before updating my review: With most if not all DS video games, there is an instant sleep feature. I am not referring to the quicksave features in \"Super Princess Peach\" and \"Castlevanis: Dawn of Sorrow\" (which is also awesome, by the way), I'm talking about the DS going on instant standby when you close the unit. Open in back up and you can start right from where you left off ... exactly where you left off. In the immortal words of that hideously annoying radio DJ in Burnout 3: Takedown, \"How cool is that?!\"* The quality of a game does not necessarily reflect how well it uses the touchscreen.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2006"}

Hayes","summary":"ATV Racing At It's Best","reviewText":"PURE, a surprise title released by Disney (though developed by BlackRock Studios), was an instant hit for me when it released in Fall 2008.  Every prerelease video I saw of the game featured several key features, wicked cool stunts, beautiful vistas, and fun racing.For background PURE is an ATV stunt racing games that features about 8 levels, several modes, beautiful graphics at these near-to realworld locations, hundreds of customization options, and online mode that features the different race types.Races on ATVs in the game are carried out in three modes.-Race: Standard 16 ATV per track (in career mode you are awarded points based on your placement, bonuses given for coming in first but it is possible to move on with places below first)-Trick Race:  There are powerups scattered around the track that give extra gas and points, in this mode you and 16 other players compete to get the most points before your gas runs out.-Sprint:  Finish the the short circuit race (16 players).  Difference here is that the tracks are really short and you have to have good handling, acceleration and boost.NOTE: All these modes can be played online, there is no offline multiplayer though.There is a career mode that players can go through, \"the world cup\" in which you just move up this 100 position ladder to be the best in the world, several stages for each engine class (first is really slow, final stages are fast).  Unlockables here in this mode give additional parts for the ATV.ATV:  Customization options, can store numerous builds of your dream ATV in the garage, real world brands as well.  It is quite simple to build, but there is a quick build option as well.Multiplayer: No offline multiplayer, but all of the modes exist online with support from 8-16 players.Presentation:  Graphically the game is beautiful on the PS3.  There are several breathtaking captivating moments at key points on each full race track that showcase these venues.  Tricks, there are tons of tricks in the game and each one looks amazing (though some are just impossible).  The special tricks for each player also look outlandish but awe-inspiring. Sound, there is a narrator who narrates each mode for beginners, there was quite a bit of attention to detail paid in the squeaks for the ATV's, the riders voice on the track, as well as an interesting musical selection by various bands.  They fit in well with the band with a key few tracks being those that may be recognized from the rock scene or the instrumentals.UPDATES:  In Spring 2009, the game was updated on the PS3 to feature TrophiesAlthough the game came out in Fall 2008, there is no wrong time to pick up this game.  If it is your desire to have a nice slight sim/arcade stunt ATV racer with high production values, online mode, then go for it.  This is a great addition to any gamers library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2009"}

But no I can't play it because of EA's backwards thinking always online DRM garbage they forced in which only causes problems for their paying customers. Anyone who pirated this game has cracked it and happily been playing it while people who paid for it are stuck with intrusive DRM that messes up our ability to use the product we paid for.Personally from what I was able to play I did not like it much at all. In fact I went over to gog.com (I love those guys) and I got sim city 4 instead and I am sending sim city 5 back for a refund and probably will never buy it again.Sim city 5 first of all felt incomplete, a lot of things seemed missing like I dont like how the city size is limited as I remember EA saying they had much larger cities running themselves but scaled them back for the final product, you can't teraform like in past games, no subways, no farmlands, no power lines, no water lines and so on. A lot of little things are absent from the game which I fear means they will be sold to us later through microtransactions or DLC packs. Because EA has a nasty habit of nickel and diming their customers to death with over priced DLC and they love to force microtransactions into every game they make, even the ones where it makes no sense like dead space 3. Like the sims 3 for instance is not a new game, its many years old but yet if you want to buy it and all the content (including packs with pets, furniture and other such trivial things) you would spend upwards of 400 bucks or maybe more.I hate the fact everything is stored on Cloud. I don't actually have anything saved that I do on my pc. I dependant on having to access their servers to play the game even by myself.Multiplayer. While a interesting idea is being shoe horned into the game whether you want it or not. Personally I feel it is just an excuse to use always on DRM and force players to play their games and save content on their servers. I don't like it myself but others might. I want to sit, plot, plan and build my cities how I want with no interference from others. I don't want to play sim city to be social.It requires Origin which I still dislike for numerous reasons. I don't even care for Steam really but I use steam and one digital service is enough for me. I don't want to spread my games out on multiple online services.It has the look and feel of the sims, which I don't care for. It feels too cartoony, too unrealistic and it just feels like I am playing a sims game. The graphics are nice and all but it lacks any sense of reality to it at all as I constantly am reminded of the sims'esque kind of graphics.It also doesn't spark my creativity and desire to articulate every little thing in my head. I don't want to go into great detail and consideration when building. I found myself trying to very hard, but not actually \"feeling it\" so to speak. I was trying to force myself to enjoy it like I did previous games but it wasn't happening. But as soon as I loaded up sim city 4 it all came flooding back to me.My recommendation is don't waste 60 bucks on this. It's a 20 dollar game at best.UPDATE.I thought it worth a mention that EA and maxis are now putting advertisements for Nissan cars in the game you paid for. Yes much like they did with ikea in sims and so on EA is putting Nissan advertisements in your game that you paid for. [...]","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0044SA70M","description":"","reviewerName":"PS2 Bruce","summary":"Very Good But NOT \"Open World\"","reviewText":"I had actually never heard of this game until literally the night before it was released...I was looking through IGN and saw a review of it; they gave it 9.0. I was like \"An RPG! Armor, swords, smithing, big map, side quests!\" So, on the way home I stopped at GameStop and picked it up. First of all I should say, that my preference towards RPG is for the Elder Scrolls games. I have thousands of hours in Morrowind and Oblivion, and right now I'm level 63 with about 350 hours in Skyrim, having finished the Main Quest, Civil War (I was Imperial), and all of the Faction quests. (I was even lucky enough to finish the infamous Companion's quest, PURITY).So, I thought, as I installed the game, how will this compare to Skyrim? The answer is, pretty well. It is closer to the FABLE games, in graphics and combat. Your character, of course, is mute (dammit). I sort of think the graphics are a nice change actually; after you spend several hundred hours in Skryim, things are a lot brighter and more colorful. Most of the NPC's look like fable; your character is sort of a mix between the graphics in Saint's Row and Fable. In Character Creation, you start with several base types, male and female, and you can do a good bit of customization. One really cool thing is, HOWEVER you make your character look, that's how he or she will look in the cutscenes.You start in a tutorial section; the games shows you how to move, access your inventory, equip and hot key things, etc. When you approach something and it glows, you can interact with it. As in the ES games, if it has a red hand, that's stealing. (Make sure no one is watching, basically). Locked containers can be picked, but the lockpicking takes some getting used to. As you go through the beginning quest, you will pick up armor and weapons. Once you exit the first quest area, and get to the first town, there a shops where you can sell your unwanted items, try out smithing and alchemy, etc. This is also where you pick up a bunch of side quests; many people you talk to have an \"I can help!\" dialog option; if you pick that, you get a side quest.As far as the combat, it is fun; its much like the Fable games. Press X, and you draw and strike with your primary weapon. Y uses whatever you have equipped as your secondary weapon. Holding buttons/triggers, etc give you different effects. D pad hotkeys items like potions, selects spells you can use, etc, like Fable. I sort of prefer Oblivion/Skyrim type combat, but this is fun...again, a lot like Fable, or Gods of War.  As you get better, your attacks will have more power, you can do combos, etc.There are just a few things I DON'T like. First and foremost, this is NOT an open world or \"Sandbox\" game. It is linear, to a point; you do have a pretty big map to explore, but you can not really go in any direction like you can in the ES games. I know some people with LIKE that; that's fine. But it's not my preference for an RPG map. But even though paths are limited, you will still have plenty to do.Next, there's not much documentation. You don't even get an insert in the game case, showing you the buttons, etc. There is a \"manual\" within the game, but it doesn't clarify much, leveling up and choosing perks is sort of confusing to start with. You also don't get very clear instructions on smithing.Finally, and this is minor, I guess, you can only dual wield daggers . The box shows other weapons, but it seems like it only works with daggers. Oh well, maybe that's just me being picky.I would recommend this game, especially if you liked games like FABLE or GOD OF WAR. It's a bit more serious than Fable, and a bit lighter than the ES games. Though the world is not totally free roam, there is a lot to see and do, and there is SOME replay value, because you can play as both genders of several races; I just don't think outcomes are affected that much due to the linear paths.Recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2012"}

I really enjoyed going back playing the whole collection again, especially when you account for how much you get (3 full games and 2 small ones).Sons of Liberty looks nice, it does feel a tad dated but plays the same as always including the \"fixed camera\" and awkward controls, however, it's always been that way so this shouldn't be too much of a surprise. After a little adjustment time, the controls work well enough to enjoy the story and gameplay; however, I would have loved to be able to customize the controls.I especially enjoyed playing Snake Eater again. MGS3: SE has always been one of my favorite games and it plays beautifully for me, controls are not perfect, but work better than MGS2: SoL. Players will enjoy a free movement 3rd-person-camera (most recently added in the newest versions of this game) with the ability to switch back to the fixed camera at any time. As always, the boss battles and story are still major highlights and I am especially enjoying the copious amounts of nostalgia that accompanied me on my play-through. Seriously great.Peacewalker was enjoyable as well, though some may not like its specific game play. The story here was very enjoyable and on par with other major MGS's. Controls work well enough and overall this is a great game in the package. It's a tad linear and each area is a bit small but I still enjoyed it all the same, just keep in mind it's a port of a mobile game.This collection also includes Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 (original games) with updated save features; they are fun little additions and I'm glad they were included.

{"product_name":"B002V16T0Q","reviewerName":"M. Scott","summary":"Mostly Bad but you should play it anyways","reviewText":"Metro 2033 is a perfect example of a game that could have been great but it suffers from three major problems.1. Awful Controls: The first thing you'll notice when playing Metro is the asinine controls. They just feel horrible. That's it, they just don't work. Especially if you've ever played Halo or Call of Duty (two games that set the standard for FPS controls)2. Stupid/Glitchy AI: The enemies are stupid, your teammates are stupid, and sometimes they'll freak out and start falling apart. This game is really REALLY BUGGY. On more than one occasion I had to restart a level because there was an invincible enemy that was blocking the door to the next area.3. Poorly Told Story: The story of the game is really not that bad, its actually pretty cool. The only problem is that its read to you. Seriously. Like a book on tape. Instead of learning the story from cutscenes or gameplay, 90% of the story comes from these between level readings, which Im pretty sure are just taken straight out of the book. Very lazy, Very Boring.Now after all that hate, you probably are wondering why I rated the game 4 stars. Well, in all honesty, it has a great ending. Or more accurately a really fun ending. I shouldn't give too much away because it really comes out of left field, so I'll just say that while most of game is pretty mundane, the ending espcially the last 10 minutes are really cool and almost make up for the entire rest of the game.If you have so cash to blow and want to see a cool ending, fly through the game on the lowest difficulty just to see the ending. Otherwise, its not worth your money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2013"}

So for whatever reason I didn't get around to buying this game, until the 22nd of this month. Just started playing it today. And man....This game is sick!!! Why did I wait till now to play this? I'm more of a fan of Batman from the old TV series w/ Adam West, the late 70's-80's Superfriends cartoon version of Batman. And yes, the Michael Keaton version is cool too! So I guess I thought this would kind of be more Christian Bale -ish....But the game is great! The gameplay is smooth & works well. The graphics are great (even only being available in 720) and the story is great! Also the voice work, aswell as sounds (including musical score) is crisp and well balanced. The voice actors nailed it dead on! And I think the actor doing Batman's voice is that of the 90's cartoon series. Which is cool cause his voice is perfect for Bruce. Along the way through the game, you get to upgrade your gadgets,abilities,armor,ect...You fight various advisaries of Batman's, as bosses. The fighting in this game is great too. You can counter an enemies strike with a bar or whatever, and do various cool s*** to counter. I'm only about halfway through this game (I think) but it's a solid game!  Also, the 3D works suprisingly well. I didn't get the glasses that comes w/ it. But I have some old school 3D glasses from a 3D Friday The 13th DVD I got. They still work with it despite being red & blue, not green & purple. If you also have lacked trying this for whatever reason....I recommend it! I'm more of a Marvel fan, but like DC too & LOVE this game. Now I just gotta get Arkham City!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2012"}

But I do want to tell you that this game is the best first person shooter on the Wii U. I know the Wi U just released, but for anyone who played the later versions of Call of Duty will really apreciate this one.First, the graphics have better detail than the PS3 and on is on par with the 360 (I own all 3 systems). The gameplay online is smooth, I did not see any difference in frame drops at all for the hours I've played the game. I havent played the campaign on the wii because I finished that part on a PS3, so I cant speak on how the game runs, but I will update when I do.Being able to play Black Ops 2 on the Wii U controller is pretty awesome. It will take anyone a bit of time to get used to the controller since it has the analog sticks on top and the x,y,b,a buttons on the bottom. To reload, jump, go prone is kind of difficult to do just because i'm so used to the other controller layouts. But with time I'm sure it will get better.Even though you can not take the controller too far from the tv, I was able to play 2 rooms away, so thats pretty good. black ops 2 looks pretty darn good on the controller screen and runs as smooth if not smoother than on the tv I kid you not. I also like that you can adjust the settings on the fly for the controller if in case the analog sticks are too sticky or too loose.To sum it up, if you own the Wii U and have not picked up black ops 2, do so, you wont regret it. If you have multiple consoles, I'd say the Wii U version of Black ops 2 is the best out of the bunch.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2012"}

Probably over half of the games of the past were movie tie-ins. However, I don't recall a game being so tied to a film series as ENTER THE MATRIX. While playing the game, you basically are allowed to take a part in the movies. The game fills in many plot holes left between MATRIX: RELOADED and MATRIX: REVOLUTIONS. Plus, once you beat the game it has one of the best previews for MATRIX: REVOLUTIONS that were available.I enjoyed playing this game and had a lot of fun. I defeated the Ghost course over in a little over four hours and the Niobe course in about five. I think the Ghost sequence is a bit more difficult, but I played the Niobe level first and it took me time to get used to the control of the game.My favorite part of the game is after you beat the game, you are able to enter into a two person combat mode. In this mode you are able to choose several different characters to fight with someone else. My brother and I have a blast playing these levels.  One of our favorites is the police car versus the fire car. Seeing the two cars fight for the first time is absolutely hilarious.The game is pretty easy to play, but also a lot of fun.

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"Rondy","summary":"fun and good.","reviewText":"not bad, i love sci fi stuffand this is sci fi, with lots of killing. who doesnt like that?(except people who play mario and zelda)great stuff.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2013"}

The dual band adapter offers fast speed and great range*, and contains an extension cable for off-board placement.","reviewerName":"Carlos Santiago","summary":"It works, but signal range could be an issue","reviewText":"I've always used my 360 in a wired setting.  My in-laws had to stay for a few weeks at my place so I had to move my Xbox upstairs to give them some privacy.  Finally I had a justification to purchase the expensive wireless adapter for my console.It could be said that the setup of the adapter should be easy, but be aware of a few potential caveats.  If you have a secured wireless hub or your SSID is hidden, or your hub is setup with MAC address security, and you have no idea of what I'm just talking about, then start looking for help or you'll be scratching your head for a while before getting the adapter to work.Unless your wireless hub is unsecured, you have to be familiar on how to enter a WEP hex code on the console network settings.  Also, many people set up their security and tend to forget all about it and then they have no idea what was their hub's WEP code, or where did they write down their password.  So you have been forewarned.I have networking experience, so the process of setting up the adapter was familiar to me.  However, I still had problems that were not that obvious at first glance.  I noticed on the Xbox networking screen that the signal was weak, but I did have reception.To make sure that everything was ok, I ran the Xbox tests and they worked fine until they reached the Xbox live connectivity tests.  In my case, they failed every time.  My searches for solutions on the Internet lead me to many cases, but no concrete solutions and no indication that the error was related to the signal on the adapter.My console was located on the 2nd floor of my house.  The wireless hub was in the basement, where I have my office and some additional space my in-laws were using.  I always suspected the reception was the culprit but I refused to believe that it was so poor when compared to my laptop's reception, which I tested in the same spot and had all the green bars on.Adjusting the 360 adapter's antenna and moving the console to a very specific spot in the room finally did the trick, but the connection was still inconsistent.  Connecting to Xbox live took considerably longer than usual and I would get sudden disconnects in a middle of a game, which in the case of Xbox Live Arcade games, they stop when you are not connected to Xbox live, so it was very frustrating to watch my arcade games being interrupted in the middle of a session.  A minute later I got connected again and had to start all over.  I also had to be very careful not to move the console from where I spotted it.  Once I got my console back downstairs it worked perfectly, with no disconnects and a perfect reception.So, in the end, if your console will be placed near the wireless hub and you are familiar with your wireless configuration, then you will have no issues with this adapter.  But my conclusion is that the adapter's reception is very weak, as compared with other wireless equipment under the same conditions.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2008"}

Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin is no exception, and while it doesn't do much we haven't seen before in the series, it still manages to pack one heck of a punch.  Following up the wonderful Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin puts you in the shoes of Jonathan and Charlotte; a whip and magic wielding duo that you play as together throughout the game.  This new dynamic adds some spice to the tried but true side scrolling gameplay, which is rich with a horde of weapons, items, and power-ups to find.  And, since this is a Castlevania game, it's only natural that the boss battles are nothing short of fantastic and the best parts of the game.  The graphics look sharp with superb animation and effects that really show off what the DS is capable of with 2-D graphics.  The music and sound is superb as well, and the game offers some decent touch screen capabilities that are more substancial than the ones found in Dawn of Sorrow.  If there's any cons to Portrait of Ruin, it's that the level designs don't have that personality that we've seen in previous Castlevania games like Dawn of Sorrow and the GBA titles, but that's not a huge gripe.  All in all, Portrait of Ruin is another superb portable Castlevania game, and yet another must own title for the DS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2006"}

I tend to think of KID ICARUS (why didn't this become a franchise???) and METROID as brothers, and ZELDA and METROID as first cousins.  While ZELDA offers a very innovative, opened-ended (for the time) overworld experience with fantasy elements, METROID does the same type of innovation for side-scrollers, with a map just as expansive (though in a different format) as ZELDA. Which brings me to the actual game play of METROID.Metroid operates as one long map broke off into sections.  There is no level progressions like Mario.  But the game does contain you too certain areas that only opens up after you had receive new items.  These items are cleverly hidden throughout the game's map, and just when you think you've come to a dead end, suddenly you bomb the floor and a whole new area opens before you.  And the game isn't too kind when it set you down in that opening area of Brinstar.  Equipped with only 30 energy units, Samus has to be tough to survive.  Energy is scarce and can be time-consuming to collect. (Compare obtaining life in METROID to SUPER METROID; in SUPER METROID there's all sorts of energy).  The energy being so hard to collect, and the ungodly complex password system, do flaw the game, but we have to remember this is a first gen NES title, so you have to cut it some slack.Now would be a good time to talk about METROID's glitch.  Much like the negative world in SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, METROID has one of the most famous glitches in the video gaming world.  Called the Secret Worlds, you use a wall jumping technique that enables you to get to \"new areas\" of the game that are otherwise unreachable.  Thought to be a secret, an intentional programming easter egg, these Secret Worlds, while still fun to search for, are not intentional.  They are glitches.  Search the Internet to find out all about these secret areas.After transversing Brinstar and Norfair, getting new items, then Samus has to fight through the two bosses' hideouts and put them down before the final confrontation: Mother Brain.  My favorite old school enemy, Mother Brain is a proven nemesis, much harder to beat than the laughably pathetic Bowser or even the more challenging Gannon.  On top of that, once you beat her you have to get out of Tourian within a certain time limit (admittedly, it's more than enough time to get out).  Even though Mother Brain's tough, we video gamers led Samus to victory countless times because of the stupendous game play and the compelling story.  Once Mother Brain is dead and we get Samus out of Tourian, then the real payoff is unleashed.  Samus is a WOMAN!  And if you beat the game under certain time limits, you get different endings.  During the days of rescuing damsels in distresses with a Brooklyn plumber or a green-clad boy, Samus's gender is very revolutionary, which brings me to the story aspect of METROID, which is currently under attack by ZERO MISSION.METROID's best features are successfully combines rich story-telling (for the NES) with innovative gameplay.  This isn't a kid's game like Mario.  This is a classic science fiction story, heavily influenced by Ridley Scott's ALIEN.  Metroid is a story of a Space Federation fighting for its very survival against the fearsome Mother Brain and its two subordinates, Ridley and Kraid, who had stolen the Metroids and had their own devious designs for them.  I have a sneaking suspicion that the boss Ridley was named after Sigourney Weaver's character and Ridley Scott.  Gunpei Yokoi, executive produce of METROID (and also one of the chief developers of the original Game Boy), said that while ALIEN was never specifically discussed during Metroid's development, it cast a heavy shadow over METROID.  That same dark terror, about never knowing what was around the next corner and how you were hoping, against all odds, that Ridley in ALIEN and Samus in the game would come out on top, forever cemented both tales in the imaginations of their prospective audiences.Because of the gameplay and atmospheric story, Samus Aran has become a classic video game icon.  Thankfully, after many long years the METROID franchise has become alive again with new releases.  But for those who want to relive the Samus's first glory, then this game would hold you enthralled.  This is truly a classic game.P. S. Unfortunately, do to the realitive simplicity of the NES version of events, Nintendo has saw fit to introduce a radical remake of the game on METROID: ZERO MISSION, enlarging it and changing around events.  While I enjoyed ZM, I felt it much to linear and went against what made the original so great to begin with: open-ended exploration.  See my METROID: ZERO MISSION review for more details.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"\"gamecubedfreak\"","summary":"Another 4-Player Funfest","reviewText":"Well what did we expect from the latest Mario Party game.

{"product_name":"B000LSJKAM","reviewerName":"Cale E. Reneau \"Mound of Wires\"","summary":"Mario and Friends Bring the Party to the Wii","reviewText":"Back in the day when the Nintendo 64 was my console of choice, the original Mario Party game and its two sequels on the system were some of my favorite games. When the GameCube rolled around, I skipped on the system and thus largely ignored the 4 entries in the series for that console. However, when I picked up my Wii, one of the games I was greatly anticipating was Mario Party 8; a game that I felt could not only recreate the same fun of the Mario Parties of my memory, but also build upon it with the implementation of the Wii remote.Mario Party 8 is themed as a \"Star Carnival,\" a place where your favorite characters from the Mushroom Kingdom can come to play games, spend money, and challenge each other in epic mini-game battle royales! The overall presentation is less exciting than you may anticipate. The host of the game is a seemingly randomly designed human-esque charater with a talking hat. Yes. Worse-so is his unchecked desire to talk up a storm in text, always giving you information on the game whether you desire it or not. It is one of two major drawbacks to the game.The second major flaw in Mario Party 8 is the lack of 16:9 widescreen support. Oh, Hudson has gone to great lengths to add in some poorly designed bars to the left and right side of your screen, but the game itself will take place between those two bars in a 4:3 aspect ratio. After a few minutes of experiencing this, you'll probably get used to it, but that doesn't change the fact that you feel utterly resricted because of it (especially when you consider that all the menus and carnival tents are designed in 16:9).Beyond these two flaws, however, lies a surprisingly well-designed and ultimately enjoyable experience. I am surprised and delighted to find that the classic Mario Party gameplay that I enjoyed nearly a decade ago still holds up on Nintendo's new console.Players begin by choosing one of 6 boards; some well designed, others more lackluster. DK's Jungle board is classic Mario Party, with a randomly rotated Star and twists, turns, and surprises around every corner. My personal favorite is Koopa's Tycoon Town, a Mushroom Kingtom take on Monopoly. On this board there are a certain # of hotels which each contain one star. When you land on a hotel space, you can invest in that hotel and earn its star with as little as one coin. However, if another player comes by and invests a greater amount of coins than you, the hotel (and it's star) becomes theirs. To add to the fun and strategy, the total # of coins invested by all players in a single hotel can transform it into a 2-star or even 3-star establishment, allowing the owner to reap the benefits. This particularly enjoyable board will undoubtedly supply you and your friends with hours of enjoyment as you strategize your moves and hope for the perfect roll of the dice.The mini-games, of course, are the real attraction here, and Mario Party 8 doesn't disappoint. It is obvious that the game begain its development cycle as a GameCube title, as some games are clearly designed with a traditional controller in mind. However, even in cases such as these the game is still a blast to play! Specific games worth noting include one where your player must hit baseballs into the outfield while making a swinging motion with the remote and the standard \"stand on a circular arena and try to beat your opponents out of it\" which is still fun to play all these years after its original incarnation.Another attraction in the Star Carnival is the Bonus tent, in which you can play against opponents in a number of exclusive mini games, including ping-pong, bowling, and a Star Wars-esque pod-racing game. All of these games can utilize your console's Miis if you so choose, though you can still play with Mario, Luigi, or Peach if that's your thing.Overall, Mario Party 8, though disappointing in a few areas is still a pretty solid game. While other mini-game fest on the Wii offer arguably better mini-games, Mario Party is the only one that ties them all together with the addictive and strategic nature of a board game. Players who have played all the previous incarnations of this game may find this iteration to be a bit tiresome and unnecessary, but people who are new to the game and those who are coming back after a long haitus (myself) should be more than pleased with what they get. Mario Party 8 is not the perfect party game, but it is the closest you'll get to one in a long time.7.0  PresentationAn overly-talkative host and unskippable text is bothersome, but the star carnival is not as bas as it could've been. Main menu presented in 16:9.6.5  GraphicsNot the best I've seen. Jaggies are everywhere and the lack of widescreen is extremely disappointing.7.0  SoundThe game's music is nothnig to write home about, but it's not annoying either. Voice overs are repetitive, but too unbearable.8.5  GameplayWith the exception of a few minigames, MP8 is extremely enjoyable. Most of the boards are well-designed, and Wii Remote implementation is a welcomed addition to the series.8.5  Lasting AppealIf you have friends and family around, this game could hold you over for some time. Next to Wii Sports, it's arguably the most addictive party game on the system.7.5  OVERALL(out of 10 / not an average)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2007"}
{"product_name":"B007VFHGZ4","description":"","reviewerName":"Brendan Ross","summary":"Very polished and fun game","reviewText":"This re-boot of the classic Tomb Raider franchise is characterized by fantastic graphics, good voice acting (especially by the lead) and generally fun and varied gameplay.As compared with the prior iterations of the series, the game is more combat-heavy (quite a bit), less puzzle-oriented and more fast-paced in general as a result.  However there is plenty to explore on a large island, plenty of secrets to be discovered, platforming to be done, caves and tombs to explore and so on, together with a fairly good storyline as the core.  The top-notch graphics on the PC really make it a standout from the optical perspective as well.The one reason I rated it down from what would otherwise have been a 5-star rating was the presence of too many quick-time events.  These are essentially sequences in the game that require the player to press certain buttons that are generally unrelated to other actions taken in the game but are picked to be pressed in certain sequences scripted for that specific event.  So, the player's knowledge of the control set is no help.  Instead, the player must follow prompts given on the screen that really have no relation to the controls of the game otherwise.  This may be a fine and accepted form of gameplay on console devices, but in a PC game it is unbelievably irritating to the point where it discouraged me from continuing to play the game several times.  Not due to \"difficulty\", mind you -- there isn't anything particularly difficult in terms of skill, here -- rather it is learning a scripted event by playing through it unsuccessfully several times until the player gets the specific timing of the scripted key presses down sufficiently to clear the event.  That's not a form of gameplay that I personally find appealing at all, and its inclusion in a PC game is irritating enough to warrant a one-star downgrade.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2013"}

Was it the sub-par voice acting for Connor? Was it the the empty locations and/or frustrating controls? It was probably all of the above.Pros:Very smooth animation. Perhaps it was because I played Skyrim, with its clunky animation, just prior, but movement in AC3 (especially Connor's) looked great: hopping over fences, jumping into saddles, climbing buildings and fighting redcoats all looked fluid.Good plots twists (mostly the first one). What a way to end Sequence 1. I don't want to spoil it, so I'll just say I found it fantastic.Awesome naval content. Did anywhere out there dislike the Aquila missions? That was the best part of the game for me. It was so good, in fact, that it inspired Ubisoft to base AC4 entirely on what was just a subplot in this iteration.*3D-compatibility. This won't matter for most, but I own a 3D TV, so switching this on once in a blue moon was a nice (but certainly not necessary) feature.One of the new (and coolest) weapons in the arsenal was the rope dart. It could be used to slow down quick enemies, kill small animals, and stealthily strangle redcoats.Experiencing the sights and sounds of revolutionary America: The Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Bunker Hill, George Washington, Ben Franklin, etc.Cons:There were a multitude of small issues that brought this game down: occasional out of sync subtitles, unintended actions (climbing the wrong object, attacking the wrong enemy), subpar voice acting from Connor and Desmond's dad, bodies falling through the ground, frustrating detection algorithm, frustrating horse travel (especially over rocky terrain), and useless craftable or collectable 'special items.'Too much empty space. To me, Assassins Creed is about exploring dense, vibrant cities, not the sprawling countryside. In other words, it's about vertical, not horizontal, exploration. Maybe instead of a frontier and homestead, they could've included Philadelphia.Who cares about hunting? I'm sorry, but outside of a few easy opportunity kills, I utterly avoided hunting.I didn't really understand Connor's motivations. He didn't like the British, but he certainly wasn't fond of the Patriots either. There just didn't seem to be enough reasons to help one side defeat the other.###* I'm sure the thinking went something like this:\"Everyone LOVED the naval/piracy missions in AC3. They called it the best part of the game. Is there any way we can build AC4 entirely on that?\"\"Hmmm. We've always gone forward in time with the series, but the most exciting time for pirates was the 17th century, well before Connor's story.\"\"Who cares?

This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"E. Garcia","summary":"A multiplayer gem","reviewText":"This has become one of my favorite multiplayer games. Find a partner to team up with and you'll be set for one incredible experience. The graphics in the game are well done and the gameplay is excellent. Some people complain that this game is not scary and strays from its survival roots; yes, those are both true. But the game strays for good reason. Without spoiling too much, the game is mostly about epic struggle between Chris and his arch-nemesis Wesker. Chris isn't the scrawny guy he once was 10 years ago- he's devoted his life to being prepared to take down Wesker. The franchise had to go this direction- at least for this game.As an added bonus, you can play the mercenaries minigame with a second player. The gold version has more possible players to play as.Overall, this is a great muliplayer experience, delivers a fantastic story, and has a high replay value.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0007P8FN2","description":"In the ancient, mysterious world of the Jade Empire, you train under your master's watchful eye and learn powerful martial arts and mystical powers. When danger threatens, you travel across the world, from the harsh mountains of the Land of Howling Spirits to the lush gardens of the Imperial City. In your adventures you face powerful human and supernatural foes, learn exotic and magical martial arts, and discover the darkest secrets of the world. Only by mastering the greatest fighting styles and defeating the most powerful enemies will you earn your place as a master of martial arts in the world of Jade Empire.Features:Epic story set in a world inspired by the myths and legends of ancient China. Jade Empire immerses you in a deep, rich storyline in the tradition of the BioWare-developedStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.Sinister events upset the peaceful harmony of an isolated martial arts school and draw you into a story that unfolds with drama, action, and adventure. Detailed followers and other non-player characters enrich the adventure by providing comic relief, rivalries, flirtations, and hostility. Stare in awe at the sweeping views of the lush environments, sheer vertical drops, and overpowering scale that provide the visual backdrop to the story. Confront wild outlaws, evil magicians, demonic incarnations, and other foul villains that protect the Jade Empire's darkest secrets.Become a martial-arts master. Using the knowledge gained in crafting multiple story-based role-playing games, BioWare sends you on a journey to become a martial arts master. Choose a character with a unique appearance and quirks, a custom voice set, and a powerful combination of ability scores and fighting styles. You can choose to act for good or evil, and these decisions build your reputation, which precedes you throughout the land, changing the course of interaction with other characters and followers. Take the role of a master of martial arts and recruit followers to your cause in an interactive, living world.Innovative fighting system. Master fighting styles and mystical powers. Jade Empire provides a gameplay experience with the tempo and fury normally found in Hong Kong cinema favorites such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the Bruce Lee classics. As you journey through Jade Empire, you can upgrade your starting combat style or learn entirely new styles to tailor a character for your specific gameplay preferences. Select from dozens of fighting styles, including (for example) martial-arts styles (Legendary Strike, Leaping Tiger), magic styles (Tempest, Dire Flame), transformation styles, and weapon styles (Twin Axes, Staff, and improvised weapons like chairs). Each style has its own tactical role and attacks that range from punches and kicks to weapon strikes, mystical powers, and even transformations into supernatural monsters! You can focus on a narrow channel of styles and become dominant in these forms or broaden your area of study to include a wide variety of styles adaptable to many combat situations. Combat is fast-paced martial-arts action, and it is exciting and tactical as you rapidly switch fighting styles to meet diverse challenges.","reviewerName":"GameraRocks \"captpicardfan\"","summary":"Real Fun (Especially If You Like The KOTOR Series)","reviewText":"I really do recommend Jade Empire, it's an RPG much like Knights of the Old Republic except you play a monk from ancient times and go around helping or hurting others while you try to get revenge for having your school burned down and your master kidnapped.I believe it is made by the same people who did KOTOR, so they are very similar. Instead of the light and dark side, you have the Way of the Open Hand and the Way of the Closed Fist. Like KOTOR, there is dialogue and options that you can choose from to answer in response. Your actions effect the way you are, do bad things- you're a bad guy and so on. One example being that you meet a woman who is obsessed with a man who is already married, she hires people to beat the man up for being married to another woman who isn't her. You can settle this by either killing them all or helping them to understand each other or take another option. Many options are given to different goals, another great part of the game.The characters on the game are very interesting, from a King Seesar like spirit that possesses a little girl to a ninja who is out for revenge, the game has many interesting characters that become your allies. The game itself is well done, the game isn't even turn based and is even more smooth than KOTOR. I really do think it's one of the best games of '05 and I  highly recommend that everyone who likes RPGs like KOTOR or Fable to get it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2006"}

Lethal","summary":"an easy Ninja Gaiden game?!","reviewText":"First about the gore: it is toned down in some places, yet untouched in others.  It doesn't hurt the gameplay, but comes off as a deliberate attempt to make the game inferior in some way to its X-Box counterpart.  I think the loss of limbs is very exaggerated, and enemies minus an arm or leg actually become more dangerous as they attempt powerful suicide attacks.  This effectively punishes you for doing damage unless you finish them off quickly.  In some cases shooting an enemy in the body with arrows results in him losing an arm.  Huh?  After the amazing dismemberments in Dead Space this seems dated by comparison.I played the first Ninja Gaiden Sigma, and at first was ready to quit after under an hour.  Once I learned to block, evade, and mastered combos and choosing the right weapon for the right enemy, it was still hard but entirely manageable.  Since the combat system is largely unchanged, I had little trouble once I got past the first chapter.  Because the first level up of the dragon sword isn't immediate, I actually found the first chapter the hardest in the game!  How did the dragon sword lose levels between games?  How did Ryu forget techniques?  It's a thing about sequels that always annoys me.  There are about ten different weapons, each with its own strengths and weaknesses relating to range, speed and damage.  This at least provided variety as I easily dispatched waves of enemies.  I beat most of the many bosses on the first try in the normal difficulty setting, and in the entire game died no more than ten times.  I'm shocked at how easy this game was.  Even the final boss went down in one try.  You just learn their pattern, when to block and counter strike, and down they go.  Ninpo is powerful and takes out any enemies around you.  Since weapon upgrades no longer cost yellow orbs, you can hoard orbs and keep health upgrades in constant supply.  You can only carry three of each health up as opposed to six in the previous game, yet it's still far easier.  Even by normal standards this is an overtly easy game, which is why it only gets three stars.  It lasts about fifteen hours, and the other characters add a little variety as well as nice eye candy.  But most of the game just feels like a formality.  Where the first game tested my skills, my nerves and my resolve, this one was a matter of deciding \"how many chapters should I go through today?\".  I had trouble finding one boss' weak point, but otherwise never got stuck on anything.  It makes no sense that the tougher difficulty setting isn't available until you beat it once.  At times I honestly thought I must have inadvertently selected easy mode.  The game is fun and while dated the graphics are still above average.  But while beating NGS was a badge of honor, there was no satisfaction in beating this one at all.While this is a good action game which shouldn't be missed, it's not worth full price.  Wait until it gets marked down, or rent it and beat it in a few marathon sessions.  Tinkering with the gore and plunging the difficulty were big mistakes by Team Ninja, and I hope they don't repeat them.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

Terrorists operate openly, killing thousands; drugs, disease, and pollution kill even more. The world's economics are close to collapse, and the gap between the insanely wealthy and the desperately poor has grown to the size of the Grand Canyon. Worst of all, an ages-old conspiracy bent on world domination has decided that the time is right to emerge from the shadows and take control. No one believes the conspiracy exists--no one but you.In this thrilling role-playing adventure, you play the part of J.C. Denton, a powerful, nanotechnologically augmented antiterrorist agent. It's up to you to stop the conspirators from achieving their goals. But this world is full of lies and betrayal, a world where nothing is as it seems and entire nations can seemingly be turned against you at the push of a button. To succeed, you must travel the globe in a quest for knowledge, develop your character's nanotech augmentations and strengths as you see fit, build a network of allies to assist you, and determine when stealth and strategy are more important than action. And each time you think you've got the mystery solved, the game figured out, there's another, deeper mystery to be unraveled.

Killer 7(as the previous reviewer said)is like an ART house game.  First off let me get this right off the bat.....the gameplay is not \"terrible\" or does not \"Suck\" as most game mags and sites seem to say it(Gamepro can kiss my..)just because they acctually played a game that is \"different\" doesn't mean it \"sucks\".  90% of the people who gave this game an average or below average score(not fans, Game sites/mags)were probably expecting fast paced action with lots of drugs/sex and everything GTA had!!!...Well it isn't, to anyone who is thinking about getting this game...if you're use to things like killing, killing and running around and more killing(like HALO2) DO NOT NOT EVEN TOUCH THIS GAME..Cause this game will make you use your brain(unless you use a stradigy guide)...Do you remember some of those annoying yet very rewarding puzzles in the original Resident Evil games?....EXPECT SOME OF THOSE, yes this game is pretty linear(obviously it was set that way)but the puzzles make up for that...And they really do make you think but you'll eventually figure it out and for people who don't like backtracking, THIS GAME ISN'T FOR YOU.Let me be the first to say(or 4th)that the gameplay is very, very unique and cool(especially the heaven smiles, I don't know were capcom came up with a name like that, but I think it's brilliant).  Especially the Rail track like gameplay, which is pretty cool but the best part about this game is the puzzle solving and the awesome First person shooting aspects(which I can't stop saying they pulled it off so well)were you have to scan areas to find the Heaven Smiles(those things are so disturbing).Visually the game is very beautiful and some of the areas you're in just make you awe in amazement especially the cutscenes..they are just...beautiful, did I mention the character modeling is just fantastic?  The way Capcom pulled off the Cell shaded/anime like characters just look great.  And my lord the sound in this game is very disturbing(especially when you hear the Heavens Smile laughs)and those Robotic-like jibberish you get from the 3 helpers that guide through out the game.  Some of the music in this game is also very cool, it sometimes has that \"anime\" feeling to it.  As far as the storyline goes, one of the previous Reviewer tells it out very well so there is no point on me repeating what it's about.Now let me tell you this....if you thought Manhunt was a very disturbing game, you haven't played KILLER 7, this whole game is just one dark, bloody masterpiece.  From beginning to end you have this \"tention\" that the game brings to you that just gives you the creep, especially some of the stories you hear, like early on in the game you find a head in a dryer that tells you some pretty disturbing things but that's not it, you still have people like Travis(another person who guides you in the game)and another person that tells you some disturbing stories.Now most games(like GTA)now I for one for the first time in a long time have to say this games theme is so dark and disturbing little kids shouldn't even play this...The game truly deserves it's M rating for Stylized Violence with limbs and heads being blown off in very anime/stylish like ways, Strong Language and just listening to some of those stories makes this game deserve its 17 and over rating!!!  This game isn't for little kids....Now lets get to itThe Good-Very unique and original-Very cool gameplay-First Person shooting aspects are just awesome-Very disturbing and brilliantly original creatures-Some of those \"Resident Evil\" like puzzles-The violence in this game(sorry if I sould like some 13 year old who thinks Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is the greatest game ever)is very cool and sylish, I really liked the way Capcom did it, especially when you get a one hit kill-The way you upgrade your characters by using blood from the creatures you killed, and turning it into serum is just very cool(I've been using that word alot in this review)-Gamecube version runs much smoother with slightly better visuals and sound(plus I feel as if I have to say this but it just seems like a Gamecube game..)-The storyline(though at times is confusing and needs some thinking)is pretty cool and involves some POLITICAL THEMES(acctually \"some\" is the worst way to describe it!!!)-Using different Personas to solve some puzzles are very cool-Spanning 2 discs, expect to spend more then 10 hours on this gameThe Bad-WHY CAPCOM!  WHY!!!  This game would have made an amazing Gamecube exclusive and another reason why you should own a GC!!-The backtracking does get annoying at times...-It gets a bit annoying when you die and have to resurect your your personas-You either hate it or love it(I donno why I'm posting it on here)Overall Killer 7 was a very big surprise of 05.  It's very unique, original and just darn disturbing and creepy(this game ain't for the lil' ones).  Though the story may need some putting together(even though you could just read the back of the games cover to know about it, but there is just MORE to it)it's very original.  The gameplay is solid(no it doesn't suck)and the cell shaded/anime like visuals fit so well with the game.....did I mention the puzzles have some sort of \"Resident Evil 1 2 and 3\" feeling to it?...Overall I really liked this game it was one of the most unique games I've ever played since the original shenmue..I give this game a4.4 out of 5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2005"}

Of course, the new handheld still plays all the Game Boy Advance titles available in addition to games made specifically for Nintendo DS.And the built-in Wi-Fi lets you play wirelessly against nearby friends, or you can play online against gamers from around the world with Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.Awesome games, great enhancements and an incredible price makes Nintendo DS Lite will be your best acquisition of the year.","reviewerName":"D.

Now I personally like games that install to the HDD as they run faster during game play. It's a bit longer than 10 minutes for the initial setup, I didn't time it with a stop watch, but the DualShock had turned off, which it does after 10 minutes.I waited on ordering this until I saw at least 3 reviews on reputable gaming sites. They had some big shoes to fill after BioShock 1, and so far I think they've done an awesome job. I really enjoy exploring the maps making sure I've covered every inch. Most of the enemies are the same so far, with two new additional Boss type monsters that I've encountered so far.The graphics and sound effects are great, only a few glitches here and there, but nothing worth even really mentioning. No crashes so far, and I've played at least 12 hours, collecting as many trophies as I can.I'm very much enjoying this, maybe not as much as the first, only because BioShock was so unique at the time. If you liked BioShock 1 you should love 2.  There are many new weapon enhancements, and the great plasmid system is still intact.I've not yet tried the multiplayer, or really have any desire to, and sometimes wish developers would just forget about it and make a longer single player experience.This will be one of the few \"shooters\" that gets 3 or more playthroughs. 95% of shooters I play once and move on, so for me it's that good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2010"}

Yes it had problems but the core for a great game was there and the world was huge. Well pretty much all that remains of the original is the core and it is hardly recognizable. The world is absolutely gigantic. I spent the first twelve hours on the first three islands which are smaller than a few others and they keep you busy by sheer size. Each island has a different culture and architecture scheme from Middle Eastern/Persian to Asian/Japanese to forest island to Old European/typical D&D; landscapes. I am amazed at the amount of detail to each city, village and individual building inside and out.Having split the different worlds between islands was a smart move as it definitely gives a big world feel with a sea dividing the regions rather than having the different cultures packed together on the same land mass. There is music that culturally fits each region.I cannot comment on the magic unfortunately because I am all warrior:) The main draw to this game is supposed to be its massive magic system and effects. I level up on armor and fighting styles but after I get settled and start to roam this massive world I think I will go hunting to level and try my hand at some magic.The combat is loads of fun. Alot of weapons. All sorts of colorful and varying armor. Character animations are great. Slight rag doll physic to death blows. Enemy AI is about as good as Oblivion was..but Oblivion is in a class of its own.Graphics. A new engine has done wonders. Trees, grass, sky, buildings all look incredible. Draw distance is superb. Character animations are good. Lighting and shadows are excellent. A few glitches here and there that I am sure will be complained about but hardly noticeable when taking into account the size of this world and how it can all look this nice.Voice. Many will find fault here. There is incredible improvement over the last. The guy sounds like Bale in Batman. This is not a story driven RPG ala Dragon Age or Mass Effect. This is an open world RPG and the voice acting is more than sufficient.I could go on for a while more about how much I really like this game. Easily my favorite RPG to date. I recommend this on easily to anyone who liked Oblivion. It is not perfect but it is far from flawed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2011"}

Okay, for those who know nothing about the series, it's a sub series in the Mega Man franchise. The sub-series began on the Super Nintendo (or Super Famicom in Japan) which is considered not only one of the best Mega Man games of all time but also one of the best games on the system. 2 more came out (along with Mega Man 7 and Mega Man Soccer, which is not part of the X series) and then eventually went on to the 32 bit era (Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn, as Capcom didn't care for Nintendo's N64 console) and released X4. The graphics were redone but were still in 2D and along with that were cinemas and voice acting. Of course we can forget about voice acting as it was still very bad. Later, in 2001, X5 came out and the gameplay was the same but a few different things were added. X6 came out a year later and this was the final X game to come out for the PSone (Sega's Saturn had only X4 due to being a failure). People were displeased with X5 and X6 due to \"unupdated\" gameplay and difficulty level. Then This... This game came out. When I first played it I was excited to play a new X game because the X games were actually my favorite games of all time. I played through this disaster and my heart was shattered into a million tiny pieces. First of all, you can't play as X... hold on a second, you can't play as X! I later found out why Capcom did this and it was because it was part of the story as X didn't want to fight anymore so you play as Zero and AXL (Why did they make this character? he sucks!). The gameplay was way too weird for my tastes and the boss battles were just terrible. Go on YouTube and look up the gameplay and boss battles for more info. I only played this game once but playing it just once told me to never ever play this disgrace again. Hear Me Out: AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2006"}

This game is worth everything single penny! It's extremely fun, very team-based, graphics are fairly good, campaigns are of much variety, and the game is a great platform for add-ons. The left 4 dead 2 community is also an active and for the most part, a very nice group.Onto some highlights (feel free to jump around):Campaigns are of much variety and actually takes somewhere between 30 min to 1.5 hours to finish all the missions in a campaign.Here's just a quick overview of the campaigns, but do feel free to skip down if you don't feel like reading this portion:Dead Center - This campaign is extremely fun and is actually my favorite. Wonderful planning and creation of a fictional mall. The opening mission is gripping, filled with fire, windows and ledges that call of much caution, and a nice introduction to left 4 dead 2. As you make your progress through the campaign, you'll notice little fine details throughout the mall, providing that environment and vibe that you are in a zombie Apocalypse. Well done campaign here.Dark Carnival - Things take a turn and darkness has starting to settle into this game. This too is a very solid campaign with nice details and environments. As you make your way through the town and into the carnival, you'll notice all the characteristics you'd find in a carnival - games, bumper cars, roller coasters (one mission requires you to walk on the roller coaster), merry go rounds, ticket boxes, shooting games, etc. etc. This was a joy to play through. You'll end up at the concert, which is majestic and well designed. Hit the lights!Hard Rain - Now things are starting to get interesting. As the gang makes their way South, they encounter a hazardous factor - rain. This was the most challenging campaign for me because of 1) the rain 2) the ridiculous engulfing storm 3) and nature of the campaign. Here, you start off near the dock, but you will find out soon that you will making a round trip back. Ingenious idea because as you move forward, you will need to choose wisely which items you want to take with you or conserve as you make your trip back.Swamp Fever - Also a very detailed campaign and set of maps. Not as flashy or nice to look at as the other campaigns, but you will feel engrossed in the swampy, gritty, dark environment. The wooden bridges, swamps, trees, huts and houses, all added  a unique experience. The first few levels are located in swampy regions. The last level is one of my favorite finales, requiring the survivors to ward of zombies, special infected, and tanks on a plantation. The mansion that you will fight in is, to put it simply, epic.The Parish - The last campaign in l4d2 ends in a bang. The maps are filled with many details that are reminiscent of the South, namely New Orleans. Of course, it's not a complete adaptation though.  There's a great variety in the campaigns, with open and closed spaces, top ground and underground, and a fun journey across the south. I especially like the detail and design of the cemetery and bridge. The last level is an epic adrenaline (pun not intended) -pumping race through a bridge. Cars, zombies, tanks, everything alike are swarming in this narrow space, as you make your way to rescue. The plot does seem imply that there might be a left 4 dead 3. Yes, one can wish!As for items, the items and weapons in this game are very fun to use. After you get the hang of how to use the pipe bomb, bile, Molotov, med pack, pills, adrenaline shot, there soon is a clear advantage of knowing when and how to use it. If you communicate well with your teammates and use the items properly, it is a very satisfying gaming experience.Now, we can't forget about the many different melee weapons. Here are some of the melee weapons: cricket bat, chainsaw (oh yes), ninja sword, bat, crowbar (half life reference much?),  fire axe, and several more.The voice acting in left 4 dead 2 is superb. I found myself constantly laughing at Ellis's and Coach's dialogue. Rochelle and Nick's dialogue are also solid too. This just adds to an already fun game.Aside from single player and multiplayer campaign, there are also other modes like versus, realism versus and campaign, scavenge, survival, and mutation. Versus is essentially 4 vs 4 online game play, in which teams take turns either being survivors trying to finish the campaign, or special infected trying to prevent their campaign completion. Scavenge is extremely fun and can get competive, as teams take turns trying to fill up the most gas cans. Survival tests how long you can last (timed) against zombies and special infected. The different modes in this game provide for much variety and replay value.Overall, a very complete and finely detailed game that provides fun, exciting, thrilling, and many hours of zombie-slashing enjoyment. The teamwork and multiplayer strength of this game is remarkable and a testimonial to Valve's continued dominance and excellence in multiplayer games. Highly recommended game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"RPG Fan","summary":"Simple as this...","reviewText":"I've played (and paid fees for) FFXI and didn't enjoy it.

{"product_name":"B00026RFI2","reviewerName":"Vicente Drago \"Shaun O'Donnell\"","summary":"A fun simple fighting game","reviewText":"Of all the Dragon Ball Z fighting games the Budokai series has always been easily the best.  With simple responsive controls and fast paced action, and of course the crazy energy attacks, this stands above the first two as the best of the lot.The story mode is vastly improved over last years title in that it not only follows the story, but allows you to develop your character (limited to the main Z hero's not villians or hidden) and unlock all sorts of hidden goodies as well as the natural progression of attacks and skills.  The difficulty in story mode of course fluctuates and some times forces you to take time to strengthen your character (at randomly placed Battle Zones which range from Saibamen to Meta Cooler).  Also at certain points in story mode (usually the second + time through with a certain character) you can sometimes branch away from the saga and do a movie battle of sorts (after you beat Frieza the first time but before Goku goes Super Sayin you can face off against Cooler instead).  However this leads to complaint #1.  During the key story moments instead of a cool cutscene we get this almost story book form instead that is really uncool.The controls are identical with a few new improvements.  The first is in order to make the action faster you can teleport behind your foe and hit but only if he attacks you first (a counter basically) as well go into hyper mode (all energy at once) which then allows you to unleash your most devastating attacks, which leads me to complaint #2.  When doing the ultimate attacks it's either fastly speeding bar which is fairly inaccurate when you click to max it out or a 3 stage attack which increases the odds of you foe succeeding using the X O /\\ or [].  Most of the time despite being cool and powerful it's more of a pain to unleash than it should be.Graphically it looks like last years model so if you liked the cell shading great if not tough.The Voiceovers are great as expected, I found no problems with any of the voices while playing.  However the Music is complaint #3.  The music is Atari custome midi with little (and I mean very little) to none of the great american tracks that most fans who watch the series state side (not the imported Japanese) get to listen too.  So at moments like when Goku first goes Super Sayin 3 it would be great to hear that track from that moment in the series playing.  Or any big Vegeta fight have his theme going on.Despite some of the shortcomings this is truely is a great game worth playing.  It easlily destroys the past games and overall is worth picking up.  I still say that this is what a 3D streetfighter should be like (or maybe more like the Recent Mortal Kombats it's hard to say).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2004"}

Get behind the wheel of the Enzo Ferrari, Porsche 911, Ford GT, or the Audi R8, to name a few. The physics model of each car is based upon actual car data, so your driving feels like the real deal. Plus, Forza has taken meticulous steps to design each car's visuals according to exact specifications. Teams of artists have worked to reproduce the surface properties of materials in an ultra-realistic fashion -- the painted metal is shiny with gloss, the glass reflects light, and the car's rubber is rich with texture.You can trick out every car with real-world body parts, such as rims, wings, side skirts, bumpers, and hoods.

Ever.","reviewText":"There is something that has taken over my life and slowly but surely sucked all productivity and responsiveness out of my overwhelmed mind.No, it's not the latest reality TV show.It's this game.\"Forza Motorsport\" is simply phenomenal in every way. I have eight other driving games for the Xbox, from arcade racers like \"Burnout 3\" to more realistic ones like \"Sega GT\". \"Forza\" kicks all their butts eight ways to Sunday. It's the Dodge Viper to everyone else's Geo Metro.Okay, that's unfair to titles like \"Project Gotham Racing 2\", which are excellent in their own right.But \"Forza\" takes the racing game formula, bolts on an intercooled turbocharger, limited slip differential, cat-back exhaust and racing slicks, and pumps up the gameplay to a whole 'nuther level.The level of detail and realism in this game is stunning. The graphics are excellent, with the car models resembling those in \"PGR2\", and the environments better than anything out there.But where \"Forza\" really shines is the gameplay. It simply grabs hold of your lapels and yanks you into the cockpit of your latest ride and leaves you panting for more at every turn.An example: Most racing games revolve around unlockables, and \"Forza\" is no exception. There are hundreds of vehicles to unlock, and each one can be upgraded and modified in many ways. But whereas other games usually require you to place in the top three in a race or even win it outright to advance, \"Forza\" takes a different approach. Unless you come in dead last in a race, you will earn money for having completed it. You can then spend that money on upgrading your car. Repeat this process until you win. It's a much better system than the winner-takes-all formula, because it gives you a stake in completing your current race even if you aren't going to win.\"Forza\" has incredible depth and breadth, as well. There are hundreds of cars and dozens of tracks. You start winning some pretty cool cars quite early in the game, too, unlike others where you start with sub-compacts, move on to compacts, and maybe 20 hours later you're driving a Ferrari.There is a great variety of races, too. For instance, one may be open only to mid-engined cars, while another may be restricted to cars under 200 horsepower.\"Forza\" has also packed enough techincal stuff under its hood to keep car geeks happy for a long time. Apart from upgrading the cars with high-performance parts, you can actually go in and tweak various settings of the suspension, tires, etc. You can then test drive the car to see if your adjustments translate into better performance on the track.Another sweet feature is, when you replay a race, you can cycle through all kinds of telemetrics that continously show you things like g-forces, power generation, tire camber, and much more. I don't understand half of it, but it is impressive to watch and drives home how seriously the design team took the creation of this game.I unequivocally recommend this game for anyone who loves cars and wants an unparalleled driving experience on the Xbox.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00004XOWT","description":"If the original PlayStation was the video game console equivalent of the  '60s-era Volkswagen Beetle--economic, reliable, loads of fun--the PS One could  be considered the new Beetle--a hip restyling of those same qualities.Make no mistake: the PS One has all of the same functionality as the original  PlayStation workhorse, will work with all of the same peripherals and  accessories, and will play the existing PlayStation game library, as well as  audio CDs (also note that, like the original PlayStation, it's not compatible  with the more advancedPlayStation  2). The difference here is that this new model is quite a bit smaller than  its older brother, and quite a bit cuter, too.The system is made up of a 32-bit, 34-MHz RISC processor with 16 Mbits of main  memory, 8 Mbits of graphics memory, 24-channel stereo sound, double-speed CD-ROM  drive, and one Dual Shock analog controller. That's not a lot of power, compared  to a next-generation system like theSega  Dreamcast; but, when you factor in its very low price and the enormous  library of games that are available (more than 1,000 that are spread across  every genre imaginable), one can see easily why it's as good a deal as ever. If  rumors of exciting future accessories for the PS One (a four-inch LCD screen  attachment, to name one) are true, this little machine could become a great  option for the on-the-go gamer.--Porter Hall","reviewerName":"Terry Surugy","summary":"Fantastic","reviewText":"This product is fantastic...Its a playstation 1 for god's sake.

McAdams","summary":"Good for gaming, not so great for everything else","reviewText":"I have been testing this keyboard for three weeks now, and I am ready to rate it now.  I am typing this review with it.---------------------------------------------------------------------------For you impatient types, here is your executive review:Gaming functions: 5/5Key profiler and game scan: 4/5Built in audio jack: 5/5Built in mic jack: 5/5Built in USB port: 2/5Built in multimedia controls: 3/5Back-lighting: 5/5Keyboard as a keyboard: 3/5---------------------------------------------------------------------------I think, as a gaming keyboard, the features and functions the G110 offers are excellent.  The macro and quick key functions are easy to use, either with the macro recorder that is built into the keyboard itself, or the \"key profiler\" program which is installed with the keyboard.  The macros work well, and changing between the three modes of macros is a snap with the M1-M3 keys.  You will need (and love) all 3 modes of keys if you are using the keyboard for a complicated RTS or an MMORPG (World of Warcraft, Star Trek Online, Star Wars The Old Republic, etc.).  Additionally, you can record macros for ANY program.  Just open up the key profiler program, and select the program's EXE file, and give it a name.  I assigned some macros for Adobe Premiere and Adobe Photoshop for mundane tasks (that take many menus to do, and don't have convenient hot-keys already) like saving in different formats, and applying the same set of filters, etc. to a file.  Once you learn to record the TIME DELAYS with the macros, then it works beautifully (if you don't the macro goes too fast for most standard programs to respond to, as they are loading up pop-up windows for you to interact with, and there is a time delay on that).I tested the gaming aspect of the keyboard inside THQ'sCompany of Heroes: Gold Editionand Bioware'sDragon Age: Origins.  Interestingly enough, neither of those games was pre-recognized by the automatic \"game scan\" that the key profiler comes with.  The profiler automatically recognized, and created a profile for: Knights of the Old Republic (1 & 2), LOTR Online, LOTR: Battle for Middle Earth (1 & 2), Rise of Nations (and expansion), Starcraft, Titan Quest & Warcraft 3.  But not Company of Heroes or Dragon Age.  I don't know what algorithm it uses to detect games, but it clearly isn't all that up to date.  It also missed: Diablo (all), Baldur's Gate (all), The Longest Journey, Star Wars: Empire At War, Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, Age of Mythology, Neverwinter Nights, Asheron's Call & Dune 2000.  Not a huge annoyance, all you have to do is open the key profiler and create a new profile, and navigate to the game EXE, but it is interesting what it picked up, and what it missed.The built in audio jack does a good job.  It mutes the sound output to the hooked-up 5.1 sound system, and plays the sound only through the headphones you plug into the jack.  The audio comes through quite clear, and the controls for muting it work as advertised.  There is also a grouping of multi-media buttons in the upper right which CAN control your multi-media, if your multi-media understands the signals they send.  They DON'T work with WinAmp or Corel's WinDVD (2010, don't know about earlier versions). They DO work with Windows Media Player (11, I cannot vouch for earlier versions) though.  There is also a mute all button in that grouping, and a volume scroll wheel which only controls your plugged into headphone volume level, not Windows' volume level.The built in microphone jack also works quite well.  The button built to mute it works as advertised, and sound output from it is as good as when the mic is plugged into the main computer.The built in USB port is terrible.  The guide and the product documentation say the port should support up to 100 mA (that's milliamps) of power needs.  In reality, it will beep at you with a horrible noise, and pop-up a message saying, \"USB Hub Power Exceeded: The hub does not have enough power available to operate the USB Composite Device. For assistance in solving this problem, click this message.\"  See customer image I am posting for this product for a screen shot.  It will give you this message for darn near anything.  It refused to power my Logitech MX 510 mouse on 2 out of 3 tries (although, strangely, it powered my G5 easily, go figure).  It flat out refused to power my cell phone's USB charging cable.  It refused to power my Kingston 4GB DataTraveler (DTI/4GB) USB stick.  The USB port is fairly underpowered, and as a result, it is basically useless to me.  This annoyance is the first major reason why I docked 2 stars from this product.The keyboard itself is 2 inches wider than the LITE-ON SK-1688U standard USB keyboard I use (20 inches vs. the Lite-On's 18 inches). You would think that with that additional space (which means it is hanging off my keyboard tray), that the keys would all be full sized and laid out in the standard size and arrangements ... and you would be wrong.  The keys are all about the size of laptop keys.  That is, about 1/3 or even 1/2 smaller than normal.  This takes some SEVERE getting used to, if you are used to normal key layout and size.  I am CONSTANTLY hitting the \"`\" key, when I mean to hit the \"1\" instead, and I often hit CTRL when I meant SHIFT, and the Windows key when I wanted ALT, and I frequently hit the wrong letter keys as well.  You get used to it, but I don't see why the additional FUNCTION buttons couldn't have been smaller, and the normal keyboard keys left the same size and standard layout.  The keys themselves are nice and soft (just like the Lite-On model I normally use), and not clicky at all (which I like).  They are very responsive, and are clearly made with quality in mind.  However, the size and placing issue annoyance cannot be overlooked, and is the other major reason why I docked 2 stars from this product.The back-lighting is a gimmick, and I don't normally even have it on.  You can change the colors to different shades of red and blue (and everything red and blue can be combined to make, I.E. there is a red and blue LED inside it, and you can combine the colors accordingly), and the colors will change depending on what mode you are in (M1-M3) and what color you assigned to that mode.  It works as advertised, though.  So, if you like to play in the dark, it will most certainly help you.Overall, if you ONLY plan to plug this thing in to play games -- especially MMORPGs or complicated RTS games, and you are willing to spend the time teaching it the various macros you will need, and learning how to use them in-game, you will probably LOVE this thing.  If you are someone who WORKS on your computer as well as plays, and you are used to typing a LOT during the day, and you are used to standard sized keys and buttons being in a certain spatial relationship with each other, then expect a learning curve for this keyboard.  It works quite well (except for the USB port), and is obviously a quality product.  I am not sure if it is worth the current asking price, but if it comes down about 1/3 or 1/2 of where it is now, any serious PC gamer could do much worse than this keyboard.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00004W4QJ","description":"Three years ago, gamers were introduced to Aya as she resigned from the  New York Police Department and enlisted as a NMC (neo-mitochondrion creature)  hunter for the shadowy government organization M.I.S.T., a secret agency of  monster slayers somewhere betweenGhostbustersandMen in Black.  Wherever there was a neo-mitochondrion outbreak, Aya and her team were on the  scene to put the boots to the mutants. From the outset, it's evident that  SquareSoft revamped the entire game to give gamers a better looking, sounding,  and (most importantly) playing experience.The game starts with Aya training in the agency's shooting gallery in Los  Angeles. Just as she begins to get in a groove, she is asked to look into some  strange happenings at the Akropolis Tower. When she arrives on the scene, an  explosive, full-motion video flashes across the screen and showcases the death  and carnage as Aya surveys the scene. Her entry into the Tower is where this RPG  begins.SquareSoft has kept some of the excellent elements of the weapons systems from  the firstParasite Evetitle, but went for an entirely new battle system.  Combat is delivered in real time and allows players to run, hide, and open fire.  Aya can tap into her parasitic powers and can unleash elemental, magic-based  attacks on the many foes she encounters. Ammunition is plentiful in the game and  there are plenty of entertaining weapons to choose from. Auto targeting and  involving puzzles are back, though the arrow-pointing interface for solving  these puzzles is really hard to operate.The cinematic mix of story and action is very well done, and the numerous  cutscenes do an excellent job of moving the pace along in a believable way.Even though the originalParasite Evehad its problems, SquareSoft has  pieced together an excellent sequel that will satisfy fans of the first game and  help create many new ones.--Todd MowattPros:New, real-time battle system is an improvement over firstParasite  EveGreat weapons and plentiful ammunitionGreat mix of story and actionCons:Clunky interface for solving puzzles","reviewerName":"\"bosley83\"","summary":"Parasite Eve 2: The Mitochondria Strike Back","reviewText":"Guess what? They're back. The evil mitochondria from the first PE have shown up and this time they're crashing the party in Los Angeles. To top it off Aya is back. Is it just me or is she a little bigger (as in chubbier) and has bleached white hair. Making a return appearance is Eve, only this time she is a sweet innocent little girl. Lets get to it. The game is a very interesting hybrid. It is an RPG mixed with action, strategy, and plays like Resident Evil. This gives it some strengths and some glaring weaknesses. The strengths: the major strength lies in the battle system. It is real-time, so move your whatever or it will get knocked down, action. You move, shot and reload all while your enemy is sneaking up on you. It makes the game play like Resident Evil basically. The magic system has been revamped as well. Instead of gaining spells as you gain levels (levels have been done away with entirely), you gain experience in battle and use it to invoke the spells (12 in !all). The spells follow the fire, earth, wind, and water elements so you can figure out which element's abilities are. Trite isn't it. The controls have also been fine-tuned but can still be quite maddening. This occurs when ever you need to haul [...] fast, like in the Reactor battle. Sometimes it is just easier to use the digital controls instead of the analog. The negatives include the story, or rather the dialouge. The dialouge seems like it was written by a second grader that knew some big words. It's sad really, the first Parasite Eve was written very well. The only saving grace are Aya thoughts. These come up whenever she looks at items and the background. In one such example she looks at a toilet once and says \"Wow that's a nice toilet.\" Look at it again and she says \"dear God I need to get out more.\" Some rather humorous things can be found by analyzing everything till she repeats herself (well I thought they were humorous). The other negative is this massive problem !I have with so-called goverment conspiricies in video games (and the world in general). They may happen in real life but they always seem tacked on in video games, and this game reeks with them. The games main part happens in Area 252 in Nevada while Aya looks for UFOs relating to NMC activity. Can anyone say Area 51? I almost got sick of watching the scenes in the White House, and is it just me or did Clinton call Aya \"very attractive?\" (Get the best ending if you need explaination.)  The story would of been much better if it was handled by the same group that did Vagrant Story.  Now there was a good story and awe-inspiring dialouge.  Also, this isn't the silent era anymore. If a game is described as a cinematic RPG (like PE and PE2) it should have real voice everywhere, not just one worders here and there. The game Koudelka isn't a cinematic RPG and everything except item describtions is spoken (rather well too). PE2 would have been much better with voice acting, even if it !would mean adding a third disk because of memory limitations. Well with that said. My recommendation is to get the game if you can overlook the flaws. Just make sure that you get the player's guide too. It is almost impossible to get the best ending without it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2001"}

Byrd the penguin, Bentley the yeti, and Agent 9 the monkey. I did I mention that Sparx is now playable. Each character has it's own unique set of moves, my personal favorite character is Sgt. Byrd because, not only can he fly, but he can also launch rockets. Sheila is the worst character because she is hard to control. Bentley is okay but he moves too slow and Agent 9 is fun to play as since he has a totally cool raygun. Another new feature is that you can ride on a skateboard and pull of some sick tricks. The story in the game is an evil sorceress captures all the dragon eggs along with her helper, Bianca. So its up to Spyro and Hunter to take back the dragon eggs and defeat the evil sorceress before its too late, but Hunter ends up falling in love with Bianca. The graphics in this game are not to far from perfect and the game itself is amazing, its one of the better games for PSone and still remains the best Spyro game.

Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy.

Unfortunately it has been overshadowed by the PlayStation 2 and newer, shinier first person shooter games.  But enough of that, let me say what this game has done for FPS fans.Perfect Dark brought decent graphics (for a 64 bit system) and many new toys to a genre that is very difficult to make upgrades on.  Although I know a lot of the things in PD weren't really &quot;new&quot; and that PC games used a lot of the techniques before PD came out, PD was the first to bring it all in, and one-uped it by putting it on console.Secondary Weapon fire: I don't think there has been a console FPS since that hasn't had a secondary weapons fire.AI Bots: Yes, you have always had that in single player, but not in Multi-player!  and the ability to not only conrtol their level of skill, but also roughly how they would act?!  Now that is something to be proud of.Play Options: Sure, GoldenEye has Capture the Flag, and a few other little games, but PD brought in more games, better options, and just overall a lot more fun.Weapon select: Getting sick of those crummy little guns in your weapons set?  You and your friends just want to blow each other up with rockets?  Well then, just make up your own set!  Go ahead, select all the weapons you want, or then again, don't!  Slap each other silly, it's up to you.Custom Characters:  This is something that was left out of Timeslitters (I've heard that a lot of the staff that worked on GoldenEye left Rare to become Free Radical).  I happen to like my alien wearing a scubba mask and a trenchcoat.  I think that although this option does not have much playability value, it is kind of fun to see what sort of odd creations some people will come up with.Even the newer PS2 games with all their fancy graphics cannot match up to PD in all aspects.  Let's just hope that the next installment of PD is just as good, and has all the fun fun toys that the original has (remember now kiddies that although Rare is making what is being called &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot;, at least some of the Rare team has gone off to play on the Free Radical Team, we'll just have to sit and wait I guess).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2001"}

The graphics are 2001 standards admittedly, but graphics do not define a game.  (For example, some of us still play Galaga and Ms. Pac-Man for the gameplay and not the graphics. )  The assembling of teams in this game is quite cool and adds a little bit of thinking involved.  What I like about this game is that your team AI is much better than SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs for the Playstation 2.  They actually assist in providing cover fire when you are escorting hostages across enemy territory.  True, the areas themselves are limited and you can only move down specific ramps and such (but that was 2001, folks!), but some of the areas are quite large.  There is no music while on a mission, and that only adds to the realism (as opposed to SOCOM, which has music on a mission).  Another great feature is the replay value of the missions and arenas.  You can put on the Firefight option ot relieve stress after work.  Also, you can unlock \"heroes\" in this game.  These heroes possess better weapons, better skills and better leadership.  Some of the weapons are monsters such as the M60, PKM, and the AN-91/Grenade Launcher.  Furthermore, some of the missions and environments are absolutely awesome. The Battefield, Vilinus, Mountain, and Red Square missions are incredible and capture the element of war.  In the Vilinius mission, for example, you escort three tanks through a war-torn city, filled with rogue terrorists, and you can feel the tanks rolling beside you.  Lastly, unlike SOCOM, you can improve the soldiers' abilities if they survive the mission.The faults of the game are few.  First, the arenas should permit more mobility.  Second, the AI of your team can still be improved.  Lastly, the two-player split-screen co-op should permit modified kits.If you want to really feel the impact of war, put the game on Elite where the game places snipers that camp and hide and lead squads of enemies after you that seek cover.  Trust me, you have to be better than the Best to survive without an entire squad or both squads being crippled or eliminated, especially on the Battefield level.  Please send me an e-mail if you happen to not suffer from any deaths of team members (without saving) during the \"Battefield\" mission on the \"Elite\" level.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2003"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Spectacular","reviewText":"Proving that change can be quite good, Nintendo's long running portable turn-based strategy series Advance Wars gets a fresh coat of paint with Advance Wars: Days of Ruin.  Taking a more mature themed storyline, Advance Wars: Days of Ruin still features pretty much the same tried and true gameplay that fans of the series will come to expect and will be quite easy for them to pick up and play.  Besides a more mature themed storyline, Days of Ruin also features a more comic-style artistic design scheme and a less cartoony feel to it as well, making it a pleasure to look at as well as play.  Sadly, the Shop that was in previous installments of the series has been done away with, but what we get instead is some spectacular multiplayer and Wi-Fi options that only up the replay value even more so than ever before.  The single player mode, which has been shortened when compared to Dual Strike, is still great as well, but the multiplayer options are where the most fun is to be had.  While there's really nothing new in terms of the overall gameplay mechanics of Advance Wars, Days of Ruin remains a spectacular strategy game that delivers on all fronts.  All in all, fans of the Advance Wars series will should cry with joy once they pop in Advance Wars: Days of Ruin, which is undoubtedly one of the best installments in the series, and one of the best strategy games and multiplayer experiences you'll have on your DS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"M.

Though it is not as long or hard it still is pretty good. Brawl has many more things to do but the melee game has a better battle for multiplayer. The melee i like the music better because they are the original soundtracks from the actual games. Melee is also one of the oldest games for the GC and it has some of the best graphics of all of the GC games. Man, does this game bring back many good memories!

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"Stellar!!!","reviewText":"CONCEPTSet in post-apocalyptic America, The Last of Us centers around Joel and Ellie, two survivors who must trek the overgrown and long abandoned cities and towns scavenging for bullets and supplies, all the while having to look over their shoulders and around corners for those who would hurt them, whether they be militant extermination squads, murderous looters, or the grotesque infected that roam and hunt in predatory packs.GRAPHICS/SOUNDLike usual with Naughty Dog, The Last of Us is a beautifully rendered game to every detail. Sprawling cities are overgrown with greenery, old decrepit skyscrapers have collapsed, either leaning against neighboring buildings or as a heap of rubble blocking your path. The ambient surroundings have a realistic effect to them that makes the surroundings extremely believable. If this were to happen in real life, THIS is how it would look. Facial rendering is some of the best I've seen since Heavy Rain, and this gives it a run for it's money. Also in high quality is the erie music that serves as the backbone of the dark toned plot line. Speaking of plot...I don't think I've ever had to fight back tears in a video game, much less within the first 10 minutes! What also needs to be mentioned is the voice acting. HO-LY CRAP. Simply phenomenal script and voice acting. There are several of little side conversations and comments that take place that give every character so much more depth than what you're used to in a video game. Those little comments do WAY more for the experience of the game than you would think. After The Last of Us, every other game's dialog will come off hokey and cheap, at least more than usual.GAMEPLAYMuch like their flagship series Uncharted, TLOU has a very well polished and fluid gameplay dynamic. While Nathan Drake may have been quite the nimble athlete, Joel and Ellie are much more realistically grounded, but their movements are natural and the layout of the controls is a well tuned configuration. I think my only hangup would be that there is a little bit of realism taken away from moments when STEALTH is key, and your AI partner is running around right in front of the bad guys and they don't seem to notice. But really that's it. While I would usually want to refrain from comparing games for a review, I will say that the feel of the game is A LOT like Uncharted, but I fail to see how that is a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination.OVERALL/REPLAY VALUEA truly great game isn't \"played\" so much as it is \"experienced\". The Last of Us is most definitely and experience on many levels. This served as an excellent send-off for the PS3 before Playstation and it's developers turned their focus onto the upcoming PS4. The quality of the game alone would be enough to play it again, never mind the trophy chasers and easter egg finders, it's an excellent game to experience for both casual gamers and completionists.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2013"}

But game is very addicting!","reviewText":"I really want to like this game I really really do but right now I can't even play it. I'm not alone in this. The Tech board on the Naughty Dog forum is full of people like me who are experiencing glitches in the cut scenes. Skipping, black bars, or just black screens with nothing at all. My experience got worse the more I tried to fix it. It began with picture skipping and audio freezing. i decided to skip the movie (unfortunately) and go straight to the game play. The game play was flawless. However, it skipped again when another cut scene came up. I couldn't take it. I've deleted games from my hard drive, cleaned my system with a cleaner disc, then sprayed with some compressed air. It worked slightly better but then the screen went totally black. I deleted the save data along with the patch to start fresh with the game. Now the game won't install at all. I get an error message. All of my other games play just fine, even uncharted 3 so it has to be an issue with the disc or game itself. Right now I am exchanging my game for a replacement. Hopefully it will arrive and everything will be okay. If not then I hope the devs fix this issue.Update: Szatan on the forum posted: \"Did You notice that most of PS3 games installing some files on hdd? Well The Lost of Us don't!

Geez.Update 6/30/13: My replacement disc from amazon arrived and the night before I vacuumed out my PS3 the night before, I can't tell you which method worked for me as others have done the same thing and still had issues. I'm happy to say that the game works now. I've played for several hours so far and I've only noticed a slight hiccups and some rubber banding but not noticeable. the game so far is amazing! I am loving the game play. However I have a few issues. So far there is no game map, I have picked up maps in the game but they all seem useless. the game does give hints as far as direction but most of the time i was running around trying to figure out where to go and it was getting really annoying. Only after several minutes did a hint pop up to point in the right direction but not much. I love the fighting, guns, and enemies although I wish I had more ammo. it really helps you learn to spare a few shots when you can. the transition between cut scenes and game play is flawless. right now I have not completed the game so I don't want to review the story yet but this game is very addicting.Update 7/1/13: I've finished the game and I can't believe how much I love it! The story was amazingly well done and I love how they avoided the typical cliches that can arise with stories like these. The ending itself, while some may consider unsatisfying was well done in my book. I love how simple it all is, and how there are no right or wrong choices. Everyone was doing whatever they needed to do to survive even Joel and you see first hand just how living in that type of world can change you. I wish I can go deeper into the storyline itself but I'm afraid I might give out spoilers. Anyway, I highly recommend this game. The game truly out shined the tech issues.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00B67ZTUW","description":"","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"The death of the JRPG, pt. 2 (Thanks, Obama!)","reviewText":"Initially I reviewed this game rather favorably. While nothing groundbreaking, Tales of Xillia seemed a nice JRPG in an age where JRPGs have been mediocre to downright bad. Unfortunately, a crazy thing happened on the way to the ending, and this now becomes part 2 of my ongoing series of the death of the JRPG.The JRPG has not aged well. At all. One of the main culprits is the cut scene. While cut scenes were nice to break the monotony of traditional turn-based fare in years past, they really don't hold up in this age. This is one of the main reasons, IMHO, that the JRPG has failed to expand beyond its dedicated-but-aging fanbase. No one wants to sit through poorly-voiced movies. It is particularly tiresome in RPGs in which battle actually requires more than an exchange of turn-based attacks.Tales of Xillia apparently didn't get the memo. An already-linear affair is broken up by cut scene after cut scene. They are mostly predictable. Go from one area to another, get a cut scene. Move from one town screen to another, get a cut scene. Fight a boss. Get a cut scene. I had heard that this game was better about this than Tales of Graces f. It's a dirty lie - this game is riddled with cut scenes, most of which are completely disposable due to a horribly-paced story line that goes nowhere for hours. Add to this the generally-lacking voice-over work, and you will be bored to tears.Speaking of story, why do the JRPG fans like these tired stories, which require absurd deus ex machina events to go anywhere? Tales of Xillia has some of the dumbest development I have EVER seen in a game. It is just terrible. My party was betrayed, NUMEROUS TIMES, by one of its members, and yet again and again, they ask him back into the fold? I defeat one boss enemy, and yet she is able to escape by...a backwards crab crawl? (I am not joking about this, by the way - a single female enemy, who has just been beaten down, managed to escape 6 able-bodied party characters by crawling away, face UP, on her hands and feet.) And speaking of bosses, why is it that when I beat a boss, s/he doesn't even feel it? In one hilarious instance, I absolutely kicked the crap out of a major boss, and yet the cut scene that followed showed MY party sucking wind, while he was gearing up for a super attack.It's terrible. It's a monumental joke that these same tired gags keep appearing. It was one thing when a character was a half-inch sprite on a 19-inch television. I could at least use my imagination to explain their escape (such as when Golbez gets beaten down, but turns into a giant hand to steal a crystal and escape). But now? It's much, MUCH harder to suspend disbelief.Thankfully, the gameplay of Tales of Xillia does redeem it somewhat, although action-driven battle only makes the cut scenes all the more boring. I've always enjoyed Tales battle systems, and this is no exception. It keeps this from being the slog that other RPGs become (such as, e.g., a Gust offering), and it's enough to keep me coming back for more of the horrible storyline.With regards to graphics and design, the developers really mailed it in. I'm pretty sure that every environment is just a palette swap. How many times did I walk through the same area populated by trees and boulders? Well, to give you an idea, at one time, the area I went through was called a TUNDRA, and it still had the same trees in it, only differently colored (If you don't see the problem, look up the word \"tundra\"). The scenery is so repetitive. Apparently, every single town decided that its seahaven should look identical.The praise for this game is unwarranted. This game is nothing compared to Tales of Graces f (which wasn't exactly fantastic, by the JRPG standards of the past). There is a reason the JRPG continues to flounder (and yes - I know that pre-orders for this game were very high. It just further goes to show the destructive influence of irrational fans).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2014"}

He is a genius hacker with a dark past. He was a criminal in the past and his actions led to the tragic death of his family. Now Aiden is out for blood and aims to take down the criminals. This takes place in the future and in the city of Chicago. There is a sophisticated computer network in place that can control practically everything around the city. Aiden can hack into the network and take control and utilize them as additional resources. There are tons of opportunities to hack the system. For example if you are in a car being chased by the cops you can switch traffic signals all to green so there will be an accident. You can also raise a drawbridge so the cops are stuck on the other side. I won't ruin all the surprises but there are tons of different hacks and you can unlock many more as you progress.You can also unlock new combat moves and crafting skills. You earn skill points as you play and you can unlock the skills that are most interesting to you. You can craft new items from parts that you find or purchase at a pawn shop. For example you can craft a lure that you throw down as a distraction to get people to go to it. As you fight there are many things to consider and you really need to adjust your methods depending on the situation. Sometimes you will need to be stealthy and sneak in and out unnoticed. Other times you can go in guns blazing. It just depends on how many guys you are up against and what your goal is. There are tons of different campaign missions and side missions along the way. Every few minutes it will pop up and say that a crime is in progress and you can choose to intervene or not. There are online missions to play as well. You can also just explore the vast city and get into trouble with no real purpose at all. Just keep in mind that the citizens will love or hate you depending on your actions. If you are constantly running down innocent people with your car then they will eventually hate you and will cooperate with the police to nail you. If you are careful not to cause civilian casualties and are constantly helping the citizens of Chicago then they will love you and will be much less likely to turn you in.This game is incredibly complex and thoroughly entertaining to play. There are tons of weapons to choose from and unlock and loads of different cars to drive and unlock. In a way this game has a lot of the same characteristics as Grand Theft Auto but there many differences as well. The language in Grand Theft Auto is pretty bad and it's hard to play with my kids in the house. This game certainly has some language but it's not even remotely close to being as bad as Grand Theft Auto. I like Grand Theft Auto a lot too but I honestly enjoy playing Watch Dogs more.The city is huge and you can explore wherever and whenever you like. Whether it's on the streets, roof tops or in the water inside a boat or swimming there is always some place new to explore. The graphics in this game are very detailed and smooth. The whole experience really pulls you into the games and makes it feel like real life. This is going to be my favorite game for the foreseeable future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2014"}

It's sold out everywhere.  Grannies are playing Wii Sports in nursing homes because it's so easy to pick up and play.  But here's what you won't hear -- the Wii is a pitifully outdated piece of junk with one major gimmick (the motion control).  I'd like to see follow-up news stories about the grannies to see whether they still turn the thing on.  I know that mine now mostly collects dust, as do most other WiisThe defining features of the Wii is its motion control.  Here's the dirty little secret that the fanboys and enthusiastic recent buyers won't tell you: the Wii controls are terrible.  I have played through a lot of games, ranging from the AAA titles like Mario Galaxy and Zelda, to the party games like Mario Party 8 and Wii Sports and I can say this -- motion control is awful.  There is absolutely no precision to it.  If you had dreams of using the Wii-mote realistically like a lightsaber, than forget it. It doesn't facilitate any kind of decent control.  The only game where motion control actually improves the gameplay is Wii Bowling.  In every other game, it's generally an annoyance that is used in gimmicky fashion.  Random button pressing has been replaced with random Wii-mote gesturing.  By the time you have played a game like Zelda or Bully for a few hours, you will be wishing that you could push buttons in lieu of waving your Wii-mote around.  This is why 90% of the software on the Wii is shovelware party games.  This is why the Wii has the lowest ratio of software to hardware sales out of the three major consoles.Speaking of shovelware, the Wii has by far the worst library of any game console this decade.  Most of what comes out for it is unplayably bad.  There are a few great first party Nintendo titles (which are largely rehashes from prior Nintendo platforms), and a few great third party titles like Bully and Resident Evil 4 that are already available on other systems.  Every multiplatform game that comes out, whether its Madden football, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, Guitar Hero, or a Call of Duty game, puts its worst version on the Wii.  If you don't believe me, then look up the reviews for these games.  The Wii always gets the worst version of every game.  I cannot think of one single exception to this rule.The reason for the poor Wii software library is that the Wii is nothing mroe than a Gamecube with gimmicky motion controls.  Everything about the technology, like graphics, level size, and loading times, are bad.  The Wii sees none of the recent advances that have improved video games, like realistic physics.  Not only does the Wii not get a good version of multiplatform games, it doesn't get the great games that take advantage of modern technology.  Fallout 3, Grand Theft Auto IV, Mass Effect, Far Cry 2, Dead Space, Left 4 Dead, Assassins Creed, Portal, Half-Life 2.  You cannot play these great games on the Wii.  Want to know why? Because they won't work on the Wii's 2001-esque technology.  You can't get downloadable content for Rock Band on the Wii.  Why? Because it lacks a hard drive.Two years ago, the price point for the Wii was a major selling point, but now that that PC hardware, the XBox 360, and the PS3 have dropped in price, this is no longer much of an advantage.  You can actually get a barebones XBox 360 for $50 less than a Wii now.The only people for whom I would recommend this console are:A:  People with children between the ages of 3 and 10B:  People who have lots of social gatherings at their house.The Wii is a good console for children because of the simplicity of the games, and the motion controls do add a certain element of fun when you are playing with other people.  I must say that the times where my in-laws have come over have seen the Wii get a lot of use.  Other than that, not much.

The graphics are great. The game play is great. There is not a frustrating moment in sight. Immersion is awesome. I never had as much of a feeling of \"being there\". Vehicles drive great. It is an experience you want to go on and on...Unfortunately, the whole thing gets visible worse in the later part of the game, once you get inside the alien compound. First, you have no ammo, as you go through one of the most disorienting levels I ever played. So you end up literally punching the aliens if you happen to start out the level wrong.Once you get out of there, things get chaotic and you just kinda blow your way through without much aiming. Then you get to a flying sequence that is borderline broken, the thing is so unresponsive. Aliens are flying around you, and it takes you 20 seconds to turn your ship around. Not fun. (A patch made this a little better but it is still like a low-budget, awful game mixed in for no real reason other than making the game longer perhaps). All of a sudden, random tornadoes creep up behind you and suck you in and there is nothing you can do about it. (And it will probably take you 5 or 10 attempts before you even realize what is going on. At first you think it is just random crashes).In the later levels, the game also tends to leave you without much guidance or even misguidance. At one point you need to walk into a chamber. Over your comm system you hear \"can your suit handle this level of radiation?\", which your character confidently answers \"yes it will\". So you walk in, and - whack - you are dead. Too much radiation. What the...?!?Luckily, the game automatically saves often and at fair spots. In addition, you can go to the menu and save anywhere you want. I felt that that was a great system. You don't quick-save all the time, but if you really do end up at a spot where you wish you could save yourself, you can.I should also mention that the game crashes a lot, even with patch 1.2. I must have experienced 10+ blue-screens playing this game as well as a number of crashes to the desktop. I am not sure why, but it seems that is one characteristic that all German games share. Where is that German engineering?!? (I can say this, because I am from Europe myself :-)This is still a great game and I had a blast. With better quality control and the game play fun staying up in the last 3rd of the game, this would have been a 5-star game no questions asked. As things stand, with the last parts of the game I remember having been bad, I am tempted to give it 3 stars, but 4 is more appropriate overall.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2008"}
{"product_name":"B007SRM5U6","reviewerName":"ITBeast \"ITBeast\"","summary":"He Who Laughed Last, A Review of Batman Arkham City","reviewText":"This is a review of Batman Arkham City: Game of the Year Edition for the PS3After completingBatman Arkham Asylum: Game of the Year Greatest Hits(At least all of the Campaign Story including the Riddler Challenges) I was all ready for Arkham City. However, the edition I wanted was the newly released GOTY (Released May of this Year) since this not only had literally almost ALL the DLC that came out before, during and after the initial release of the original edition that came in October of 2011 (See included DLC Below) but also included the Batman: Year One Movie for free as a Digital Download from the PSN Network, and the price was almost $50 dollars at the time I originally looked so I decided to wait. Then one day God answered my prayers and had dropped the price for $29.99 with prime for about a week, upon the initial discovery of this I immediately ordered the game and was in business 2 days later. The price eventually did go back up between $45 to $50 dollars, again I was very fortunate. For those who played the first game this is basically Batman Arkham Asylum on Venom, it about 3 times the size, complexity, and overall fun of the 1st game on a much Wider Open End Scale that will have you playing for days. Not only do almost all the characters from the 1st game return (With both Batman and Joker being voiced again by both Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil Respectively) but so do some of Batman's other staple villains are prominently featured in this game like Two-Face, Penguin (voiced by Nolan North of the Uncharted Franchise), Mr. Freeze, Hugo Strange, Ra's al Gul , Clayface, The Mad Hatter, Deathshot and more. As far as Batman's allies not only are you rejoined by Oracle but you are joined by Robin, Tim Drake, the 3rd incarnation, Playable in the Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC Expansion pack and the challenge Maps). Nightwing, Dick Grayson The original Robin, only playable in the Challenge Maps.  Alfred Pennyworth (Bruce Wayne's Loyal Butler) who acts as a secondary Intel source and helps supply Batman's arsenal through the game. Catwoman, Batman's on again off again foe and ally and sometimes more, while in Arkham City on her own agenda she does come through for Batman when the situation warrants. She is playable in the Main story Campaign (Due to Catwoman's Expansion pack DLC being integrated into the Main Arhkam City Story Line) and of course all the challenge Maps. This game definitely delves deeper into the Batman Mythos and explores more of not only Batman's character but that of its supporting cast as well.Plot: Almost a year after the events of Arhkam Asylum, Mayor Quincy Sharp (The former Warden of Arhkam Asylum) has decided to close both Blackgate Prison (Which housed all of Gotham's toughest Criminals) and Arhkam Asylum since in his opinion they could no longer \"adequately\" house Gotham's criminal population and in its stead relocate them into a large district of Gotham's oldest and slummiest district. This relocated district of Gotham would be cut off from the rest of Gotham City and be called \"Arkham City\". Bruce Wayne, Gotham's most wealthy and respected citizen (Along with Batman's alter Ego) stages a peaceful demonstration on the dangers of the new prison when the new Warden of Arhkam has Bruce Wayne taken captive by his mercenary security.  The New Warden then confronts Bruce (who turns out to be Batman's old Nemesis Hugo Strange) of cooperating with his plans or face the risk of his secret identity being exposed. Hugo Strange then promptly turns Bruce over into the Prison population and then is almost immediately taken by Penguin, who holds a nasty grudge against the Wayne Family. Once Bruce takes out Penguin and his thugs he has Alfred Air drop his Batsuit into Arhkam City. Once Bruce dons his famous cowl he then starts his quest to find out who is really behind Arkham City, What is \"Protocol 10\", and along the way once again Batman squares off with Joker who is slowly dying from the after effects of injecting himself with the mutating TITAN formula from the events in Arkham Asylum, who wants to finally even the score with the Dark Knight once more before his ultimate fate is decided.Gameplay:  As with Arhkam Asylum the majority of the Game is played in the 3rd person aspect only shifting to 1st person when going through underground service vents or building air Shafts. The Controls are very similar to asylum on controlling batman with a few exceptions mainly concerning the location of Batman's gadgets. Rocksteady improved the free flow fighting system to make it more rhythmic than the 1st game. You get most of Batman's Gadget's and upgrades that you received at the end of asylum however there are improved modifications that as before you will have to earn the necessary XP in order to receive them. The Riddler's Challenges has not only doubled in quantity of finding or solving (Going from 240 to 440 from the 1st game) but you may have to actually disarm or solve a sequence of combination to retrieve the Riddler Trophy, and some of them can only be retrieved/solved as Catwoman. There are approximately 12 side missions that can be done either during the main campaign story or after including one side mission that is integrated with the Riddler's Challenges. The Predator and Combat challenge maps are back in spades including some that have combined some of the other challenge Maps with a Side Scrolling \"Street Fighter\" Style Challenge Maps.Plus Mission: The \"Plus\" Mission is the campaign story of Batman Arkham City that is unlocked after completing the intiail campaign that auguments the challenge of each of the original objectives of the original campaign story and side missions. For example, if you originally say fought 6 or 7 henchman unarmed you are now facing that same objective with maybe one and a half to twice the number of henchman with knives and shock stickes. Another example is on a predator Map instead of the henchmen being just \"armed\" they are now using the \"Armored\" henchmen with a gun that cannot be taken down silently from behind. There are a couple of cool things in plus Missions for example you get to use all the upgrades and gadget obtained in the intial campaign story from the get go except if the part of the story you are exploring does not allow you to use the gadget yet. You can choose what Batman Skin you would like to use (See below of list of available Batman skins) instead of the Default Batman Skin. You do not have to \"re-solve or re-find\" any of the Riddiler's Riddles or Riddler Trophies if you have already solved or found them in the intial campaign, however you may have to resolve a riddle or 2 if the story dictates.Level Of Difficulty: Even through there are only 3 Dificulty options listed (Easy, Normal, and Hard) there are actually a total of 6 dificulty levels once you include the Plus Missions. For example if you play Arkham City on \"Normal\" when you unlock the \"Plus\" Mission the difficuly is harder than \"Normal\" but not has bad as Hard. Overall Rocksteady diffently fixed the \"Difficuly\" problem from Arkham Asylum where there was only the Easy, Normal, and Hard and the Hard Difficuly felt more like a Normal Difficuly with the exception of the Posin Ivy Boss fight. I orginally started playing Arkham City on hard but actually had to lower it to Normal to play the game the 1st time through.Included DLC (Downloadable Content) With the Game of the Year Edition - Basically everything that was released from the time of Pre-order of the original Edition of Arhkam City to the release of the GOTY Edition of this game is included with this game:- The Catwoman Expansion Pack and additional Skins, Integrated into the main Campaign Story.- The Harley Quinn's Revenge Expansion Pack, takes place 2 weeks after the Main Campaign events in Arkham City. The Story has both Batman and Robin as playable Characters.- Batman Alternate Skins Bundle which include The Dark Knight Returns, Batman: Year One, Batman Inc, The Sinistro Corps, Silver Age (1970s) Batman, Batman: Earth One, Batman Beyond,  Animated Batman, and of course the original skin for the game.- The Nightwing Bundle which include the Animated Skin and additional Challenge Maps.- The Robin Bundle which include the Red Robin and Animated Robin Skins along with the additional challenge Maps.- As an additional Bonus The Batman: Year One animated Movie based on the original Batman Year One Comic Story as presented in Batman Vol.1 #404 thru #407. Available as a free DLC Download on the PSN Network in the Northern United States and Canada until March 31st, 2013.All of this together is approximately worth $60 - $70 dollars if purchased seperately that comes with the GOTY Edition for free.3D: As with the 1st game N/A on the 3D since I feel playing it in 3D would ruin some aspects of the game. However for those who want to take advantage of the 3D aspect be warned this game DOES NOT COME WITH THE 3D GLASSES! You will have to go to the Trioviz web site to order the 3D glasses, just do a google search for the Trioviz website.Plus Side of the Game:- Even through the same Game Engine was used for the games graphics (Epic Games Unreal Engine 3) as in Asylum the Graphics are a lot more detailed and life like than previously displayed in Asylum (The graphics for that were just awesome as well!).- Easier to control the free-flow combat maneuvers than in Asylum- Being able to Play Batman in his other skins once you have completed the intial campaign- The completely Open Ended Map of Arhkam City itself, not as limited as Arhkam Island.- Great Story, Once again wonderful job by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini.- Top Knotch performances by Mark Hamil (Joker), Nolan North (As a uniqely more bestial Penguin), Kevin Conoroy (Batman), and Wally Wingert in a very expanded and more menacing Riddler (His role was basically reuced to 3rd string in Ayslum to only voice).- Great Expansions on Batmans Gadget and Gliding abilities.Minus Side of the Game: While there really is no real minus side to this game (At least to where I would knock a star off) there are a couple of annoyances...- The Controls did not always respond as you would like them to (Same problem as in Asylum)- After the game ends the thugs you take down as Batman do not \"Stay Down\" for the rest of the after missions which can be annoying when they regenerate a couple of screens later.In Conclusion: Not only is this a Worthy follow up to Asylum but in alot ways superior to the 1st game. This is well worth the purchase and even if you have the original version of this game I would still think twice about purchasing the GOTY Edition if you do not have the additional DLC already. A Must buy for true Batman Fans! If you have not playedBatman Arkham Asylum: Game of the Year Greatest Hitsgo ahead and pick this up first, Arkham City references alot to Asylum and for approximately $17 new you might as well play it anyways.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2012"}

I thought I didn't want any goals in games, because it was so appealing to just do whatever you want. But, I just can't seem to really feel like traveling for no reason... However, in my opinion it got boring quickly.Cons:1) Not wanting to be someone who got out of prison.2) Hard to hit something in battle3) Not sure what to do in the beginning (where I should go)4) Characters are unattractive, and move strangely.5) The Wood Elves look like aliens6) Loading time in some areas7) The amount of time needed to play the gamePros:1) The water is great looking, as well as the rest of the graphics.2) There are millions and millions of items.3) The controls are fairly easy to learn (Very similar to Halo's)4)Interesting storyline.5) Character development6) The Class SystemMany people should read more about this game before they get it, this isn't like a Final Fantasy RPG, this is a very sophisticated and in-depth RPG. In my opinion, many people can simply get used to playing RPGs such as these, however it will burn up a large amount of time. Since all of the NPCs (non player characters) have a lot to say, it could take nearly an hour to talk to everyone around town, although in my case I didn't bother talking to most of the people. Traveling town-to-town only takes about 5-10 min. if you don't run into complications, which is a great improvement in comparison to some other RPGs, in which it may take an hour to travel somewhere.There is also an excellent class system, where you can make your own class. This is one of the best features I encountered. The races, however, I didn't like, especially the females of the race. Basically, none of the faces nor hair appealed to me.Many will find this game hard to understand at first, especially those who have never played a RPG like this before. I spent a year and a half playing everquest, when it eventually took over my life and I went cold turkey. Even though Everquest doesn't have a story, it is very similar, and I like the character graphics a lot better. (Clothes, Faces, Hair, etc.). However, I do not recommend Everquest in any way.Basically, what it all comes down to is being a patient person willing to spend a large amount of time playing. Also, one who knows what they want to do in the game, and has an idea of something to do.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"Final Fantasy X","reviewText":"In the most classic and richest sense, Final Fantasy X encapsulates the struggle between a domineering father and a strengthening son; only Kafka put to paper a better interpretation of this theme, yet FFX is the inverse of The Metamorphosis: instead of a son finding himself having become a beetle upon waking, subsequently locked away in his room, fed by his sister, mourned by his mother, and despised, even feared, by his father, the creators of FFX have transformed the father into a monstrous entity simply referred to as Sin who punishes the towns and people of the futuristic world of Spira, hoping that one day his son, who he (Sin) has transported 1,000 years into the future, will defeat him and throw an apple into the back of his misery.You assume the role of Tidus, a professional blitzball player from the past, who is seeking to find his way home, if he can, to Zanarkand, a city destroyed by Sin. Tidus quickly befriends a group of guardians who are escorting a Summoner, Yuna, on her pilgrimage through Spira at the end of which she hopes to defeat Sin. The game's quest follows a pretty linear path.Each character of the game possesses the ability to go into overdrive mode after taking so many attacks. Initiating an effective overdrive attack isn't as simple as just pushing (X) and watching the lightshow. Nope. With characters like Auron, your truly bad-ass fighter (reminds me of Cid from previous installments of FF), you need to perform button combinations within a set amount of time. Depending on how well (or lucky) you are, the amount of damage inflicted increases. You quickly obtain most of your party. This includes: a mage, Lulu, another blitzball player, surfer-boy, Wakka, Kimahri, Yuna's guardian since birth, and eventually Rikku, an Al-Bhed (three races/faiths in the game: Guado, Yevon, & Al-Bhed), and of course Auron, Tidus' quasi-stepfather.I don't want to spend a lot of time discussing the graphics, since it's a given they're going to be pretty damn good. Your world is a complete 3D environment. In fact, you don't have a world-view map that you wander through-be this a good thing or a bad thing depends on who you are. Your characters are richly colored (almost reminiscent of Chrono Cross) and actually have voice-overs for their dialogue; yep this is new to the series. Luckily, the acting is as bad as most games out there. And you're going to swear Wakka reminds you of one of the characters out of Shenmue.Abilities are handled in a completely new way. As a player, you're now able to determine kind of the path your character is going to take. This is done through a system coined Sphere Grid. At the end of each battle, your characters can earn Sphere levels as well as different types of Spheres (mana, power, speed, ability, etc.). The Sphere Grid is this table of interconnected, unfilled spheres that contain different attributes. You spend Sphere Levels to move across the grid and place Spheres in empty spaces to obtain more attributes, skills, or spells. Now, this isn't as easy as going in a straight line; rather, there are times when you're going to need to back-track to gain abilities or raise HP/MP. It's best that you plan ahead before spending your Sphere Levels because once you've spent them you're stuck until you get more.As an aside, the game offers the chance to play blitzball from any save point (that is once you've earned this ability). Blitzball is basically a side-diversion, since there are really no side-quests per se. The game also offers you the ability to recruit Blitzball players for your team, the Aurochs. I really didn't spend too much time with this, since the Blitzball matches are pretty primitiveOne of my long-standing complaints about the Final Fantasy series has been how encounters are handled. In previous installments, battles took a considerable amount of time to initiate and complete. Square has quickened this process up some, but you still have those random encounters that can become infuriating if you're not into fighting for every step you take. A decent job has been done at tapering this some. It feels as if a lot of work went into integrating your battles into the actual story of the game. Forget wandering around until you've leveled up enough to continue in the game.As far as RPG titles for the PS2 go, this is another owner; however, I must put forth that the game time is significantly lower than previous installments. It's also not as in-depth as previous Final Fantasy titles. To me it feels like Square is getting its feet wet on the PS2, but not completely jumping in. That's unfortunate, as so much could have been done with the world of Spira. One plus, however, is that FFX resembles some of the colorful traits of Chrono Cross-at least, this was a plus for me. The game feels like an RPG designed and drawn by a surfer in California or Hawaii. Final Fantasy X is another trendsetter for the platform. We see Square push through a decent storyline--albeit linear-- and introduce us to another lovely world with intensely archetypical characters; however, it remains plainly simple compared to some of its predecessors, especially last year's Final Fantasy IX, which was a nice return to the original theme of the series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Jshelt21","summary":"Final Fantasy 10","reviewText":"As the other games in the series I very much enjoyed this game. Right from the start you can see how amazing the graphics and which continue through the entire game. The story was different and intresting and the voice acting was okay at times and bad at others but still brought the final fantasy games to a new level. However this is where the games start to seem too easy. I very much enjoyed playing this game adn leveling up but it never wwas much of a challange, I died once in the game and it was easy to figure out where to go and at times there was hard bosses to me the hardest was when you fight Sin on the airship \"which was the only time I died in the game\" but after that the final bosses just seemed to be a joke in difficulty. I love a good story in games which is one of the reasons I love the Final Fantasy series but I also enjoy a challange so this one could have been better.But It is still a great game with amazing graphics and a intresting story and worth playing more than one time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2012"}

Unlike other MK games that seem to have depth, codes, secrets, hacks, cheats, and even the famed \"TOASTY!\"  Where you hit a button sequence and fight a character in order to unlock him this game complete LACKS the subtle charms of other MK games.Where it delivers in SPADES however is DC vs MK!!!  EVERYONE has always wanted to see it and finally we do...unfortunately, the game lacks inventiveness. They don't explore a Magical Morph Fight between the Green Lantern and Shang Tsung, an Eye Laser Death match between Super Man and Kano, a Lightning Fight between Raiden and Captain Marvel, the options are ENDLESS and yet none of them were explored...and for that matter, why does Captain Marvel's Electricity hurt Raiden and Vice Versa?What it ends up as is a Rock Solid game that peforms well, but doesn't do much to satisfy the fan-boy lust on either side of the aisle.And one last thing, while the End Boss is REALLY intimidating (and cheap) his powers aren't all that impressive.  With the combined might of the dark-lords a few planets or dimensions or whatever, you'd think there powers would be substantially greater and that they would have some sort of split-personality psychological break-downs at certain points...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2010"}

When I game online, I want to make sure that other players can hear me, I can hear them, and I can mute without too much hassle. The EX-03 meets each of my requirements.FIRST IMPRESSIONS:I was irritated by the small font in the instruction book, but that's a minor gripe.Pairing was a little cumbersome, I had to scan my headset to register it as a Bluetooth device, whereas my Sony PS3 headset was recognized by connecting it with a USB cable.PROS:I was happy to see it only took 3 hours to get a full charge on the EX-03 headset, my old Sony PS3 headset took 6 hours to fully charge.There were 3 earbuds included, and I used the smallest one. The earbud focused the sound inside my ear and was very soft, which was a vast improvement over my Sony PS3 earpiece.When I played Little Big Planet 1 and 2 and Splinter Cell: Blacklist, all the other players could hear me without any problems, and I could hear them loud and clear.The ear hook and microphone extension were easy to adjust to my comfort level, and even after a 2 hour stretch of gaming, this headset didn't cut into my ear or feel heavy with prolonged use. The volume up and down buttons were easy to use.CONS:The Gioteck EX-03 headset is only fitted for the right ear, so the lefties are out of luck on this one. It even says in the instruction manual \"Unfortunately this is not possible.\" Truth be told, I rarely use my left ear for headset usage, but The Sony PS3 headset gave me the option to switch if I wanted to.Don't throw away the box thinking you can use your Sony cables to charge this headset - you have to use the charging cable that comes with it, nothing else works.When I put my headset on mute, there wasn't any visual indication on my PS3 screen (which does show up for the Sony PS3 headset) - instead, I would hear two descending tones about 4 seconds apart. If I wanted to turn my mic back on, I had to press the power button and I'd hear two ascending tones to indicate it was back on.MY VERDICT:On the whole, this is a very crisp and clear headset and does exactly what I want...allows me to hear and be heard without any discomfort. If that's what you want from a gaming headset (and you don't want to spend the extra $ for a Sony PS3 headset), then this one will get the job done.Recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2013"}

The second is that a couple of the minigames are actually really entertaining, and use the Miis to great effect. That first thing's really important, though, because Wii Play isn't the kind of game you'll play for hours on end. Some of the minigames are really clunky, and others are simply too shallow to be enjoyable for long.Still, there are two standouts for me. One game, where you try to \"Spot the Mii\" is a great use of the system, and the more Miis you have, the better it is. The second standout is the shooting game, which is immediately reminiscent of Duck Hunt. Who doesn't love Duck Hunt? (Okay, I'm sure some of the younger set out there don't even *know* Duck Hunt, but I'll skip over that lest I feel too old.)For a $50 game, Wii Play is a total and complete ripoff. A terrible value. For a $10 game that comes with a $40 controller? Worth every penny.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2007"}
