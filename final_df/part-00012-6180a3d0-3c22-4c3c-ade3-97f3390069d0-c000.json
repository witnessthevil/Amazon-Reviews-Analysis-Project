Sherman \"The Critic\"","summary":"King of the Road","reviewText":"I remember playing \"Mario Kart 64\" once with a neighbor's kids years ago.  Not a big fan of racing games then, I had a lot fun with this game (especially with the Battle Mode) and I've been itching for a chance to experience the fun again.  Now I can, any place, any time, thanks to \"Mario Kart DS.\"Still the undisputed king of handheld racing after its 2005 launch, \"MKDS\" seems to take the best of every game in the \"Mario Kart\" series and squeezes it all into that little game card, and sticking that nice label on it.  Starting in Grand Prix mode, you choose from 3 engine classes, 8 racers, 2 karts, and 4 cups with 4 courses each.  And then you're off!  There are more cups, karts and racers hidden in the game but with no cheat codes to speak of, you'll just have to do things the old fashioned way.  A map is provided on the touch screen in case you steer off course.While a great gaming experience, you can only have so fun just racing while unlocking stuff.  Fortunately, there's so much more to do in \"MKDS.\"  Aside from racing other players wirelessly or online, you can also enter an improved Battle mode with new arenas, including an old-school Nintendo DS.  And then there's yet another mode that has you take on different \"missions\" to unlock more missions.  To sum it all up, deciding whether or not this is a quality racing game for your DS, it's a no-brainer.This game is rated E for Everyone: Mild Violence.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2008"}

Previously I had a NES Classic edition but it got jacked by the workers who installed the wood flooring for my home a few years ago.This Pearl Blue color(which I got) along with Pearl Pink and Graphite were the last model Nintendo made in 2006. Unlike previous colors/models, these later models have a different backlit system. You can't turn the backlit off, instead there is a super bright mode in addition to the regular bright mode. I'm very impressed with this new backlit feature, thanks Nintendo. It was impossible to find a new Game Boy SP, so I had to settle for a used one from Gamestop, I went to many Gamestops to find one that was in the best possible condition without scratches on the clear LCD cover, although many were in good condition but I wanted a GOOD one. The AC Adapter charger is upgraded as well, it's significantly smaller than previous version.Overall if you want an awesome video game system or handheld get a Game Boy SP! It's portable so you can play at work, beach, book store, on the bed, in the bathroom, or wherever.

It is pretty fun and challenging and makes a great party game, the only reference to the fact you are exercising is the calories burned counter after each event which just adds extra benefit to the whole game.The only let down, and why the fun factor is 4 star and not 5) is lack of 10 pin bowling which you do get in the original but would have been good to allow you to import sports from the 1st game into the 2nd so you don't have to change disc. There are already two free addons you can download which give you extra challenges which adds to the life of the game and suits anyone from beginner to experienced with difficulty levels set just right so you can work up to the harder challenges without feeling it is impossible to achieve.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2012"}

parents.","reviewerName":"Jeff Carter","summary":"Ace Combat 4","reviewText":"This is a pretty easy and fun game.You are a pilot name Mobius and your fighting against the Erusions.There are several different difficulty levels on this game.This review is based on the normal mode.Ace Combat 4 involves intense air to air,air to sea and air to ground battles.Once you learn how to turn,read the map and drop your special weapons correctly you can get thru this easy.There is 5 tuturouls that show you how to do all of that.Air targets are easy to hit with missles just lock on and send 2 missles at them.It only takes 1 missle for ground targets.Ground targets are harder to hit thou because the planes you are flying in are fast compared to the ones in secret weapons over normandy.You will unfortuanly crash if you don't slow down and fly low to hit ground targets.The goal of this game is to get an S rating.An S rating gives you enough money to buy new planes and new and better special weapons.You get all kind of jets to fly in this game there is F15's,F18 hornets,F4's,F5e's,Migs and other jet fliers.Secondary weapons consist of bombs and some special type of missles.These missles are better than the missles that your plane comes with.There are all kind of bombs.I like the napolms because when they hit an object on the ground they explode several times.Their is one secondary weapon you get that allows you to hit several planes with missiles at the same time.The explosions in this game are ok but not as good as normandys.The graphics are good.The enviroments consist of mountains,snowcover,oceans etc.The ground targets your after consist of radars,hangers,aa guns,planes on the runway,oil rigs,towers,sam missle types,boats and others.The game offers you three choice views by pressing the down area you can toggle between 1st person view,cockpit view and 3rd person view.Cockpit view looks different on every plane in otherwords each plane looks as different inside as it does out.It is easy to locate the repair station on this game.Just go to the map and hit the sqare button till you see the white dotted lines fly or turn toward those lines.Your wheels will then lower however you can skip this part and hit start and you will be on the runway to take off.It is tricky to actually land the plane but it can be down but to save time you can just hit the start button and your already there.When you land you get your plane fixed and your weapons replinished you can also change your special weapons if you want to.You can either take off or you can hit start and your already in the air.I like to take off because you can kick in the afterburners and watch your plane head toward the sky.The jet noises on this game is real.They actually recorded the sound from actual jets when they made this game.I would also recommend you purchase the ace combat 4 strategy guide used for this game.It is very helpful and tells you how to get an s rating on every level as well as show you all planes,secondary weapons,levels and bonuses when you finish.If your lucky enough to finish every level you get a bonus called free flight or roam were you can fly on any level for 30 minutes without enemies just enjoy the flight you also get to play on all levels when you finish anyone you want.You will also want to pick up Ace Combat 5 in November it will have new planes,new missions and you will be able to get your wingmen to help defend you if you get in trouble.Here is some pros and cons on this game.Pros1)Excellent Graphics2)Modern Up To Date Jets3)You Can Switch Between Special Weapons And Missles By Hitting The Select Button.4)You Can Toggle Between 1st,Cockpit and 3rd Person View By  Hitting The Down Arrow Key.5)It's Fun To Watch Your Target Explode6)Only Takes 1 Missle To Destroy Ground Targets7)Most Of The Jets On This Game Are Incredibly Fast They Can Reach Speeds Of Over 1000 Mph If You Hold Down The R1 Trigger.Some Are Faster Than Others.8)You Don't Stall As Easy On This Game As You Do On Normandy.If You Do Just Accelerate By Hitting The R1 Trigger.The Service Stations Are Easy To Find By Going To The Map And Flying Toward The Station.9)You Have The Option To Do A Manuel Takeoff And Landing Or Skip It By Hitting Start And Doing It Automatically To Save Time10)It's Fun To Watch These Jets Take Off11)A Good Variety Of Planes And Special Weapons To Buy.12)When You Finish The Game You Get To Free Fly Without Any Enemies.13)You Get To Play All Levels When You Finish Game.Cons1)It's Difficult To Hit Targets With Your Machine Guns.I've Had To Use Missles Because I Can't Strike Planes With Bullets.2)Sometimes Even When Your Locked On To A Plane It Can Out Manuvier And Get Away.3)Planes Require 2 Hits By Missles To Bring Them Down.4)You Only Get A Limited Number Of Special Weapons And Missles.5)Crashing Is Easy Especially When Going After Ground Targets.6)Planes And Special Weapons Are Expensive And You Must Get An S Rating To Buy Them.7)You Can Only Save 4 Levels At A Time if you want to save more than that you will have to overwrite one but this is solved when you finish the game you get to play all levels.If you like air combat games get a Ps2 and buy this game.You will enjoy it.Also it is on sale now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2004"}

I got MW2 because of the hype, and it was well worth it. People are complaining that the solo campaign was too short, well if you aren't an expert at these types of games it can take longer. Took me about 8 hours. Still not \"long\" HOWEVER, the multiplayer and spec-ops make up for it.Multiplayer is a ton of fun. Again, it isn't something I am very good at but its so much fun. I'm actually starting to get decent at it but I'm still at a level 5. People must have more spare time than me to get ranked as high as they are! Every game you play is different so it really makes up for it. Lots of game modes, bonuses, perks, etc.{EDIT: I'm now a level 37 and loving every minute of it. I'm completely addicted and can't quit thinking about it or playing it. The thrill and fun of getting some clutch kills and unlocking new weapons and attachments is well worth the price of admission.}Spec-ops looks very promising. I've only played two of the missions solo, but it is meant to be played online or offline with a friend. 23 missions and you can play on three difficulties if you are a completionist. Looks pretty awesome and will extend the game even more.{EDIT: I have now played most of the first three sets of levels with a friend online and it is perhaps the most fun I've ever had playing video games with a friend. Grab a headset and get ready to roll! Working as a team, with one in a helicopter gunship and the other clearing out enemies on the ground, you can't beat this mode. So much fun and such a good time.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

I like the dark fantasy and the character design of the female elf is perfect.  Usually I would like to create my own character, but the female elf is better than I could create.  I also like the dialog between the elf and the bald warrior caddoc.I also like that you can shoot the bow like a gun.  You actually have a sight and with some bows can zoom.  You can also use cover like a shooter.  It is a pretty fast paced shooter type feel for a fantasy hack and slash.I like using the elf and playing as a shooter.Story is good, lots of cool cut scenes.I have finished the game with one ending for the ps3 and now am trying for the other ending on the xbox.  So far I like the gameplay better on the xbox.The game has lots of enemies and mini bosses and bosses and there are also puzzles that are optional.  I skipped these puzzles the 1st time mostly, but am trying them out now and they are pretty fun.Also the locations are huge.  I have played about 3hrs or so to get to the second stage.  There is lots of cool locations like dungeons, towns, forests etc.Check out some videos for this.  Hunted really has a unique look.  Very cool too me.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular.

In real life the Barrett .50cal would be better but the game throws so many enemies at you so fast that the Dragonov's quicker fire rate comes in handy.The enemy AI is very good, better than most.

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills.

Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale.

People either love or hate Zelda and will react accordingly each time a game is released.  For better or worse, LZ:ST plays like a new version of LZ:PH from two years ago.  Personally, I like this game better and I would imagine the majority of Zelda players will agree.This Zelda is continuing in the cartoon series.  I've found Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass to be attractive and LZ:ST is no different.  In fact, maybe too similar.  You wouldn't be able to tell the difference between LZ:PH and LZ:ST without knowing what you were looking at.The story is fairly typical Zelda fare, nothing even too groundbreaking in the series, its always just interesting enough to justify the series of dungeons.Link uses the Spirit Train instead of a boat this time around and it works plenty fine.  You can toot your horn and fire a cannon later in the game.  The side mission of hunting rabbits keeps the train sessions mostly interesting, but like the boat, it is probably not as fun as riding Epona in the console Zeldas.The game controls great for stylus only control.  If it irritated you in PH, it will irritate you now as there has been no real changes to the control scheme and no option for D-pad control.  One minor improvement is the use of double taps for rolling instead of drawing circles on the edge of the screen.LZ:ST is a short game though, in travel speak, it will probably last you one long car trip or two plane rides.  Like many Zelda games, there is plenty to do, collecting rabbits and stamps prime among the activities, but the dungeons all seem extremely short and easy.  The puzzle answers are rarely more difficult than finding a drawing or note somewhere in the dungeon and making a few drawings on the map.  I'll be the first to admit that the game mechanic IS fun, but it is awfully easy as well.  One new mechanic is fun, and that is controlling phantoms with Zelda.  Sadly, this is only done in the tower, which is a very limited part of the game.  Its too bad, this could have been even more entertaining to use.Bosses have also made no improvements.  Each boss is just like bosses you've seen from ALTTP and on.  You find a weapon in the doungeon and then you use it to defeat the boss.  This mechanic could use some freshening.  Maybe use multiple items on a boss?  Something.New items are entertaining, especially the snake whip and the pinwheel.In the end, Zelda is Zelda.  A few minor tweaks here and there make this an overall stronger game than Phantom Hourglass, but not exactly by leaps and bounds.  If you love Zelda, you'll love this game.  If you aren't a fan, nothing here will change your mind.Yes, Nintendo basically keeps putting out the same Zelda games for us over and over, but its hard to argue when they are all so good...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2009"}

Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A landmark in JRPG history revitalized and elevated to new heights","reviewText":"Oh how I miss the era of 90's games, where the JRPG was king. There were many gems during that time, but Final Fantasy IV will always have a special place in my heart. The definition of a JRPG classic, FFIV was a pioneer landmark that truly ushered in an age where video games could tell a complex story just as well as any movie or novel. While many Final Fantasies came after this one, most of which can be argued to be \"greater\"/better, FFIV's status as a classic cannot be denied, and I'm happy to say this remake of it is worthy of the original in every way.First off, the original FFIV is a beloved entry in the series for a number of reasons. In many ways, it was the first of its kind in terms of storytelling in games. It has a rich world filled with likable, memorable characters with motives that make each easy to relate to and root for. The story is filled with events both exciting and poignant, many of which are truly unforgettable. The whole experience is saturated with charm and a tangible sense of adventure. The gameplay follows the traditional JRPG formula to great effect, with a wonderful balance in its RPG elements. Nobuo Uematsu's soundtrack for this game is legendary, giving the already exciting story even more grandeur and gravitas. The game is definitely one of the best entries to grace the Final Fantasy series, and I hold it in high esteem in my heart alongside FFVI, VII, and IX. It's a lovely game. That been said, when you get a chance to play a remake with so much effort put into it, and from the same core team that worked on the original so many years ago no less, you take it, and you thank yourself and the gaming gods you did. This is, without a doubt, my personal favorite version of FFIV.Why is this my favorite version of Final Fantasy IV? After all, you can get the game in itsoriginal SNES form(including digital rerelease form for the VC and PSN), as well as ports for thePS1andGBA, and an even more recent, arguably more retro remake in the form ofFFIV: The Complete Collection for the PSPwhich contains both FFIV's sequel AND a brand new interquel. So again, you're probably wondering why this is my preferred version. Let me tell you...- The script. The script in the original SNES release, when it was known as FF II in the US, is imfamously known to be  terribly botched. The localization team back then had no idea what they were doing. For this DS remake, however, Square went all out and had Tom Slattery translate this new version's script (the stellarChrono Trigger DS translationwas his work as well). The result is a script that finally gives the timeless story of Cecil and his companion the grandeur, depth, and sophistication it has always deserved. This is, without a shadow of a doubt, thee vest best translation of Final Fantasy IV. It has a tremendous amount of depth and nuance to it, and this story has never been more enjoyable to take it. It also has a great deal of levity and humor to the mix as well, including the \"YOU SPOONY BARD!\" line lovingly preserved. It's a wonderful balance that makes the story so compelling and charming. Complimenting this script in certain places are excellent cutscenes with voice overs from voice actors renowned in the business for their skill and ability, and they hit it out of the park here. Almost every character benefits a lot by their voice actor and new script. Not only that, but some characters' stories have been expanded to include more depth and background, which is also very much welcomed. Knowing that the same core team as the original wrote these new parts makes the entire story in this game feel brand new again. This, in my opinion, is the most compelling reason to view this as the definitive version of FFIV.- The engaging changes to the gameplay. In order to make this game appeal to veterans of the original game, the development team worked hard to give this game a much increased level of difficulty, and they definitely succeeded. This version is hard as nails in terms of its combat. Enemies hit a lot harder. Bosses are so difficult, you really need to learn the right strategy just to stand a chance at beating them. While some may chafe at the difficulty of this game, I personally thought it made it more engaging. You are required to be quick with your fingers and your mind as you enter battles, employing proper strategies to stay on top. I really enjoyed this myself. There's also a new \"Augment\" system in place that allows you to teach certain skills and abilities (ones that used to be limited to certain characters) to anybody of your choosing. This new system allows for even more strategy and planning, as you can combine abilities in ways that lead to devastatingly powerful characters. For instance, teaching Cover and Yang's Kick augment to Cecil allows him to retaliate after defending an ally from attack with a super powerful blow to, not just the enemy who attacked, but every enemy. Talk about a powerful combination! This augment system made what was already a fun JRPG into an even more engaging experience.- The visual enhancements. This tends to be the most controversial aspect to the game that turns people away. No one will deny that the environments and enemies look fantastic. Battle screens look splendid, the overworld is charmingly colorful, the towns all have distinctive personalities, and the visuals shine even in close-up scenarios in the cutscenes. What people seem to have a problem with are the \"chibified\" models for the main characters, but I personally like them a lot. I don't understand why some think they're untrue to the originals. If you look up promotional art for the game from its release, they looked a lot like the characters do in this game, except now they're a lot more detailed. Heck, they look like the PSP version's do but in a 3-D world. I find they are given more emotional expression in this style. I don't get the hate. I think the visuals in this game are pretty gorgeous, and they really seem to push the DS beyond its capabilities. As far as I'm concerned the visuals are a win in this game.- The audio enhancements. Like I said earlier, Nobuo Uematsu's soundtrack for this game is splendid, filled with a sweeping grandeur that still sounds great. For this remake, they remade the wonderful compositions with much more lush orchestration that befits such a moving score. Anyone who hears this game's version of Interlude, The Red Wings, the Overworld Theme, all of the battle music, etc. are in for a genuine treat. Wonderful job here! Like I said earlier, the voice acting in this game is another audio aspect that could have been disastrous but turned out great here.Let me be clear, I am not bashing any other version of FFIV with this review. I love the PSP Complete Collection version of this game a lot myself, but with the aspects mentioned above, it is my personal opinion that this DS remake is, hands down, the best version of Final Fantasy IV available. The original was and still is a wonderful game to take in, with many timeless aspects, but with the DS remake, you get what was already a classic elevated to the level of a masterpiece. Square did great with this one. IF ONLY they would giveFinal Fantasy VIthe same kind of treatment for the 3DS! So buy it, prepare for an amazing tale of redemption, friendship, and adventure, rediscover a landmark in video game history.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2014"}

While I cannot say it is one of the best games on the console, I definitely feel like they are moving in the right direction.Before I go onward, I wanted to state that I am one of the many people who disliked the first game simply because of how lazy the game developers were. They created a game that resembled a minigame and should have been worth $20, not $60. And yes, I am angry that instead of adding more maps to the first game for $10, they decided to scam us with another $60 game, knowing that anyone who wanted more from the first game bad enough would get the next game. Putting all of that aside, I will try to rate this  game on it's merit alone, based on how it has improved over the first game and how it is as a game of its' own.Graphics: Graphically the improvements in the game are slight. There are more infected shapes and colors. However, there are some problems as well. I notice certain infected, when killed, disappear, this was not a problem in the first game. The area you move in seems slightly more detailed. The best you can really say about the graphics is slighly more polished than the original.Gameplay: Some may be happy to find that the feel of the game is the same. You can pick up one or the other and notice very little in the difference between the feel of the game or the feel of weapons that are similar between games. On the up side, you have access to melee weapons and a couple new weapons as well. Temporary upgradable ammo, chainsaws, grenade launchers, and katana's are a couple of the new weapons added to the game.The levels are now wider (I can't think of a better word for it), giving you more space and less restriction on where you can go. This makes it easier to get lost, but also gives you a lot more to explore. There are a lot more random weapons and items in the rooms now, so you are always finding something, so you will often have to choose which melee weapon you have, weather you want a health pack or a defib(revive downed survivor), pain pills or adrenaline(increased speed), and what melee weapon you want. This tends to make levels funner and less predictable. (the previous game always gave you the same weapons and most of the weapon pops were like clockwork.The game now consists of a couple different types of events. It is no longer an \"entrench yourself until the horde is all dead\"; and is now more of a \"wait  just long enough for the next door to open and floor it\" kind of game. Some events require you to floor it to the safe room, with infected continuing to pop up the entire way. Some require you to shut off the alarm by making it to the shut off switch with infected constantly appearing until the alarms are off. One finale requires you to fill a tank of a car with constant zombie attacks. Any way you look at it, you have a lot more variety in the events, although once you finish an event the first time, obviously it doesn't change. But it does help each campaign feel truly unique.Story: Possibly the #1 reason that this game made a higher score is the story. While it does not follow any intense story complete with backgrounds of characters, it is actually a story, as opposed to the last game. You follow these 4 characters from campaign to campaign. The campaigns actually move in chronological order, as you travel through there journey trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. It starts when all 4 of the characters meet on the rooftop of the mall, hoping for a rescue from the helicopters they were promised. When this does not occur, they continue to travel. They meet and greet in the first campaign, and each campaign after explains how their previous escape attempt eventually goes bad. You can follow the story from campaign to campaign, which I find to be the best part. The only thing I don't like is I haven't heard them come up with an idea of how to escape until the finale. They travel from safe room to safe room for no reason, and then in the finale, one of them just says, oh, let's do this! The previous game usually had them state an objective, like, \"Maybe we can catch a boat at the docks\", this one doesn't seem to give that direction.Overall: So to sum it up, I think the game is an improvement over the first one. If it was worth $60 for you, you would buy it or would already be making plans to buy it. If you never have played it, want to know what the fuss is about, and don't rent games ever, then buy the first one, you won't be seeing too much difference here. If you own the first one, and are looking at getting the second, I would say that it depends on whether new maps, new objectives, and new weapons is worth the money. If I had to buy it again, I probably would, to appease my wife if nothing else. However, I felt it was an improvement, although a small one. The game designers were less lazy when making this one, but only just.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2009"}

This is such a case.  But I finally finished it.  Though I enjoyed \"Vice City\" tremendously, I won't be playing the next installment of \"Grand Theft Auto.\"  Here's why.Have you ever noticed that, in the words of Margo Timmins, \"living's mostly wasting time\"?  Well, I have.  A very small percentage of your time actually goes to doing THE THING.  Most of the time you're simply getting ready to do THE THING.  You're standing in line for THE THING, registering for THE THING, arranging payments for THE THING, stuck in traffic trying to get to the THE THING, struggling to get THE THING working on your computer, etc.Well, video games have reached such a level of graphic realism that when you're, say, driving a car down the street in \"Grand Theft Auto:  San Andreas,\" it really looks like you're driving a car down the street!  It even feels and sounds like a car!  Same with the bicycle, the truck, the motorcycle, etc.The problem with this game is that DRIVING A CAR THROUGH TRAFFIC IS BORING!  So is walking down the street!I don't know how much time I spent in this game simply covering distance.  At first I didn't mind it, but after hours and hours spent this way (the video game is far and away the longest I've ever played -- really epic), you find yourself putting your iPod on to stave off the boredom.  The boredom of a video game!Yes, folks.  This game thinks nothing of having you fail a mission, then leaving you in the middle of the desert with no way of getting back to town.  The programmers must have thought it was funny, but I don't.This could have been fixed easily with a \"restart mission\" function, but I believe the programmers deliberately neglected to include something like that because they thought players would find it amusing walking hours through the desert.  I certainly didn't.  I mean, video games are THE THING that you spent hours in traffic so that you can play.  When they themselves are tedious and repetitive, there's something basically wrong with the cosmos.Now, due to the variegated entertainment herein, I was on the point of forgiving the gamemakers and pronouncing the game tolerable after all.  That was until I got to the maddeningly pointless mission, \"Flight School.\"  (You can read more details about that particular one elsewhere.)  But that held up the game's progress for DAYS, so difficult was it.  By the time I finished, I forgot what my character was doing and had lost any emotional connection to the game.  It's not that \"Flight School\" was particularly difficult (though it was), it was that it was, like the rest of the game, a recreation of everyday life that was a little too convincing.Here's my guess for what happens in the next outing:  your character has to brush his teeth, launder his underwear, and get his cholesterol checked.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2009"}

Not great but good.Pros:The Look - The PS4 looks great.  Some people don't like the lights on it but I do.  I think it's makes the console stand out from previous consoles.Hardware - I haven't run into any lag, frame rate issues, slow load times, or slow download times.  So far it seems like they really used top notch hardware.Controller - The controller is good. I wish the trigger buttons were larger and I wish the options and share buttons were a little larger but other than that it's a great improvement over the old Dualshocks.Software - Right now it's average but still a plus.  I liked the layout of the PS3 better.  I don't doubt for a minute that the overlays and menus are going to change overtime.  It also seems like Sony is taking a \"wait and see\" approach.  The software seems a little shallow right now but you can tell it could easily be expanded.  One big plus right now is the enhancement of the trophies.  Now trophies tell you what percentage of players have obtained them and, if it's a PS4 game, you can see how rare the trophy is.Cons:Missing Options - There are some things that really need to be adjusted. For instance if you plug in the PS4 camera you cannot turn it off without unplugging it.  There are a couple of other things like this that can get annoying.Sharing - This needs work.  I find myself sharing stuff because of accidental button presses.  Also you need to be careful and narrow down what you share or you'll virtually spam your friends with junk. I want to see more options too.  I haven't been able to figure out how to upload to YouTube from the PS4.  I also want some good editing options.  If I'm going to share I want to share something I'd want to watch, not a simple screen shot or video capture.PS Plus - This is on here because it's driving me nuts.  I am a PS Plus member.  The store doesn't seem to know that.  When I go into the PS Plus section it tries to get me to buy a membership.  I end up looking at what is included into Plus, going to the other sections of store, hunting down the item, and then it seems to figure out that I'm a Plus member. Granted this should be fixed soon but it's odd that it's busted in the first place.My guess is within a year or two the PS4 is going to be a 5 star product.  Right now it has a lot of potential.

But you didn't buy this game for the graphics. You bought this game for the insane weapons and the outrageous missions. From the very beginning (the bank heist intro is as over the top as any Saints Row intro) the game flaunts its GTA-on-steroids attitude, and the ride is very fast and very turbulent indeed.For those of you who don't like mindless violence and choices governed by moral turpitude as much as by strategy, you are sure to dislike this game. It's not a game I would recommend for impressionable kids, or even impressionable young adults.

Made the game for me! I loved her! The game its self so so...","reviewText":"Well, 20 hours into the game I loved it. 80 hours into the game I hated it, and 120 hours later after beating it I was somewhat pleased with it.To start things off I just wanted to say that the only other FF game I have played and beaten as well was Final Fantasy 8 that my Mother brought for me as a Christmas gift back when it first came out.I was never really into Final Fantasy games, but for some reason I felt like giving it a try. 10 years later I beat FF8 and moved on to play this game FF12 the latest (at the time I write this because 13 is on the way) installment to the series. This review will be not biased as clearly I'm not some diehard fan of the series I can honestly take it or leave it.That being said, here is my review of Final Fantasy 12. I picked this game up not knowing what to expect at all. Mostly I play games like Tales Of the Symphonia, and The Persona games Altus makes. When it comes to FF I'm somewhat new to it still. The major thing that is impressive about this game is that it is graphically amazing. For PS2 this is honestly something that the design team had put much effort into. Never did I feel as if the game was biting off more than it could chew. Mostly the artwork, and designs fit right in with the capabilites of the PS2.The gameplay I enjoyed. It was a mix between realtime, and turnbased fighting. A nice change from the \"zone fighting\" than occurs in other Turnbased RPG's. It was nice being able to run up to a monster and just fight it without all the screen changing. I thought the fighting system was a big improvement, however the system they used \"license baord\" to customize your character could have been left out entirely. The board does little to make your character unique other than locating the \"quickenings, and Espers\" aside from that all characters have the ability to use the same skills. By the end all your characters will have the same access to skills, so it truly serves no \"customizing\" purpose.Also, chosing weapons is somewhat MMORPGish. You level up, go to a town(or dungeon in cases), get better gear. As your level increases so will your need for more powerful armor and accessories. However, it is very well possible to succeed this game without maxing out your armor, weapons, or spells. So armor/weapon grinding isn't but so so necessary.The story everyone's favorite part of a game (or so to speak) is really fragmented in FF12. There are so many side quest in between the main objectives of the game that they dwarf the main story. Of my 120+ hours played atleast 80 hours were spent on side quest and leveling. Once your powerful enough the game is really not much of a challenge (took me levels 45-53 to beat most espers and finish the game). The base of the story is focused on Princess Ashe and reclaiming the fallen Kingdom of Rabinastre(spelling?)from the forces of an overbearing empire. Ironically you play more as a tag along character \"Vaan\" than as the true main character \"Ashe\".You're actually playing out her story, but through \"Vaan's\" point of view. Along with some helpful company along the way. Fran (who is amazing) a calm and collective Viera who aids Balthier a sky pirate who is a gentleman, Basch the fallen Knight who reclaims his honor,and Penelo the tag along and long time friend of Vaan. There isn't too much interaction of \"character development\" between the group. Mostly what you gather form FMV's or cut scenes, and how you will have to determine what they're relationships are to eachother.FF12 is very weak in this department as a lot of the backgrounds for the characters is left out, and leaves you with many quesions. Even after finishing the game I'm still puzzled about the characters. For starters Fran and Balthiers relationship is never really explained. Why did Fran a Viera (a race that looks down on humans)choose to partner with a male SkyPirate? How did they meet? Just what is thier attraction? Is it love,friendship,or something else? Who is Panelo? What is her story? What are her goals? What is motivating her to continue on the journey with Vaan? As for Basch I always wanted to know why is he so sworn to protect the royalty of Dalmasca. What event in his life made him so focused on protecting others? It's just these signifigant details that could make this game so much better developed.Another issue of Final Fantasy 12 is that it plays more like an MMORPG over a console RPG. I've said it before, but there is very little story to this game when compaired to the amount of sidequest thrown into it. The major focus if the game is not helping Ashe reclaim her throne, but hunting monsters and capturing espers. There are many many many monsters to hunt, and secret bosses to fight. Initially these battles are much harder than the storyline boss battles. I never broke as much of a sweat defeating the final bosses as I did fighting some of the more difficult espers. The story for me just leaves so much to be desired. They have created some wonderful and interesting characters, but so very little is explained about them.My final thoughts on Final Fantasy 12 is that it's a good game to play. Plenty of action and fighting which can either be fun or frustrating depending on which way the wind blows, but if you fall in love with a character (like I did Fran) it makes more your worth while to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2009"}

The artwork in the game is also top notch.  The Xbox 360 seems to have trouble keeping up and there is a lot of texture tearing.  The sound is fantastic, too, but I've noticed lots of voice-to-character syncing issues.  Minor issue, really, but still kind of irritating at times.Rage will not stun you with game play.  Rage, like most of Id's first-of-an-engine games, is really just a full length demonstration of the engine.  The game play is very old school, with only minor tweaks.  If you look back at, say, Return to Castle Wolfenstien, you'll see it is identical -- except instead of just going from level to level, you have a city hub with some _extremely_ light questing, equipment management, and the vehicle racing diversion.The combat levels are very linear and while the engine looks great and the levels are designed to hide that linearity, players of modern shooters will feel a bit \"on rails\".  Not necessarily a bad thing, but just a change of pace for modern games.  The side-quests/missions and even some of the main missions re-purpose many of the existing levels.  Sometimes you'll be taking a different path, sometimes you'll be running it backwards...  they definitely got a lot of bang for their design-buck.All in all, Rage is an enjoyable play.  I played through on Normal and it took about 14 hours without too much trouble.  I wandered around a bit, I did some of the side quests, I did most of the vehicle races...  so, over all, not too shabby by modern standards.The game feels like a combination of Borderlands and Half-Life 2 -- the feel/art/flow of Borderlands (without the loot/co-op aspects) and the campaign/level progression of Half-Life 2.My only real gripe is that the ending of the game is abrupt, a total let down, and a super-duper cliffhanger that leaves it very open for a sequel.What will really be exciting is to see what other people do with the engine.  I'm hoping someone comes along and makes a game that has more modern concepts with this engine.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2011"}

The game is flat out amazing, period. The main storyline is a fair length, but add in the side jobs, racing, mutant bash tv, mini gambling games and the various other things you can do and the game length increases dramatically, and everything you do serves a purpose whether to gain money to buy items, racing certificates to buy vehicle upgrades or just furthering the main story. The fights are manic. I particularly love driving around the wasteland battling bandit vehicles (which gains you money and racing certs if you talk to the right person first...which reminds me to tell you...talk to everyone immediately because you never know what bonuses you might get for doing what you already will be doing). There are some small things that are gauranteed to maek some angry, such as the fact that (don't worry...no spoilers!) there are a few missables that become unavailable later in the game and in at least one case this means missing an achievement if you don't get them. That means a second playthrough may become necesary, but with the game being so good it's ok. Besides, this kind of thing adds challenge. If you could always get everything in a game the tension would be nill. My first playthrough was on Normal, so anything I missed I will pick up on my Nightmare playthrough.

My pixel is only noticeable when the screen goes completely black.The screen resolution, color and sharpness are impressive.  I can't wait for more movies to be converted in UMD format, it's a pleasure to watch, although your hands get tired of holding the PSP at a viewable angle after a while.I haven't purchased additional memory yet.  With the included 32MB stick I have stored 3 pictures (1mb avg), 3 MP3 songs (5mb avg)  and some miscellaneous game saves.  I have only 8mb left.  I own two games, and their save files take up an avg of 300k each.To save existing MP3's and pictures (JPG format) from your PC you can create Music and Photo folders on the memory stick and transfer them using Explorer (if using Windows).  These will show up on the PSP ready to be viewed or listened.  Sony has plans to develop other media transfer software in the near future.To access the memory stick you need to have either a USB cable (with a standard Mini-B type connector in one end) or a Memory Stick USB reader, which are not included.  Luckily I had one compatible USB cable from my 2-year-old camcorder.I prefer the cable since it doesn't require you to remove the stick from the PSP.  Some digital cameras  such as Minolta also have compatible USB Mini-B cables, so you may have one already without knowing it. They are inexpensive, readily available and should be one of the first things to invest on.The actual storage capacity on the mem sticks is always lower than what's advertised.  PSP accepts Memory Stick Duo, or Duo Pro.  Memory Stick \"Duo\" is smaller in size than the original Memory Stick.  \"Duo Pro\" is a higher capacity/speed card.  As of this writing (Apr 2005) you can find 1Gb Duo Pro's for around two-hundred dollars.  2Gb sticks are a bit expensive at four hundred dollars.  These prices will eventually drop as higher capacity sticks show up.  Sony recommends purchasing Memory sticks Duo Pro with MagicGate support.  MagicGate is a media copy protection technology.The Sony PSP also has wireless capabilities, ad-hoc or through a wireless router such as Linksys.  Ad-hoc is a direct connection to another PSP.  It is possible to connect to the Internet (actually it is more like a VPN) and potentially download updates, games, music, movies and any type of media onto your PSP.  This planned feature opens up a huge and varied set of easily accessible content and makes the potential of the PSP to be  unlimited.  Secure connections are possible using encryption, and you only need to register the passkey once on the PSP.  I connected to the Internet (or VPN), got a response and searched for an update although I did not require any at the time.Battery life could be better.  It lasts around 3 hours of continuous use , enough for one movie and a gaming session afterwards. Sony claims it has 3-6 hours for single player gaming with no wireless, and 3-5 hrs. for video playback, all of these adjusted for usage conditions and environmental factors.  I consider the 2hr recharging time acceptable.The PSP has the potential of raising the bar on handheld devices.

My PSP included the Spiderman 2 UMD and sampler UMD disc.  On to the system it took about 2 hours (roughly) after charging it I was blown away with graphics that are near or on par with the PS2 system.  Setting up the system was no ptoblem I didn't bother reading the manual only the quick reference guide but that was enough onfo for me anyway.  It can do a few things that the DS can't play movies (UMD format) play MP3s and store photos.  I wasn't completely blown away with the music playback on the psp but I have an Ipod for music.  The standard 32MB memory card (which was really meant for game saves) just won't do I suggest either a 512MB or 1G card.  I have been hearing a lot of moaning from people who are complaining about dead pixels um what LCD screen doesn't suffer from this?  Read the manual page 13 states that the dots are not a defect I may have one myself but it doesn't bother me unless I physically check the screen and go looking for it.  Hopefully it will fix itself (I won't bother returning the PSP I might end up with a unit thats worse and has more dead pixels than the one I think that I have already got or some other issue(s) entirely.)  I don't have issues with stuck or broken buttons or any of that other nonsense.  If you are that unhappy return it for a refund and buy a DS.  I on the other hand LOVE my PSP and can't wait to see what else gets released on this sexy beast in the coming months.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"zeb alford","summary":"Average first person shooter.","reviewText":"Let me explain my title. I'm am a huge fps fan. I own Red faction 2, XIII, Tribes, Unreal tournament and alot more. Those are all great games and anyone should try them out. But back to Halo. Let's start with the story. Pretty basic, you fight aliens with your team of humans (which by the way you can't command in any way). The aliens are attacking you and you attack the aliens (the aliens are some of the best I've seen since Half Life, the grunts are so funny and the elites are so cool).Now to the gameplay. Its the normal first person shooter stuff. You run and gun, nothing much more than any other game.I have to say the voicing is good. There are really no corny lines. It is some of the best I've ever seen too.Now to Master Chief's abilities. He's a super cyborg guy, that can only hold 2 guns at a time. He can't jump very high, and can't land large falls without hurting himself. But he can take alot of hits and keep on killing.Now how about I go onto the so called best aspect of the game, the multiplayer. The multiplayer is very defined. It is some of the best I have seen in a while. The levels are rich in design and character. The only real complaints I have on it are that there are no bots, only 2 vehicle levels, and not many levels. By the way Hand em' High is the best. Finally to the thing that makes up every good fps, the weapons. I have to admit, this is one aspect I hope they fix in Halo 2. Yeah we've seen it all before, pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, rocket launcher, I'm tired of the ordinary. Bungie, give us something new. Or at least add 5 types of assault rifles and like 3 kinds of rocket launchers ect. But all in all Halo is a great shoot em' up and it has a fun mulitplayer and an average single player. Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention the co-op mode. It is fun and I like it, but why only two player? Hello, Microsoft, the Xbox has 4 control ports, how about we use them all? But, if you have an Xbox you should by all means pick this title up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2003"}

Newberry \"agent_47\"","summary":"IF YOUR SAD ITS TOO SHORT,YOU PLAYED IT ON NORMAL SETTING.","reviewText":"Well Halo is a great game.But It's too short not too short in a bad way only because I wanted more and YES I played it on HEROIC level.  The graphics are pretty good.I like the distant look of the planets and the whole feel of the game. The movie cutscenes are a little on the choppy side but still look nice and the sound and voice acting are solid.Some of the levels are inside ,not like like the first halo where mostly your outside. I love the sniper level with the water falls,it's pretty hard sometimes you get killed with one shot. The only way to play this game is on the HEROIC ,or LEGENDARY level. That really helped it last longer. The first encounter with the FLOOD enemies was intense ,seriously 10 times harder than on normal setting.The enemies do seem to get smarter on the harder levels.They seemed to hide better behind boxes and walls etc. The graphics arent \"splinter cell\" quality,but still some good eye candy. I would like to see this game made into an epic movie.The sound is pretty good .If your not gonna go online or use the multiplayer from this game,you might wanna rent it,don't even buy it,unless your a collector or dont mind the price.Just rent it and beat it before your rental date is due ,believe me ,it's possible. I played it on Heroic level and it was a fun challenge very tough enemies sometimes I would lay like 300 SMG  bullets and they were still standing there looking at me like what ? thats all you got? Then I'D empty all my doulbe fisted needler bullets into them ,that took care of em.I suggest you ONLY and I mean ONLY play this game on HEROIC or LEGENDARY if you think this game is easy and short.Try LEGENDARY mode ,then tell me its easy. Multiplayer levels,and online looks like what this game is a good buy for.But if your gonna just play single player campaign ,just rent it and beat it in a week,although Im still not done playing it on LEGENDARY mode and I got it the day it came out,it's now 11-20-04. All in all HALO2 is a great FPS game,that was just impossible to live up to all the hype.Much like FABLE was. But still a SOLID  game ,but for the price of HALO2 why can't they make it last a little longer ? Like MORROWIND or KOTOR? For single player I'd rate it an 9 out of 10.Only because its nobody's perfect.And the special edition version THEY PUT BOTH DISKS ON TOP OF EACH OTHER? WHY? why couldn't they make an extra space like some dvd movies with two disks? You know one on the left ,one on the right? instead they stacked the bonus disk right underneath the game disk ,with no seperate holder.I had to be careful not to scratch my game disk. UGH...In conclusion HALO2 is a fun game. with nice graphics and very tough enemies,on the HEROIC and especially on the LEGENDARY setting.The enemies would actually change there strategies based on my actions on these difficulty settings.HALO2 IS THE BEST CONSOLE FPS AS OF NOV 20TH 2004. AT LEAST UNTIL DOOM3 COMES OUT.I totally agree with (A.SINGH) comments about this game. If you play it on NORMAL setting ,this game is easy and short. Try it on HEROIC or even harder LEGENDARY mode. This game lasts 10 times longer and you have more time to take in all the scenery .Not to mention tons and tons of more tough as nails enemies. I unloaded two complete SMG double fisted clips into this enemy and he was stilll standing. Can you handle it? This is a MATURE rated game for people over 17.EBAY ??why are kids rating this game? there saying its too short ,it's too easy,yeah if you play it on easy  or normal setting.I think they shouldv'e made normal mode HEROIC mode and call it normal mode.Then there wouldnt be so many complants about it being too short.(NORMAL) setting and (HEROIC) setting are two different games PERIOD.aND LEGENDARY mode is frickin severly intense.I do agree the ending was a bit shabby,Where's the hero MASTER CHEIF?but you have too watch entire credits to see the little xtra ending. I wish also if you beat the game on HEROIC you get like bonus ammo or unlimited cammo,something man.Now Im on legendary mode and I'm constantly in need of ammo,in some areas.whereas the enemies  have an unlimited supply. Im up agaist like 100 enemies at once.give me some more ammo.Also in the civil war type part of the game I felt more like a spectactor than the main character.If I wanted to watch a DVD I'd rent one.HALO2 STILL ROCKS WITH ALL IT'S very small flaws.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2004"}

Two brothers, Ray and Thomas  McCall, are soldiers fighting for the South in the Civil War.  Pretty soon after they kick some Union butt, they desert to protect their family's house in Georgia from Union looters.  One thing leads to another and they set off in search of treasure somewhere in mexico to rebuild their family home.  They run into a whole bunch of guys on the way and pretty much kill most of them.  The story does kind of have a twist in the ending, which makes it more memorable than if it didn't.ok that's enough about the story, the rest you can find out for yourself.  Now, about the game play.  You can usually choose either brother to play for the mission.  Ray can wield two sixguns at once and use dynamite, but isn't that great at rifles.  He is slow but powerful.  Thomas is better at using rifles and can use a lasso to get to high places, but he can't dual wield guns or use dynamite.  He is quick but weaker than Ray.  Personally, I like Ray better because he can pack twice as more of a punch when he carries two pistols.  Most of the game is close quarter combat, and having two guns out at once helps a lot.  There are two instances where it is an open world place where you can do whatever you want, like purchasing upgrades or completing side missions for $$.  Otherwise, it is more of a closed world, where you have freedom to move around inside a town or village, but can't leave it.One thing I really like about this game is the showdowns you have.  After you kill all of the bad guy's henchmen, you usually have a showdown with him.  You face each other and wait for a bell to ring.  When that happens, whoever gets his gun first doesn't get killed.  You can kill the guy in one shot and be killed in one shot.  The weapons are all superb and sound great too.  Pistols, shotguns, rifles, sniper rifles, knives, bows, dynamite, and even chairs can be used to kill.  Hey, when that's all you got, go with it.  There is also mulitplayer where you can team up and complete objectives.  Same great features apply in multiplayer as in single.  This is deffinately a game you should play if not own.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000088KH9","description":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis the third in the successful mission-based stealth series that first appeared on the PlayStation in 1998; few changes have been made to the basic format. Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements. The game feels more like an update of the first Tenchu, and while this is no bad thing, fans will probably be expecting more.--Chris Ryan, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Robb Boutros","summary":"3 and 1/2 stars. New Console, same gameplay","reviewText":"Tenchu was one of those games that really WOW'ED! alot of people on the Playstation one. It's protagonist, a 16th Century Azuma ninja Rikimaru, is probably one of the more memorable and emulated characters in the more recent video game landscape. Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven brings Rikimaru and his female counterpart Ayame to the Playstation 2 with a considerable upgrade in graphics, but with pretty much the same basic design and gameplay.The strength of the Tenchu game series is and has always been STEALTH. With few projectile weapons and no firearms, this forces the players to get \"up close and personal\" when taking down an opponent. You do have a variety of ninja items; shuriken, poison rice cakes, even a long bow. But your best weapon is still your katana sword. So you really have little choice but to be stealthy. The game environment does offer plenty of places to hide thanks the enhanced graphical power of the Playstation 2. One thing that is different is that developer K2 has implemented an ability upgrade system. After nine stealth kills (which are kept score in the form of Kanji characters on the bottom left hand corner of the screen) you are awarded a new ninja ability. There are quite a few abilities that can be awarded. However the cinematic that plays once the stealth kills are completed is kind of goofey. I would have liked it better if Rikimaru or Ayame picked up a scroll and read the ability aloud. This would have given the game a feel more with keeping to it's 16th century setting. But this is only a minor issue. There is also an unlockable third character named Tessu that is available once you've completed the game and a multiplayer mode. Missions for both character follow different paths and have different objectives. So you are not replaying the same missions twice with both ninjas. There are also three different enemy layouts to each level and player rankings, to increase the replay value.The controls are basically the same as the previous Tenchu games though side stepping is a bit more difficult. One thing that bothers me about Wrath of Heaven is that Rikimaru and Ayame both move very unaturally. Their motions while running, crouching, and \"sneaking\" look too computerised. Often when going to a crouch they will appear \"jerky\". Also while running Rikimaru and Ayame appear to \"skate\" across the gamescape. This is kind of disappointing seeing how the first game on the Playstation 1 made Rikimaru and Ayame move with greater flow and ease. The learning curve for this game is about 30=-45 minutes (the amount of time to get used to the controls).Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven is a game that favors fans of the series but shouldn't let down newcomers either. It gives you just enough to keep wanting to play and is challenging enough without becoming frustrating. Mind you that this game is rated \"M\" for a reason. Ninjas are not particually nice people. If you're a stealth action fan then this game will fit nicely in your game library. For the new reduced price, Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven is a very good value worth checking out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2004"}

It features cinematic cutscenes, movie parodies, facial expressions, dozens of unhinged characters, and 1- to 4-player deathmatch games in a variety of styles.","reviewerName":"TigerPomme \"tigerpomme\"","summary":"This should have been titled &quot;Gamers Bad Game Day&quot;","reviewText":"I'm not sure why I purchased this game really. I guess I got suckered in by all the media hype surrounding the M rating and the so-called constant swearing. I don't know if it's my age, but when a game promises bad language why are some of the words still bleeped out (I know why but that isn't the point here)? It should have been an all or nothing deal.So pushing aside the unusual choices in their words is the game really that good? Well, sort of. The controls are bordering on deplorable. Conker's jumping ability as well as the action buttons are instantaneous. Yet Conker's attack has a very distinct lag. Why? Because the programmers, for some bizarre reason, chose to have Conker go through an extensive animation sequence of drawing out his frying pan and then using it to whack whatever. And why can't I run and wa . . . hit at the same time? The lag and quirky controls during some sequences could be forgiven if it wasn't for that idiot camera.Obviously the programmers have never heard of Jelly-cams or even a Ghost-cam. The camera is a crucial aspect to any good game. It doesn't matter how good the game play, control, story line of the game is. If the camera isn't up to par, the game isn't up to par. There are numerous instances where the player is unable to see what is around Conker because the camera is forced to obey the laws of the 3D world. Never, in any game, should the camera be the direct cause of the death of any character. The angle of the camera makes it very difficult to gauge the distance between Conker and numerous climbing ropes, enemies, dangerous blades, platforms, and several unmentionables. The camera controls do little to alleviate the camera problems since the camera can't pass through insignificant walls, platforms and sometimes enemies. There were numerous times I couldn't see the next place Conker was supposed to go to because I couldn't rotate the camera due to some idiot platform in the way. It saddens me that numerous gamers today have forgotten how a camera is supposed to behave.So pushing aside the crummy camera work, quirky controls, and bad language, is there anything good at all about this game? Well, yes there is. This game suffers from what many modern day games suffer from, A whole boatload of eye candy. Aside from some unusual areas that could potentially cause blindness, the in game graphics and animation are very slick given the limitations. Hasn't anyone noticed? The box nor the instructions specify that the game requires the N64 memory expansion card that a previous Rareware game required. Since the game doesn't require one, I sometimes wonder how much more the game could have been if it took full potential of the N64. It's fairly safe to say that I have never met a person that owns the N64 and doesn't have the &quot;optional&quot; mem' card installed. And along with the quirky controls and slick graphics comes a story that's neither.The story really doesn't make a whole lot of sense but then again neither does the fact that a drunk red squirrel is dating a a tailless gray squirrel (which looks like her design was heavily influenced by Lola) and the baddest guy around looks a bit like a beefed up Bagheera followed around by Hyena henchmen. Strange really. I'm not going to give away the story but the reasoning for the Panther King's obsession with Conker is certainly strange.Given all of that the game has numerous hurdles, most experienced gamers (like myself) will breeze through this since we've played worse games than this. However, beginner gamers will quickly become frustrated with the quirky control and terrible camera work. I suggest you pick up either of the Banjo games or something similar. However, if you want something that's a good title to show off and a title that could potentially pave the way for adult players, pick this one up. I guarantee this title will be forgotten by the masses but will become a cult favorite by the few dedicated players in a few years.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2001"}

{"product_name":"B0050SX7BQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Superb story and awesome gameplay, but falls apart","reviewText":"Beyond Two Souls is the latest work of Quantic Dream, who make the curious decision to place story, environments, and characters beyond gameplay upgrades. You play a duo of a little girl and her pet poltergeist soul-bound hanger on as you work through her life of being experimented on and the happy trails that follow. Or maybe you're trained by the CIA for \"perfectly normal\" work.Gameplay is awesome with Aiden, the poltergeist. You don't have much beyond scouting and knocking things over, but you'll be surprised how absorbing that can be, and how difficult it is to keep in mind when you're fleeing police or are wracking your brain about a piece of info you need. What makes it awesome is there is real choice. You can even be a brat in the tutorial level and the game will just move on rather than go \"you must prove that you're paying attention.\" Combat is a bit frustrating even though its simple. You tap in a particular direction or manipulate the controller itself. Whats annoying is you are supposed to gage which motion is being made while its happening. Is that straight kick to the groin a right motion, or technically up? And when you make a wrong choice, it doesn't give much in the way of notice what should have been correct. Balancing this is at least you have to slipup several times to really be punished.Voices and environments are wonderful if a tad narrow in scope. Some stages flee like a set of canal locks, but while you're drifting along the current stretch, its awesome to stop and smell the roses. Characters have full side conversations and don't stop to bask in you PC glow when you get close enough to hear what they're talking about.Nits are few and far between with one exception. While the super simple interface is nice, its so simple that its sometime a trial to find the white dot that you actually can interact with on that white door. You have to be standing in the right spot and push in the right direction, though this doesn't happen nearly as often during crucial moments, just during exploration. Other than that limited and still workable flaw, this is a highly polished, basically flawless diamond.Update: I tend not to play the entire story start to finish before writing a review, but the ending for this was so hollow it lost two stars just for it. Its not as bad as ME3, but the final run up is remeniscent of Quantic Dreams massive story failure with Indigo Prophecy. The end doesn't tie in with the rest of the story well, the premise is really destroyed by trying to explain it, which just opens up massive amounts of plot holes. The main villian shows up in a total of 3 scenes, and you don't even realize he was supposed to be the villian until moments before he dies, and on and on. Its obvious that they intended to include 10-20 hours more story, because there's just so, so much that's not explained, but its slapped in your face to the point that it still demands an explanation. Trying not to provide spoilers, but when you finally learn how Jodie got her powers you're just like \"What?.... That happens all the time!\" QD had a massive hit with Heavy Rain, but nearly snatched defeat from the jaws of certain victory with this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2013"}
{"product_name":"B001H4NMNA","reviewerName":"S. Melvin","summary":"Great charger, but weird connection design","reviewText":"I purchased this charger after realizing that charging PS3 remotes via the included USB cable is annoying and not very reliable.  This Energizer item plugs directly into your wall outlet, so there is no concern with the power being on or if the USB ports are self-powered or machine powered.  As soon as you plug in the remotes, a red light appears, letting you know that the remotes are being charged.  Once the remotes are complete - the light turns to green.  That easy!  There is also a USB port on this, so you can plug in a USB cable to charge another device (I personally use it to charge my Bluetooth Headset, also for the PS3).  The package is well constructed and small enough to fit behind my HDTV.  I've had this for quite some time and the connections are still tight and hold the remotes in place during the charging process without issue.  The remotes fit perfectly on top of one another and don't require you to be an origami expert in order to figure out how to make them stack.If I had a complaint, it would be that the connection port (front load) is a bit unwieldy.  In order to plug the remote in, you have to hold it in the center and firmly press it onto the USB port - and with big fingers like mine, I often hit the PS button, which turns on the PS3.  Not a fun process, but not a deal breaker either.  I certainly do not have a better idea on how to make the connection to charge these remotes, so I can't complain much - but that is just about the only thing I could point out negatively about this device.Overall, it does what it is intended to do - charge your PS3 remotes.  Combine that with the included USB ports and you can even charge your other PS3 devices or anything really that has a USB adapter cable (cell phones, iPads, etc).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2013"}

If your looking for a portable gaming system this is it right here. If you want a much bigger libary & a more selection of games this is what you should buy, avoid the PSP Go unless you already know there are games on that system you would like. The PSP go isn't really a PSP. Sure it has the same functions as this but you lose the ability to play UMD games that are still easily available. Even if Sony manages to put every single PSP game, this is still cheaper. I only say this because not everyone is ready for the digital world & since the PSP GO is entirely digital it lacks a certain ability that many game consoles have. It only takes less then a $1 to make a physical copy of the game & while downloadable games are nice to have so you don't have to swap out disks it isn't perfect yet.This is why i suggest this system instead of the PSP Go.And while this does have some cons, like the UMD hatch seems kinda flimsy so your little brother might tear it off causing a major issue being able to play games you can still download games the same as you can with the PSP Go. Another con is the memory sticks are not cheap, compared to hard drives.. hard drives are much cheaper by the GB then it is buying a memory stick. Sure you can go 'off brand' but how much more reliable are they compared to Sony's brand? I have never tried it but it's like they say you get what you pay for. Doesn't always work that way though. This model of PSP is cheaper then the PSP GO & you won't lose your warrenty if you need to replace the battery or if you choose to have extras. The other con i have is the charging cord is on the bottom & its easy to pull on it making the plug-in a little loose. I suggest not playing it while charging it & unhook it when the charge is complete. There might be a charging dock for the batteries themselves & you could just have 2 batteries, 1 in the psp while the other charging. Another is having 2 psps but highly unlikely if you don't have the money. But after seeing the PSP Go, you might want to buy a backup PSP 3000.What seperates this from the Nintendo DS? Much cooler graphics & a bigger screen. And you can watch movies. You can even download them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2010"}

I had friends who were into it and they kept telling me I needed to play it.  I was skeptical at best, but one day (a few weeks before I wrote this review) I was at Hastings and they had this game on sale new for $40, so I said screw it...let's see what all the fuss is about.  My initial observation was the graphics...they were pretty good, and it came out even more so later when I got out into Skyrim and started exploring.  The opening scene is pretty cool, and the character customization is so intricate...you can edit just about every little detail.  (My character is a Nord and he wound up somewhat resembling Kratos from God of War, so I named him Kratos...had to, LoL).  Initial game play seemed pretty fun, but after my first few levels up and I really started to get out into the world of Skyrim...completing quests and upgrading my character and exploring all the various things you can do within the game...I was hooked!  By level 10 I was a Skyrim convert!  It's an all around amazing game!

{"product_name":"B001CMIUYS","reviewerName":"A Hot Whizzer Summer...","summary":"Review from a former Final Fantasy Fan","reviewText":"I just picked up Final Fantasy 13. I was a former final fantasy fan. This is to say I have played and beaten 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 , 10 , and 10-2. Most of them twice. I am about 8 hours into the game, enough time to know the game is great and to advise people what I have learned, first impression.When I heard that FF 11 was to be a multiplayer, my heart broke. I tried it, out of dedication to the series, but was disappointed as expected.  I picked up 12, with hopes that they tried to return to their roots, but once again, a flop. Finally, they brought back the Final Fantasy and brought me a game I love again.Graphics: Final Fantasy Graphics are great, you expect it. The FMV's are beautiful and the in game graphics are decent as well. The lip syncing is decent, however, you still face a couple awkward emotional sounds that don't seem to quite fit in. Previous FF had the same problem, where the graphics couldn't quite display the right emotions, so they use sounds that people say \"huh, heh, ho, wow\" ect.. and it doesn't always work. However, it does remind me of FFX and brings back good memories, so I say it is passible. The only graphical complaint I must say about the game is the use of invisible barriers. I was a little surprised at how many I faced, and how obvious they were. It would have been nice if they spent a little more time filling the game with more natural looking barriers.Gameplay: Gameplay should probably be broken into several parts, but I figure I might as well start with combat. The random battle's that existed in the original FF games have been replaced with a chrono cross / chrono trigger type of gameplay. In other words, you see the enemies, and if you can avoid them, you can avoid combat. If you can get close to them without them noticing, you can get a preemptive strike. This means you can strategically choose how to approach an enemy to try to engineer a preemptive. You get control, I like that. Touching an enemy initiates combat. If you get close enough, the enemy might see you and start approaching you. The speed of approach and the ability to see you coming depend on the enemy. Once in combat, it is similar to the original ff games (I ignore 12). You get to choose actions, although it also offers you the choice of auto actions (it chooses the action for you). You no longer have control of your allies, which you will immediately think you hate, but I have quickly come to enjoy the strategy involved in the game. In battle, you no longer stand in one spot in a row facing your enemy. Rather, your character moves around the screen, and so do the enemies and allies. Certain enemy attacks can be interrupted if you time it right, and timing is everything in combat. You have the ability to move the camera 360 so you can see what is happening to your allies, but there is always the status bars to tell you what is what. The main \"strategy\" that replaces what used to be controlling your allies is now a system in which in mid combat you change how your allies fight. So, with the click of a button, an ally can go from attack mode, to healing mode, then defensive spell mode, then offensive spell mode, and so on. In some ways, a lot of people will hate this, I like it, it is new and refreshing.Th next new strange thing with the game is that hp is instantly restored at the end of each battle. Every battle starts with full life. You may think this sucks the challenge out of the game, but you will find yourself struggling occasionally. Some mobs will simply wipe out half your health in a couple of seconds if you don't watch it. So the game is still challenging and enjoyable. The other catch, as you only control the \"leader\", there death means game over, no phoenix down for the leader.I think they finally listened to a select group of people who kept saying \"why does a game have to be tedious\". It seems to me like they simplified, yet made it fun as well. You no longer have to worry about keeping you health up inbetween fights. Instead, every fight you go in full and go nuts, if you don't use strategy, you could fall hard and quick. I like it.The last gameplay idea I will mention is leveling. They borrowed the concepts of FFX leveling up (the sphere grid). However, they amplified it, instead of experience earned, you earn CP. You cash CP in, which causes the line to move towards the next crystal(sphere). After x amount of cp (depending on value of thing you learn) you get the crystal and whatever boost it gives you. The added catch is that you now have multiple grids, each depending on what type of playing your character is doing. Remember those modes I mentioned earlier, different modes mean different advancements. So while in heal mode, you character has access to skills and abilities they don't in attack mode. This means switching modes in combat is mandatory, even for your main character, especially if you decide you want to cast a spell or protect magic yourself. Anyway, this basically means you could go into every characters menu after every fight and level up a little, or wait until you store up cp points and then move several at once. So you constantly earn experience points in every fight, and you have to decide how you want them spent, and when you want to blow time spending them.Layout: Chests in this game take the form of technological balls (at least so far). Their positioning in this game is pretty simple, and unlike previous FF's, I never feel like I am forgetting something. They like to perform the trick of starting you in front of a chest, so if you just turned around and went back a few steps you would find one, but your desire to move forward prevents you from thinking of looking behind. Most other chest locations are rather easy to find if you look at the map, basically any deadend off path leads to a chest. Since there are no random battles, you don't have to be afraid to explore either, you know what is in front of you.Story: SO far the story has me 100% hooked. To sum up the concept, you have two worlds, a technological world, and an \"unknown savage world\" Any exposure to the savage world is met with fear. There are these godlike creatures, some help the techno city stay techno, and some are from the savage world. One thing the savage demigods like to do is pick out people and make them do suicide missions (think avatar from halo 2). The citizens of technoworld treat these people as the equivalent of suicide bombers. They are considered cursed since, success means they become a crystal, failure means they become a mindless ghoul. However, the demigods temporarily endow the person with magical powers and increased strength, which gives you the reason why all of your players become so powerful, unlike previous FF games, that would explain why one of the characters becomes so powerful, and then leaves you wondering why all his teammates are just as strong (FF7 cough FF9). Anyway, some of the story is predictable, I expect some revelation about those demigods and their true nature, and the nature of both planets. I expect that the savage world is not so savage and that the government is in control in an unnatural way. You just expect those things with FF, but that does not mean I won't have fun uncovering them.To Sum It Up: If you are a fan of the FF series the way it used to be, FFX and prior, then you should love this game. It is the first time in years that I am playing a game that feels and looks like FF. If you expected another FF12 with a new storyline and repacked ideas, go play WoW and leave my series alone. Thank you for returning to the roots, but also keeping it innovative and refreshing as always. I have yet to even touch the iceberg of this game. I am barely passed the prologue after 8 hours of play. This is going to be great, thank you Square enix.Update: Last Impression. I figured I should update upon finishing the game, as if my review was not long enough, and add my thoughts on the game in the end. I will keep my 5 star review, mainly because I think too many people placed lower scores because of the ps3 trolling or jrpg trolling. However, I would say I feel it is a 4 star game, not 5, and this is for 3 reasons. Reason 1, there are no towns to explore, which is something I miss dearly, reason 2, there are virtually no npcs to speak of after the intro and a brief time in the carnival, and whether they gave you sidequests, told you where to go, or simply commented on the weather, I enjoyed their presence and it makes the world feel less immersed.  Reason 3 is that you cannot return to the majority of the game. At the end, you can go to the city of eden, or pulse, you do not have access to anything else, for xbox 360 people, this means everything explored on disks 1 and 2 cannot be returned to, ever. I still enjoyed the game, it was challenging, innovative, and fun. The story kept me guessing until the end. However, those problems, and the invisible walls I mentioned before, dropped the score for me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2010"}

I'm one of the handful of people who missed out on Half-Life One. So my main complaint is the intro to Half-Life 2. You basically wake up on a train and find yourself in a train station...OK, so not much was put into an opening movie or storyline, but thankfully it gets much better from there. There are subsequent areas where things are somewhat explained incrementally, but you'll probably be so into the quality of the gameplay by then that it just starts filling things in a little better. There was obviously a great deal of planning that went into HL2 and BRAVO to Valve for following that up with great execution of the plan. There were a couple of places I did notice a frame rate drop, but they were quickly played through. In fact, there is so much going on in this game at times that it's a pure wonder that there aren't a couple of dozen places with frame rate problems.Thankfully this game was produced in a epic-type format. You go on a true journey from that original train station through some pretty creative scenes that require a combination of quick reflexes, puzzle-solving and resourcefulness to get you safely through plenty of good old fashioned shoot-them-before-they-shoot-you adrenaline pumping confrontations. Quick Save often and at any time you please. Then there's the almost guilt-inducing selection of weapons you collect when progressing through levels and plenty of times where you'll nearly jump out of your seat or nearly paralyzed with fear (I can still hear that attack gunship's gun batteries charging up before firing lethal rounds...Ouch!)HL2 is just a GREAT game...Even if you never really liked FPS games. There are times that will be frustratingly difficult, but when you finally pull it off and clear the level it produces a sublime sense of satisfaction rarely found anywhere else on Earth. The graphics are really top-notch along with the sound effects. The other 2 HL2 \"Episodes\" extend the story, although the game titles are unnecessarily confusing:Half-Life 2; Half-Life 2: Episode One; Half-Life 2: Episode Two. Those are 3 separate games, so why not HL2, HL3: Episode One and HL3: Episode Two?!?! Or even HL2, HL2: Episode Two and HL2: Episode Three?Portal is a great diversion, although it's over just about the time you start really excelling at the game. Can't comment on Team Fortress 2, haven't played it. All told, we got a great deal of fun out of 4 of the games in The Orange Box and I've bought more expensive games that have only one game (like most) and regretted the purchase because of poor gameplay and zero fun factor. In other words, you can't go wrong with The Orange Box! Get it and prepare yourself for a truly enveloping gaming experience...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2009"}

Acid being the last one. Revengeance puts you in the shoes of Raiden, a cyborg  fighting against other cyborgs for the greater good. The plot is supposed to hover around MGS4, but it&#8217;s boiled down to a confusing, and ultimately, uninteresting mess. There&#8217;s something going on about children&#8217;s brains being harvested for implants and people making money off of war. Raiden is the good guy trying to stop all this, but the game is so short and broken up so much that it&#8217;s hard to follow.What is great is all the action. Raiden responds wonderfully and has an array of flashy moves that would put most action adventure games to shame. As you progress through the game you can upgrade your life, fuel cells, weapons, and moves. The whole game pretty much revolves around a slicing engine. When you defeat an enemy enough you can slow down time and use the right analog stick to slice enemies up into ribbons. It&#8217;s pretty fun and never really gets old, but it&#8217;s sensitive and some times finicky. Boss fights will rely on this and lining up squares can cost you the entire battle if you aren&#8217;t quick enough.I honestly wish Platinum never put stealth sections in the game. This isn&#8217;t Solid Snake, I want to run around slicing things up. The enemy placement isn&#8217;t smart and laid out like a typical Metal Gear game. You get seen most of the time even if you try hard not to. One problem lies in the fact that there&#8217;s not much else to do. It&#8217;s just wave after wave of enemies and then a boss fight. It also doesn&#8217;t help that the game is ridiculously hard outside of easy mode. Even though it took me less than 6.5 hours to finish the game, it was broken up throughout a year of playing. I would spend hours on some areas just because of how hard the game can be. There&#8217;s no block button. Let me throw that out there right now. Instead you can dodge and parry which is extremely difficult to get down right. You can die in just a few hits and healing relies on slicing enemies at the right moment and getting there nano strands to fully heal. You must slice them before they hit the ground, this can be really tricky to master.The enemies also repeat often and the game is overly generic in tone. Sure the graphics are fantastic, the music is great, and the action is fast paced and looks amazing. However, the enemies are just generic soldiers and Geckos. The environments nearly all look the same and some boss fights even repeat. I appreciate the difficulty which forces you to master the combat system, but a larger variety of gamplay would have been nice.So the final question is this: Is Revengeance the be all-end all of the action adventure genre? Not likely. Sure it&#8217;s up there with some of the better games combat wise, but everything else just falls a bit flat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00503E9FY","description":"","reviewerName":"maskedgamer","summary":"Decent but lacking a lot that makes a FPS fun.","reviewText":"This is the first COD game I've ever played. It was a decent shooter and I like playing online against other people which can be fun or frustrating depending on who you get. A shooter is a shooter and you play one you've played them all so you can understand it's  running around a closed map,pointing and shooting,while looking at the back of a gun on the screen. What separates one shooter from the next are how well the game looks and how well it controls. COD:MW3 looks pretty decent. It's not on the same level of realism that the battlefield series is but it looks just as it should... like an arcade game. Call of Duty is what I'd like to think of as an arcade shooter. The guns aren't very realistic to how the real thing would act, These a lot of over the top abilities like the constant air strikes,Juggernaut armor,Invincible Riot shields,nukes,EMP's etc. etc. It just a military arcade shooter. That makes the game very fun if you're looking to log in and jump right into the action but, the problem is that the lack of realism doesn't play to well if you're interested in REAL warfare strategy.I'm used to playing TOM Clancy games and the best part of the series is the strategy behind it. Using your men properly, taking cover, figuring how to overcome a group of soldiers. All of that is what I feel should be adapted into any military game. The arcade likeness of COD just isn't designed for that type of playing style. In COD if someone is firing directly at you, instead of seeking cover and then firing back, people just stand and shoot at each other like they're playing water guns. There's no sense of mortality in the game. No one acts as if they make decisions based on their safety and the safety of their team like in real combat, or combat simulator games. What it results in is cartoony game play with Kaboom! explosions every 5 seconds and people running around not cooperating like a chicken with its head cut off. There are clans but mostly it's not strategy they play it's just knowing the map and how to play it which sadly is what the game boils down to. The better you know the maps the stronger you will be in the game. Knowing the best positions to ambush/snipe/or whatever is mostly what the games about. It's fun until you get bored and after a few rounds it does get repetitive.Controlling the game as with any FPS is a big aspect of it. It can make or break a game and in the case of COD the controls style suits the game well. This game does not award you on precision at all. It does not focus on targeting too much. If you aim close enough to the hit mark you will be rewarded a kill. This makes it easy to run around spray firing and still be awarded for hitting someone and killing them even if your aim is inaccurate. You will see this most notably with shotgun weapons. The weapons themselves also play a role into the arcade shooter. They are in cases more or less effective than the real thing. LMG's are underpowered and not as damaging as an assault rifle. If you hit someone with a few LMG rounds they can still live to tell about it. If you get hit with one Rifle round you'll be back at the spawning point. Not very accurate for a weapon that shoots multiple rounds of VERY large bullets. Shotguns also do not act as they should. In most cases they cause big damage within range just as long as they are aimed at a specific target. In COD you do not need to exactly aim directly at a target with a shotgun. You can aim near or close enough to someone to be awarded a kill point. Riot shields are also another fun \"defense\" weapon that can stop any bullet that's fired at it. They are invincible to all fire, even though in Real life they are not bullet proof. They are used as shields to keep officers from being hit by thrown objects like bottles and rocks etc. etc. The weapons match the game more or less because they are semi realistic. They look like the real thing and perform like them but not as them.Overall COD is a decent military shooter. If you're looking for a more serious war game you may want to go join the ranks of BF3 or something similar.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2011"}

He can also use tons of items like hammers and thunderbolts.","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"I love this game!!!","reviewText":"If you played Paper Mario on the Nintendo 64, or the more recent Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga on the Game Boy Advance, you've probably been counting the days until the release of Nintendo's latest Mario role-playing game. The Thousand-Year Door contains the same simple and addictive mechanics, and is one of the best RPGs to ever hit the GameCube. The story of The Thousand-Year Door begins with a letter Mario receives from Princess Peach containing a mysterious map. Peach invites Mario on a treasure hunt, then manages to get herself kidnapped (again). As Mario, the player has to get her back (again). Using the treasure map to find clues on her location, players embark on a traveling quest, looking for special items, and unlocking new areas. At various points, you switch control of characters, playing as Peach herself, and even a certain large green chap with terribly bad breath. For those who haven't played either Paper Mario or Superstar Saga, this game will initially seem odd. It's an RPG, but incorporates plenty of simple arcade-like elements from the classic Super Mario series. The game takes full advantage of its flat-yet-3D paper theme, folding Mario on command; he can glide across gaps as a paper airplane, or turn sideways and fit through narrow openings. You occasionally bump into enemies that send you into turn-based battles; however, reflexes and timing play as critical a role as character's stats. By skillfully tapping the right buttons on cue, you can add damage to your attacks, execute special moves, and even dodge enemy strikes. With experience, players can learn to get through lengthy battles without taking a scratch. The venue for combat is rather different too, as all combat takes place on a stage. If you do well, fans come to see you compete. Win the audience over and they'll toss power-ups to you, and their cheers will recharge your energy. If you make slow decisions, perform badly, or are just unlucky, the audience will throw rocks at you. You can also add extra stylistic flairs to your attacks that don't inflict additional damage, but do get the crowd roaring... well, as much as a crowd full of Toads and Koopa Troopas can roar. There's a clean-cut, effective visual style used throughout the game that would be called \"charming\" in a children's novel. Characters are flat sprites; sometimes single sheets with no depth and other times multiple sprites connected together to create simple 3D shapes. Buildings and rooms unfold like a pop-up book. While the game doesn't exactly show off the GameCube's power, it looks brilliant, full of bright, well-drawn animated characters. Music is largely a blend of fresh tunes and remixed, retro Nintendo music -- they still work! The only real flaw is a number of conversations between characters that go on too long, dragging the usually fast-paced game to a screeching halt. But, those moments are far outshined by the greatness elsewhere. Though it's just an evolution of Superstar Saga and Paper Mario before it, The Thousand-Year Door feels 100 percent fresh and entertaining. The occasionally complicated button maneuvering that caused a little frustration on the GBA is replaced with much more approachable gameplay. While this isn't a hardcore title, the puzzles and numerous battles will keep serious gamers busy for some time. Paper Mario is easy to play, exceptional fun, and a thoroughly engaging title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2004"}

{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"Christopher Lankford","summary":"Best Final Fantasy in a while","reviewText":"OVERALL IMPRESSIONS (TL;DR):The game is significantly less flawed than recent installments in the Final Fantasy series, but rarely shines as an example for other games to follow. Highlights include the managerial battle system, monster ally development, characters Yeul and Caius, and the voice acting. While enjoyable on its own, it doesn't have the feel of this generation's masterpieces, such as the big names \"Skyrim\" and \"Mass Effect 2\" or sleeper hits \"Valkyria Chronicles\" and \"Catherine\".BACKGROUND:Ever since Final Fantasy X was released to massive acclaim in the early 2000's, the series has been very experimental. And it had to be; the \"active time battle\" which began in the SNES era had been beaten to death, and FFX was a perfect swan-song for the true turn-based RPG. But other elements were seeing change as well: longtime series composer Nobuo Uematsu was going independent and leaving the series to new talent. The \"high-tech fantasy\" setting which was successfully developed for Final Fantasy 6 had grown a touch stale, and Square-Enix had discovered in FFX that alternative settings--in that particular case, a fantastic southeast Asia--were well received by fans.However, much of the experimentation over the next few games resulted in failure. The \"pop princess\" scenario of Final Fantasy X-2 was unimpressive to many, and the game's battle system (which combined their \"active time battle\" with their \"job system\") was glossed over as neither a saving grace nor a damning feature. The following single-player game, Final Fantasy XII, had many MMORPG elements and was received well for it, but ultimately was not in the spirit of previous games due to its vastly different soundtrack (which had zero input from Uematsu), relatively small cast of story characters, and requirements for \"grinding\".Final Fantasy XIII returned to the core of the Final Fantasy series for the most part. However, to the surprise of many fans, the game was almost entirely linear: there was no element of exploration or, for that matter, personalized character stat development. This betrayed an amazing gameplay and story experience for many people, leaving the game ultimately unsatisfying. This is where Final Fantasy XIII-2 was created: somewhere among the tenuous peaks of revolutionary \"progress\", after a mixed bag of successes and failures.GAMEPLAY:This is where the game probably shines most. The game allows a huge amount of customization to your characters in battle. Crystogen Points (CP, the game's version of EXP) can be allocated to any of the six roles in Final Fantasy XIII in any distribution: to refresh, they entail a pure damage-dealing job, a job which boosts an enemy's damage taken while dealing moderate damage, a job which protects allies by absorbing damage, a job which debuffs enemies, a job which buffs allies, and a healer. Like in Final Fantasy X-2 and XIII, you can and must switch between these classes during battle for maximum effectiveness. The ultimate effect of this is a managerial gameplay experience that allows you to build a team any way you wish, then control the flow of battle as much as any boss enemy would in previous games.The third playable \"character\" in the game is actually a set of captured monsters which you gain access to shortly after the game's beginning. Upgrading, naming, and decorating your monsters can become horribly addictive. It's also very personalized: some people want a team full of series-staple chocobos, others want hulking behemoths or trophy boss monsters (many of which are tameable). I used a team of gelatinous flan, because they're classy (duh). The good news is, the monster development system allows a hefty fraction of the monsters to be powerful enough for late game activities, so you can focus on having fun with it!The only downside of the gameplay relates heavily to the monster system. It's quite possible, if you're skilled enough to sequence break in a few places, to break the game's difficulty by raising a monster that stays just ahead of the enemy curve. Much of the game becomes a cakewalk if you do this accidentally, even on the harder of two difficulties. The good news is that the post-game superbosses (when paired with the game's relatively easy-to-achieve level cap) are not trivialized unless you create \"ultimate monsters\", which is a late-game activity in and of itself, so it's not a problem.TRANSLATION, VOICES, MUSIC:This game was translated with more love than previous installments in the series. A major downfall of many Japanese-to-English translations is a lack of romanticized adjectives: FFXIII-2 flows like a novel in places, so that's not a problem. Voiceover is unsurprisingly excellent, considering its cast includes Troy Baker (as Snow, see also Vincent from \"Catherine\"), Laura Bailey (as Serah, see just about any other game's voice cast), Ali Hillis (Lightning, see Liara T'Soni from the \"Mass Effect\" series), and Liam O'Brien (as antagonist Caius, who hams it up as usual, but is for some reason well-received for his hamming).Despite the stars, some of the lesser-known actors who are given main characters in XIII-2 really shine. The character Noel is voiced and written very well, and the antagonist's counterpart Yeul is astoundingly good: she strikes a nice balance between girlishness and the deep, throaty voice of an all-knowing (and occasionally pessimistic) seeress. Also, since *MINOR SPOILER* her character is actually a multitude of characters across time *END SPOILER*, there's an extra bit of goodness due to the slight variety of performances she gives.The music is for the most part a step up from XIII, which focused too heavily on one theme. This soundtrack is much more diverse, but doesn't spread itself out too much for the leitmotivs to be audible. The violin-sawing from XIII's battle music is widespread in the sequel's soundtrack, which is good for anyone who enjoys that particular instrument, and there are many choral pieces as well.The only problem I can mention about the sound is that Mog's voice can become annoying at times. However, these moments usually come and pass, and you'll find it cute again eventually. Just recognize that it's a fifteen year old girl doing it, and you'll grin.VISUALS:Similar to XIII, but with questionable character design decisions. Noel, Yeul, and Hope all have very nice character designs, but Serah's new outfit is too sexualized for how skinny and child-like her figure is. Lightning looks like a lopsided Asian valkyrie, Snow looks like a vagrant, and Caius' outfit is too tight. Its purple hue is not a problem, it's just too tight. New character Alyssa has shorts that come down to about her wrist, which means there's something very wrong with her proportions, though I can't necessarily place it.Environments are very good, although less diverse than XIII's due to a notable lack of Cocoon's disorienting cityscapes. A few snowy environments put snow on your field and battle models, which looks cool on both the characters and the monsters in the allied and enemy parties.Character design flaws in Serah and Noel can be remedied with downloadable costumes at extra cost. I recommend the Mass Effect N7 armor, it makes for some ass-kicking goodness.STORY:Overall less impressive than XIII, but better than XII. Interesting new characters distract from the fact that the cool elements of XIII's setting--the fal'Cie, their control over Man, and their bizarre quest to end original sin by sinning yet again--are now all purged from the world. As has been the trend in Final Fantasy games since IX or X, the antagonist can be sympathized with, at times more than the protagonists. Much of the story is bizarre and really follows from the goddess in question being \"a goddess of chaos\".If you get the game for the story, know that you will have to wait and cough up more money to complete it. The ending is \"To be continued...\" and in all likelihood will be completed by DLC. (Note that while the Snow and Sazh DLC can help 100%-ers and do have some fun elements, they do not contribute to the story in the way that the Lightning and future DLC will.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"Yamila \"Keyblademaster22\"","summary":"Excelent Game","reviewText":"I'll just make this sweet and short.XIII-II follows the events after XIII was over and takes place 3AF on New Bodhum.  With Lightning, Snow, Hope and everyone else gone, Serah (now the protagonist) is the only one left.  Serah then dreams of seeing Lightning and soon after is awakened in new attar and a meteor falling down on Gran Pulse.  Soon after, a boy named Noel Kriess (protagonist) comes and tells Serah that he's seen and spoken to Lightning in Valhalla (an unknown world between time and space) and tells her about time travel and paradox's.  Afterwards, they gather artifects to open gates to try and find Lightning in Valhalla.Basically, the story involves a lot of time rifts and time continums.  The game in my opinion is a lot better than XIII.  I liked XIII a lot but this ones better.  I've only spent about 20hrs on the game(most of that time, I was just leveling up Serah and Noel) but I'll try not the spoil it too much.  But what I didn't like about the game was mainly that it's WAY easier than XIII, and I have it on normal mode.  I'm not even going to see what it's like on easy mode.  But one last thing, and maybe it's just me but I didn't find the Crystarium...to my liking, I liked XIII's original better. It just seems like everything in this game is too easy.  But I guess for some, it's fine.The story does have some pot holes that weren't exactly explained, like---who's Noel?  Who's Caius?  Who's Yuel?  What's a Seeress?  Where'd all these people come from?  Where's Snow?  And most of all---Where's Lightning?  But if you play through the story and not down it because of a little BS and not nitpick at it, then you'll like the game.Pushing that little ball of lint to the side, I find the game both touching and beautiful (I even found the story so weird, confusing and interesting, that I was just too engrossed in it to even go to sleep) A lot of people didn't care for XIII and a lot of people don't care for this one.  But I have to tell you guys, at least it's better than X-2.  We ALL know what X-2 was like.  Moving along, a word of advice, don't level up Noel and Serah too much or the fights will get too easy.*Spoiler*If you by any chance hit what I believe is the R1 button, don't freak out when you can't get to another time gate.  If you hit the R1 button, you will be able to relive the chapter(or time gate) that you want.  For me, I did this accidently when selecting Oerba and fought Caius---AGAIN.  And if you DO somehow press the R1 button and complete the same time gate again----saaay, if you completed Breisha Ruins but decided to do it again for the heck of it---who knows, you might unlock something else that wasn't inn the past/present before(wink).But I warn you, hint---the story isn't completely finish.  You'll have to buy DLC in order to FULLY complete the game.  Sooo, I don't know what SE did this, they could've just put the other part to the story in the game so we wouldn't have to waste TIME and MONEY.  But I guess they like making money off us.So over all, XIII-II is an amazing game with unbelievable ear orgasim OSTs, emotional stories and beautiful graphics (as always).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2012"}

Its a mix of 8bit music with techno, from really low key stuff to blasting your ears off techno. The way its placed on the levels makes it blend into the game and doesn't distract the user with obnoxious sounds.The difficulty on this game is basically shoot them and kill them in one hit, or die horribly if their hits connect with you. When you kill the enemies their body parts go flying, heads explode, necks cut or heads smash in occurs with even more brutal takes downs. Also, since you have to walk back through the level to your car you get a sense of dread what you have just done to all these human beings.The story is basically you get calls from someone random to kill these mob members. It spirals from their and you slowly learn who you are killing and the impacts it has on your character. Just be sure to watch the credits thoroughly.If you can handle a brutally hard game, than pick this game up. Its worth it for the soundtrack and the combat to add it to your collection.

The over-the-shoulder perspective is now a staple in the action genre, plus the game was so well designed, it is one of the few games that keeps bringing me back after the initial sparkle wears off.Resident Evil 5 borrows heavily from Resident Evil 4. Having said that, comparison is inevitable. And initially, it seems like more of the same good stuff. But is it really?The first difference that's gonna hit you in the graphics. Yes. They're gorgeous. You will find yourself spending time in each level just marveling at the details and effects.Along with the improved graphics, the combat is also sped up a little bit and the game is perfectly paced. The action is fast and fun, and brings back the Resident Evil 4 feel pretty well. The gameplay alone makes it worthy of a rental. Resident Evil 5 also introduces Co-op gameplay where a friend assumes the role of Sheva Alomar, partner to the main character, Chris Redfield. Co-op is implemented well and is fun to play with a friend online or on the same screen. But that's where the good ends.The game is short. It'll take you 10 hours to beat the game, maybe 12 if you are the exploring type. The game is not designed as well as Resident Evil 4; without going into too much detail, you will only have reason to play the game through twice before its just no fun anymore. Besides the combat, you will partake is some excruciatingly easy puzzles, in which you are basically hand-fed the solutions to. Bosses are easy as well. Everything feels very dumbed down compared to Resident Evil 4. Even the inventory system has been re-designed to make it simpler for the player.One of the things that made Resident Evil 4 so intense was the fact that the player was always low on ammo and tight on space. Battles had to be meticulously planned in the inventory and since ammo was sparse, the player had to be crafty. That was fun. But in Resident Evil 5, you are never really strapped for ammo, and you can almost always use your partner as a pack mule. It changes the game mechanic, making it much less interesting.Speaking of intense, one of the things about Resident Evil 4 that made it so intense was the fact that it was truly scary and maintained a sense of horror and suspense. It made the game immursive; you really felt like you were alone in the dark. In Resident Evil 5, you are neither. Thanks to your partner and the sunny African setting, you'll never be alone or in the dark. Horror has left the game in Resident Evil 5, and with it went an undeniable sense of charm and excitement that is woefully missed.Because that sense of Horror is absent and the game is more action oriented now, it seems kind of strange that the developers stuck with the setup where the player cannot walk and shoot at the same time. I know other reviewers address this all too often and to be honest, it is the most minor of my complaints in my opinion. Nevertheless, it is still worth noting.This is not to say it is impossible to have fun in Resident Evil 5. It is a perfect rental, because it can be beaten quickly and once it is beaten, there is not much worth-while to return to. I'd say definitely find a way to play it, like co-op-ing it at a friends house, because the first time is a blast. Otherwise, I'd stick to Resident Evil 4. But trust me, you don't want to be the loser who actually paid full admission while the disc sits on the shelf collecting dust for years to come.RENT IT. 3 stars out of 5.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00008QOL6","description":"When it comes to first-person shooters, there are two schools of thought. One harkens back to the originalDoom--frantic action, scary monsters, big weapons, and story is given short shrift. The second school is best exemplified byHalf-Life: strong narrative, consistent real-world weapons, consistent monsters, and settings.Doom'sheirs up until now have beenQuakeandSerious Sam, but nowPainkillercomes onto the scene leaving bloody footprints, and &#x85; let the carnage begin!You play a man who dies in a pathetic car crash (he's distracted because he's holding his girl's hand) and has spent a long time in purgatory. He thinks this is unfair because, despite being well-schooled in the art of killing, he maintains that he's done nothing wrong. Heaven makes a deal with him. Take care of a little invasion problem concerning Hell, and our hero can enter those pearly gates.Weak storyline aside,Painkillerbasically amounts to a brilliant series of arcade-style levels and challenges. The settings include darkened monasteries, graveyards, a horrifying asylum, a medieval town under siege, and even H-E-Double Hockey Sticks itself. The level design is brilliant, varied, and jam-packed with enemies. There seems to be no end to the amount and variety of cool monsters to fight, and they each explode into chunks of blood and gore in a most disturbingly satisfying manner. At the end of each level is a challenge, such as collecting a certain amount of gold or killing a Boss within a time limit. Winning the challenge gives you tarot cards you can use to make the game easier. The different cards bring haste, double-damage, invulnerability, and so on. This simple mechanic makes the game far more replayable than your average shooter.The graphics are first rate, which means you need a powerful PC to run the game with all the detail settings maxed out. The only other problem is a CD-copy protection bug that makes the game unplayable for some (a patch is available).Painkillermay seem a bit silly at first glance. But the gameplay mechanics, replayability (full multiplayer is also available), variety, and brilliant level design make it one of the finest and most satisfying shooters ever made. -Andrew S.

This game has some of the best acting with Anna Torv (Fringe) as Nariko and Andy Serkis (Lord of The Rings) as King Bohan. The game play leaves a lot to be desired. The game is supposed to have certain combos that you can do but they just don't seem to work in the game, and even if they did, you wouldn't have enough time to pull them off because as soon as you are in the middle of pressing the buttons for a combo it is broken up when you are hit, and you will get hit. When you get hit your character freezes for a moment (too long of a moment) and you get hit again because you can't dodge or move. Also in the middle of combat you cannot stop a motion which also causes you to get hit alot. This will become very frustrating. Boss battles also seem to drag on a lot longer than they need to, especially the last one. With such a frustrating control scheme you will want to smash the controller many times. The game just comes down to being a button masher. For some, that may not be a bad thing but why have a combo system if you cant really use them during actual game play. There also should have been an aiming system for the rocket launcher when you have to kill five hundred enemies because the rockets will hit the first object in the game it comes across which is usually a barricade, which means wasted rockets. The motion part of the game was not bad and I actually enjoyed most of that after I got used to the controller, but they may have overdone it a bit. Bottom line is, this game will frustrate you because some things just dont work as they should and some things are overblown. Not being able to control the camera angle 360 degrees is also annoying. Game developers need to realize that making a game challenging does not mean making a game frustratingly difficult. When a game becomes frustrating and difficult, it is no longer fun and enjoyable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2011"}

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return, as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

It's an epic story filled with incredible visuals and action.  The characters are some of the more memorable ones in gaming.  Like its predecessor, it's an RPG/TPS.  However, this incarnation is much more heavy on the TPS and less so on the RPG.  It's kind of like Bioshock in that it's more of a shooter/action game with RPG elements thrown in.  This is not necessarily a bad thing when you look at Mass Effect 2 on its own merits.  But when you compare it to its predecessor, Mass Effect 2 is a bit nerfed.I downloaded Mass Effect 2 from Steam.  Thus far, I've been very pleased with the experience.  Getting connected to the Cerberus Network was easy, but I haven't installed the DLC yet.  Character creation is about the same as Mass Effect 1.  However, the level of customization in ME2 is oversimplified.  The ability tree and inventory are nowhere nearly as intricate as ME1's.  I was a little disappointed by this.  Plus, the Mako is nowhere to be found.  I actually enjoyed the Mako missions in ME1.  The dialogue trees, however, are more varied.  Overall, the technical aspects of ME2 are good, but they have definitely been dumbed down.The visuals and gunplay are great (much improved when compared to ME1).  Beautiful color palette, lots of lighting and particle effects.  The cover system works very well.  The simple act of firing your weapon is a treat, especially if you are an FPS or TPS nut like me.  Now you can engage in some strategic dismemberment (ala Dead Space) by blasting off an enemy's arm or leg.  So much fun.  I'm running the game at 1920x1200 with an 8800GT graphics card.  I've got 4gb of ram with a Q6600 @ 3.0 GHz (Windows 7).  Smooth frame rate, no glitches.Bioware has never disappointed when it comes to a compelling story.  ME2's story is a continuation of the first game and is a bit darker in its theme and scope.  I won't give anything away, but it'll definitely get its hooks into you.  The new characters are intriguing, especially Miranda (yowza!).Aside from the changes, I have to admit that ME2 is entertaining and worthy of my hard earned cash.  There are some old elements that I'll miss, but I'll get over it.  Nerfed or not, ME2 is vastly superior to most games out there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Looks Promising","reviewText":"DISCLAIMER:  This review is based on the Demo version of DJ Hero and not the full version that is to be released October 27th.I heard about DJ Hero a few weeks ago but did not pay much attention to it until I got the chance to play the demo version in Game Stop and almost immediately became hooked.  Because of the store setting I was unable to really see how the the game worked and the different controls, but now that I have the Demo version at home I'm better able to understand the game and how the different controls work.DJ Hero follows the same concept of the popular Guitar games, but instead of a guitar controller you are given a turntable controller.  Like Guitar Hero you have to match the colors of the buttons on the note track with the three buttons on the turn table.  Unlike Guitar Hero games, that have 5 buttons, DJ hero only has three buttons.  You may think this makes the game easier, but there is also a cross fading and scratching you have contend with.Cross Fading:In addition to the button keys you have to make use of the cross fader.  This is a switch on the left side of the turn table that has three positions:  Left, Center and Right.  On the on screen note track, you will sometimes see the green note bar move to the left this means you have to move the cross fader all the way to the left as well in addition to matching the timing shown on the screen.  Similarly when you see the far right note bar (Blue) move to the right, this means you have to move the cross fader all the way to the right.  You leave the cross fader in a position until the note track tells you to move it again.  While the Beginner and Easy modes do not require you to use the cross fader, Medium and above make use of this and this can make it very difficult to get a streak of notes.  Unless you have actually DJ'd in real life, this is sure to throw you off until you get the hang of it.Scratching:I'm sure all of us older gamers experimented with scratching our parents/grand parents LP's when we were younger and if your grand parents were anything like mine, scratching their records was something that happened once or twice and never happened again. We now have the opportunity to scratch to our heart's content with DJ Hero. For the most part scratching is pretty self explanatory, basically requiring you to move the turn table back and forth with the appropriate colored button held down. However you can only scratch for the specified amount of time and if you do any more (or less), then you lose your note streak.  To make things even more interesting, on harder levels you are also required to do \"directional scratching which requires you to scratch in the direction that the note track tell you to.  See a down arrow that means move the turn table down (with the correct button pressed).Euphoria:I am not 100% sure what Euphoria does, but from what I can tell is very similar to Star power, giving you a point boost during the time it is activated. You build up Euphoria by hitting every note in certain special sessions, and you activate by pressing a flash red button on the left side of the turn table right above the cross fader.  This requires you of course to move your hand from the cross fader control which can end up messing up your streak.Effects switch:Similar to the effects switch in Rock band, DJ hero has an effect knob that allow you to change the way a sections sounds in addition to providing a handful of special sound effects during special red sections on the note track.  These are not required to do during the song, but they do add to your score.Reverse ModeOne of the coolest aspects of DJ Hero is the Rewind.  If you play a certain amount of notes/scratches/cross fades correctly (I believe its 50), then you activate a \"Rewind\" that allows you to litterally rewind the song you are playing by actually turning the turntable 360 degrees.  Use these wisely because the game is quite unforgiving and does not give you any time to recover from the 360 turn and if your hands are not already on the buttons when the 360 turn is complete you will miss notes.Versus ModeAnother feature is Guitar vs. DJ were one person plays the turn table and the other plays a guitar.  The demo did not really explain the purpose or object of this mode so I'm not exactly sure how it incorporates into the actual game.  There is also a DJ vs. DJ mode that follows the same concept.Because this is only a demo, I don't know of the other modes this game has to offer so this review is severely limited to the 4 tracks that were included with it.  As far as durability of the turntable, it seems to be pretty sturdy.  My only concern I can think of is the mechanism that recognizes the scratches and rewinds of the turn table may start to malfunction down the road.  But since there are not as many moving parts as a guitar controller I suspect it should last longer than my Guitar Hero controllers have lasted.  The turntable itself is quite responsive, in fact too responsive in during scratching, a scratch that lasts a split second longer than what shows on the screen and you will instantly break your note streak.  Similarly, the button presses have to be pinpoint accurate as well. The cross fader however, does give you a little room for error when moving it back and forth.Because this review based on the demo, I can't really go into the different game modes, the true fun factor, online play, versus mode, or re-playability.  Naturally having only 4 songs to play on the Demo gets very old and boring, but I don't know if this will carry over to the final version of the game.  In any case, I'm more than likely going to purchase the actual game when its released when I can find a package that sells the game only.  When that time comes, I will update this review with a review of the full version of the game.  In summary however, if you want a break from the Guitar/Drum/Vocal based games, then DJ Hero should be an interesting twist on an already popular (but aging) genre of video games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2009"}

I have to admit the Commercial made this game look like the next and maybe even greater than Grand Theft Auto 3. I had false hopes. True Crime is terrible, there is no reason for you to buy this game.First off EVERYTHING is WAY over-exaggerated, the figting, the shooting, even the gameplay. Some of the moves you can do in fighting are a little bit too \"Matrix-esk\". And it's always the same thing, run into a room, fire off a gun, fight with the left-overs. And when you're driving the car, you can goup on two wheels (WHO CAN DO THAT?).On top of that you fight a dragon and I quote from A Gamer,\"How is fighting a dragon true crime?\" And he's right, in no way does fighting a dragon have to do with Crime.True Crime is one of those games you beat once and then leave it on the shelf to collect dust. There is no replayability because all of the suprise is gone, also it just gets friggin' boring.Overview:Fun- 4/10 This game is very redundant and quite boring after a little while of play.Graphics-6/10 one of the best features of this game...sadly. (All because you can drive over 200 miles of L.A)Gameplay- 5/10 a little on the stupid side, as I mentioned before, too repetitive, and the camera angles screw you up.Difficulty- 5/10 fairly easy...some parts are harder than others.Overall- 20/40This game is not worth $50, I doubt it would be worth 20. This Game could have been awesome, but it seems like the makers lost sight of what they were trying to do after they made the first 5 minutes of the game. Nice Concept, crappy delivery...If your interested in a game like this, I reccomend Grand Theft Auto 3.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2003"}

Mills","summary":"Delightful!","reviewText":"As has been said by numerous reviewers, this game is seriously \"inspired\" by Zelda and it many ways such a rip-off it's impossible to think that the wonderful people over at Silicon Studios were even trying to pretend they weren't.  Instead of hearts you have life \"apples\" and the system works exactly the same, EXACTLY.  And that just one of many super-obvious examples, another being the use of bombs, and really the entire structure of the narrative.But despite this, how does this game still succeed in being a completely unique and novel experience?  It's really all in the name: \"3D Dot Game Heroes\".  I bought this specifically to satisfy an urge I had to play some classic Zelda a la \"A Link the Past\"  but was pleasantly surprised to pop this in and find just a little bit more beneath the surface.Not only is the whole 2d to 3d thing about the game a cute gimmick and a hilarious concept for people who remember the old days fondly.  It also allows for a new combat experiences which are really not that similar to Zelda, or any other game.  Your sword gets huge in this game, don't worry there are plenty of double- entendres throughout this game on the subject.  But as game play it really works, the combat is not just 2-d brought to 3-d, it has to be approached completely differently.In terms of the humor aspect of the game, which is excellent.  I disagree with the recurring opinion of some people (who are obviously entitled to said opinion, and this is just my own) but that said I disagree that this game is so similar to Zelda to be a true parody.  I fully expected to find this to be the case, but even before the game started when I could choose my character from among countless bizarre offerings such as a funky Santa and a ninja who hides underground and breaths through a reed, I knew this game was going to be a delightful affair.The humor isn't really aimed at Zelda, its just silly humor.  Meanwhile the game its-self is full of things which poke fun at the entire medium of videogames such as giving you the option to say no to the king for his response of \"well, that won't really advance the story now will it?  Let's try this again\" once again, not really aimed at Zelda but all games with \"choices\".I guess my thesis here is that the game world is clearly (lets emphasize this again: CLEARLY) ripped off from Zelda, but since the parody of the game isn't specific to the Zelda franchise, I guess I felt more like they decided that Zelda was the best series of the 2d action rpg genre which they wanted to mimic and is therefore really more of a homage then a parody, with the humor being all over the place.  I also think they chose Zelda just BECAUSE it is so recognizable, it's really necessary for the whole 2d world turned 3d idea to resonate, if it was just any old game it wouldn't be as charming, in my opinion.Personally I love ALL Zelda games, and I love this game too, but really for different reasons:  As I said before, the combat is really an entirely new thing which really takes advantage of the whole 3-d view and it's addictively satisfying.  The way enemies blow up into little blocks is SO satisfying.  the entire world is really well transitioned from \"2d\" to 3d.  iF this was just 3d Zelda game it would be fun, but not the great unique game it truly is.However there are some areas where the formula falls a little flat, the sound for instance, made to sound as if it could have been from a true SNES game; sometimes it's great and really adds to the fun of the whole game.  Other times it will drive you crazy.  It just isn't as fantastic as the classic Zelda music.  Maybe I am bias due to nostalgia, I don't know.This game also leaves you with just as little information about what to do next as \"a link to the past\" I kind of like that in a video game but this WILL frustrate some people.I also had this game freeze my ps3 once, and its a brand new ps3, maybe its an anomaly, or not, hard to tell.All in all this game is definitely a lot of fun, and I gave it a full 5 out of 5 just because the character editor is great and the game comes fully loaded with literally dozens of hilariously delightful characters, plus the price is really quite a bargain.I feel like this might be obvious but I'll say it anyway.  This game will most likely fall flat for anyone who hasn't played an old 2d RPG in their life.  And for those people out there on the other end of the spectrum, who are completely snobby about these things (like the people who don't like Batman Begins because \"the `real' Ra's al Ghul was completely different blah blah blah\"- basically anybody who just can't handle anything but the original product because they have no imagination) Well neither of these parties should buy this game basically.If you loved those old 2d rpgs, have a sense of humor and want a fun little game which will delight your nostalgia receptors as well as provide new and hilarious game play, do YOURSELF a favor and pick up this little gem.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2010"}

Utilize stealth, tact, and survival instincts to complete your missions.","reviewerName":"Michael J. Covino","summary":"Great! Just excellent!","reviewText":"Okay, now we're talking. I got the game 'Dead to Rights', 'Conspiracy', and 'Vice City', thinking that they would satisfy my need to finally be introduced to a game where the realism is unmatched. All those games failed to meet my expectations. In fact, Hitman 2, was everything those games were not.I never played Hitman 1, but from what I understand from Hitman 2, you were once a professional killer who has worked for many needy Employers. For some reason, you have decided that enough was enough, and found yourself sanction inside a Catholic Cathedral somewhere in Sicily, planning to live the rest of your days in penance. But your violent past finds it's way through the sanctity of the Church, and forces you not only to turn your back on God, but regret that you did. Personally, this had my name written all over of it. It applies to that saying: 'NECESSITY KNOWS NO LAW'.You get in contact with some sort of underground Agency, which apparently you have worked with before. This Agency obviously works for the American Government and all of America's Allies, and it sends you out to annihilate all sorts of Adversaries, from Terrorists to corrupt Military Generals. The work you do is obviously un-constitutional, but justifiable just the same. In turn you visit many different parts of the world - Japan, India, Iraq, Malaysia. That in itself deserves a shinning star.Now the real reason why this game is so great: there is no one way to complete a mission. In fact, each mission can be completed using any method your heart so desires. You can walk into a fancy-dancy ballroom where you got a guy on a piano in one corner, a group of men talking business in another, martinis being passed around, bright shinning suits and tuxedos, a waiter serving chcolate treats to everyone - the perfect enviriment to pull out an AK Machine gun from your coat and blast away until there's no one left screaming. Or...you can take a more stealthier approach: Glance at your portable computer, which gives a satellite projection of all persons in the house, which should show the whereabouts of your main target. Sneak around a bit, killing only the people that stand between you and your target, make the hit, and walk out undetected. I like this feature - kinda like a game of 'Catch the Flag'. There's usually a group of guards in every level. You can wait behind a bush until one strays too far from the other patrolmen, shoot him or strangle him from behind, drag his body and stash it where it won't be found, take his clothing and whatever weapon he might have on him, and walk pass enemy-lines DRESSED as the enemy. Tell me if that ain't cool.Another great aspect to the game is that it can be so wickedly cold, it's bound to just make you shake your head and say to yourself, 'I can't believe I just did that.' For instance, an innocent postman is on his way to make a delivery to a house where your target is stationed. On his way there, he stops to empty his bladder on a bush. So, as this poor bystander is 'RELIEVING' himself, you can sneak up from behind him, wrap that cord around your fist, and strangulate him to death, Just so you can obtain yourself a nifty postman outfit and earn a free ticket into the house of your target. Here's another example, this one taking place in Japan: you already made your way into your target's house, but you can't reach the third floor because of that locked door, and you know that little Japanese Geisha girl has the blasted key. Sneak into her room. Hide behind a sunframe. Wait for her to come in. Shoot her in the back of the head while she's in the process of polishing up on her makeup. Or (and this is the greatest) when you find yourself a nice fuse box. Oh, your target is in his hot-tub, having a great old time with his highly paid playboy look-alike wannabe whores. Break the circuit. Put on your nightvision goggles. And one by one.....Just like in Silence of the Lambs. Tell me if that won't excite you.The graphics are superb. The only set-back to this game is that you (your character) was cloned by the government or something, just so you'll never have a real identity and do what you were made to do. That's kinda silly if you ask me. A Hitman is someone you hire to kill your husband or to remove that guy who totally screwed up what could have been a highly rewarding drug deal. So, there's a minor drawback to the realism I so love to see in games, but Hitman 2 still has got to be one of the greatest games I have ever put money on. Most definitely not a rental.

Anyway, the story of the game is pretty basic, doesnt seem to major at first but it stays gripping untill the game is beat. A ship, a BIG ship with 6 sectors i believe have became infected with creatures and each sector has a different enviornment, this is where the suit and weapon upgrades come in. But wait, not just creatures. There is also a creature that mimics you, yes Samus but is much stronger and deadly. Its name is SA-X. X is the name of the infected parisites in the game. And the whole game is going from enviornment to enviornment to beat bosses and get upgrades to fight SA-X and save the ship. Now for the real review. The controls are quite simple and could be mastered for an average gamer. The grapics are you ordinary GBA and SNES graphics and same type of music. It is a side scrolling adventure/nonvionlent shooter game that people from all ages should love. Like all other Metroid games, it does take some brain to complete. Many puzzles to solve to figure out what to do next if the computer doesnt tell you. For GBA game the story is amazing and should keep you busy from a good 9-15 hours to beat. It is also compatable with the GameCube if you beat the story. Hook it up to your GameCube with Metroid Prime in and Whalla, you get to play the original Metroid off the NES right on the big screen from the GC.

While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction.

You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience.

If you did not, then you will in all likelihood loathe this game.However, if you're like me and enjoyed the stuffing out of the original, this is a very nice follow-up to it.  It isn't exactly a port, which disappointed me at first.  The battle system is almost exactly the same, but I was disconcerted by the fact that only certain species could use certain classes, not to mention the fact that I could no longer spend job points to buy skills (instead you have to have a weapon which teaches you the skill equipped until you've collected enough ability points to earn it).And then there is the Judge System.  Everyone I'd talked to who played this game before me warned me that it was probably going to be enough to chase me off as it had them.  At first, it was very off-putting, just like the other changes that had been made; however, like the rest, as I played the game, I soon came to like (maybe even love in a few cases) the judges.  It added an extra spice to the game play and even saved my bacon in one boss fight (I had gotten my rear handed to me because this boss constantly cast charm, so I waited for a day where charm was illegal and the boss no longer used it).The story at times seems very simple and maybe a little \"kiddified,\" but I really have no problem with that.  It didn't stop me from enjoying Kingdom Hearts, and it doesn't stop me from enjoying this game, either.Anyway, I highly reccomend this to basically any fan of FFT. :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"Sir Edmund Hillary \"Tenzing Norgay\"","summary":"The Most Over-Hyped Game for Teenagers - EVER","reviewText":"I say this game is for kids 18 and under because you have to be one of those kids in order to compete on line with some success. It's the same nonsense as Halo 2. If you are 30 years or older with a life other than playing Halo 2 or Gears of War 10 hours a day after school, then this game is not for you. I have yet to play with anyone who sounded like they were out of high school yet. Therefore, as the old man that I am, I enter these live matches immediately dying from kids who have spent 100s of hours memorizing the maps and perfecting headshots. It's a completely different experience like say, entering a racing game (i,e.-PGR2) where you can be a \"noob\" and still have some fun.As far as the single player mode - one of the most OVERHYPED and OVERATED games ever. I respect what EPIC is doing and their UNREAL engine is phenomenal. No one can question that this may be the most graphically intense game for any console to date. However, that and great sound quality are the only things the game has going for it. Here are all the cons:* Save-points are a joke. I can't believe in today's day and age you can't save at any point. Elder Scrolls IV, though a totally different type of game, allows you to save at any point so you are not doing the same thing over 40 times until you get it right. To boot, I haven't found a way to skip the cut scenes. Inexcusable!* Levels of difficulty are poorly designed. You can either play IQ-50-easy to ridiculously hard. Therefore, accessibility is limited to the hardcore player (ironically most 12 to 18 year olds). If you are a casual player, forget it. Although, there is actually a \"Casual\" mode which my 4 year old can play. There is no \"in-between\" for normal adults who have some skill and a life outside of video games.* Controls are clunky at best and have a huge learning curve. The A button is used for everything from jumping, running, and wall cover/sticking. Therefore, if you are running from an ememy in the single player or a 12 year old on-line and you run by a wall, you can kiss it goodbye. You inadvertently stick to the wall and get blown away by said 12 year old who is more than happy to also stomp on your head for additional humor. Also, the camera view when running (a.k.a. -  roadie view) makes it very hard to see where you are actually going. Yeah, that's real fun.I like the third person over the shoulder view that was stolen from Resident Evil 4. However, for the single player mode, this game is falls way short of the greatness of RE4 in ever single aspect, save the graphics.Bottom line -If you are still in high school and don't have a girlfriend/boyfriend and have no ambitions besides living at home with your parents for the rest of your life, then this game is for you. All others save your money for much better XBOX 360 titles.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2007"}

While playing many differing games, the characters do not always do what I command them to do. At times, the characters do not even respond to controller input. For example, when I play Assassin's Creed there are times when Altair simply does whatever he feels like doing. He will take off and run...and keep on running with no input from me. Other times, he (and characters of other games) will not respond to button presses or stick commands at all. I use the Nyko charging base that charges four controllers at once, so I keep all of my controllers fully charged.I wanted to use the phrase \"Has Minor Issue\" as my title BUT it does not feel like a minor issue when you are in the middle of the fight of your life and your controller commands leave your character motionless, or cause them to move/jump/strike the incorrect direction. Or your character just takes off for a little romp around the park without any command from you to do so. This has happened with COD 4, RFOM, Rachet & Clank:TOD, Assassin's Creed, URT III, Folklore, Uncharted: Drakes Fortune, Elder Scrolls: The Oblivion...and others.With this many games affected, I have to believe it is the controller technology, and not the games themselves, causing this phenomenon.My only past controller experience has been a wireless Logitch controller for my Computer (Wingman). This controller was the cat's meow, and I never had issues as mentioned above with literally 100 plus different title PC games.I think it is possible that the bluetooth technology is just not quite there yet(?) However, I am not an expert by any means.Other than the aforementioned, I have had wonderful gaming experiences since crossing over to the dark side (gaming consoles) *snicker*Just a quick side note, once retailers are done playing the game of \"supply and demand\" artificially jacking up the cost for the XBox 360 Elite system, that will be my next purchase. 120 GB hard drive...WOW!

Symphony of the Night and Curse of Darkness have been my favorite of the series so far. This game comes close. While not in the timeline of the series, this game is a reboot.Story: Set during what was called \"end of days\" in the year 1047 in Europe, a group called the Brotherhood of Light (Holy Knights) seek to find the reason why the souls of the dead are not leaving. Gabriel Belmont's (voiced by Stargate: Universe's Robert Carlyle) wife, Maria is murdered and he seeks to find the God Mask in order to resurrect her. Guided by the oldest member of the Brotherhood, Zobek (voiced by Star Trek: NG's Sir Patrick Stewart), Gabriel must hunt down the lords of shadow to get each piece. Zobek also narrates each chapter's heading.Gameplay: 3rd-person action/adventure game. Your weapon is a retractable chain whip called the Combat Cross. You can perform tons of combos with your whip. Secondary weapons include daggers, holy water, etc. that can also be upgraded. Magic is used in the game in the form of light magic and dark magic and can be combined with your weapons for special moves. You receive a completion percentage after each mission. Each mission has gems that you can collect to upgrade your health, and both light and dark magic. You also have a certain challenge on each level that may be timed, defeat a certain number of enemies, etc. If you find all the gems on a level and complete the challenge, you just have to complete the level on the hardest difficulty in order to get 100%. Each chapter has a boss battle that is both challenging and fun. Some of the enemies include werewolves, vampires, trolls, spiders, and goblins.Conclusion: The controls are not that complicated though some combos can be harder to perform. Graphics are amazing. I bought the PS3 version for the 1 disc option over the Xbox 360. The game is fun and some of the levels are very challenging. There are puzzles in the game that break up the action and you can choose to skip it if you want but I wanted to complete the game in full, so I did not skip any. You will not be disappointed with this game. It is very good and worth picking up on either system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2011"}

Players can even customize their own hero or villain and upgrade them with an in-depth skill tree system that will increase their special abilities.","reviewerName":"P. Hardy","summary":"A pleasent change to EA's LOTR gaming franchise","reviewText":"Most people have been complaining about the once-current LOTR video Game \"The third age\" by EA Games, stating that they couldn't care less about the original characters, they're background stories, plots or even their development character-wise. Just because you could not play the usual Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Gandalf and the hobbits (and maybe Faramir) Characters.While I will agree that my curiosity makes me wonder what the Game itself would've been like had these characters been in the drivers seat, but the truth of the matter is: I was right and tired of playing with the Fellowship Hero's after the release of EA's \"Return of the King,\" a much needed improvement over their \"Two Towers,\" video game and \"Battle for middle earth.\" So with that said, I have to disagree with everybody else when they say this game is bad (yes, its a marketing scheme in which to find out who would buy it, but what game or anything else for that matter isn't?). The third age is an excellent RPG Game for first timers, with a much better storyline than Final Fantasy could even conjure (suck it fanboys/girls, I shall not back down).There are over several levels divided into several storylines in the Game: A forest type landscape (I forget the name), The mines of Moria, Rohan / Edoras, Helm's Deep, and lastly Minas Tirith / Pelennor Fields. All of witch are beautifully designed and true to the movie locals in ever detail you can imagine. You can practically roam anywhere in theses levels, I know, because I tend to get lost (that map was much help until my brother helped me out with it) and enemies pop out of nowhere giving you a right good scare most of the time, but around next several hundred jumps and surprises it gets old and isn't impressive any longer. Small Note:  Helm's Deep is still the hardest level since \"The Two Towers.\"The basic Plot is this: You start off with a narrative voiced by Ian McKellen(?) - Gandalf the Grey/White explaining the third age before being introduced to Berethor; a soldier of Gondor in search for Boromir and the Fellowship supposedly having come from Rivendell on his way to Moria. He is attacked by several Ring Wraiths [Nazgul] and is defeated & about to meet his doom before the second character, Idiral appears and saves his life (and ultimately forcing the Nazgul away) with her Elven magic. From there your two characters journey across the forest landscape until you reach a snowy mountainous area where you then are introduced to Elegost, a Ranger hunting a pack of Wargs and searching for his Dwarven partner, Hadhod, a grouching Gimli-type character. These four characters travel through Moria and meet up with the guest character Gandalf who battle against the Barlog of Morgor. The last two characters you'll meet on the plains of Rohan; the shield maiden Morwen & Eaoden a rider of Rohan, being a part of the Rohirrim. These character's ultimate goal is to aid Middle Earth and the fellowship in its time of need (the background story for Berethor is especially interesting).The RPG elements of the game are fast pace and easy to understand and vary from Taunt, Special Abilities, Summons, Items, and Perfect Mode (Which has to be the coolest thing in the game aside from CO-OP mode). You can Level up your characters given the strength or number of times you've used them. They are equipped with different clothing, armor, swords, helmets, shields that really don't protect them if not beef up their armor value as the game progresses, and my all time favorite: New abilities and special items to use against your enemies.The boss battles (set on any difficulty) are tough and aren't as easy to overcome as everyone's has been stating. It takes some actual patience, time, and careful strategy to defeat these (The Balrog, Grimma Wormtongue, The Witch King, The Orc Captain in RTOK, and Suaron himself) bosses and its good payoff at the end. The enemies (Goblins, Orcs, Wargs, Uruk-Hai, Trolls, Ring Wraiths, among other things) are as equally tough in challenge, however, their easy to overcome despite the fact that they're abilities range from, Swordfighting, magic spells, spear attacks, etc.. Sometimes it'll usually take more than one hit to kill most of the enemies (mainly Wargs, Trolls, Nazgul, and Uruk-Hai. Goblins and Orcs are easy pickings).Lastly The Graphics for the Cut Scenes in the game are simply beautiful, especially in the Elven forests and Gondor, the character models are nicely done, and the voice acting is the best I've heard since Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia. I'll admit this game has it lagging points and hiccups but this does nothing to put a damper in my enjoyment of this game. [a 5 out of 5]","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2005"}

I really like many of the story-driven missions, many of which or unique, novel experiences.  The open world aspects lets you do so much.  The developer litters the world with tons of side missions, collectables or challenges, and other stuff you really don't have to do, but if you are a completionist you might find yourself trying to complete a number of boring things.  There is so much to do and the game seems so long to me that I quit half way through to play something else for a few months and then returned to continue.  In my opinion they could have split the game into smaller pieces.  But thats what has always been great about GTA, it offers so much value since there is so much to it.  I have to overlook boring and optional aspects that are less fun and focus on how much is great that is far above and beyond what could have been included.You have \"friends\" and girlfriends in the game that call you on your cell phone.  They bug you all the time to do stuff.  The problem is the stuff they want to do is pretty boring, involves stopping what you are doing and driving to pick them up, doing something boring with them, dropping them off, etc.  It is fun at first, but then seem tedious.  There are advantages to making them happy with you because you get bonuses, but gets pretty boring.  I ended just ignoring them all together towards the end.The other thing is it takes a long time to get from one side of the world to another.  But there are taxis you can hail and jump to the destination pretty easily.  It just feels like you are missing out or cheating by skipping driving through the open world to get there.There are tons of reviews, so I don't really need to say more.  It is a stellar value, a great game, has boring aspects that you can mostly skip if you can get past feeling like you are missing out if you don't do them, and I still can't knock it below a 5 star review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2009"}

I am a big fan of survival horror and didn't buy it b/c there is simply too many other games that will occupy me plus survival horror games I usually don't play through twice.  I did see there was a formula to the scares and in time it became predictable and I knew when something was about to jump out at me but that dint rob me of enjoying it.  I was playing with my wife and she would jump at the scary moments but it didn't bother me.  The biggest reason I never had too much fear was b/c you have an awesome arsenal of weapons that I simply loved.  I had a few moments when I would be walking down a corridor or about to pick something up when all of a sudden there was a \"what the heck is that sound \" or \"what the heck was that\" coming out of my mouth.  This game didn't really scare me like I hoped it would which could be due to the arsenal of weapons at my disposal.  I wanted this game to make me check the back seat of my car before I get in to make sure something wasn't gonna chomp on my face but this game really didn't do that for me.  The graphics I think by the way are fantastic. A strange thing to happen is  when a corpse is on the ground and you kick its head or body down the corridor as you're walking kinda weird but doesn't take anything away from the game play.  Even with all that I still really enjoyed this game and odds are if you love survival horror like some of us do you will enjoy it as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

I loved the original GTA and played it constantly, and since GTA 3 came out I've heard nothing but all the hype about it, so when I finally played it, I decided I would get a PS2.  Everything you've heard about this game is true, and then some.  The graphics are mouth watering and the frame rate is smooth considering all the on screen action and the size of Liberty City.

A year has passed and why do I all of the sudden like something so similar to something I hated initially? First the game -An RPG where your class doesn't really matter, mostly it establishes a base \"look\" and gives you some extra class based perks. You can level and do what you want (kind of - there are some KEY items you really need to get started with). The graphics are A+ - really good, atmospheric and moody. The controls are precise, like a Nintendo platformer, the controls do what you ask them to (I'm not sure why it makes me think of the original Metroid - maybe it was angled jumping and mid air bomb laying...anywho) - the controls are one of the few things in the game you don't fight with and that's a great thing.It is really a trial and error game, again, like old school Nintendo (remember walking into the first room with Egg Plant wizard in Kid Icarus or random wall bombing in Zelda...anywho). I will argue that deaths CANNOT be avoided. There absolutely are cheap deaths, and that was something I wasn't prepared for Demons Souls (most reviews said that deaths were all fair - I still call BS on that). That said, it's not impossible.Why not 5 stars - because Dark Souls absolutely crosses the line between frustrating and challenging. I play games to chill out and there are times that you will have to put down (or throw at the wall) your controller and come back later. In regards to the online portion. Some argue the intent of the developer is for it not to be a multiplayer co-op, so just deal. At the same time, the community around this game is generally cool (far fewer racial epithet spewing 12yr olds screaming CAMPER into the mic) and I'd like to have an easier time joining with friends that are battling through the same things I am. So it's not perfect in my opinion.Obviously I haven't beat the game or seen all it has to offer, but I have played enough to know a great game when I see it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2011"}

I tried to keep it as vague as possible while conveying disappointment with the ending*********************I can't see giving this game lower than 3 stars because it was just so incredible. Bioware stepped up their game and the SP and MP are both second to none. The voice acting and story telling is even better than the previous two games IMO. I was on the edge of my seat for the whole game, but then.....I don't want to give anything away, but there were some major glitches in the last parts of the game that caused me to have to restart my system and play missions again. This may have been somewhat unique to my gameplay, but it was unacceptable and took away from the story for me. They weren't just little glitches that can be forgiven, but major ones that impacted my gameplay. i.e. You get to make a choice at the end of the game for the ending you want and I didn't know which was which. I walked up to one and then it was glitched and I couldn't walk away from it, so I was forced to choose the ending that I didn't want.As far as the ending, I actually thought it was kind of cool. I was hoping for something a little less dark, but I guess I expected that it would have to be a little bleak if humanity was going to stop something that had been going on for billions of years. My issue is that they didn't explain enough, and the different endings were too similar. I made a lot of major decisions in all three games that didn't seem to matter in the end; I watched all the endings and there wasn't much difference between them. I did everything right and got my forces up to full strength, but it doesn't really feel like it matters. I would have liked to have seen about a 30 minutes cutscene at the end that rapped everything up, but they didn't deliver. 4 years of my life ends in a way that was somewhat unsatisfying. Again, I like the concept of the ending, but they could have explained more and showed the aftermath of your decisions. I would have liked to have seen bigger differences in the ending choices and the decisions you had made. They could have given me a video that showed how everyone was doing in the new world and what the consequences of the choices were. It feels like they just ran out of time or money at the end and chose not to pursue a more in depth ending sequence. I've come to expect the highest quality from Bioware; they delivered up until the very end.I would still highly recommend this game though. I can't think of any other games that rival the depth and emotion of this game. I would pay a lot more than 60 bucks for games if other companies could deliver like this.Please come out with a 20 or 30 minutes DLC video that explains everything for me Bioware. I'll pay you 10 bucks. ThanksIf they release something that improves on the ending, I'll change my rating to 5 stars.*****************************************************************************************************UPDATE: Extended cut offers pretty much what I was hoping for in an ending; the ending that was already great but just didn't provide closure or answer questions, now gave me what I wanted. Thanks for fixing the ending and making a great game worthy of 5 stars Bioware. I've changed my rating to 5 now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"D.N.","summary":"Just short of being a Great Videogame","reviewText":"While I had a great time with this game, it seemed to end much sooner than I had expected, I guess I'd assumed it was something more epic. Moving through doors soooooooo S L O W L Y can be beyond tiresome and you'll want to stop playing, I hoped they finally fixed that for the GC version, but no. Add to that the backtracking. LISTEN, loading, searching, mazes, many enemies, lack of items/storage space and backtracking DO NOT GO TOGETHER! The mansion environment is gorgeous and the backgrounds help the mood so much. The character models...look bad, just weak graphically, too beautiful -- if there was a solumn, creepy old man with dark eyes, instead of a cool, relaxed dude with sunglasses, it would have helped the mood a lot. I actually, would love to play the game as an older man who may have lived there for some years (as long as he doesn't need a cane!). No, it's not 'scary', but it has mood and tension, enjoyable, while sometimes tedious difficulty. I wish there was the option, to have the zombies appear in different, unexpected places each time you play the game, to keep things fresh and new, or to have the Mansion rooms rearranged, with items in new places. Some Special Modes are difficult to earn in enough time - and it takes 5 hours minimum just to try. I wish there were better Special Modes that were a little more forgiving to earn. The ending is a unsatisfactory, things are left completely unanswered, CAPCOM must tie up all the sub-plots cohesively (and interestingly) in the next game or people just won't care anymore. I realized after finishing that this formula could continue forever, you'd feel you'd gotten nowhere and the gamemakers must consider the plot irrelevant (and that could have been a huge selling-point for the game). The gameplay becomes a little mathematical and dry towards the end. Getting keys and doing unlikely puzzles is the nature of it, and you are often lost in a maze. The puzzles should be more sensical. I don't need online in the next game, possibly multiplayer, a change from pre-rendered backgrounds would be nice (which was done in RE: Code Veronica) but only to ditch the door loading if they can make graphics like the backgrounds look (Silent Hill 2 was able to put a lot of detail into the bathrooms so the game shouldn't have to look as cutesy as CV did). I wonder where the next RE should take place -- maybe outside, in the city environment. There's a lot of fun here, worth buying, but you must enjoy it on it's own narrow terms.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2002"}

The story follows Vincent Valentine as he gets drawn into a mystery filled with surprise attacks and the disappearance of whole cities that occurs a short while after the events of Advent Children. It is full of references to (and characters from) FF VII, and many mysteries about Jenova and Omega will be revealed. Vincent's task is to discover something important about who he is and, of course, save Midgard's world.I bought this because, well, I'm a Final Fantasy geek. Even though I'm not a third person shooter geek. There are only a few such games on my shelves - Jak, Prince of Persia, Bloodrayne, etc., - games that got a lot of critical notice. So take my opinions with a grain of salt.The story is interesting and the artwork good. Gameplay isn't particularly complex - you build weapons as you gain cash and, for the most part you point and you shoot. You can also use physical combat and dodge and run, but again, don't expect any complicated moves. For some reason the game's play reminded me a lot of Castlevania. That isn't bad, but it's lacking in terms of the state of the art that I expect from the Final Fantasy series. It just doesn't really push the envelope.My third person skills are pretty rudimentary, but it only took me about 10 hours to run the game the first time through. There a about a billion little side quests you can also play, plus all kinds of goodies you can unlock, but this is definitely a less than 20 hour experience, which means that you are spending a lot for a small game with limited variability.

{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"","summary":"A Mixed Blessing","reviewText":"Halo 4 does a lot of things right to correct the fatal flaws from Halo: Reach.  However, some of the additional features violate the core experience that has always been central to Halo multiplayer gameplay.  This review will highlight changes in multiplayer - War Games mode.Halo: Reach suffered a major misstep by introducing armor abilities.  Thankfully the two most problematic abilities from Reach are corrected in Halo 4 - the jet pack's flight time is significantly reduced and players can no longer become temporarily invincible.  Unfortunately, Halo 4 not only retains sprint, but makes it available at all times to every player, even going so far as to give the option (through custom loadouts) to have unlimited sprinting.The Halo series has always emphasized a level playing field, where skill matters more than luck with strategy and teamwork being as integral as coordination and reflexes.  Halo 4 eschews the concept of a level playing field by offering loadouts that increase in power as a player earns points by playing Halo 4.  By allowing players to start each life in a multiplayer match equipped with a sniper rifle and other items unavailable to players who have invested less time playing Halo 4, the game compromises its integrity.  Halo 4 also introduces a feature where after several kills a player is able to call down a supply drop featuring a power weapon, grenades or an enhancement like overshield.  Many matches become saturated with power weapons, whereas in Halo 2 and Halo 3, players were forced to fight over the few power weapons and this added an important strategic element to gameplay.Multiplayer combat in Halo 4 is fast paced and chaotic compared to Halo 2 and Halo 3, which I much prefer.  Certainly as you become more experienced playing Halo 4, the chaos will become more manageable and orderly and the pace will seem to slow.  However, I feel that the way sprinting is implemented combined with instantaneous respawning pose a big problem.  When a player successfully wins a combat encounter vs. another player, their team should gain a temporary advantage by being a man up and also, the losing player should not be able to re-engage while the winner is still recovering ammo and shields.Another change I dislike in Halo 4 is the new scoring system.  While I love assists, distractions and other contributions counting towards something tangible, it seems that deaths make little to no impact on scoring.  Certainly a player with 8 kills and 4 assists but 12 deaths does not deserve a better score than a player with 6/4/4.  Also, I miss the ranking system from Halo 3, where your rank could go up or down and represented your skill.  Now your rank mostly measures how much time you spend playing halo and is only minorly affected by how well you play - worse yet, commercial promotions currently offer double xp.Despite the flaws introduced in Halo 4, I think that it improves the multiplayer experience from Halo: Reach, which made me stop playing Halo altogether for the first time since I picked up Halo 2.  My gold xbox live subscription had lapsed long ago by the time Halo 4 came out.  Halo 4 is not Halo 2 nor Halo 3 and I can live with that.  While I am disappointed by some of the strategy and skill defeating features, Halo 4 offers enough entertainment and satisfaction to justify a new gold subscription.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2012"}

Our entire family - 6-year-old to 10-year-old to grown adult - enjoys the gameplay.  The controls and play are intuitive enough for younger kids and there is replayability for all ages via the chance to attempt levels repeatedly using different characters with unique attributes. The multiplayer mode also encourages teamwork in a way that doesn't hamper the fun even if the players have different skill levels.  This makes it a great collaboration game for kids of different ages (such as two brothers who usually fight over just about everything!).Those already familiar with the Rayman series may not find much new here except for the mutiplayer mode and some serious refinement of the overall presentation, but the nostalgia factor alone makes it recommended for them.  Those new to the series won't be left behind since the learning curve isn't very steep as well.  This is a highly-recommended side-scroller for kids and adults alike.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2013"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission. Train and equip your team to survive insurmountable odds.Explore the Galaxy- Scan planets to uncover unique secret missions in theMass Effectuniverse.Integration with OriginalMass Effect- Players of the firstMass Effectcan import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

The combat system works better then it did in the first game and is still a blast to play while keeping it a more realistic gameplay experience (over then lets say a turn based RPG). While the combat system still has a few hiccups (its still not as flawless as lets say Gears of War 2's combat) it works well enough not to be a concern and feels like a great aspect to this title.- A well thought out and well played story that rivals or bests that of games like Grand Theft Auto, Fallout or any Final Fantasy game for that matter. Much like the first game the story is it told through dialog (which you control the direction of) between you and other characters and because of the choices of make during the story it has a \"choose your own adventure\" feel to it. Much like other known Bioware games like Dragon Age or even Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.- Gorgeous graphics and effects that rival that of any action game like that of Assassins Creed 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 or Bayonetta.- Much like the first title this one still has a great sound track that still has that movie like quality of the great Sci-Fi Space movies from the past like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, & Dune.- You can port over your character from the first Mass Effect and all your story choices will carry over as well or your can start an entirely new character if you like.BAD:- The Mining mini-game is slow and tedious but necessary to unlock better weapons and upgrades. Now the way the Mining mini-game works is by scanning a planets for elements and shooting a probe in the area of a planet that has needed recourses.- This game still has a more then a few loading sequences during gameplay that might upset impatient gamers. It should be noted that installing the game (both discs) to your Xbox 360 harddrive (if you have room) will make the loading a bit faster.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- The story of the game is mostly told through dialogs between yourself and other characters in the game, it should really be noted that your choices in responding to questions asked of you and your reactions to events unfolding around you is going to change the story of the game overall and attitudes of others around you as well. It should also be noted that during the games story you can make choices that either make your character into a brash loose cannon who cheats, steals and shoots first asks questions later or a by the book fighter for justice and freedom with good moral values and willingness to sacrifice personal wants for the good of others.- Much like the first game, you travel to many different worlds/solar systems through out the Milky Way galaxy (the galaxy we all currently live in, in real life) with your own star ship the Normandy and its crew. During your missions you get to bring two of the total eleven other characters with you and these other characters (all eleven of them) have their stats as well as weapons be chosen by you.- A Sci-Fi RPG with lots of Third Person Shooter (Camera behind the player) elements. The games combat has much quicker pacing then most other RPGs like that of Demon Souls on PS3 or Fallout 3. And now the over all combat has been sped up a bit more then in the first game and the controls have been improved more well this makes Mass Effect 2's combat gameplay very much like that of other main stream First/Third Person Shooters like Halo ODST or and Gears of War 2.- Like the first game and like in many other \"western made RPGs\" (made in America/Europe/Canada and oppose to eastern made RPGs like Final Fantasy of Japan) like Dragon Age, Oblivion, or Fallout 3 this game has lots of dialog and story, which plays a very big role in game and setting the tone. This will turn will turn off those gamers looking for fast paced action title with little interruption like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.- No inventory or way to equip your allies with new armor. The long-standing inventory system you might see in a game like Resident Evil 5 or the first Mass Effect was removed completely in favor for something similar to something like an action game you get only one copy of each gun and armor (and you can not sell them), now you can buy upgrades for them as well as get new guns (but once you have them you can not sell those as well). The over all effect is something like a combination of a weapons cache of a FPS like Half-Life 2 (getting guns you cannot sell or lose) and an RPG since you can upgrade these weapons. Now this is streamlining was done for most non-RPG gameplayers, but the choice is a little disturbing to hardcore RPG-players.- A new addition to the combat in Mass Effect 2 is of all things, ammo. This may sound odd to anyone who has not played the first Mass Effect since that game's weapons never needed ammo and could only over heat. The ammo system in Mass Effect 2 work feels very much like any other First/Third Person Shooters like Halo 3.- Still no multiplayer or online gameplay.GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Mass Effect (360/PC)- Fallout 3 (360/PS3/PC)- Gears of War 2 (360/PC)- Borderlands(360/PS3/PC)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- You do not need to beat the first Mass Effect to play or beat this title. But, doing so will give you a better understanding of Mass Effect 2's story overall and if you port over a character from the first Mass Effect you'll get more dialog options as well as a boon of in-game cash. Also the first Mass Effect was a great game to that should not be missed.- In the limited collectors edition of Mass Effect 2 you will find a Cerberus Network pass code (more on this below) art book, the first issue to the limited run four issue Mass Effect comic (called Mass Effect: Redemption) as well as a bonus a DVD with a making of Mass Effect 2 video DVD also has PC wallpapers (of the Mass Effect 2 locations and new characters). The collectors edition also has a code to download from EA/Bioware home website a set new armor and rifle for the game (it's based on the new emeny you meet in the game and looks pretty cool) and this it all comes in a tin as well as paper case.- Check out the Mass Effect novels called Mass Effect: Revelation and Mass Effect: Ascension these books have a great deal of background story for the two games.- The Cerberus Network download that will enable future downloads for Mass Effect 2 via EA's and Bioware websites. The Cerberus Network download is about $15 on Xbox Live and free if you buy the limited collectors edition of Mass Effect 2. Bioware said that all Mass Effect 2 downloads will come via Cerberus Network and most will even be free.- There is already free downloadable content for Mass Effect 2 (a new Shotgun and new Armor) and lots more on the way. It should be noted you'll first need the Cerberus Network download to access this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2010"}

Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done.

Players may now play and carry out missions with in the setting of palm tree lined streets bustling with traffic, bikini babes, and pastel-color suits around every corner.","reviewerName":"Maria Marienthal","summary":"A positively fun time","reviewText":"Not too bad for a Scarface parody either....Anywho, I'll start off this review like I started off the one for GTA3.  GTA Vice is extremely violent.  It is rated M for Mature.  MATURE!  That means that you should not let your 13 year-old kid play this.The next section is food for thought in terms of parents and game selection.  If you aren't getting this for a kid under 17, just don't worry about this.I've been giving this a lot of thought, and it seems as though parents are letting their ignorance allow their kids to be exposed to these things.  First off, it is Rockstar Games' right to free speech to enable Tommy Vercetti (the main character) to blow the bejesus out of anyone and everything with a rocket launcher.  It is also an organization's right to free speech to say whatever hateful, bigoted dialogue that they want to, wherever they want to.  Now, cultured and decent parents make an effort to keep their kids from hearing these hateful messages, so why don't parents make an effort to keep their kids from hearing Rockstar Games' message of sex, violence, and destruction?  Because it comes in the formatat of a videogame?  Technonolgy for the young?  I think that philosophy is a load of garbage.  Parents, honestly.  If you really care to protect your kids from violent messages, you will go the distance to research the games that they are talking about.  GRAND THEFT AUTO.  Listen to the title.  The title of the game is a crime.  Doesn't that spark your interest?Ok, the review.  This game, like its predicessor GTA3, was very violent, but at the same time it still executed a decent storyline and had plenty of variation with weapons and wheels.  You can get motorcycles in this game which is really cool, and the unique vehicles selection is much greater and much more accessable.  Boats are very easy to get along with choppers.I have to protest the story since it does parody Scarface.  But Scarface was a tragedy, unlike this story that had a very happy ending.  Yet, at the same time I must give it some brownie points, since unlike with GTA3, there is some sense of accmoplishment that comes with the end of the story.  Vice City is yours.  This was a very very bipolar game.Graphically i was very unimpressed.  It looked a lot better than GTA3, but this is the PS2 we're talking about here.  Vice City is a second generation game and should have had much better graphics.  The setting was certainly nice and bright, however a little graphical effort would have greatly enhanced the spirit of the game.Tommy Vercetti wasn't nearly as cool as Alex.But why am I comparing the two games so much?  Vice City was unique in its own right.  It got 5 stars for a reason.  It was a really good game.  The targeting system was flawed, however there were some great improvements.  The driving is SOOOOOOOO SMOOOOOOOOTH.  Like butter.  It's almost scandalous.  And the environments are so much less claustrophobic than the previous games.  It makes sense though since Vice City is a joyous beach scene.  I'm comparing again...Anyway, the revamped gameplay that is Grand Theft Auto was very well represented in this great rendition.  This game does desrve 5 stars for the simple reason that it is fun.  The free-roaming nature of the game that is GTA is certainly in no way played out.  Ok, last comparison.  If GTA3 was Freaky Good, then Vice City qualifies as a slightly less Super Good.  Both ratings get 5 stars.  Vice City was very good, and if you liked GTA3, you will probably like this game too.  I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who will say they like Vice City more than GTA3, but this is just a matter of preference.  The differences were suttle, but the game is still very great.Keep in mind, this game is violent.  But it's a good time.  Kids shouldn't play it, but if you are of age, it will be well worth the many hours of game play.5 StarsHappy gaming!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0044SA70M","description":"","reviewerName":"Call me KID","summary":"I really like it","reviewText":"I didn't think I would like this game as much as I do but it's really good.  The map has a little indicator to keep you going in the right direction for missions or tasks which is great you don't wander aimlessly.  The fight scenes are really good, with special powers like lightning bolt, 2ndary weapon bow, primary weapon dagger, and a little mortal kombat move that shoots a rope that pulls enemies toward me unless they are big then pulls me to them, and all these moves are very fluent.  You can always click to potions which stops battle while you gear up more with better weapons for that fight potions and armors for that specific fight.  You can hold 70 items which seems like a good amount.  Collect hers, make weapons, level up to add to skills, sometimes you've got a ai companions and sometimes not, dieing blows so save regularly, so as not to have to go back to far.  There's even fast travel just pick a fast travel point (valid points) and zoom so once you get there your done not fifty trips of hiking back and forth.  It says socketed on some of my items but haven't figured out how to use that yet, came with no instruction book.  Good game, some of the options don't work right, can't turn off subtitles, the gamma doe's nothing when moved up or down, stuff like that.  I sit in front of my tv on the floor the be able to read all the small print, you think these companies would make the damn print bigger, but the don't in raw it's like tiny, unreadable from any realistic distance, so beware of that one.  Back to this, so far one quest one register for me so the person just lie's on the ground squirming and her friend says help her and I have nothing on my quests screen to make it easy so  I have no idea where to get what she needs.  But that's the only one.  The bulls are funny they will ram ya, potions are cool, wish I had more repair kits, I just had to spend three hundred to fix my items so they didn't break 25 % of three days worth of gameplay.  So if your looking for a fun run around game you can play just a few hours or so a day then this might be it.  Borderland is pretty good too just beware if buying used game of year addition some don't come with both discs like advertisement says it's dl content and used up, what a rip.  Plus always check your discs for little cracks in the clear part of the spindle, they will get worse till disc is no good, happened to me this week with borderlands and it's a headache to do amazon returns without a printer and no return ship label, but vendor has been very helpful with mailings, ok RECK ON get it just missing ING.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00020LZBG","description":"The third installment of the Ratchet & Clank franchise incorporates new elements of gameplay not seen previously in the series, including online and offline multiplayer capabilities that will appeal to a wide variety of players.Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenalreturns gamers to Planet Veldin, the setting of the originalRatchet & Clank, where the duo set off on a gripping new adventure through a multitude of diverse planets to fight for galactic peace. Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Crono \"Mega RPG gamer\"","summary":"Best entry in the Ratchet and Clank series.","reviewText":"Ratchet and Clank has been a mainstay of the Playstation 2 lineup, and the series just keeps getting better. The latest installment, Up Your Arsenal, is the best and is major fun.Graphically, the game has really progressed. It looks absolutely spectacular and the entire game feels very polished. Similarly, the music and sound effects remain top notch. The framerate is always smooth, and I've never experienced any slowdown, even when there are tons of explosions on screen at once.Gameplay wise, the series hasn't changed a lot, but it's excellent. There is still the single player filled to the brim with Ratchet and Clank humor and a fun if predictable storyline. Not to mention that Captain Qwark is back! The single player is about as long as Going Commando, but it's much better because of new environments, more polish, better weapons and challenges and some nice little 2D side-scrolling in between. They've even gotten rid of those frusturating space fighting scenes and mandatory races. Overall, the single player is great.Where the game really shines is in multiplayer. There are 3 multiplayer modes, capture the flag, siege, and deathmatch. The best is by far siege, where teams work together to destroy the other teams base using vehicles, weaponry and by capturing nodes located throughout the map. The maps aren't huge, but they are very well desgined for each of the modes. I only wish they had included more vehicles since the game only has 2 currently, and isn't completely suited for them like in say, Halo 2. The multiplayer can be played splitscreen or online. The splitscreen really pales compared to online play though. Part of the screen shows the nodes that are captured, and so you're limited to only about 40% of the screen, and it's considerably harder to play that way. Full screen online play is much more robust and allows for up to 8 players per match while standard PS2 allows for only 2 without a multitap. Online Play is virtually lag free, and you can find plenty of games. Plus it's free, and it really provides an excellent online experience considering the PS2's overall lack of quality online games (besides SOCOM and this game that is) I highly recommend getting a USB headset, because it's impossible to coordinate with teammates without it, and I've even gotten kicked out of games for not having it. Be warned, the game requires Broadband to play online (as in DSL or a Cable Connection.)Overall, Up Your Arsenal is great. It looks great and plays great whether in single or multiplayer (but avoid the splitscreen if you can.) Should you purchase it? If you have a broadband connection and maybe a headset, and can play online, then I'd wholeheartedly recommend it. But if you don't and are only in it for single player, then I would recommend renting it unless it drops down to $20. Splitscreen multiplayer is only fun for so long, and some might not be able to stomach it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2005"}

Is the Xbox one better than the 360 in terms of graphics?  Yes.  Is it noticeable when playing the games?  Not really, unless you are looking at it side by side with a 360, which I don't think many people do.If you are a hard-core gamer or someone just that feels the need to have the best of the best in terms of latest technology, then this is probably for you. However, if you have a 360 already....you are paying a lot of money for what is, to me, a slight upgrade (that once the movement and motion of the games start and you are getting into it, you might not even notice).If you don't have any console yet, you are better off buying an Xbox 360 for close to half the price of this (maybe a quarter the price if you get a used on in great shape), not to mention for the 360, there are hundreds of great games already under $20.We had an xbox one and sold it pretty quickly. It wasn't bad, but as I said, not a huge upgrade.  Our gaming strategy going forward is going to be to keep out 360 for a few years...and maybe later this year or early next year get a mid to high end gaming pc to hook up to our TV.

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"Fish Hunter \"Eddie\"","summary":"One thing to add to the other comments","reviewText":"This game will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck!

The game is enormous and I'm sure there are many side games that I haven't even begun to touch; this really is just about first impressions.First of all the mutch hyped graphics/resolution...whatever. The game looks good. I find the A+ titles on PS3 and X360 titles to be very close to PS4 graphics. Infamous SS looked better in my opinion, but both are still very good. BF4's single player smokes this, but it has a lot less going on, so maybe not apples to apples. I certainly wouldn't purchase a PS4 for the visuals in Watch Dogs, but it still looks very good, espcially for a an open world game. I would say it seems to my eyes, very similiar to Assassin's Creed on PS4.WD is also very playable. The controls in these games are getting to be consistantly smooth. Again, like Infamous, you typically aren't fighting the controls to make the cars, character or guns do what you would like. I still struggle in Assassin's Creed with random wall jumping or character steering issues. The cover mechanic and gunplay seems very polished and there doesn't seem to be any inout lag. I prefer the weighted cars to twitchy cars in GTA, a plus in my book. Overall, very fun to control.The story is where this game, and many other open world games lose me. Our guy is not likeable. Aiden is souless and boring bent on revenge. Perhaps stealing money that didn't belong to you would have been a better route and not cost you your niece. Virutally every character I've encountered so far is also a villian. Very limited redeeming qualities. I'm just not a huge fan of anti hero stories anymore. I still think there is some merit to a principled character fighting for his values...but I digress.Ultimately WD does cool things with the hacking. Fans of open world games should find a lot to do with minigames that range from chess to poker to mechanical spider terrorizing, racing or whatever. If you were expecting this to be the first big next-gen title to really blow your mind...well prepare for some dissapointment. Watch Dogs is fun of not revolutionary.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2014"}

The simple mode allows novice and young players to compete right away. One caveat for parents is the game contains language you don't want your second-grader to repeat.My sons are 8-years old and 6-years old, a bit young for the game's intended audience. \"Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes\" released a couple years before my kids were born but that hasn't stopped them from gravitating toward used copies every time we browse a game store. The prospect of playing as Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk and Wolverine is mighty tempting for a young boy so, when teaser trailers forMarvel vs. Capcom 3appeared last year, requests naturally followed.I wasn't concerned about the voluptuous female characters (my kids turn their heads in disgust when Lois Lane kisses Superman) or the animated violence which is no worse than what they watch on Cartoon Network. The stylized fighting is relatively tame (read: no where near as bloody) as you'll find inX-Men Origins: WolverineorMortal Kombat(BTW: both of those games carry an `M' rating for players 17-years old and up).The characters' dialogue inMarvel vs. Capcom 3is generally engaging and fun but once in a while you'll hear a cringe-inducing line that you hope your kids won't repeat. For example, Chris Redfield is pithy, shouting, \"Eat it!\"; \"Suck it!\" and \"Eat Lead!\" And Deadpool gleefully announces, \"Check me out, I'm the ghost of Christmas kick your ass!\" Along with barbed comments from Spencer and Taskmaster, the game earns its `T' rating for teens.The gameplay is three vs. three, tag-team fighting with loads of special attacks. The simple mode allows players of any age or skill level to jump in and have fun. In simple mode, little time is needed before battling the game's final boss, Galactus. However, I encourage parents with younger players to explore the mission mode to perfect moves, especially X-factor, which creates a glowing red power aura around your character.The game's main disappointment is the lack of an adventure mode that would allow two offline players to play together as a superhero team. I had hoped the game would include more unlockable extras and modes to extend the game life. After a couple hours of gameplay, my sons grew tired of fighting each other and the CPU and returned to playingMarvel Ultimate Alliance, where teamwork is key.In summary,Marvel vs. Capcom 3is an addictive, visual feast. The Marvel characters look and sound authentic (my sons didn't know many of the Capcom characters and, frankly, weren't that interested in them in the first place). This is a game that I see them playing in spurts but never wanting to trade or sell (probably because it will be another decade before the next installment).Rating: Four stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2011"}

I have included my impressions of the controller after approximately a week of play on COD Ghost, BF4, KZ Shadow Fall, Resogun, Contrast and Madden 25.PROS:+Slightly bigger than the PS3 DS controller, but not quite as clunky as 360 controllers.+The finish is very refined looking and gives what I consider the perfect amount of grip for first person shooters.+The thumb sticks have been slightly shortened and now have more of a lip to keep your thumbs from sliding out of position too much.+The touch pad area is very large which makes it easier to access when needed (So far mostly on KZ SF for operating the Owl).+The built in speaker on the controller is a nice touch...although the first time I heard it while playing Resogun it scared me to death.+++L2 and R2 triggers are amazing! With the PS3 my index fingers would occasionally slip off the back of them, but not with this controller. They are extremely precise and responsive!NOT SURE:Haven't used the headset jack located on the bottom of the controller...yet!Not completely sure, but so far I think the battery life isn't quite as good as the PS3 version. It may have something to do with the lightbar always being on (which does not annoy me at all).CONS: Does not come with a charge cable and unfortunately the ones from the PS3 don't work with these controllers. Not a huge issue since the PS4 console comes with one charging cable.OVERALL:My goodness I love this controller. Sony has been able to keep the distinctive and attractive look of the dual shock they have always had, but minor tweaks here and there make this the absolute best controller in the gaming industry bar none!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

Players are immersed in the role of apprentice at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy where they learn the power - and danger - of the Force. Amidst a multitude of complex and richly detailed Star Wars environments, including twice as many unique locales as those inStar Wars: Jedi Outcast, players face a variety of powerful and insidious enemies.For the first time in a Jedi Knight series game,Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academyallows players to create and customize their own characters by choosing various characteristics including species, gender, clothing, and physical attributes such as hair and facial features. In addition, players can create a custom lightsaber, selecting from hilt design and blade color. As apprentices progress in their training, different lightsabers will become available, such as the double-bladed lightsaber or dual lightsabers.Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academybegins shortly after the conclusion of events inStar Wars: Jedi Outcast. Players create a Jedi apprentice character and join the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 to learn the ways of the Force under the tutelage of Luke Skywalker and Kyle Katarn. While the young apprentice embarks on various missions to hone their skills and abilities, a mysterious group is discovered creating havoc throughout the galaxy. Until order is restored, the fate of the Jedi Academy - and the future of the Star Wars galaxy itself - hangs precariously in the balance.While players are able to accomplish more by using the lightsaber inStar Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, they also will have a variety of weapons - new and old - at their disposal including a blaster, blaster rifle, Wookiee bowcaster, Imperial repeater, and a Destructive Electro-Magnetic Pulse gun. A unique level selection system allows players to choose their own path through the game as well as the missions they undertake to improve their Jedi skills. The game adds new multiplayer modes and bring back the most popular modes fromStar Wars: Jedi Outcast.","reviewerName":"bayou_hannibal \"bayou_hannibal\"","summary":"Great Game!  Not just a rehash of the last one.","reviewText":"If you like Star Wars or any of the Star Wars action games that have come out, then Jedi Academy is a game that you simply can't miss.  I liked Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast, but it has a few big faults.  I LOVE Jedi Academy!  This game takes what was great about Jedi Knight 2 and emphasizes it, and it eliminates what was bad about JK2.In case you haven't played a Lucasarts Jedi game before, this is a game that gives you the look and feel of being a Jedi Knight.  You run around and do flips.  You use the force to yank weapons from enemies' hands or to push them onto the floor.  You shoot lightning out of your hands.  You telepathically choke enemies like Darth Vader.  You use a lightsaber to block laser blasts and duel with Dark Jedi.  Jedi Outcast did a wonderful job of capturing that look and feel of being a Jedi, and I think that Jedi Academy does an even better job.  This game is a sequel to 3 previous games, but you don't have to play those games to enjoy this one (but I would recommend playing Jedi Knight 2 anyways).At first glance, you think &quot;Okay, I've seen this all before&quot;.  The graphics engine is somewhat outdated, the guns are the same as the previous two games, and so are a lot of the enemies.  But after you play for an hour or so, you find that gameplay is substantially improved.  The action begins immediately (you start the game with a lightsaber this time), and it never stops until the very end.  There are no annoying jump puzzles in this game, and no gauntlet sequences where you have to complete 8 impossible tasks in sequence within 15 seconds.  Say goodbye to those 3D pixel hunts.  The puzzles are much easier, and there are very few of those annoying snipers.  You simply jump in very quickly and start slicing and dicing unfortunate enemies with your lightsaber.  To put it simply, there is a lot more fun and less frustration.The game does a great job of mixing up the levels to keep the game interesting.  Just when you think repetitiveness is creeping in, out comes a wildcard level that hasn't been done in the previous two games.  A perfect example of this is the thrilling speederbike level, where you are flying around at 100 miles an hour and slicing enemies off of their bikes like it's a high-speed joust.  There are other unique levels, but I won't spoil them for you by telling you what happens.Unlike the previous games, you get to customize the look, race, and gender of your character.  Throughout the game, you get to assign light or dark force powers as you progress, like in Dark Forces 2.  After the halfway point, you get to wield a saber in each hand, or a double-bladed saber ala Darth Maul.  By the end, you are fighting an army of Dark Jedi and it never gets old.  Near the end once, I met two Dark Jedi waiting for me on a walkway high above a fiery pit of lava.  I used Force Speed to rush in and whack one across the gut before he knew what hit him.  Then, I clashed sabers with the other guy for a minute before finally using my Force Push ability to shove him off of the walkway and watch him plunge to a ghastly death.One of the faults of this game is quirky lightsaber controls.  The lightsaber is still very hard to control, and lots of the duels are mouse click-fests.  That's a problem from the last game that wasn't fixed.  Where this game lacks the most is production values.  Specifically, the sound.  The soundtrack is the same as in the previous Star Wars games, and it might start to grate your nerves.  The voice acting is cheezy, and voice samples get repetitive, because there are so few.  The graphics, on the other hand, are outdated, but the game makes up for it by making all of the scenery bright, colorful, and unique-looking.  The scenery varies from the icy Hoth planet to the deserts of Tatooine, so it never gets repetitive.I like Jedi Academy better than Dark Forces 2 and Jedi Outcast.  I like it more than any action game that I have played in a long time (at least a year).  This is what a Star Wars Jedi action game should be.  Don't be put off by first impressions or so-so-looking screenshots.  This is a great action game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0050SW1WW","description":"","reviewerName":"M.D.C. \"Tempting Reviews\"","summary":"5 stars?  No.  But I know why they say that.","reviewText":"It's because a game like this is unique.  But it is this very unique that brings the game down, severely.I won't bore you with details about the game.  IN summary, you're controlling Kat, who has been thrust into a mysterious world with no recollection of who she is or where she came from.  She stumbles across a cat (ironically) who when near her, gives her the power to control gravity.  You begin to explore this new world, and along the way your powers are put to light and later, heavy use.On the surface Gravity Rush (or Gravity Daze, it's original and more appropriate name, but I digress) feels like something fresh and new.  The idea that the world is open and almost at your total control is appealing and you feel like you've got quite the adventure ahead of you.  It's a bit disorienting to figure out all of the controls, simply because there are so many tools and powers at Kat's command, that the game is really a balancing act of sorts.  You're constantly trying to think about the right tool for given jobs - whether that be walking up walls, or flying into the air and free falling, or air surfing down some stairs.  On the plus side, the world is rich and open enough that if you're a fan of exploration, the game simply cannot disappoint you, since there's very few places you can't go (at first, you're restricted on the up and down, but that will ease up as you progress).  Quite a few times, I felt like I was playing a game of Memory - that I was basically tapping things in a proper order, until I realized that I was playing the game wrong.  Instead of thinking so hard about the right sequence of buttons, I simply needed to pick the right tool for the job.  It's hard to describe.For example, some bosses are able to crawl up walls, so my first instinct was to simply adjust gravity to walk up after them and fight them on that level, but it was dizzying to the point of near nausea.  Instead, I found an attack that allowed Kat to simply fight in the air and achieve better results.  Problem is, some other enemies were designed to counter this so efficiently that I often ended up getting swallowed by the mist (the \"up and down\" I mentioned earlier) and having to start over in frustration.  It caused me to rethink my strategy.  That's not a bad thing, but it did mean that some boss battles were simply infuriating.  At one point, you're even required to navigate a stage and fight a boss without your gravity controlling powers at full force, and I will tell you now that many people have quit because of this stage.  It felt like artificial difficulty, and it wasn't fun or \"strategic\" at all.The other thing I noticed has to do with what I can only describe as the \"Sonic and Shadow Hedgehog\" effect.  There are a few stages where your objective is not to fight or run, but simply chase.  That's not so much an issue, except that as with a game such asNights into Dreams [Download], the flight mechanics make fine and precise movements difficult.  It was surprising how much similarity there was in the flight and control mechanisms of these two games.  You'll be flying straight but you can't quick dodge easily to the left or right without stopping your forward motion, thus disrupting your travel.  Meanwhile, the enemy throws attacks that force you to start all over from a previous point, and after having played a game likeSuperman Returnswhere you do have this sort of precise control over flight, it's frustrating to be limited in choices when you know exactly what needs to be done.For a game based on gravity, I also saw that the developers seem to have a poor sense of it.  For example, in the aforementioned stage, you would think that falling, given that your velocity should increase, might help you avoid some of those attacks.  It doesn't.  In fact, the attack matches your decent vector almost flawlessly, resulting in you getting nailed with attacks that should never have touched you in a properly gravitated situation.  You might chalk that up to accuracy - but at some point there has to be some give.The back storyline is quite deep, and I had no complaints here.  I also had no complaints with the graphics and detail of the game, as well as the music.  From a presentation standpoint the game certainly shines over the competition in a major way.  It's only hampered by controls and the basic battle engine.  It's not a bad game, it's really not.  But it's certainly not 5 stars unless you simply want something different.  As withLuminesbefore it, I think people jumped on this because it was the first game out and has that unique feel.  But a lot of what they threw in to be unique was just not fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00309XHD0","description":"","reviewerName":"Mark Carson","summary":"A worthy successor, left me wanting more","reviewText":"The original Dead Space had a nice advantage of taking relatively low expectations and generally blowing them away.  I liken my experience with it to my first viewing of the Matrix...I didn't expect much but was incredibly surprised. Dead Space 2, for me, was more like having breakfast at grandmother's house...I had high expectations, and generally got exactly what I wanted.  That may make it sound like a disappointment, but that is far from the truth (and then again you never had breakfast at my grandma's). Both the original and its successor have for me a large list of merits (as well as a few flaws), but overall I loved both games. Even after playing each more than once and back to back, it's hard for me to say which is my favorite, and I consider that high praise for DS2.DS2 feels very much like its predecessor, in terms of gameplay and story. The developers, however, are to be complimented for some nice improvements. As much as Dead Space looked great, the graphical improvement in DS2 is noticeable from the start.  Gameplay is very similar, but has been tightened up in ways that felt exactly right for me. Implementation of zero gravity is much better this time around, and gone are the frustrating tourret sequences. I've read and heard much about whether the sequel's story is in some way inferior, but for me it was very much like the first one. I played the original on its own (without benefit of any of the other media), and felt the story was interesting but generally just okay. I loved the game so much, though, I sought out the comics, animated movie, etc and found my experience very enriched with a deeper understanding of the overall mythos. I approached DS2 in much the same way (with Aftermath, Salvage and yes even the poorly designed Ignition) and felt similarly rewarded. I like that Isaac was cured of his laryngitis for the sequel, his performance actually helped flesh out his character and for me created a stronger connection with what was happening to him. I would sum it up to say while DS2 doesn't quite match the frights of the original with its \"things that go bump on a space ship\" approach, it does succeed in being quite creepy, especially during certain chapers as Clarke struggles with his deepening dementia.My only real nit picks are in the game's overall length and somewhat lack of variety in its gameplay. My first methodical walkthrough of Dead Space clocked in at around 12 hours, Dead Space 2 about 10 and a half. Now I try not to let time influence me too much, as I'd rather play 10 hours of awesome than 25 of tedious and boring. But I remember I found myself in the last chapter of DS2 knowing it was almost over, and to me it did feel a bit abrupt. With its setting on the Sprawl, it seems likely some opportunies were missed for varying the gameplay (but hey it could have been worse...Altman be praised for no co-op or escort missions). The multiplayer doesn't really do anything for me, and I honestly feel it could have been nixed altogether in favor of beefing up the single player experience.Overall I loved Dead Space 2 at least as much as the original, and that's saying something. As of this writing one can still procure the Limited Edition with the Extraction Wii port, a fun on-rails shooter in its own right. Its inclusion for a Move owner like me pretty much made day 1 purchase a no-brainer. I am excited for the almost sure to be announced DS3, but can see the franchise may already be at a bit of a crossroads. More of the same (only better)worked for me this time around, however I do fear the possibility of diminishing returns (insert survival horror franchise of your choice here for examples). One can only hope EA and Visceral can take it to another level for the next installment; if so, my pre-order is as inevitable as another necromorph outbreak.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2011"}

Say what you want about Desmond or Connor, but there is no period of grace or satisfaction in either protagonist's ending.

{"product_name":"B0050SXFKE","description":"","reviewerName":"Joey Z. \"Joey\"","summary":"Assassin's Creed III Review","reviewText":"My time with Assassin's Creed III has been interesting to say the least. I'm still new to the franchise, and my first game in the series was Brotherhood. I wasn't a big fan of Brotherhood or Revelations. I found the combat to be confusing and frustrating, and overall I was a little lost in what to do or where to go. That said, I came into AC3 expecting more of the same, but what I got was an entirely new experience that is full of things to do and excellent gameplay and design.Now, if you've played the previous games in the series, you know Desmond Miles and his story. He has been kidnapped and forced into the Animus to take control of his ancestors and stop the Templars' plot. I was never a big fan of the Assassin's Creed story. I never liked Desmond and his tale. But the bulk of the game will have you playing as Desmond's ancestor, Connor Kenway. Whereas previous installments put you in settings such as Rome or Constantinople in the 12th century, AC3 puts you right in the middle of the American Revolutionary War. It's the setting that makes the game here. You spend your time split between big cities like Boston, and the wilderness of the Frontier. These settings are the base for the story, and they're a marvel. Connor's story has him protecting his Native American heritage while the British Redcoats infiltrate the Colonies. Along the way, Connor meets up with many historical figures, including George Washington and Paul Revere. You get a bit of a history lesson here, and it's a lot of fun to play through what you learned in 5th grade. You'll play through historic moments like the Boston Massacre, The Battle of Bunker Hill, and visit locations such as Concord and Lexington.Connor is very nimble, and his particular set of skills sets the tone of what you'll be doing. Free running has been improved since last games, allowing you to perform parkour-style moves along the Boston rooftoops or in the Frontier canopy. It works well for the most part, and it looks pretty badass. There were some times when Connor jumped to the wrong branch, or jumped off the roof altogether, but these mistakes aren't as common as they were in Brotherhood or Revelations. The combat has also been improved. In fighting the Redcoats, Connor can block, counter, and attack in a wide variety of ways. One reason I wasn't a fan of the first AC games was their combat. I found myself confused in what I could do, and enemies always blocked my attacks. For this reason I avoided direct confrontation a lot. Here, that's not the case. Combat is a breeze, and follows a simple pattern of push one button to dodge, and then you have a split second to counter, disarm, or roll away. It's simple, effective, and a lot of fun. You won't die too much, but mistakes are common. Connor's arsenal consists of his tomahawk, a bow and arrow for ranged takedowns, the classic hidden blade, rope darts, and a lot more. Experimenting with these weapons is a lot of fun, and it allows for a good amount of player choice in determining which weapon is right for the job.In addition to the main quest, you've got plenty to do on the side. The Homestead allows you a metagame of managing your land's economy. You recruit settlers by rescuing them or meeting them in the Frontier, and they'll set up shop at your home. You can then buy their products and craft new items, or trade via convoys to make a little money. It isn't explained very well, but once you figure it out, you'll be making solid revenue in no time. There is a wide array of collectibles to pick up along the way. Benjamin Franklin's pages of his almanac have been lost and are spread all over Boston and New York, and it's your job to find them. Also, eagle feathers and treasure pieces in the Frontier will keep you on a constant treasure hunt. Speaking of hunt, hunting is a very deep diversion that can be very addicting and rewarding. Animals are spread out all over areas of the Frontier, and Connor can trap and kill them in a variety of ways, using bait, setting up traps, or simply shooting them with a bow. You can skin these animals and trade them for profit, and it's a lot of fun, even more fun than Red Dead Redemption's hunting sidequests. Naval missions allow Connor to take to the seas aboard a naval vessel, and engage in some ship battles. These are easily one of the best parts of the game, and upgrading and commanding your cannons as captain of a ship is a blast (get it?). Also, assassin recruits are back, but these aren't as full-fledged as they were in Brotherhood, which is a shame.Assassin's Creed III is a technical marvel. Boston and the Frontier are brimming with detail and movement. The colors shine, and particle effects are beautiful. The campaign is set in different seasons, and the snow forests are literally a sight to behold. At sea, your boat rocks back and forth amongst the waves, and the view distance is incredible. Enemy attacks are as gruesome as ever, and you'll have a lot of fun finding creative ways to kill a Redcoat. All that attention to detail in the environment, however, is lost when it comes to characters and cutscenes. Characters are a blocky mess, especially in the faces, and it's disappointing when a cutscene loses its luster because of poor attention to detail on characters. Cutscenes are a mixed bag; some are beautiful, others are a mess. Surprisingly, Assassin's Creed III is full of bugs and glitches, and it makes me wonder if there was any debugging of any sort at all. At one point, a character's mouth didn't even move when he was talking. In another, Connor got stuck in a rock and I had to reset my PS3. It's disappointing when freerun doesn't work because of a glitch, and it almost breaks the game to be honest. The soundtrack is nothing special. Voice acting is good as always, and some intense battle music is pretty good.Multiplayer is back from Brotherhood and Revelations, and it's been switched a bit for the better. Deathmatch is back, along with Team Objective and a variety of other modes I have yet to play. Multiplayer is fun, and it's a unique way to approach the Assassin's Creed gameplay with multiple players. Basically, you have to kill one target, while another target is hunting you. You can use a variety of diversions, and it helps to blend in with the crowd and keep hidden. It's a lot of fun, and can get very intense. Wolfpack is the new co-op mode, where you and friends hunt NPC targets, and you try to coordinate your kills and gain more points.Assassin's Creed III changes up the AC gameplay for the better. Connor is a joy to control, combat is much better, and the sidequests will keep you busy for a long time. Graphics are great, but a few game-ruining bugs are present, and multiplayer is a fun diversion from the main campaign. If you gave up on the AC franchise for whatever reason, AC3 is a great place to jump back in.Pros:Excellent Story and SettingRefined Assassin's Creed GameplayBajillion things to doFun MultiplayerCons:Game-Breaking BugsSome things aren't explained very wellOVERALL: 8.9/10.0","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2012"}

Is it an action game?  Yes.  Adventure?  Sure.  Puzzle?  Yep.  Platformer?  Yeah.  It even has slight horror elements.On the surface, Shadow sounds simple:  search for the colossus, find its weak spot, and stab it.  Sounds easy enough, but that's like saying that To Kill a Mockingbird is a legal drama, or Platoon is about the Vietnam War - it's not the whole story.  Even Shadow's story - boy wants to save girl - slowly reveals itself to be something much more complex and mysterious.Where Shadow excels is in its design.  Finding each colossus requires travel through a landscape that can only be described as dreamlike, yet it feels real.  You'll seamlessly travel from a cliff overlooking a river to a thick forest, and then you could find yourself in the middle of a desert or at the edge of a lake.  Since the land is so vast (and, besides the colossi, relatively uninhabited), you travel by horseback, courtesy of Agro, perhaps the best-animated animal character ever seen in a game.  Controlling Agro is initially complex, yet intuitive, and thankfully his A.I. is sophisticated enough to keep you from riding him off the edge of a mountain.  You're armed with only a sword and bow (with unlimited arrows), and there's no way to upgrade your weaponry.  The real upgrade lies in the learned experience of defeating each of the colossi hidden in the valleys and mountains.Each colossus is haunting, fantastic, ominous, and awe-inspiring, and there's even a slight sense of innocence.  I won't go into specifics because the sense of wonder and discovery is vital to the gameplay, but if you avoid walkthroughs and spoilers (and you certainly should) you will constantly be surprised at each one.  Defeating them requires careful thinking, experimentation, and trial-and-error, and there's not always one way to achieve victory.  Just as the brilliant bosses of the Gamecube's two Metroid Prime games demanded quick thumbs and quick wits, the colossi are masterfully imagined, rendered, and designed, and get more complex as you progress.  They had to be, as the game is basically sixteen boss battles.  Still, there's nothing like the rush of finally discovering the key to each beast, but that's only part of the battle, as you then have to put your plan into action.  Simply put, the colossi are some of the most cinematic and exhilirating experiences in gaming, and each one is unique and memorable.If you have a PS2 and want something challenging, beautiful, and unlike anything else you've played before, Shadow of the Colossus is an absolute must.  It's an instant candidate for Game of the Year, and should at the very least get recognition for its design.  Games like this don't come along often - enjoy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2005"}

A rare and unique gaming experience.","reviewText":"THE SHORT: With high production values and minimalist storytelling, this game takes on the feeling of an art movie. Not that it isn't exciting- the battles are exhilirating and different than anything I've played before. I have 2 complaints and 2 only- The replay value isn't terribly high, and the game's 10-20 hour length leaves me wanting more. But it's honestly so great, I'd want more anyway. There is nothing else like this game, though it borrows a bit from Zelda and sets a new standard all its own.THE LONG: I'm honored to be the 100th person to review this game. Playing it was almost everything I expected it to be, and it's great to leave my mark on what felt more like an immersive experience than a simple game.I've never played Ico, the first game by this company, so I went in fresh. The game was, at its simplest, billed as 16 boss battles with not much more in between other than traveling the countryside tracking them down. While this is technically true, it's all done so well, and at such a great pace, that it feels like an extremely satisfying adventure similar to something you'd find in a Zelda game.The plot is basic- your character arrives in a vast and beautiful landscape, carrying with him a woman who he wishes to revive with the help of an ominous voice in the temple. The voice agrees to assist him, should he hunt down the 16 beasts and bring them down. The character accepts regardless of consequence, and it's time to begin.The land is absolutely huge. Even if traveled entirely on horseback, it would take the player hours to actually investigate every gully, waterfall, desert, forest, ruins, and mountain. Thankfully your character has a strangely powerful sword- one the voice in the temple seems to recognize- and in the sunlight this sword emits a beam in the basic direction of the next foe. It's up to you to find the colossi using your horse and this sword.On average it seems to take as little as ten minutes to find a foe if you really know what you're doing or as long as half an hour or more when figuring out how to navigate the landscape, grapple over rocks and whittle down the hiding places.The battles themselves are grand contests of wit and skill. Once you track them down, you then have to find their vulnerable spot or \"vitals\", and then figure out how to access them. Fortunately every beast has something to grab hold of, and it's a matter of reaching it. This takes the form of, again, Zelda-like imagination: Get it to raise its foot, shoot it from underneath, then jump onto the injured foot when it falls- climbing up its side, running along its back, then finding the vital and stabbing it while holding on for dear life.That's not the trick for every Colossus- just one. Each of the 16 has a particular strategy to figure out, specific weaknesses to exploit. By the end, you'll have gone through battles where you have NO idea what to do- strategies that require usage of not only the creature but your very surroundings- and when you figure it out, it's immensely satisfying as you smile in triumph, looking forward to each new beast.And what beasts. With the exception of 2 surprisingly small (and in my opinion disappointing) creatures, these Colossi really live up to their name. To watch one stand high above, slowly craning its monstrous head to gaze at you, the invading pest, is a unique gaming experience. Without giving away their forms (seeing what they look like is half the fun), rest assured that you'll crawl atop towering heads, be pulled and thrashed through the water, and soar through the air. You'll ride your horse, Agro, past flying blasts of lightning, and be thrown about as you cling to the bellies, arms, and backs of thrashing monsters the size of roller coasters. The battles are intense, immersive, and very well executed- they move with the slow speed and powerful strength you'd expect, and the vast landscape around you looks a lot different when you're dozens- sometimes hundreds- of feet above it. A gaming website got it right when they said that these battles are so exciting that you want to tell the next player how much cool stuff is waiting for them- battles that get better and better- but can't because you know how great the discoveries were. So you instead wait eagerly and watch as they experience the same awe you got to feel.The music is fantastic as well. Ambient, natural sounding tunes of pleasant wandering and sweeping action carry over the proceedings. It's always satisfying when you find that weakness and leap onto the Colossi's back and hear the heroic theme acknowledge your achievement and spur you on. Sounds effects and voice (especially the Temple God) are sparse but well done.Since the battles are complex, it's a good thing the actual control isn't. There's a jump button, grab button, and attack button. No combos to figure out here, you just need to get the hang of charging your moves to full strength and when to leap and when to hold down that grab button. The trip to the first Colossus gives you a good basic glossing over of the controls. By Colossus 3, I was really getting the hang of how to move around more capably and quickly. Good thing, since things get more intense. Thankfully switching weapons and targeting the Colossi are a breeze.One thing I wanted to address is the game's graphics and performance. I kept hearing that the game suffers some slowdown and the richly detailed graphics can't keep up for some parts of play. Whether I got lucky or just don't hold such perfectionist standards I don't know- the game played perfectly fine for me, and there was never a moment where I actually noticed things bogging down or screwing up a maneuver because of any kind of hiccup. I was consciously waiting to experience what seemed like the most commonly mentioned problem, and it just didn't happen, what can I say.The one problem I do have is that, since much of the game is focused on discovery, experimentation, and exploration, once you finish the game you've pretty much seen it all. It should be noted that I was so taken by the game, and had so much fun fighting, that the next day I started right back up and played through again. And though much of the allure and mystery was exhausted, I still had a good time. You'll unquestionably develop favorite Colossi (mine are 7, 9, and 12), and probably want to fight them several times. If you continue a finished game, you can do time challenges for each beast and try to win special items, which adds some replay but in truth doesn't change the fact that it just means more battling.Time is another thing- 10 to 20 hours is great for just \"16 boss battles\", but still not greatly lengthy. It's worth playing, without question, but some may be done once they've seen it through the one time, and in all fairness they're pretty correct.But for me, I just wanted to go right back through. Learning the late story developments and lengthy ending (which to me was interesting and a pretty satisfying conclusion) just left me with a feeling that I'd participated in a grand tale, one I knew I'd revisit much like a favorite book I've already read. And if a complaint can be leveled against the game because it leaves the player wishing for more, then that's a pretty admirable fault to have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2006"}

Playing through KH was extremely compelling and was amazing. When KH Chain of Memories released for the GBA it took over where KH left off in the ending scene (as Sora and gang where walking down a winding road and spot Pluto with a letter sealed with the Kings symbol and end up chasing him [fade to black]). Also the Secret Cutscene unlocked by completing Jiminy's Journal (easy) or beating expert mode, makes a huge reference to KH2. For a GBA game it had stunning 3D cutscenes and excellent gameplay! The story line was VERY compelling and the battle system was somewhat of a challenge to get used to. It took much thought and planning to win battles. Also \"The Organization\" was introduced in this game! Unknown to most the KH released in Japan actually had an Organization member as a secret boss in the room where Melificent (Dragon form) is destroyed by Sora (Kingdom Hearts Final Mix). By the way, I'll give you a spoiler, the Organization XIII member was Xemnas if you could tell by his Etheral Blades.  Overall Being a GBA game it was fairly short. One of the prime features of KHCOM was that you could play Sora's rival and friend Riku which explains what happens after Riku and King Mickey get trapped behind the Door to Kingdom Hearts (or \"Door to Darkness\") Characters such as Namine and Diz where first introduced in COM NOT KH2. The Re:Chain of Memories (Kingdom Hearts II - Final Mix [Japan]) is basically an exact copy of the GBA version, just with a few added features with KH2 graphics. So don't believe the \"never released in the US before\" adds you see because it was released on the GBA. Kingdom Hearts lovers everywhere should pick this game up and for those of you who played and own the GBA version will not be disappointed at all. Strongly recommeded for Hardcore KH fans. Wouldn't recommend for someone who is starting the series (Go with KH). For those who skipped over COM really shouldnt leave bias reviews. Take it from a big KH fan this is the way to go for KH gamers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000HCQK0A","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"Crackdown... the ultimate way to relax","reviewText":"I absolutely love this game and have been playing nothing else since I purchased it. It's basically Grand Theft Auto meets the Matrix. I say that because it has the entire open world feeling that GTA has mixed with the sensational feeling of jumping from one rooftop to another. This is one of those games where you can actually feel how high up you are, especially when you realize that you're not gonna make it to that rooftop that you thought you could reach. As your character levels up and you start jumping higher, throwing farther and shooting more accurately, the game just becomes ridiculously entertaining.The graphics are awesome. I love cel shaded graphics myself and while this slightly cartoony look may put off some of you, I think it's a big part of what makes this game work. It's amazing how you can stand on the highest point in the game and look down at the entire world before you and still see tiny cars in the distance and people milling about. The physics are really nice also, employing ragdoll physics and real world physics so people collapse realistically after being filled with lead and cars flip over in a believable manner after being blown to smithereens. And speaking of explosions, let's just say there are many, they are usually huge and they're really loud.The in game sound is really nice and if you remember what the gunfire in the film \"Heat\" sounded like during the heist scene, it sounds just like that. Another reason to get yourself a surround setup if you don't alrteady have one.Online co-op is great and has a kind of Gears of War thing going for it in that you can jump in someone else's game and help them complete missions if you choose. Playing in this type of game with another player is a very satisfying experience. The controls are nice and tight and even though there might be a slight issue with locking on targets you may not necessarily be targeting, it's still more than adequate for the games purposes.This game boils down to eliminating the bad guys and collecting stuff scattered across the map. Rarely has it ever been this much fun. While there isn't as much to do as in GTA: San Andreas (let's face it though, I don't really think delivering pizzas would make sense in this game), there's still a lot of searching, collecting and wiping out of scumbags to make this game a hell of a good time.Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

Worst of all, an ages-old conspiracy bent on world domination has decided that the time is right to emerge from the shadows and take control.

They are the prime examples of good gaming, not only for the system, but also as an RPG.  No game for the system has been able to surpass them in quality since the release of each, and likely, no game ever will.  They're not just good GBA games; they're great video games, period.There are dozens of aspects of the game that would make a good game cool; but the fact that there are so many, makes these amazing games extraordinary.  I tend to prefer real time combat to turn based, but out of all the turn based I've ever played, this is easily the best.  Not only is there the progressively interesting psynergy, and not only are there releases from various weapons, and not only are there the djinn, collected over the course of the game, with their own, unique releases, but there are also the spectacular summons and combo summons (introduced in The Lost Age) that can be used with stand-by djinn, which, alone, puts these games ahead by leaps and bounds in terms of graphics, over any other game for the system.  And all of these contributions make combat far more strategic and engaging.My absolute favorite aspect of these games are the dungeons.  I've grown tired of the RPG where, upon entering a dungeon, the only difficultly comes from the overly incessant monster attacks and the boss battle which, traditionally, comes at the end.  In Golden Sun and The Lost Age, monster attacks are on a more limited basis--meaning they don't get boring fast, like other RPGs.  But the real challenge in the dungeons are the complex puzzles, most of which require the use of various psynergy.  And the psynergy (magic) system is very intelligently taught to the player as the game progresses, as to recognize when a specific psynergetic power is required.  It's the only RPG I've ever played where magic isn't just a convenience; it's a necessity.  And while many of the puzzles are hard, they're fun, and all the more satisfying when the solution is achieved.  It's one of the few games I've played that required serious thinking on the part of the player, as opposed to mindless, repetitive combat.  It's one of the few I've played where I actually looked *forward* to the dungeons--and even some of the boss battles.  (My favorite dungeons include all four lighthouses, the Elemental Rocks in The Lost Age, and the Ankohl Ruins, which requires the use of my personal favorite psynergy--sand.)My only gripes for the game include the fact that I'm a little tired of the standard RPG that's from the point of view of a male protagonist, as well as a minor flaw such as the fact that, when in battle, a character is assigned to attack a monster but the monster is killed before they can attack, the character automatically goes into defense mode, and the turn is wasted.Overall, I would seriously recommend this to anyone who's ever been an RPG fan, and agree with the statement that it is worth buying a GB soley for Golden Sun and The Lost Age.  And while you can start with The Lost Age, I would recommend starting with the first one, simply so that you can appreciate the awe and splendor of both games together.On the downside, I almost wish I hadn't played these games first.  Because now, nothing else I ever play will even compare.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2005"}
{"product_name":"B002BRZ9AG","description":"No More Heroes 2 Wii","reviewerName":"Theresa Winfrey","summary":"Disappointing Sequel","reviewText":"I absolutely adored the first No More Heroes. The combat was so satisfying, and riding around Santa Destroy on the motorcycle was fun. NMH2 is a good example of what happens when you try to please your critics.I think some people criticized having to actually drive from place to place on your motorcycle. I would not be one of those people. I loved driving that thing. They took the open-world element out of the game. Granted, there wasn't much open world to see - just a large, mostly empty facade of a city punctuated by a few critical locations. Still, I blame the Wii's hardware limitations on this more than anything else. Despite the limitations, it was fun. I always drove the motorcycle in first-person, immersing myself into the experience.Critics also did not like the minigames you could do to make money, although you could just do \"killing missions\". They took out the \"killing missions\" (they only pop up randomly now). They also took out the 3D minigames and replaced them with awkward, \"8-bit\", 2D minigames that frustrate more than entertain. Even the gym workouts have been 2D-ified. It wouldn't be a problem if these 2D minigames were fun, but they are not. For 2D games, they unfittingly require sensitive, analog control. In the old days, when you pressed \"left\", you went left, and \"right\" was right. With these 2D minigames, however, there are 10 degrees of left and 10 degrees of right. You must be precise, or you won't catch that coconut, or place that pipe where you want to. You will run into that bug that is five pixels away, and you will crash into a car that is three pixels away.The combat is as good as ever, and the entertainingly ridiculous plot and characters return. This series has been and is a true Wii gem, and the inner Nintendo fanboy in me wishes that the PS3 port didn't happen and that Travis Touchdown becomes a playable character in the next Smash Bros.This is a slightly worse game than the first, but the combat is still great, and that's what you're here for - not the stupid minigames.

Or you should buy the 250gb model if you plan on doing alot of downloading content.The models are similar, the 4gb model is matte black, the 250gb model is shiny black.  They both have wifi, both are kinect compatible, both come with one wireless controller.  Overall its a great deal and saving $100 never hurts.I still think Microsoft should have included at minimum a 20gb harddrive and these units would be flying off the shelf.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2010"}

At first I thought it was just my unit, but everyone I know has some kind of PS2 trouble. I'm not blowing it out proportion either, EVERYBODY PS2 that I've heard of had malfunctioned at least two years after it's shelf birthdate and purchase. It's not just PS2 either, pretty much anything Sony sucks these days. I doubt I'll be purchasing a PS3 since every PS1 and PS2 I have heard of has malfunctioned way too soon. Disc read errors happening in five years, maybe, but two, even one year for most! NO way. Besides these big negatives, PS2 is beautiful and has some great games and an awesome emotion system.

Wells","summary":"Hours Play, Less Freedom","reviewText":"Dragon Age 2 is one of those games where you can easily log 60+ hours questing, looting, and discovering the histories of a deep fantasy world. For disclosure, I played the first Dragon Age (Awakening & Origins, as well as the other DLC) and enjoyed them. I just completed my first playthrough of Dragon Age 2 (I chose the Mage class).  Playing through with different classes and making different choices make DA2 a decent value.  However, if you loved the first Dragon Age and you were hoping for MORE Dragon Age you might be disappointed: DA2 has \"streamlined\" (aka limited) choices to make it maybe more friendly to non-RPG gamers.There are many fun tid-bits that carry over from the first Dragon Age if you play the 2nd Dragon Age, but really the first Dragon Age is not essential for enjoying Dragon Age 2.The loot management system has been streamlined.  You will constantly by hunting for armor, rings, amulets, belts, and weapons for your own character.  Your companions' armor is pre-set; however, you will need to upgrade their weapons, belts, amulets, and rings as the game progresses.  You will also have to hunt high and low to find the various upgrades for your companion armor.The strength of the Dragon Age is game is the constant upgrading of attributes and abilities. By the time you reach the level cap you will have a character that is pretty powerful.  There are many quests, side quests, and decisions to make.I was completely absorbed in the fictional world of Dragon Age.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  You will probably want to use a strategy guide or walkthrough if you want to find all the secret locations.A few things make DA2 a bit of weaker offering than its predecessor.  First, the limited armor/weapon management for your companions I felt was a step backwards.  Second, Your companions are all over the place (no DA1 \"campground\"): to talk to them you must travel throughout the city of kirkwall (and there are load screens between each part of town you want to visit), so you tend to spend a lot of time at load screens. I also feel that \"hiding\" your companions armor upgrades is a bit annoying.  I would rather have their armor level up if you use them in your party, or after certain accomplishments.The BIGGEST problem with DA2 is dungeon maps.  Unfortunately, entering different dungeons/caves gives you a feeling of deja vu.  This sensation comes from the fact that the maps for dungeons are recycled...looks and feels like a cheap shortcut.Overall, Dragon Age 2 is a game you can lose yourself in. You can spend days playing each class and there is plenty of replay value (make friends, have different romances, be a nice guy or a real bad dude). I liked it. I hope they get back to the DA1 roots with any new release.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2011"}

The graphics and immersive environment are spectacular. You can interact with the terrain in amazing fashion giving you lots of freedom. Use crevices, door and window frames, landings, etc to climb just about anything you want. AC lets you ride a horse and fight from a mount.The combat in AC is fun. It takes a little while to get use to, but once you do watch out. You must use timing and defense to avoid death when faced with overwhelming odds. As you continue the game you get access to new weapons and fighting skills. Before long you can do amazing counter-attacks, dodges, and grab and defensive breaks. The action is very fluid and thoroughly engaging.Without giving too much away, the storyline is entertaining and will keep your interest. There is a duel storyline going where a modern day guy is reliving the memories of his ancestor. I found this part unnecessary, but it didn't detract from actual game. Yes, the whole premise of the game is assassinating people. So, no, the game is not for kids, hence the mature rating. Several reviewers have described the game as slanted towards killing Christians. It's not. It's really more killing everyone Muslim or Christian that gets in the way. However, the game does have it out for the Templars. They are portrayed as evil villains in the game. Most of the people you are sent to kill think they are serving a good cause, but their actions are misguided. Much like the actions of the main character.Some things I didn't like. While you have tremendous freedom to interact with the terrain, you can't do some simple things like open doors. Also the environment is not destructible except for rare exceptions like vendor carts. You don't have many items / weapons at your disposal that could cause much damage, but rails could break, tables move, open a chest etc. Maybe I want to set a fire as a distraction. Oh well maybe next time.I didn't have any problems with game stability. I don't think it ever crashed which is saying a lot these days. The only thing I had a problem with is the game opened as a window instead of taking over the full screen. This caused problems when the cursor got off the screen. Any suggestions would be appreciated.I would agree that the investigations leading up to each assassination attempt do become repetitive. You don't have to do them all, but they make completing the assassination easier. The game is also kind of short, but you will enjoy the ride. I'm looking forward toAssassin's Creed IIto expand the experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2009"}

Maybe so.","reviewText":"The comparisons between Forza Motorsport and Gran Turismo (for PS2) are inevitable, and for good reason. Sim racing fans have long praised the Turismo series for delivering something that most racing games seem to lack- a true \"Career\" mode where you buy cars from scratch, upgrade them like real autos, and customize their handling with real-world touches. Not to mention the literally hundreds of hours of potential gameplay, depending on how you race your way through the events. So which game is better- Forza or Gran Turismo? (For this review, I'll be using GT4 for comparison.) To the uninitiated, both would be excellent choices. Both games have stellar graphics, incredible realism, and oodles of strategy. But- if you haven't figured out where this is going yet- Forza winds up being the winner by a long shot.What Forza does better:-Graphically, Forza's real-time rendering tops Turismo's use of actual photos or pre-rendered bits to create an illusion of better graphics. Even while actually rendering most everything you see, Forza's graphics remain as good or better than Turismo.-Forza has a much easier learning curve thanks to its excellent helper tools. The \"preferred line\" feature appears on the track, turning from red to green in real-time to show you when you're going too fast to safely navigate a turn. Even veterans can use the line to help memorize the trickier parts of new tracks. Other features from the Anti-Lock Brakes system to the Traction Control can be toggled at the user's whim, and turning off these options will even increase your winnings in the Career mode. Yes, learning how to \"drive right\" actually pays off in this game. Customizing these options will keep the game fresh whether you're completely new to the genre or a long-time veteran.-Forza doesn't have license tests. In Turismo, you have to pass supremely annoying and nearly senseless license tests to continue your Career. These often involve strict time limits coupled with cars that drive like the Titanic, if the Titanic had wheels made out of butter. In Forza, you acquire new events by having the right cars for a specific race (still necessary in Turismo) or by levelling up- which is accomplished by simply racing more to increase your earnings. Levelling up even comes with bonuses, like free cars and price reductions on parts.What Turismo does better, and why Forza still shines:-GT4 has many more cars spanning a wider range of interests. However, some of these cars aren't worth driving (a few Model-T era contraptions barely move at all) and a few aren't drivable at all (some cars have track or mode restrictions, meaning they literally can't be driven). Forza has enough cars to keep almost anyone happy, with a catalogue running back to the 60s, and including the big names like Ferrari. Only die-hard will really be seeking more.I could go on:Forza tops Turismo in pretty much any aspect imaginable. As an added bonus, the Xbox controller's triggers allow for much smoother acceleration and braking than the PS2's buttons. And I didn't even mention the amazing paint mechanic! You can customize your car's paint from a library of colors, and then apply up to 600 decals (on one car!) using a fully-featured shaping tool that, with practice, will allow you to do anything with your car's paint from replicating a real racer to drawing murals of 8-bit Nintendo characters (I've done both). And yes, your customized paint scheme shows up in all races. Turismo lacks damage modeling, while Forza lets you toggle it from \"Off\" to \"Simulation\", where hard hits will even warp your steering. Forza's computer cars seem to have much more competitive AI, with cars that actually try to avoid running you (or them) off the road if possible. The list goes on!Bottom Line:Forza might just be the best sim racing game ever made. The learning curve helpers allow anyone to jump in and try out the fun, while the depth of customization will please any sim fan. The library of tracks, modes, and cars will keep even die-hards happy. What more could you ask for? Forza 2, of course.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"One of world's biggest but world's best?","reviewText":"On one hand, it's quite easy to criticize a series like \"Halo\". It's a simple first-person shooter, control vehicles, grenades and big set-pieces are pretty standard in a lot of FPS' lately and it doesn't really do anything revolutionary to make it the \"shooter to end all shooters\". However, the mythos, characters and the sheer fun of the series as a whole is quite enticing and out of the shooter franchises involving aliens which include \"Resistance\" and \"Gears of War\", Halo probably has my favorite mythology tied to it. When the second game ended, it came with a slightly confusing storyline and a cliffhanger that didn't feel finished, like watching a tv show when the power goes out. Bungie took many of the criticisms found with both games and addressed them for this installment. Does it make it a better game?Story: When Halo 2 ended, Cortana had been captured by the Gravemind, the Prophet of Truth was heading to Earth to activate the Ark which would fire all Halo installations in the galaxy, effecting wiping every living being off the face of the universe. So in comes Master Chief and with the help of the Arbiter and the marines, the whole future of the galaxy rests on everyone's favorite Spartan.Graphics: Barring the repetitive level design from the first game, it was still a great looking game for its time, same with 2. The third game while given a major upgrade, might not have the flashy effects that are found in games like Gears, Bioshock or Call of Duty IV. However, the detailing, environments and the big battles are still here in all their chaoticness and seeing a Scarab destroyed a mere 40 feet from you is really awesome. Character animations are slightly iffy and because you can't install directly to the hard drive, you'll occasionally see some stutters and pauses though they're forgivable.Sound/Music: With that main theme, how can you not get pumped? Sweeping and very theatrical, the score is easily a highlight of the game and when the music kicks before a big battle, it's easy to get that sense of excitement and be jazzed up for the fight. Voice acting as always is excellent and despite the fact your teammates are inconsistent in their help, their lines are quite funny at times. Only thing I wish would've been addressed is the option to change the sound volume. I play with headphones (the earphone doesn't work) and when you're on co-op or multiplayer, would've been nice to turn the game sound low so you can hear Live chatter.Gameplay: Nothing much that's been changed from the 2nd game. Dual-wielding, vehicle boarding and the like is still the same though with it comes new additions. Added is the Mongoose, a sort of ATV with optional gunner in the back, and the favorite Chopper which is slightly harder to drive than a Ghost or Warthog for me but with spinning blades in front and cannons, it's easy to mow down enemies. Air units in the campaign are really only relagated to one part though there's a couple of parts where you can ride a Scorpion but Banshees on the ground are strangely absent unless you shoot one from the sky.One thing that I love the addition of is co-op for the campaign since as most can tell you, Legendary achievement can be a ***** and having up to 3 additional friends to help you out not only cancels out the weak friendly AI but speeds up the process since it isn't as wall-making every 10 minutes. Also you can find skulls within the game which will add special effects to the game. Some are just goofy like headshots on grunts will cause confetti to be thrown into the air complete with a \"hurray!\" soundbit while others will give enemies more grenade tossing capabilities or even have weapons have less ammo when picked up with the benefit being they add multipliers for a level score. Getting the achievements will require you to add more than one and it adds a nice arcade-y feel.What's made Halo 3 so popular since it came out is its multiplier and got to give it to Bungie for their commitment to the thing. 3 map packs plus a free redesigned one, title updates and countless players online, it makes for a bit of an addictive play. My only gripe is that like most MP games, you have to vote on a map and should the majority wins you get another map/game type automatically. However it's not like say Call of Duty IV where you're specifically in Capture the Flag or King of the Hill and the changes are the maps, you can be in one gametype, map gets vetoed and thrown into an entirely different map and game type. Plus let's face it: you've never seen as much snotty brats, arrogant punks and racist slurs as you can with the community in Halo 3. In fact, I think I heard the racist slur ***got near 20+ times in one match so be prepared to mute.With a near endless supply of players, looooong list of achievements and a fun campaign, Halo 3 has enough value for 60 bucks. Just depends on whether or not you can see past the hype and all that other stuff.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"PS2 Bruce","summary":"It's OK-Pretty Fair Game","reviewText":"Of course everyone knew that this game would not live up to the extreme hype-that's a given. I played Halo 1 and 2, and liked them pretty well, but ws never a fanatic or anything-i like shooters, but am not that skilled at them i prefer the 'free roam' type games like GTA Saints Row, etc rather than traditional FPS, which, after all is what the Halo games are.I usually pick up all the major releases for 360; I figure that if I really don't like a game, I can trade the premium titles in for a good exchange anyway; I usually try to play through the game at least once to see how the story goes; if the multiplayer is good I might keep it for a longer time. My favorite games of course I hang on to.  I got this a few days after it came out. The graphics are OK-like most 360 games the cut scenes are better rendered than the game play but the graphics are still quite good. The weapons, from what I remember, are similar to the first 2 games, the controls are the same which is good.I'm playing on normal level and still die quite a bit (again Im not good at shooters). Once there are Brutes around I'm dead. The things that giggle at you are annoying but pretty easy to kill. I know it's blasphemy in some circles, but to me, this is a fair game, nothing too bad, but not earthshaking either. I think Gears Of War was better-and that game, although very good didn't live up the the hype either (to be fair, I don't think any game can).Bottom Line: If you liked Halo 1 and 2, you will like this. If you're not much for shooters, (a) it will be hard and (b) it may not impress you. Also I would not buy a 360 just to play this. GTA IV, yes. This, no.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2007"}

First off it is kind of hard and confusing at parts, might frustrate some gamers. And another thing that is really dumb - you are followed by this annoying little dinosaur that you have to feed and everything for about 3/4 of the game and it gets really annoying. You'll wish that you could kill that little pipsqueak.Here is a tip for anyone who owns this game - when you have to blow up those two dinos on the hoverbikes at the snow level, there is a really easy way to do it. At the first of the track, go over the hill which they will go around. You should come out in front of them. Then when you get to the small cave, just hold *B* button to brake and they will keep slamming into you and both of them will blow up. Then just joyride to the end of the track.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2004"}

It is a good system and at the time I was really impressed with what it offered. No memory cards required and the ability to burn CD's onto the hard drive made it very appealing. However, there were some drawbacks. Having to buy a remote(I can't help it, why buy a remote if you have a controller...) to watch DVD's seemed a bit ridiculous. The first design for the Xbox controller was also terrible in my opinion. Seriously, it was way too big(like holding a turtle shell). The S-controller that they later released was perfect, though. All in all, the first Xbox was a great machine. As far as I know there weren't any big issues like the RROD. I think there was some sort of power cord issue(fire hazard) but that had to do with someone leaving their machine on for days without catching it(these weren't meant to be left on all the time). With some great games over the years, the original Xbox has some reasons to be acknowledged. I give it four and a half stars, only removing half a star because of the remote thing(give me a break).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2013"}

After first being introduced to HALO last summer and then having become accustomed to it because of my fall roommates non-stop playing of games on XBOX, I finally broke down and ended up purchasing a XBOX.  In many ways, I find the system to be superior over the Playstation 2 I purchased several years ago. Unlike the Playstations systems, there is no extra game cards that one has to purchase to save your progress in your game. Instead, each games progress is saved directly to the hard-drive-type memory that makes up the bulk of the game system. This is a huge plus. Another benefit is that the games that are available are some of the most visually stunning on the market (outside of some PC games).  Nevertheless, the XBOX does have a few negatives.  For one, DVDs won't play on an XBOX without buying a separate DVD kit (the PS2 system allows DVDs to be played automatically).  Also, there are really only a handful of XBOX games available on the market. PS2 games dominate the market and Nintendo isn't far behind, but XBOX is lucky to have a tenth of the games on those other systems combined. Still, if you like to play video games and enjoy playing some of the best of the best, the XBOX might not be too bad of an investment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2005"}
{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","reviewerName":"badazzps","summary":"Wow, just wow","reviewText":"I'm not very good at writing reviews, plus there are plenty of great reviews here, so I won't go into details. I finished the game yesterday and needed a break before starting my review. I completed 100% at 19 hours and 28 minutes on normal. The game is as of right now, the best experience I've had in a videogame, bumping down Uncharted 2 to second place; a far second place.I couldn't help notice that most reviews, especially the low reviews, were from individuals that didn't even get half way through the game. Some of them had about two hours of gameplay and they're calling this boring and unoriginal. Might not have the best story ever, but the way Naughty Dog delivered it was amazing. They did an exceptional job presenting the story of how the characters grow on each other. And the voice acting puts most Hollywood movies to shame.If all these people would get at least to the winter portion, they would change their mind, as winter has plenty of variation, and one of the most intense, scary parts in the game.It is true that you get no choices during gameplay for a different outcome. Well, this is not that type of game. Naughty Dog had a specific ending in mind that wanted you to experience, and believe me, it's worth it. The choices you had in the game are the ways you can approach the enemies. You can stealth you way through most of the areas, or you can simply take them out one by one. While supplies are limited and you need to think about how to use them, I never found myself low on anything, had plenty of supplies all the time. Crafting items was done perfectly. Everything was done during gameplay along with using health kits, which take some time, so make sure you're in a safe area.Lets talk about the cons. Glitches, I understand that some people had some. I, thankfully, didn't experience a single one. I have the fat PS3, the one released on 2008, not the one that plays PS2 games, with a 500GB HDD installed. Not sure if it makes a difference. Also the bad AI, well, I only had Ellie get in front of the enemy once throughout the whole game, and she didn't give away the position, so it didn't affect the gameplay. This is the thing, Ellie will follow you closely when enemies are there, and if there's no room for two where you are, she will still try to be close to you, sometimes putting her right in front of the bad guys.I don't recommend playing this game when little kids are around, as there are plenty of F bombs, half of them from Ellie, lol. Also, the gore towards the end is pretty intense.For those of you who haven't played the game or haven't finished it, go ahead and give it a shot. It will be worth it. Might not be for everyone, and I can understand that. As for me, I loved every second of it. I had so many different emotions, I was scared, I was tense, I was depressed, and the ending just left me thinking. Could there be a sequel? Sure, it's possible, I just hope that there isn't as it ended beatifully.Thank you Sony, thank you Naughty Dog, you guys really know how to please your customers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002GPPPS4","description":"","reviewerName":"ReToM7 \"Patrick\"","summary":"Far cry from series, but not in a bad way!","reviewText":"Who doesn't love Castlevania? Awesome monsters, awesome boss fights, awesome surroundings, awesome music, and awesome weaponry make for an epic adventure. This game, however, is MUCH different from any other Castlevania made to date.The bottom line here is whether or not you enjoy 3-D action games like God of War or Dante's Inferno. If the answer is 'yes', then keep reading. If the answer is 'no', you're not going to enjoy this game.This game starts off a little slow in order to learn the controls. The controls are easy to learn, but definately have moments where the combination of poor camera angles and shotty controls can lead to death and frustration. Most times, they work, but sometimes you have to modify timing or positioning. Camera angles tend to be on the okay side of things, but in multiple enemy fights and boss fights, a zoomed in camera can be trouble. It's hard to see what's behind you and move appropriately. Also, the controls tend to lean on the action game trick of button mashing. The benefit of this game is that you have lots of upgradable options as to HOW your weapon moves instead of just whip, whip, whip, knife. This breaks it up a little bit, but in the end, you'll be button mashing.The enemies are pretty well varied and the boss fights range from epic to not-so-much, but they are all fun. Some are harder than others, but like any of these games, once you learn the pattern, you can get through it pretty easily. I ran the game on the regular difficulty and have no interest in going back for the extreme difficulty. I thought normal was hard enough for me.The story is engaging, the cut scenes are frequent and nicely done, the game is long, the upgrades lead you to go back and replay levels with new items just to get to new places, and the unlockable artwork is very nicely done and anyone who appreciated the art and design in these levels should also enjoy it.The minigames are fun from time to time, but a lot of it just centers around pressing Y or X at the right moment. I am fine with these, though it's kind of pointless in certain spots.Overall, this game is a must for any fan of the series. It's a great story and sets up for a great 2nd game. No spoilers here though. I would definately recommend. Reason it was not a 5-star was because of many spots where frustration levels were high because of faulty camera angles and mechanics that should have been a lot easier.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"James Skemp \"JamesRSkemp.com\"","summary":"Reboot: Successful","reviewText":"I've never bought a Tomb Raider game before this one. Actually, I did buy the Lara Croft PSN/Xbox Live game, but that's not really a Tomb Raider game in the classic sense. I also received a free copy of Tomb Raider: Underworld via PlayStation Plus, but I've yet to finish it, and don't have much drive to.However, Tomb Raider is not only the first Lara Croft game I've paid full price for, but one of a very few games I've picked up almost immediately after it was released. And it wasn't a bad decision.After playing Tomb Raider I not only cared about Lara's story, I want it to continue. I want to pick up Tomb Raider 2 (or whatever they call it).So it has a good story. How about the game play? I dare say that it's taken what Uncharted has done and stepped it up a level. Done what Darksiders II should have done to successfully follow up Darksiders' Zelda-like features. It is a sandbox game that knows when to stop expanding, and when to draw the story to a close.The only issue I really have with the game is the multiplayer. Trophies/achievements give you an idea of what the developers were thinking. Almost a third of the trophies/achievements for this game are in multiplayer. However, the multiplayer is, at best, lackluster. And with the announcement that future DLC will only be for the multiplayer, I'm disappointed they felt they had to throw MP into an otherwise solid game.Despite this, it takes nothing away from the core experience. It is a solid game, and I found it to be well worth the $60, and at less than that it would be a steal.5 of 5 stars (or 9 out of 10).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2013"}

{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"Blown away","reviewText":"In the end credit sequence, Crystal Dynamics makes a statement that they worked their hardest to deliver the best game possible.And I'll be damned if they didn't succeed.Every now and then, a game comes along and blows you away on all fronts...graphics, gameplay, sound, and (most importantly for me) story.  My wife is not a gamer and rarely sits down to watch anything, but she could not tear herself away for the first two hours.  To accomplish that feat required a well-delivered product that combines an almost movie-like experience with extremely tight gameplay.  The Uncharted series did that for me.Tomb Raider is another game of that esteemed caliber.Here we see Lara Croft, adventurous but unproven, heading off on an expedition to find the lost kingdom of Yamatai.  But the ship that she's on, the Endurance, runs afoul of a very nasty storm and is subsequently shipwrecked.  Separated from her friends, Lara is vulnerable, afraid, and has a very minimal set of survival skills.What follows is a fantastic story, following Lara as a human being and not an anatomically drawn caricature targeted at the male demographic.  Along the way, Lara learns what she can to survive...and her first kill is a very emotional one that gripped me as surely as it did her character in the game.Gameplay--------Without ruining the story further, let's just say that there are elements from the original Tomb Raider, but it's enhanced way beyond that.  You will be learning to salvage scrap in order to fabricate weapon improvements throughout the game.  Just when you think that there aren't any further improvements, Crystal Dynamics \"ah ha!\"s you with another set.  You'll have your usual complement of weapons including a pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, and bow.  Ohhhh, the bow...my favorite...there are sooo many enhancements and game play elements around this weapon alone including your ability to create zip lines using suitable environmental anchors and poles that are positioned every now and then.  But the brilliant aspect of each weapon is that they start off as rusted antiques!  They gradually become formidable weapons (or you receive replacements that will include your upgrades) as you improve them gradually through the game.  And as you improve them, your adversaries get tougher and better equipped; the game provides the best and most striking example of perfectly balanced gameplay that I've ever seen.And it's not just weapons!  Lara \"levels up\" as she defeats enemies, hunts animals, unlocks secret tombs, etc.  The leveling up goes toward three generalized skillsets, namely Survival, Hunter, and Brawler.  Each one deals with a particular facet of your environment, ability to shoot, and your ability to \"suck it up\" in a fight, respectively.  While some skills don't appear to be as valuable as others, I found myself surprised that taking one particular skill actually provided to be a huge boon in my ability to gain experience faster and enhancing my ability to discover secrets.  There are tough choices to be sure.  So as Lara starts off the game, you'll find her aim to be shaky, unsure, and subject to all sorts of \"wild fire\" moments.  Gradually, like her character, her skills become more fine tuned as she rises to the occasion as the game progresses.In addition to unlocking secret tombs, each area of the island has its own particular set of challenges (light all the statues with a torch, etc.) that will drive someone with OCD nuts.  There are also collectibles in the form of journals, relics, and GPS caches.  I'm borderline OCD in that regard and quite the completionist as a result.  Some of these challenges will serve as head-scratching moments for you, however (\"how do I get THERE?!?\"), that will require certain weapon/tool enhancements gained later through the game that will have you coming back to previously explored areas.  Yes, the island is dotted with \"camp sites\", some of which allow you to \"fast travel\" from one area of the island to another previously discovered one.  It's that kind of ingenuity that Crystal Dynamics has buried into this game that begs you to challenge yourself and \"do it all.\"Graphically-----------Never since Uncharted have I seen a game look so pretty.  Sure, Bioshock Infinite was beautiful too, but a lot of that had to do with the gratuitous use of light blooms, flares, and other trickery...don't get me wrong, I love it, but it's just not delivering the sharp, gritty, and \"wow that looks amazingly real\" moments that this game does.  If Uncharted was a 10 graphically, Tomb Raider is a 9.8...it comes so close, but it occasionally has a framerate hiccup.  Those are VERY RARE, but when they happen, it's noticeable...rest assured, however, that it doesn't hamper the gameplay at all.  It looks fantastic!  The only reason that I can think to explain the occasional hiccup is simply because of the non-exclusive nature that Tomb Raider is.  You can't satisfy every platform as a result without making some minute sacrifices in the coding.  I'm not sure which platform looks better, but, that said, it's stunning despite the extremely minor flaws.All in all, this is a game that you should check out.  Tomb Raider received the well-deserved reboot that it did.  Don't pass this one up; it's worth every single penny.  Crystal Dynamics earned their pay.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2013"}

The main character moves through neo-Paris via jumping from building to building similar to Lara Croft's ledge climbing and swinging.  The biggest disappointment for me, however, was the memory rewind sequence.  The main character has the ability to go into a person's mind, rewind their memories and change them subtly to make a specific outcome be what they believe as truth.  Again, visually stunning and the controls work perfectly.  The actual application of this ability just wasn't exciting.  Also, I found that I just didn't really like or care about the characters.  The whole gameplay experience was just very blah.  I am a huge fan of Deus Ex and I was hoping for a similar experience with Remember Me but it just wasn't there.

{"product_name":"B003PHLTDC","description":"","reviewerName":"Theresa Winfrey","summary":"The next step in the evolution of the third-person shooter genre","reviewText":"Many people give too much credit to Cliffy B. and Gears of War for the current state of the over-the-shoulder third-person shooter genre today. They forget about the foundation that Shinji Mikami laid whilst working on the critically acclaimed modern classic: Resident Evil 4. Cliffy B. explicitly stated that RE4 was a huge inspiration for GoW and that \"if you're gonna copy something, why not copy from the best?\". While GoW made some advancements in the genre, Mikami takes it to the next level in Vanquish.Pros:+ Graphics and art direction combine stylized art direction with a futuristic realism to arrive at a slick medium+ Anime-like storyline. Play this with Japanese voices and English subtitles, imagine that it's hand-drawn or cel-shaded 3D, and you can easily see how this could be an anime that you would watch+ Option to use the superior Japanese voice-overs+ Refined, polished, and streamlined gameplay that is free of needless exploration or puzzle-solving+ The innovations: Boosting and ARS mode (slow-mo)+ Light RPG elements: upgrade your weapons by picking up the same weapon in the field while your ammo is maxedCons:+ Life-bars over enemies take away the immersiveness of the battle and instead makes you aware that you are playing a video game. You hence look for your aiming reticule to turn red (so that you know you will damage the enemy) instead of aiming at your enemy. Some people like bars and meters all over the screen; I do not.+ Uniform upward recoil. When you shoot your weapon, the recoil causes your aim to go up. However, it simply does that. It doesn't shake left, right or down. It continues going straight up. This is not realistic, and it annoyed me at first; however, as I continued through the game, I anticipated this and would sometimes aim below a target and then shoot, for I knew the crosshairs would soon reach my target.+ Dying incurs a penalty that automatically downgrades your weapons in \"Normal\" difficulty and above. Why have this penalty? Or better yet, why would I play a difficult section over with my weapons downgraded? After realizing that my weapons were being downgraded upon death, I simply exited the game and loaded a previous check-point. This is an unnecessary penalty that simply makes the user waste time.+ One-hit deaths. This is arguably necessary because of the rebounding health meter. If you could simply hide all the time, then you could never die. However, it is frustrating to die in the heat of battle because you missed dodging the one-hit-death move from a boss while you were focused on killing one of its minions.Parting Thoughts:Yes. This is better than Gears of War. I got bored of GoW and was unimpressed by its graphics. Vanquish is a thrill-ride that must be played. It is sad that games without multiplayer are immediately deemed inferior by the mainstream \"'Call of Duty' gamer\". I hope that games like this continue to be made. As long as intelligent gamers like us exist, it will be a reality. Thank you for reading this review, and have a great day.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2011"}

First I want to say if you are looking into a next gen console I think the ps3 is the way to go for many reasons.-The games are fun and origional, with more games for hardcore gamers coming out like socom(32 online) with clan tournaments around the world, and resistance 2(60 player online), and fun games for everyone like ratchet and clank out now and little big planet coming in october.-Sony is going to put out a more quality network with amazing features like Home. The psn is getting bett er with update 2.41, it's on par with XBL about and it's freeeee!-The cell processor makes games bigger and better! Ray Tracing (real time reflecting and refracting of light) is somthing only the cell processor can do and it makes games come to life(such as in gran turismo 5), and developers are using parallel processing to make HUGE games like in resistance 2, and they have only began to tap into it's power.-You get an entire entertainment system along with an amazing game console. The ps3 has a blu-ray player, wi-fi, hdmi 1.3, web surfing capabilities(although not as good as surfing the net on a comp, it is still the real deal, I was watching you tube videos great on the ps3 the other day), and the ps3 and psn have the best games IMO.-the controller is the six axis and re-done classic duel shock, the vibrations in the duel shock are so amazing, if a bomb goes off far away the contoller mimics how the ground would shake a little, and everyone I have talked to prefers it over the 360 controller for comfort and design.-The hard drive can be upgraded to any laptop hard drive you find, I found a 300 gig on tiger direct for 80 bucks! It's very easy to make it your boot drive for the ps3, the ps3 owners manual and some you tube videos show you how, ps3's competitor only has one uprgade, a 120 gig microsoft hard drive.!!KEEP IN MIND!! the 40 gig is not backwards compatible for ps2 and ps1 games, also no ps3 memory card slot. But if you want the ps3 experience for 100 dollars less, get the 40 gig. If you don't mind paying 100 dollars more, then you get the ps3, metal gear solid 4, and a duel shock 3 controller, which is in my mind the best controller ever made by man.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2008"}

StoryTheGod of Warfranchise tells the tragic and violent story of the warrior Kratos and his dealings with the gods. The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt.

{"product_name":"B000MUXLOK","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"A nice change of pace","reviewText":"I am not a fan of racing games.  With the exception of silly ones that end with the word \"Kart,\" I stay far, far away from this genre.  That said, I AM a fan of huge explosions, causing chain reactions from said explosions and figuring out intricate ways to cause all sorts of virtual mayhem.  It's because of this second part that I enjoy the Burnout series.But Burnout has become a stagnant series, in my opinion, with subsequent sequels simply tweaking the modes and gameplay while relying on slicker graphics to attract gamers.  And so it is that we have Burnout Paradise, a game that tries to completely re-invent the series by making it more about an open world.This completely changes the way the game plays, both for the good and the bad.  The freedom to traverse a beautiful city, see the sights and plan your attack is liberating and makes the game feel less like a racing game.  This isn't Grand Theft Auto, so don't expect to see cops trailing you for the mayhem you cause.  If anything, it's an explosion simulator.While you're busy driving around the city, you'll come across many events for you to partake of.  These events are grouped into five categories, Race, Marked Man, Road Rage, Burning Route and Stunt Run.  Race and Marked Man have you racing around the city, with Marked Man having other cars chasing you.  Road Rage has you attempting to destroy as many cars as you can withint a set time limit and Burning Route is a time trial, using a certain car.  My favorite is the Stunt Run, which tags you with trying to string combos together with various stunts ( boosts, jumps, drifts, reverse driving, near misses, etc.).The controls feel just right and spot on.  A lot of recent driving games have felt loose to me and it was nice to \"get behind the wheel\" and feel like I actually had control over my car.  I've already mentioned the graphics (they're beautiful in case you missed it) and the sound is also meaty, with some nice explosions and a pleasant soundtrack adding to the immersion.Utilizing varous system-specific peripherals (Xbox Live Vision in this case), you can take a picture for your driver's license and when you take the game online, you'll show your driver's license to whoever you're playing against.  It's kind of a cool feature.Since this game has been out for awhile, you can also partake in some expansions that add a ton of different content and modes to both the online and offline game.  So it's nice to see Criterion support the game post release, especially with some of the free updates.The biggest problem is one inherent in an open-ended game.  It's easy to lose focus and pacing when you're not being pulled along a more linear course.  I think this change is a good one for Burnout, but, unfortunately, as far as the crashing goes I think the earlier games were better.  That said, it's nice to see a company not simply coast through with minor tweaks and actually release a product that dares to be different.  It's still the best place to go if you want to cause untold amount of car-related virtual destruction.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2008"}

From a visual standpoint, this game is very impressive.  Lots of colorful characters we all know and love, as well as lively ballparks and smooth sports action.This one, however, is really for the kids.  This is due to the cartoonish, gimmicky style of play that Mario Baseball has to offer.  For example, Donkey Kong doesn't use a bat when he steps up to the plate, he uses a boxing glove.  A couple of other creatures use rods.  One one of the ballfields there is a stream running through the outfield, and on another, giant plants that will gobble up the baseball.  This isn't baseball in the purest form, but more of a Saturday cartoon version of the sport.

{"product_name":"B003O6KWZK","description":"","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Twisted Metal...........","reviewText":"Listening to everything about the game leading up to its' release had me anticipating this game but still skeptical (to a certain extent) as games that usually get alot of media attention turn out to be not so good to me. Well, thankfully, Eat Sleep Play delivered a game that far excceds my expectations and then some. All that media attention was justified. This is an event that shouldn't be missed by PS3 owners.Like other games in the series, Twisted Metal is about a competition that takes place by the same name. Twisted Metal is ran by a man named Calypso, who has the power to grant the winner of the competition a single wish. Course, there's a lesson to be learned when dealing with Calypso...Be careful what you wish for. This time, though, Twisted Metal is quite different. This time around, only three competitors compete(which takes place in three chapters of the story mode)...Mr. Grimm, Dollface, and everyone's favorite: Sweet Tooth.Each of the drivers bring along cronies forming three gangs that wage war against one another. All three groups(and a fourth in MP) have access to every vehicle which means that they can drive other vehicles besides the ones they are most well-known for.  Each chapter comes filled with difficult challenges and ends with a boss encounter. Make no mistake, folks, this ain't no cakewalk. Just like Twisted Metal Black, this game increases in difficulty rather quickly and can be hard as nails. The thing I noticed about this game is, unlike past games in the series, the cars handle quite differently. If it is bigger, it moves more slowly and is harder to bring down. whereas if the car is smaller, it moves alot faster and can be brought down quickly.I was particularly blown away by the levels that you play in. Just as in TM:Black, the levels are massive when compared to earlier entries in the series. My favorite level has to be the Killoseum(which is constantly changing on you and is much more dangerous). Everything looks nearly photo-realistic now, graphically, and the TM universe feels more alive now.The single-player campaign is short but sweet and satisfying. Multiplayer is where the game really shines. Taking TM online has a good bit of potential and, once everyone learns the intricacies of the game, we're definitely going to see some real competition take hold. As in any TM game, I had more fun playing against other Twisted Metal fans than with the game's AI.The only fault I had with the game is it takes a little getting used to the new control scheme. Once you've become accustomed with it, it feels pretty natural. I also found the lock-on target system frustrating at times and didn't really care for it all that much.It's hard to believe that Twisted Metal has been around for over 15 years now. It's good to see this series grow, with this installment. I'm glad they took certain risks with this game. It shows. If this game doesn't win \"Game of the Year\" this year(or some type of award, at least), then- we got some pretty shallow gamers out there. Put simply, Twisted Metal is insane fun.

The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"David \"Black Widow 2014\"","summary":"good game","reviewText":"this ganme was very entertaining i really enjoyed it i'm not to fond of these types of games but goldeneye was awesome.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000034DMG","reviewerName":"J. N. K \"Esco\"","summary":"A Great Story of Fear, Death and Loathing","reviewText":"Both a technical and narrative wonder of its day, this game easily set, and in a way continues to set, the standard in modern-day gaming.To start off, this game is gorgeous. It's backdrops are stunningly real and complex, its movement quality is superb, and William Birkin, the big baddie is designed better than most Hollywood creations I have seen.  True, I would be lying if I didn't admit to the game's visuals as being outdated by today's standard; shattering glass and blood effects do look rather silly today.  However, coming out only a couple of months after Final Fantasy VII, one can see a character model boost.  Once one person said that graphics become outdated, but art remains the same -- these locations aren't polygons, or large sprites, they're coplete sets!Another aspect I really loved is the sound. Let me tell you that I bought the soundtrack when it was on sale, thinking I would never really listen to it much. Then I learned why in the end credits THREE composer names were mentioned, the music is actually grand. The ambiant music is terrifying by itself, and the music during the scenes is quite amazing, and the end credit theme of scenario 1 is a very powerful track, I have yet to hear an equal, even from Hollywood and Squaresoft. Also, while the voice acting needs work here and there, it is a serious improvement over the original, and Paul Haddad, who plays Leon Kennedy suits the character and tone extreamely well.Finally, lets talk movie aspects: story and atmosphere. Both: great. The story is rather unique, twisty, and sometimes powerful.  Strangely, I felt a lot of emotion from Annette Birkin most of all (the zombie creator's wife); I could feel the love she held for her dead husband (who didn't necessarily mean to kill thousands of people), and as I played over and over, I went from hating her to actually feeling really bad for her. Also, one particular character dies in two different ways (the two scenarios), and both scenes are very strong and movie worthy. Both scenes feature great music, and she dies in a different way, with the drama being delivered to you in different ways (you have to see it to understand, I can't explain well enough myself).All in all, if you truly understand it, this is one of the few games that can be best described as an experience, as you watch it as much as you can play it, yet it still focuses on gameplay. My freind Sean owns this game, and can't stand playing it, yet he refuses to return it, since watching this game being played by someone else truly is just as good; he's proven it to me by sitting and not even looking away from the TV as I play for hours at a time when I play and he's around.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2000"}
{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"T Boz","summary":"The Greatest Zelda Game so Far","reviewText":"It's a rare occasion in the video game industry when a game series consistently manages to top itself one game after the next, but that's exactly what Nintendo manages to do with the Zelda franchise.  I thought Ocarina of Time would never be dethroned as my favorite game of all time, but Twilight Princess is actually better.  Started as a GameCube title, this action-RPG really shines with the Wii controls.  Slashing your sword, shooting arrows, and especially fishing are both rewarding and accurately mapped to the Wiimote, and let's not forget the graphics.  Ever since the days of the N64, Zelda has become a benchmark for the graphics power of Nintendo's systems.  True, it has GameCube graphics, but so much time and effort went into creating this living, breathing world that minor jaggies aren't that big a deal.  We are already seeing the full graphics potential of the system with upcoming games like Mario Galaxy and Smash Bros.  Anyway, the story is dark for a Zelda game, which I love, the characters are fantastic, and the action never stops!  The levels are so detailed, I have regularly run across random hidden holes and gone spelunking for nearly an hour, finding all kinds of hidden treasures and fighting spiders and other creatures.  Another great feature of this game is the length, this is definitely the longest Zelda game ever, and you can literally find things to do for months after you buy it.  Do yourself a favor, if you buy a Wii, you HAVE to buy this game, as it's a masterpiece.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2007"}

There is a story line on this game which in my opinion is pretty good. There is also tons of action in this game. The decision of going 2d-3d was a wonderful idea. I really have no issues on the camera like many reviewers have complained about. The graphics and sound are pretty good too. For anyone who has not played Metroid Other M, it is a no brainer to pick this game up. CMon, for the price is selling right now its basically an awesome gift straight from Nintendo.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2011"}
