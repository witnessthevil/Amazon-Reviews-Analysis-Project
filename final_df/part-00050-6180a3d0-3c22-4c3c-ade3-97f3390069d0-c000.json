This is something I'll definitely be doing on weekday mornings.  I just completed my first workout.  I chose 15 min. to ease into it. I'll do 30 min. tomorrow. There was a fitness test in the beginning.  I'm assuming it's not required every time I workout, but it took about 10 min.  As I already knew, I'm still overweight so obviously I chose my fitness goal to return to my desired weight.  I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of the menus, the options & feedback you provide during the workout so personal trainer \"Maya\" can adjust the next workout to better suit your needs.  I'm very encouraged at making positive progress in the next few months.  I like the choices of music, exercises workouts, backgrounds, & the virtual trainer.  I especially like how the moves are easy to duplicate (I didn't use the tutorial, but I will in the future if there are moves I don't know).  I love exercising alone so this is ideal for me.  I'm 42.  I'm going to take it over to my Mom (71) & see if she likes it too before I buy one for her. She just needs to maintain her fitness as she's pretty strong & ideal weight.  This exercise game is for adults (& probably teenagers). In other words, my step-grandkids won't be interested in doing this workout - which is fine since I bought this for myself.My husband asked me if I was replacing my Wii Fit Plus with this one.  So in case there's anyone out there who is wondering the same thing, I love Wii Fit Plus & will continue to use it (I have made progress but I've never felt like I had a super challenging workout & I highly recommend it for low-impact workout & fun games). I plan to be doing both My Fitness Coach (mornings) & Wii Fit Plus (afternoons)during the week.I'm a newbie to this game so I'll add more insight as I progress.  I just wanted to write a quick note about it.  I hesitated on buying this because I figured it wouldn't be challenging enough or a duplicate of my other games.  I'm happy to report it is different & useful.  If you're serious about working out, I highly recommend this workout game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2011"}

There are zombie parrots and poodles on the loose as well as a couple of nonzombie hard to kill psychopaths (the grocery store manager with a shopping cart completely rigged up with knives and rakes around the edges is pretty cool).  The people he is rescuing can be quite funny (a couple of Japanese tourists who don't speak English and keep running away from him).  Finally, there are stores throughout the mall where he can change clothes (everything from a sexy dress to a snazzy suit) and pick up unusual weapons (buckets, traffic cones, soccer balls, golf clubs).

{"product_name":"B0009XEC02","description":"Third installment of the popular SRPG series.  First for the DS handheld.","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Advance Wars is a blast","reviewText":"The Advance Wars series is the best handheld strategy series to date. Using a simple interface but complex tactics, Advance Wars has always been a game that the hardest of hardcore or the newest of newbies could pick up and enjoy. Nintendo and Intelligent Systems have managed to bring all of the strategic action to the Nintendo DS in the best way possible, Advance Wars: Dual Strike.Advance Wars was great, but Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising took everything and made it better. Similarly, Dual Strike is basically AW2 with a lot of new stuff and a continuing story. The Black Hole army was defeated but once again they're trying to recover and gain power. It's up to the Allied Nations of Orange Star, Blue Moon, Yellow Comet, and Green Earth to rise against the Black Hole forces and silence them once and for all. New Commanding Officers come into play and mix up the story, but the old protagonist Andy has been replaced by an annoying new guy named Jake. Jake wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't an Orange version of your typical suburban wannabe...but that's a different story.The gameplay remains largely intact, with the same turn-based stuff we've all played and loved for four years. Each side gets a turn and the battle cycles around until a headquarters location is captured or all units of one side are destroyed. There are 25 units (which includes six all-knew units) at your disposal, ranging from infantry units to stealth planes. Using different types of terrain for transportation and defense, the goal is to finish each battle with as much success and as few casualties as possible. Every once in a while during the campaign, players are forced to complete missions within a certain number of days or before a missile explodes overhead. These different parameters require for near-perfect strategizing, so progression through the game takes a lot of skill. Capturing different properties is as vital as ever, especially when you factor one of the new properties. Also, using COs and their CO Powers effectively makes things much easier or harder, depending on your skill. As I said, there are several new COs and getting used to their different strengths and weaknesses is going to take a lot of practice.Some big things that really change the gameplay are the introduction of dual-screen combat as well as tag-team battles with multiple COs. Sometimes it's up to you to win the war on two fronts and defeat an enemy CO while also fighting a completely separate battle at the same time. These matches require a lot of attention and detail because they're essentially two battles in one. Choosing the proper CO for each battle is only the start, because victory or defeat can make or break the whole battle. Fortunately you can control both COs if you wish, but there's an option for AI-controlled COs for newer players. I found myself controlling the other CO myself, because the AI-controlled COs usually went and got themselves killed pretty quickly.The tag-team battles make up the second half of the game, where you fight a normal battle with two COs. You can switch between the two at any time and take advantage of their capabilities, which makes things interesting. For example, series veteran Max has always been good with tanks but is terrible with indirect units like Rockets and Artillery. If I were getting pounded away by enemy Artillery, I'd probably want to switch Max for another CO so I could counter the enemy without having to get too close. However, if the enemy decided to change its plan and send tanks after me, Max's superior firepower would take care of them with ease. Furthermore, the multiple COs can now unleash what is called a Dual Strike (hence the subtitle in the game's name), where both COs use their CO Powers and attack in the same round. Being attacked with a Dual Strike can ruin an entire battle, but hitting your foes with a Dual Strike gives a much higher chance of winning.In addition to a 28-mission campaign, there are several other options that deserve credit. Nintendo provides an excellent multiplayer option, allowing up to eight players to wage war using only one cartridge. Also, the War Room mode from the previous games makes a return. New gameplay modes include Survival and Combat. In Survival mode, you are given limited time, funds, or turns and you must finish the battle before that limit is reached. Combat mode is interesting to say the least. It's basically a real-time game where players drive around manually and shoot with the A button. Capturing buildings and destroying units is as simple as before, but you don't take turns doing it. It's not a big enough experience to call a full game, but if anything, it might be interesting to call it a very basic handheld preview of the GameCube's upcoming Battalion Wars.Something that surprised me was the fact that Dual Strike has good music. Nintendo has never been known to develop the best MIDI handheld tunes, but Advance Wars sounds pretty good. Finally I can play a Nintendo game without turning the music off. The sound effects pack a punch for such a small game, as well. In the graphical department Advance Wars excels with updated graphics from the previous games in the series. The map itself looks similar, but the archaic structures now look a little more modern with a slightly three-dimensional look. The actual cut-scenes through which battles are shown look much better than before. The animation is cleaner, the color is brighter, and the explosions look much more fiery.I'm just going to come out blunt in conclusion: I love this game. Nintendo and Intelligent Systems have served up three straight strategic masterpieces. The Advance Wars series has always been good, and fans of strategy or the AW series should definitely buy Dual Strike. It's easily the best DS game, and I might go out on a limb to say that it's my favorite strategy game. Advance Wars rocks.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2005"}

Is a follow up to the GBA version that was extremely loved for it's strange gameplay. Nintendo took that idea and put it on the DS. Was this obviously going to happen? I sure thought so; and few times I've wondered: was the DS actually made because someone had the idea for a Wario Ware game you could... erm... touch? I'll take you through the PROs and CONs, as well as my opinion on graphics,sound,control, and fun.PROs: You can now \"Touch\" ( hence the name ), plenty of minigames, a lot of unlockables, 5 dollars cheaper than many other DS games currently around.CONs: Though there's replay value, it's not the same going back through minigames you've played a few hundred times over, too short, too easy, not even worth the price in some ways.Graphics: 4/5. You have to appreciate these graphics somewhat. This is a cartoon game, obviously, but it also takes on some strange graphics. From semi-realistic looking kittens, to some paper-cutout-looking graphics, to a 3D box of matches. The graphics are all different and don't really have one main kind of look.Sound: 4/5. The sound is decent; there are some decent tunes in and out the game, such as the character \"Ashley\" who has her own song. The little sounds that go throughout the game are also pretty good, and the faster the game gets, the faster the sound gets, which makes you get pretty twitchy and into the game.Control: 4/5. This game uses the stylus and stylus only; literally. There is nothing in this game you can do with the D-Pad or any other buttons, unless you want to pause the game. After going through all the games then going through again and again, you can easily get corpal tunnel if you're immune to getting it. The games are just repetetive.Fun: 4/5. There are so many things to say about this game; it's Warioware with use of a stylus to \"get in the game\", you can use the DS's microphone to play minigames ( definitely cool. ), there is an array of about 20 ( probably more ) mini-mini games. Warioware: Touched! Is awesome while it lasts, but after you've unlocked everything, there's not much to come back for. This game could be well worth a one week or two week rental, but it could also be worth a buy, it's really up to you. Do you want to be pulling toilet paper off a roll as fast as you can? Do you want to break objects with a blow dart? Do you want to poke bug's eyes? Do you like to do that over and over again? If you like to, you should buy this game.

The EA servers are BAD....real bad.  I have several friends who have problems even connecting to the EA server, and when they do it lasts about 5 minutes before being randomly disconnected.  I have had problems staying with a connection for more than about 30 minutes.  I have been both host and client, so it is not the other persons connection, it is not my connection....it is EA.  Next there is the fact you need a special code to engage in Extraction mode, which is similiar to Horde mode in Gears.  Nice job EA, take a lousy game and exclude some people from engaging in what may be the only decent mode in the game.  Next there is the Campaign Continue.  It is already difficult to find people to play with, but if you try to continue where you left off, and want to play with a random (non friends list) player....good luck.  The only way for someone to find you is for them to choose to start at the exact same checkpoint that you are attempting to start from.  Oh, and another thing (maybe some people would not care), the achievements are BUNK.  Example 1, a 50 pt achievement for playing all 16 rounds of Extraction Mode (which is extremely time consuming, but worse yet EXTRACTION IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR ALL PLAYERS!), there is also the case (which has just affected me), where you complete the entire game on the hardest difficulty (contractor) and do not get the achievment for it.  I can only assume I did not get it because at one point someone did join my game at Normal Difficulty for 2 chapters (while I stayed on Contractor).  I will go back and play chapters 4/5 and see if that gives it to me, but nonetheless, what a pain.All this and I have not even gotten to the clunky controls, the fact that you try to revive your partner and end up rolling past him, or sprinting past him.  The fact enemies often Phantom Spawm from places you cleared out or checked is also great.  Better yet, you try and spring up to cover and end up flying over it completely exposed and dead in less than 5 seconds.One last thing is the other Multiplayer modes.  They really are not terrible, they actually grow on you a bit, but again you have roughly a 40% chance of getting in a game with ridiculous, uncontrollable, unplayable lag. I was lucky enough to rent this game as I have several friends that are pissed off about spending their money on this garbage, I recommend you do not make the same mistake.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005MO5G","description":"Although the game will seem very familiar to Sonic fans,Sonic  Advanceis an entirely new creation that's been built from the ground up.  The gameplay, graphics, and sound borrow from the classic Sonic games on the  Genesis and are successfully translated to the Game Boy Advance. The game's  single-player modes are relatively short 2-D platform rounds--each run takes two  to three hours--but replay value is added through the game's various characters.  Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy each have different abilities that make getting  through the game a unique experience.The real star here is the game's link capabilities. The Chao Garden allows you  to raise your little critters and upload them to the GameCube via thelink cableandSonic Adventure 2:  Battle. Having one cartridge lets up to four GBA players compete in one  minigame. Gamers can play two additional minigames if each player owns a  cartridge. Although the single-player game is quite good, the link options give  the title tremendous value.The only notable problem stems from the series itself: There are still entirely  too many cheap deaths resulting from the title's high-speed gameplay. You'll  find yourself zipping along a level only to be hit by an obstacle you had little  chance of seeing, let alone avoiding. Ultimately, the only way to get past these  hazards is to memorize where they are. This minor flaw doesn't detract from the  game's excellent value, though.Sonic Advanceoffers a very good  single-player game and some of the best link options of any GBA title.--Raymond M. PadillaPros:Classic Sonic gameplayOutstanding link optionsFour characters add to replay valueCons:Classic Sonic cheap deathsSingle-player runs are short","reviewerName":"ATHF Fan","summary":"Not as good as the Sonics for Genesis, but still worth it","reviewText":"The first Video Game that I ever played was Sonic The Hedgehog 2. To this day, after Donkey Kong 64, it is my all time favorite video game. I also own The Original Sonic The Hedgehog, Sonic and Knuckles,  and Sonic 3D Blast, and have played, Sonic The Hedgehog 3, Sonic Spinball, Sonic CD, Dr.Robotnics Mean Machine (I think thats what it's called), Sonic R, and Sonic Adventure, and have enjoyed all of them. So when Sonic Advance came out, it was a no brainer that I was going to get it. After abandoning the 2d format with Sonic 3D Blast, and The Sonic Adventure Series, Sonic Team (the games developers) have gone back to the original 2D side scrolling format which I think was last seen in Sonic and Knuckles. This decision made the game very similar to the original 3 Sonic Games, and some may even consider this, Sonic the Hedgehog 4. The levels are all new (but a bit similar to some of the old levels), and the format where you face Robotnick at the end has been kept, but unlike in the Sonic the Hehgehog series, where you and/or a friend control one or two people on the screen at once, the game has the Sonic and Knuckles formula where you chose your character before you start your game. The characters you can chose from are Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy, each has a special ability that will make them better for some stages than other characters. I would have liked to have each character have there on set of levels, because there are only 6 Zones (each but one with 2 acts), if Sonic Team had done that format, there would have been 24 levels, and 40 acts total. Also, the special stage is not up to par with the ones for genesis, instead of running into a check point with 50+ rings, you have to search the level to find the special stage, and the stage itself is not as fun as the old special stages. But this game has some other nice features to make up for the lack of levels, there are time trials, and a Virtual Pet game called Chaos Garden, the point of the game is to raise an animal named Chao by taking care of there basic needs. Most needs require you purchasing something which costs rings, but you can earn rings by playing in little mini games. Overall, this game is a little short, but if you own a Game Boy Advance and like Sonic, it is a must have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2002"}

I'm hard-pressed to say which I like more. \"Modern Warfare\" was quite good, but so is \"World at War\".The plot of the solo game, such as it is, has you fighting out parts of World War II playing either a US Marine burning your way through the Pacific theatre, or a Soviet soldier fighting the Germans.First, kudos to the game for resisting the urge to focus, as so many games in this time period do, by showing off the D-Day invasion. The only time I want to see that in a video game again is if you're playing the Germans. Might make it more interesting than watching the opening scenes of \"Saving Private Ryan\" played out yet again.Second, they did a great job on the presentation. You get archival footage mixed in with modern computer graphics showing all sorts of stats and things like that. Very, very well done!The combat is what you'd expect from a first person shooter and parts of it are slightly jarring due to the differences in tech between this game and something like \"Modern Warfare\". Time and again I was thrown off by single-shot weapons or magazines that didn't hold 50 bullets.On the other hand, you get a flamethrower during parts of the game, and, oh, what a lovely beast it is. First, it looks great up on the screen. Second, it's just so darn useful! Sniper in the tree? Set the tree on fire. Machine gun nest inside a bunker? Flames through the gun port. Team member annoying you? Give them the ultimate hot-foot and laugh as they try to beat out the flames! Ah-he-he-he-ha! Fire is the cleanser! (takes some mood stabilizers) Ah, much better.The online component of the game is about what you'd expect. At level 1 I was matched up against a group of people where the lowest level was 40. Yeah, that's good. But, hey, if you can survive your first few games and don't get overly annoyed at teenagers calling you a fag and whining because you're using the Juggernaut bonus, you'll be fine and have a good time.All in all this is a really fun game and highly recommended for fans of the genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"E. Segal","summary":"Bungie keeps milking that cow","reviewText":"This half hearted phoned in bargin expansion for a full game price doesnt impress me. I bought it of course because it had Halo slapped on the label. But its even worse then I thought it would be. No matchmaking makes it extremely hard to find people to play the campaign and firefight with. This isn't 1998, get some servers Bungie.The game had a terrible minute intro. The rookie is even more faceless and bland then Master Chief he says nothing, has no name and we know nothing about him. The HUB is too dark I can't see anything, the visor doesnt do enough. Where is my flashlight? The HUB may be open but there is still pretty much just one right way, with little to no reason to explore its the worst attempt at a sandbox I've ever seen.The story itself is decent, but way to short. The music is amazing, no complaints there. Bottom line is if this was twenty bucks it would be perfect. But even then no matchmaking makes firefight worthless. And at sixty this is just an insult.Edit: Okay I'm back a few weeks after beating the entire game on legendary and have had time to reflect. I still believe ODST could have been much better and Bungie just went through the motions. The story isn't as bad as I initially believed and you do care alittle about what happens at the end. But the complete lack of CGI cutscenes really hurt the plot, as this engine doesn't do facial animations well. Go look at Halo Wars if you want to see amazing Halo cutscenes.The HUB was an interesting idea but pointless. There were no easter eggs, secret NPC's to find, shops, or pitched battles to come across. Just a giant wasteland of streets and buildings with nothing but covenant waiting for you. The only bright spot were the audio logs, but it wasn't enough.After awhile I got used to the brightness and it wasn't too terrible. But still there were many times where it was to bright for visor mode but not as bright as I would like. Or I wanted to go visor mode for the targetting systems but I couldn't because it was daylight.So I stand by my earlier review, its an okay expansion with some decent Halo story and gameplay. It was hardly a stand alone game, wasn't worth the price and doesn't do anything new or exciting. Buy it on discount if your a total Halophile, otherwise don't bother.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2009"}

This game really has a sence of darkness and the story line is perfect for this type of game. If you are not sure about it then download the demo because if you dont try that you really are missing out on a great game.Plot: The game begins with Batman capturing the Joker after his latest plot and escorting him to Arkham Asylum for imprisonment. Due to the Joker's recent attack on Gotham's Blackgate Prison, a large number of sane convicts have been transferred. However, the Joker, with the help of Harley Quinn, frees all the inmates and closes Arkham Asylum with Batman and Commissioner Gordon inside. Joker then threatens to detonate bombs all around Gotham if someone tries to enter the building. Batman must uncover the full extent of the Joker's plan while contending with the horrors of Arkham and was not expecting much from the game because I had mixed feelings about the demo. But as soon as I put the full game in, it freaking blew my away. The graphics and presentation suddenly hit me when I began to play the intro of Arkham Asylum. They made the visuals and it surroundings so believable that I thought I really had Batman in my grasp to controle. It is obvious from the start that the developers put sweat and tears into the game. Every chapter of Arkham Asylum is well thought out and realized. The gadgets aren't just there for show, they make you use them because of the well crafted level design. The free flow combat is great but if you can produce some combos and add some gadgets and moves into the mix, the hand to hand combat becomes even better. In conclusion, I will quote IGN by saying \"Batman: Arkham Asylum is the greatest comic book videogame of all time.\" That is a bold statement but i truly believe that the game deserves it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2009"}

I had high expectations awaiting its delivery and it still impressed me. The build quality is very high and seems it will last. Allows you to steer with extreme precision over the PS3 controller. It's just plug-n-play with GT V, with the exception of one update I believe. It required just a little bit of work to make it compatible with DIRT 3 on the PC, just driver issues really. You probably aren't going to find a better wheel/brake/shifter setup available to the general public. The quality is equal to that of high-end arcade racing games/ simulators. I do recommend that you either buy one of the available stands here on amazon or make your own. Simply fastening the little plastic clasps onto a desk doesn't cut it, the force feed back will shake everything on the desk as will your jerking. I knocked my TV over when I turned real sharp and pretty much punched the shifter, so just a heads up. (I'm a violent driver) The brushed steel finish and leather steering wheel/shifter/pedals is awesome and it really makes you feel like you didn't waste a penny. The buttons have no labels on them but anyone with a shred of intuition should be able to figure it out. The F1 shifters are awesome, put bluntly. Super responsive, like pulling on a feather. The click it makes gives you good feedback via a physical click and an audible one. The gas/brake/clutch are also top-notch. There is appropriate resistance on all of them. (the clutch has no resistance it seems) and the resistance can be adjusted should you care to do so. The shifter is nice, it's very loose feeling which by no means makes it fragile. I would imagine it was intentionally designed that way for more responsive shifting. NOTE: To reverse while using shifter you must press the shifter DOWN as if you were pressing L3 or R3 on a PS3 controller, move the stick all the way to the right while holding it down and pull it down. Alright I'll finish this with one major issue I have and really the only issue. (IMHO) There is no traditional E-brake, you can however assign some of the red keys on the steering wheel in both GT V and DIRT 3 to function as a E-brake but it just feels silly and kills the immersion. This is a colossal issue for those wanting to practice drifting (with an e-brake anyways). I bought the XL21 Xlerator Wheel Stand for this and don't regret it what-so-ever. I intend to write a short review for it. This is an excellent product, well worth the asking price if you value immersion and high end simulation. Don't immediately brush it off because it's Logitech, I did. Any who I'm in the middle of the 24 hours of Le Mans and was taking a break because my arms are shot from the force feedback.

The downfall is that you can only play in single player mode unless you want to do/are set up for online play.In single player mode, you're a first person shooter soldier on the frontline in WWII France. You arrive in camp, learn how to maneuver around, shoot your weapon & throw grenades (smoke and explosive). Then you're immediately strewn into various battle.You start out as private Nichols (American) in the first chapter, but depending on which chapter you're in, you might also find yourself playing as Doyle (British), Cole (Canadian) or Boharter (Polish).You fight you way through intense battle chapters (there are 14 chapters). You're mostly shooting whichever weapon you happen to have picked up (mostly from dead soldiers on the ground) along your objective route (a barrage of automatics and rifles). Your objectives that guide you along are updated regularly as you complete each task throughout each chapter. And some of those tasks are brutal.No matter which chapter you're in you are mostly using your primary weapon (a rifle or machine gun), but you'll also need to engage in some exhilarating hand to hand combat, you'll need to guide tanks, fire mortars, row boats, drive jeeps, attach and arm explosives to enemy weapons, disarm booby traps and man other stationary weapons.To me, all of the chapters are equally difficult. So if you figure out how to unlock them all like we did, there's no reason to play them chronologically (perhaps at least for consistency chapters 1 & 14 should be played respectively first and last).So all in all Call of Duty 3 is intensely fun, but like I said earlier, the biggest drawback to this awesome game is that multiplayer mode is only available with online play. I'm sure that online play is spectacular for advanced players, but my kids and I 1) are not advanced, and 2) we'd rather just play amongst ourselves for now. I'm no software expert, but if multiplayer capability works online, some genius should have figured out that multiplayer would be equally fun with friends/family at the same console.

The original BioShock was arguably the best release of 2007, and indeed among the very best games of this console generation. Bioshock 2 takes place 10 years later and Rapture is still leaking and filled with Spilcers around every corner. The new villian Sophia Lamb is the complete oppoiste from the idealist of Andrew Ryan from the original Bioshock. After a awesome introduction you are aided by Eleanor Lamb, the Little Sister you were originally paired with (now an adult), whom you must rescue from the clutches of her mother, Sofia Lamb. It's a journey that takes you through previously unseen areas of the underwater city, and even out onto the ocean floor itself.However this time you are a Big Daddy by choice and this has its benefits. For starters, your Eve supply is topped up automatically by a feed from your suit so you don't have to stop and manually inject it mid-firefight which previously left you momentarily vulnerable to enemy attacks. Your larger stature allows you to wield a better and bigger set of weaponry this time around, such as the rivet gun and gatling gun, and even a hydraulic spear gun that allows you to nail those deformed enemy splicers to walls like wallpaper. Then there is ofcourse the new drill on your right arm which delivers devastating melee blows and in its fully upgraded form the drill can even be used to deflect enemy bullets back at them, lightsaber-style, although all drill usage comes at the cost of rapidly draining fuel (bought from vending machines or scavenged from the environment).This time around the Splicers are more agressive and smarter than before. Smarter too. They'll use cover, throw grenades like before and rush to the nearest med station when their health gets low. Combining weapon and plasmid attacks, not to mention taking advantage of your environment, becomes even more paramount when you come up against the tougher adversaries in the game, such as the Brute splicers who have a habit of shoulder-barging you and throwing large pieces of masonry at your diving helmet. A mix of old and new Big Daddies including the new Rumbler that sets up miniature turrets and uses RPG rounds to rub you out and of course the Big Sisters, which combine the agility of a Spider splicer with the power of a Big Daddy, their scream telegraphs their imminent arrival and allows you some precious time to prepare for battle which is exactly what you want to do.In raw gameplay terms, BioShock 2 improves on the original in many ways, with a deeper combat system, a broader set of enemy types and the addition of a fully-featured multiplayer mode. It's an undeniably enjoyable and slickly polished shooter from start to finish, jam-packed with secrets off the beaten path and hidden references to the first game that well worth seeking out. However, BioShock 2's cast of characters, while suitably corrupt and twisted, and once again fleshed out by the brilliant audio tapes that litter the city, just don't quite hit with the same kind of impact that the likes of Ryan, Fontaine, Steinman and the psychotic Sander Cohen achieved in the original.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2010"}

The graphics are great, the controls are awesome, and the music is too die for. For those of you who never played the snes version, get this game. it has 6 additional super tough levels since it's on the game boy advance and an extra level in each world if you can get a perfect score in each level. it's a pretty daunting task, but it's worth it. Trust me, buying this game for 30.00 is worth it, you won't regret it. well that's all folks, you figure the rest out on your own. gotta run, smell ya later.signed: Mario fan since 1990","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2003"}

Take out both of those, and you're left with Spirit Tracks. It's, at best, some sort of glorified puzzle game.The gameplay is monotonous. The puzzles are tedious. The tricks (such as trains that try to run you over) are annoying and seem to introduce artificial challenge just to make the game last longer. The story is meaningless (I didn't much care about trains before, and now I really, really don't care for them). In fact, the very concept of using a train to get around is not only silly and irrelevant to the Zelda franchise, but also an annoying layer that really cements this game's status as a waste of time. At least in The Wind Waker you had the chance to move around, dodging obstacles and choosing your path. In this game you are stuck on a linear track with occasional choices. When you're confronted with an enemy you have to tap furiously at it to throw cannon balls, which is rather unengaging. And if you get on a collision course with an enemy train there's no way to remove yourself - it's game over.The sound track, a usual high point for any Zelda game, is uninspired. Other than the main theme the tracks fall flat. You won't find yourself humming them or wanting to hear them. They just exist.This game is frustrating on many levels. It's worth playing as an archaeological exercise, to see where Zelda has fallen very, very short.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2014"}

This can be a revolution of gameplay for the coming years.The system takes quite a long time to set up and adjust because the system takes quite a while to recognize you. Another problem is you must keep your room's lights in a fix condition. We set up the system with 3 light sources on, then we turn of one light, then the lag is much more notable. Same result when we keep the amount of light but change the location of light source. So note this, this guy is fairly light sensitive.Talking about the lag, it depends on games. With the \"sonic rider\", there's no big deal of lagging. However, for the included \"adventure\" game, the time between your motion and the motion on the screen can be as big as 0.5 sec, which is very frustrating occasionally.The biggest issue for kinect right now is it lacks supporting games.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Battle System = PURE AWESOMENESS","reviewText":"So far I have played Final Fantasy 7, 10 and 12 and have liked all of them. With all of the hype going on around Final Fantasy 13, I decided to give this one a try and here is what I thought.PROS.PARADIGM COMBAT SYSTEM: This game utilizes unique turn based combat system. To me, this combat system was the BEST ASPECT of the game. In Final fantasy games so far (other than 12), you have to do each action such as attack, healing, magic one by one by one. This game gives you option to do that or you can have \"auto battle\" mode where things are taken care for you. So the enemies you want to deal with \"personally\" you can combat them yourselves, but then you are not stuck hitting same command again and again for each fight you do in the game. Think of it this way, in other final fantasies, you are acting as individual soldiers while in this game you are mainly acting as commander. So instead of controlling each of the party member's action individually, you can set up a \"paradigm\" where you can focus more on physical or magical or healing or combination of these actions. At first you will find it a bit puzzling but once you get it, you will most likely love it.STAGGERING ENEMIES: To win a battle, you have to punish an enemy (or enemies) up to the point that they \"stagger\". At this point, the enemy will take a lot more damage and is less likely to attack. While it is not necessary to stagger an enemy to defeat it, for most game, you will find it difficult to defeat enemies without staggering them. So what is so special about staggering enemies? In order to stagger them in most cases you will have to use variety of paradigms and will have to come up with different strategies. Again, in the beginning you may find this difficult to understand, but once you get it, it gets to be quite fun.VARIETY OF BOSSES AND ENEMIES: Yup, there is great variety of enemies and different bosses in this game (as expected of \"final fantasy\"). Before you finish the game, you will have defeat quite a few different enemies and bosses and to defeat them you will have to use different strategies. While most enemies you may find it pretty straightforward to beat (especially in the beginning of the game), many later on enemies and bosses will be quite difficult until you figure out the right strategy. But don't worry there are ways to defeat them and you will find these challenges fun rather than frustrating.CRYSTAL LEVELING UP SYSTEM: This game has similar leveling up system as Final Fantasy 10. Defeating each enemies gives you points and then you use these points to level up different characters. The difference is you can level up a character in different direction (i.e. you can make a character better at magic, physical attacks, healing, sabotaging enemies, etc.) Each character will have 3 specialty areas and later on you can develop the character in all 6 different classes. Pretty addicting if you ask me.TONS OF SIDEQUEST BOSSES: So it takes a while to get up to this point, but once the open world portion of the game begins, there are tons of (>60) mini and major bosses to beat in the game. There is this portion called TITAN CHALLENGE (won't spoil much) which is very interesting. Here you will have to defeat a series of enemies in certain way. I liked it.SPECTACULAR SUMMONS: In this game each character gets a cool summon. While you don't have control over when you can obtain it, in order obtain them you have to beat them. LOVED IT. Once you obtain them you get to use their awesome powers and most importantly limit breaks. This has been my favorite part in many of the final fantasy game and just like previous final fantasies, this game has delivered them nicely.BEAUTIFUL AND ELEGANT FANTASY WORLD: The creation of Cocoon and Pulse are just mind blowing. Everything in these worlds is very elegantly designed. If you look carefully designers have truly given attention to details. Loved just loved each and every level.WEIRD BUT UNDERSTANDABLE STORY: Really can't tell you much without spoiling it, but like in many Japanese games, this one also has a very strange, but unique story with a great underlying theme.WEAPON AND ARMAMENT LEVELING UP: I am happy in addition to character they also have weapon leveling up in this game. To level up your weapon though you have to collect and use different items in a unique manner. For example, certain weapons can only be leveled up to level 11; however, if you obtain these unique item you can break that limit and level it up even further turning it into a completely different weapon. If you like this type of stuff the game will keep you occupy for a LONG TIME.CONSLACK OF CONTROL OVER BATTLE TEAM: As described in pros, you have to design specific paradims and you can use them in the battle to your liking. However, these combination are not limitless. In other words, you won't be able to control all three of the party members in the exact manner you want to. For example, with characters A,B, and C, I want both characters A and B to attack the same enemies with physical attacks, I don't have that option. Also if I want to revive character B before healing character C that is also not an option (unless the character I control is the healer). While it seems like a major issue, it really is not. There is not a single enemy you won't be able to beat due to this problem.WHINY CHARACTERS: Ever since Final Fantasy 10, they have been having so many whiny characters in these games. Hate it, just hate it. Good thing is whiny character in this game will only whine for first quarter of the game. Also, what Japanese people and Westerners find \"awesome\" and \"funny\" are quite different. Some dialogues that Japanese may find awesome will simply sound lame to us. So that is also a problem in this game.CONCLUSIONContrary to the cons I described, this is a great game. Battle System, leveling up and hunt for different bosses and items will keep you busy and entertained for a long time. With side quests, it has taken me about 84 hours and I am still not quite done. With lowered prices, I would say this is a MUST OWN game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2010"}

Game variety is one of the best of any system launch. Titles may not be the strongest, but almost every catagory will be represented between now and the end of March. By the end of 2012, The Vita will have a very strong catalog of titles. Call of Duty, Street Fighter X Tekken, Madden 13, Metal Gear Solid HD, and over a dozen others. All are solid, full featured games. For those of you who like the casual games, You have Plants vs Zombies, as well as a plethora of \"mini\" games that average $3 a title.  This system has the potential to provide every gamer at every skill level something to entertain themselves with. It's not saturated with cutesy cartoon characters, or 10 year old games given a fake gimmicky \"3D\" or touch treatment, this is hardcore gaming at it's best. This will revolutionize portable gaming the way the original Playstation changed the console world. You don't need a $5ooo dollar alienware laptop for top quality, hardcore gaming anymore, it's got a new face: PS Vita!Cons:  OLED display. Daylight is very tough on the display. Also, OLED displays are incredibly short-lived, averaging 9 years of \"average use,\" 5 years if you are an addict. 3G is hampered to the point of being useless. Cannot play games on 3G network, cannot download games on 3G network, only post leaderboard stats and chat with friends. Waste of $50.Also, Sony has way overpriced the memory cards. 4GB should be eliminated. it's worthless.  8GB should be $10, 16GB should be $20, and 32GB should be $40. Eventually this will happen, but to have the $99 price tag on the 32GB card at launch is a slap to the face of anyone wanting the best for their system. I understand the need for proprietary casing for the memory cards, because of piracy issues that plagued the old PSP, but flash memory chips themselves are so insanely cheap these days at the wholesale level, there is no excuse for the insane prices.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2012"}

(4.25 stars)","reviewText":"Take the rage-filled, revenge-driven premise of God of War, combine it with the extreme power levels of Dragonball Z, sprinkle a bit of a space shooter, and add a heaping spoonful of quicktime events, and you've got Asura's Wrath, one of the more interesting games I've played lately.GRAPHICS: This game is gorgeous to look at, especially on a fairly big HDTV. The graphics remind me of Street Fighter IV's, but less cartoonish. Considering that a good chunk of this game is cutscenes, you expect it to look good.SOUND: The soundtrack fits the mood quite well, and the voice acting is well-done as always. The only thing that's kind of annoying is Asura's noises during fighting, but it isn't that bothersome.STORY: The premise isn't too original. Angry godly man wants revenge for his family and his betrayal, yada yada, but the interesting characters, the constant cliffhangers, and the universe itself keep the story well afloat, making you wonder what's going to happen next.GAMEPLAY: The gameplay is mostly divided into three parts:1. You're flying around and shooting things on screen. These are usually pretty easy; if you run around and tap the triangle button, you should win.2. Fighting on the ground. This is your typical Devil May Cry and God of War gameplay, but a bit watered down. While button mashing usually does the trick, sometimes you do need strategy, especially when it involves dodging a lot and counterattacking, which is done by pressing a button when it pops up.3. Quicktime cutscenes. This is the meat of the game. You pretty much press a button when it tells you to during an action cutscene. It's a gaming cliche that's still pretty neat in my book. It especially is fun during an epic boss battle.All three have the same goal: fill up the bar and unleash your Burst, which will take you to the next sequence. To do that, you have to just keep attacking things. Simple enough. The game itself is divided into episodes, each feeling like an episode of a series. Each episode ends with a cliffhanger, which will keep you hooked. Every episode also ends with the trademark rankingThe only real downsides are that the gameplay, while interesting, doesn't feel like it's reaching its full potential, and that this game is too short. When the game's over, you're wanting more, and while there are no guarantees that Capcom will make more, (it's not a fighting game, after all ;) ) this looks like the start of a potentially great IP from Capcom, which is something they need.Overall, this game is a short burst of anger that is definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something different.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002673XJA","reviewerName":"Kevin J. Redmond","summary":"Another small-scale game from Cryptic...","reviewText":"I have been a fan of Star Trek for many years now, and the first thing I think of when I think of Star Trek Online is... \"Where's the Trek?!\" It certainly doesn't feel very much like Star Trek, even if it looks like it. Some have even complained about the proliferate non-canon ships at end-game, but that is neither here nor there. The excuse of war is used to make a game that is all about shooting something and destroying it. There is no real diplomacy, there is no real discovery. Fly in, shoot it up, then warp out. Even in times of war that is not the policy of the Federation. I don't think Captain Picard, Sisko, or Janeway would intentionally blow up a base that houses Jem'Hadar babies. In Star Trek Online -- you will.Warp is another reason this doesn't feel like Star Trek. You warp around at impulse speeds in the \"Sector Map\". This is nothing more than an attempt to make the game feel larger by increasing travel time... but in the end it only succeeds at reminding you just how small the game is. Space has been sliced up, and placed into small neatly-packed instances... complete with border walls (remember the plasma walls in City of Heroes... well, take away the plasma and put a sign up instead that says \"next zone over is *zone name*\"). The other problem with sector space, and the fundamental design of the entire game, is it adds more load screens. Let's say you're starting out at Earth (Sol) Space Dock, and you have a mission to head to a planet in the Regulus Sector Block to investigate a situation: first you leave the station (load screen), then you warp to sector space (load screen), then you spend 5-15 minutes flying through sector space to the Regulus border (load screen), then you spend another 5 or so minutes flying to the system that houses the planet you need (load screen), then you finally warp in to, usually, only see one planet... and proceed with blowing up the problem, and exit the system (load screen). Luckily, you can hail starfleet and report back in without wasting time going back to Sol. The point is -- the game has entirely too many load screens. Even such minor transitions as entering Quark's bar on Ds9 require, you guessed it, a load screen.If you were hoping to knock your opponents shields down, then beam over to their ship and phaser-stun their crew to win a fight... you will be disappointed. The bridge is only there to serve as fluff... it has no function whatsoever. You won't spend any time actually aboard your ship, instead you will pilot it from a 3rd person perspective at all times.Ground combat is lankey and a complete mess. NPC's appear to have no AI whatsoever and stumble on their own feet, as well as having surprising difficulty getting through a door big enough to fly a type 5 shuttle through. Most of the time you just want the ground missions to end quickly so that you can get back to space fighting.While space combat is fun at first, it doesn't take long to become tedious. All of the missions are basically copy/paste scenarios. Even the episode content gets highly repetitive. You might enjoy the game for awhile, but for most people it won't take long for boredom to set in. Once it does, don't expect it to lift. There is also no death penalty whatsoever, which makes space combat even more tedious. There is no risk, and so you're just going through the motions without even thinking about it. Just like Champions Online this game could have been something truly remarkable, but the small-scale design just doesn't allow that to happen. There is a reason Cryptic can pump out games so quickly with their new engine -- because it doesn't require much content at all. The illusion doesn't last, and you soon realize that what you are playing is more akin to arena net than MMO.The one saving grace, besides the well-constructed graphics and good artwork, is the pvp. If you play Klingons that's all the game will offer you, as they have no PvE content to speak of yet. The PvP can be quite entertaining and rewarding, however. The problem is that it becomes just as much of a rinse/repeat exercise as the PvE content does. Playing Klingon makes this resonate even more, since it is the grind that gains you levels. It is also what makes the game feel more like arena net than MMO... the PvP has no more depth than a console game would. Even while playing Federation and going back and forth between PvE and PvP... eventually you will realize that you are doing the same five or six missions over and over and over. The objective for all of them: shoot to kill (and occasionally hit \"F\" five times on the glowing objects on a barren world).The one thing they did right was character customization. But with Cryptic, at this point, that is pretty much a foregone conclusion. If you are looking for casual gameplay and just some space-shooting then you will likely enjoy this game. If you are looking for something that is a true realization of the Trek franchise in an immersive and expansive MMO environment... expect to be let down dramatically. I would easily say this game is worth an initial $50 investment. I have gotten as much enjoyable game time as I might with any console game in a similar price range. The $15 monthly fee, on the other hand, doesn't quite seem worth it to me.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"Seppo Helava","summary":"Halo: FPS Evolved","reviewText":"Halo's a first person shooter. Which means that from a first person perspective (mostly), you shoot stuff. The formula hasn't changed a whole lot since Quake's addition of the real third dimension, but Halo's beauty lies in its execution. The game world provides an interesting place to fight, from its wide-open meadows, to cramped, claustophobic internal corridors. The AI, both enemy and friendly, is some of the best ever seen. The Covenant soldiers, your fellow inhabitants on Halo, will outflank you. They will chase you. They will bring reinforcements, they will gun you down, and they will laugh at and mock your still warm corpse. The little cowardly grunts will run and scream, and panic appropriately, when you stick a plasma grenade on their face. The friendly AI will not only realistically follow you and augment your offensive capabilities, but will show genuine anger at fallen Covenant, and flee from friendly fire.The end result is that while not necessarily revolutionary in terms of gameplay, the execution gives it a revolutionary feel. You rarely feel alone on Halo - whether it's marines fighting by your side, or Cortana (an AI, that's been loaded into your suit) telling you to \"Watch out, there's two of us in here, you know?\" - there's always someone, or something to interact with.The addition of vehicles, on top of all this, gives Halo an extra dimension that keeps the gameplay feeling fresh. Hop in a Warthog jeep, with a friendly soldier manning the chain gun in the back, and you can plow through huge numbers of enemies, nigh-effortlessly. Snipe a Covenant Banshee pilot, and their mini-plane will crash into the ground at your feet, and skid to a stop mere feet in front of you (or if you're not careful, the wreckage will take you out, as well). If you're particularly careful, you can even snipe the pilot out of the plane, and hop into it yourself.All this adds up to a sense of immersion and freedom that are almost unmatched in FPS history (Deus Ex being the sole major exception). While some of the level designs midway through the game can get repetitive, the sheer sense of danger, panic, fear, that the game can create are enough to keep a player interested even wading through piles and piles of enemies.Every surface is bump-mapped, every surface is beautifully textured. While Halo doesn't feature the volumetric grass found in games like Tony Hawk 2X, the textures on the ground, on the rocks, on *everything* are fantastically detailed. On the Dreamcast, or even on the PS2, walking close to a surface often reveals a good deal of pixelization on textures that cover most large surfaces. Not so on the xbox. The closer you get, the better things look. It's rare that you'll find a mip-mapping boundary, and it's rare that you'll find *any* texture defects.The character models are highly detailed, and very well animated, particularly the model for the Master Chief. There are very few moments in the entire game, where the animation will pull the player out of their state of immersion - there are few clipping problems, there are few jerky transitions between animations. Almost all the time, things look realistic, smooth, and believable. Snipe a Covenant Elite in the head, and it will crumple, lifeless to the ground, just like you'd imagine it would.Halo isn't just a graphical representation of a few levels that are tied together to form some mishmash of a coherent story. Even when there are large changes if your orientation between levels (being transported on a dropship, for instance), the variety of graphical detail, and the sense of good overall design always keep you feeling like you're in a *place*, *on* a ringworld, rather than just playing a game set on one...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2002"}

I was excited by all the hype, of course, as I am an avid fan of The Sims, SimCity, and Civilization.  Yet, when playing this game, it fails so badly that I feel like my gifter was ripped off!  (I don't have the heart to tell her, though.)Basically, the game touches on a fantastic concept: evolving from a single-celled organism into a mighty interplanetary race or civilization of a species that you created.  While I don't believe in Evolution Theory at all, the game concept was presented in a sound enough manner that the game should have been totally fun.  Customization, for example, is my middle name.Playing the game, it bites.  There is no truly evolutionary concept here as your creatures are in no way evolving to their surroundings.  Now, this surprisingly enables some freedom in customization, which I appreciated, but eventually the decisions I made were meaningless as the attributes I gave to my species were just for craps and giggles and not any utilitarian purpose (which is at the core of Evolution Theory).Granted, I did not expect this game to be Charles Darwin's video game version of The Origin of the Species, but when customizing your creatures is more for appearances, well, that is only half the fun; not a lot of challenge, though.The developmental aspects of the game - progressing from the bottom of the food chain (so to speak) to the civilization and intergalactic phase - is pretty cool, though the five stages are really not about much except your willingness to see them through.  That is, sure, you can customize your creations to look and act how you want them to, but at some point you will want to \"start over,\" as it were, and recolonize.  In doing so, you will face the same limitations to customization (none of which applying to true evolutionary models) and meaningless application.Besides all that, the graphics are pretty decent in a cartoony way.  They aid in your understanding of what is going on, and sometimes there are cool things to watch - for example the combat scenarios and the starship configurations.  But nevertheless, there is no sense of a meaningful end - the means are just too watered down to garner significance in your creations.Lastly, the DRM registration deal.  Let me just say this from my experience: I have had to install every game that I own at least three times in my life: between hard drive crashes, space considerations, errors in installation, the game not working right the first time around, and some incidental thing that is bound to happen, it is exceedingly unfair and burdenful (if that is even a word) to expect customers to go through the bureaucracy of trying to install their game for a (gasp!) fourth time because of this stupid DRM system.  The worst part of it all is the price factor - you might have to pay another license fee (on top of the one you are spending right now to get the game in the first place) to install it again.  And if you mess up or something stupid happens... you get to contact EA again and explain your situation.In the end, Spore is not worth your time or investment as EA is looking to protect against piracy in a rather unusual way, and the game is not even that spectacular.  In the long run, the games that you already have are worth playing some more (Sims, Civ, SimCity, etc.).  Crazy how the older appears to better, no?  That's what happens when a strong company like EA wants to bilk its audience customers for all they are worth, simply because they expect fan loyalty to allow them to do this.  I say pass on Spore, both for quality and integrity issues.  Buy a better game for 1/5 the price.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2008"}

The story is actually the best part of the game as well as the characters and voice acting. Most Japanese shooters tend to suck, for some reason, or have a lot of major flaws. Binary Domain tries to remedy all this by making it feel more like a Western shooter, but still doesn't pull all the punches.The story is about a Japanese robotics genius named Amada who creates robots that are programmed to think they are human, and don't know they are robots. They look, smell, talk, and even act human, but this is a violation of Clause 21 in the New Geneva Convention. Why Amada is doing this I can't say without spoiling anything, but let's just say there are a lot of nice plot twists and turns towards the end. You are a Rust Crew who is to bring Amada in alive, but it's not as easy as you think. The characters are well-developed and each have their own unique personality that you will grow to like. Dan is known as the \"Survivor\" and that's who you play as, and I actually really liked his sense of humor.The shooting is solid enough. You get an assault rifle that you can upgrade throughout the game, but you also get to pick up secondary weapons like sniper rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, SMGs, and probably every other gun you have shot hundreds of times before. They don't feel any different here, and that is one of Binary Domain's main flaws. There really aren't any cool and unique weapons. The assault rifle has a shock burst feature that stuns enemies, but this isn't anything really special. The cover system works similar to Gears of War, but not quite as well. When you run down hallways, Dan will stick to a wall if you get too close which is bad during timed events. You can go to shopping kiosks to upgrade your weapon as well as buy ammo, other weapons, and health kits. There is also the option to buy skill upgrades, but I found these completely useless.These skills are dots that fill a small grid like 10% extra health, armor, etc. I just stuck with the ones I got in the beginning of the game and never wound up changing them. That usually isn't a good sign, and that's because the game is pretty easy. I rarely died, and this was usually only during boss fights which there are plenty of. These boss fights are varied and actually really fun, because you have to figure out where the enemies weak spot it and just blast away, but you also have to dodge their attacks. Most of the regular enemies don't go down very easy either. You can shoot them up all you want, but you have to take off their head to keep them from crawling around. If you take off their head before taking their legs out other enemies will attack it.The game actually features a voice command system that works with your mic, but I found this to be useless. It failed to recognize two different mics, and there really isn't any point. Using the buttons is just as easy, but during some conversations your squad mates will talk to you and you need to respond. If you shoot them during battle, or give a wrong response they won't listen to you as much in battle. This was completely useless because the AI is crap anyways. A few scenarios you have to rely on them to heal you, or work with you, but they usually take forever, or seem to ignore you. Just turn the voice system off and stick with button inputs.The graphics look really good, but the game has the typical Japanese sci-fi look that I am personally tired of. The menus feel like they're from circa 1996, but sadly the game doesn't even have a unique art style. The graphics really feel sterile and boring, but at least they look good technically.  Overall, you should just come for the decent shooting, but mainly for the characters and story because I couldn't stop playing just to see what happens next. Every other idea in the game feels tacked on, but ultimately fails in regards of execution.The multiplayer is decent at best, but you won't be coming back for it after too long.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001E8VB3C","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"The first game to get super hero games right","reviewText":"The Good: Excellent sound and visuals, great story, feels just like a Batman game shouldThe Bad: Combat is very hard to master, some of the Riddler's Challenges are a pain to find, it endsEveryone has a favorite super hero/villain when they are kids and grows up dreaming about them, reading their comics, and even cartoons, but what about video games? Super hero games were far and few between until the recent super hero spike when Spider-Man came out. Spider-Man 2 (based on the movie) was freaking epic and really showed that a super hero game can be done right. X-Men Origins: Wolverine was another epic super hero game showing that, for one, Marvel has balls and will let their super characters kill (DC has yet to grow a pair), and that a movie based video game can be done right. So, what really defines a good super hero game? Well the roster is probably the first thing since that's what people look for on the back of the box or in previews. Another thing would be the game play since we want to feel like we're super powerful, and that's what Arkham Asylum does best.The game, first off, is very cinematic since you start out at Arkham with the Joker strapped in and being hauled off to a high security cell. Of course he escapes and that's where the nightmare begins. You start out fighting off some inmate goons and learn the combat. There is a lot of game play elements here so stick with me while I explain them all. CQC combat is great since it's called \"free flow\" combat. You aren't supposed to touch ur analog stick and just use the face buttons for a light attack, heavy attack, counter attack, and various other things you can do. When you knock down an enemy they're temporarily dazed so you can lay a ground attack on them to knock them out for good. When you see an icon appear above an enemy head you hit the counter button and Batman will quickly jump to that enemy and counter in all his martial art butt kicking glory. The combat is amazing since there's a lot you can do and looks great. You can use a quick batarang to knock back enemies, or you can use your bat claw and pull multiple enemies toward you. The whole point of the combat is to create a combo without stopping and this is probably the only flaw in the game since it really reflects the challenge mode (more on that later) so this will be my biggest gripe. The flaw here is that there has to be an enemy within hitting reach at all times or your combo breaks. Yes you can use the batarang or batclaw to close gaps, but some times this isn't easy if you have to quickly face an enemy. It takes perfect precision and a lot of grueling practice to nail the big combos, but otherwise during the main game you can just ignore this.Another game play mode is detective mode which allows you to see everything in a blue x-ray type view along with the skeletons of enemies and their status. Detective mode is essential on finding Riddler challenges, breakable walls, and even sneak up on enemies. Detective mode is used about 80% through the game and I feel it was too heavily relied on since you can't see how amazing the game looks most of the time since it all looks blue, and X-ray like. In detective mode you scan objects to acquire some of them and this includes riddles.Being a predator is a huge part of Batman since that's what he is. He uses fear to deal psychological damage to an enemy and thus weakening them. In certain rooms you'll have a lot of enemies and you can swing from gargoyles and take them out however you see fit. When someone passes under you you can hang down and do an inverse take down, so while he screams and dangles everyone rushes to his aid. This is when you swing to another gargoyle and use a batarang and cut him down and scare the crap out of everyone. While they spread out you can do dive kicks, or even drop down behind them and take them out silently. The stealth mechanics are great and easy to execute without lots of trial and error. Of course later in the game you MUST use your predator skills since some enemies will have collars that alerts everyone if his heart rate rises to much, which means you're in the room.Now I should mention the story since it's excellent. While you're running around the asylum trying to find Joker you run into your old pals such as Killer Croc, Ivy (who is HOT), Harley Quinn (who is also extremely hot), and throughout the game you can pick up on how the super criminals got to Arkham through audio tapes (part of the Riddler's challanges), and while not every Batman villain is in here you can read up on there bios by finding and completed Riddler's challenges.You might ask what are these Riddler's challenges? Well they are a big pain to find since there are so many types, trophies, audio tapes, actual riddles, and many others. There are over 250 of them, but there is an easy way to find most of them. If you find the secret map for each section of the game you can pretty much tell where they are due to the floating green question marks on the map. Most secrets can't even be found until the game is completed or gadgets are required. When you find these riddles you unlock challenge maps, 3D models, and bios along with achievements.Speaking of gadgets all of Batman's beloveds are in here, but you only start with the batarang. You eventually acquire the batclaw, batgrapple, explosive foam, zip line and more. There are upgrades for your batsuit, weapons, and combat skills which can be bought through points earned by completing missions. The game is very free form since you have several building on Arkham Island you can travel to at will so certain gadgets are required to get through certain areas.Challenge mode allows you to use your skills to get certain scores and reach certain time limits and they are challenging...almost impossible for the impatient or novice so approach at your own risk. As good as I was at this game I found the challenges hard to conquer and get gold medals in.When it comes to how the game looks and sounds it's amazing. The game uses the Unreal Engine 3 so you can expect graphics that rival Gears of War 2. Batman's cape flows and he gets damaged in real time, everything looks dark, crisp, and scary just like how Batman should be. The atmosphere is great and will even creep you out some times. The voice acting is top notch and so is the dialog (Joker will make you laugh numerous times). The game runs a fair length at about 15 hours depending on how you play the first time (and if you try to collect everything). Batman is one of the best games of this generation and even Batman haters should check this out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer.

The storyline for God of War: Ascension is exceptionally poor and not well thought out whatsoever.  It deviates from the main plot of the entire series by a landslide.Why would the writers decide to base the story around Kratos' imprisonment AFTER he broke his blood oath with Ares, and then focus on his pursuit of the Furies?  It's a very senseless plot line, and it does not belong in the God of War canon.  Because of this fact, this game does not deserve to even be called a prequel.  The proper prequel storyline for a God of War title at this stage of the series is to focus on Kratos, his family, and Ares.  Base the whole game around those characters only so that A) we can find out exactly how Kratos became who he was (and the flashbacks in the first God of War title are NOT enough), and B) how Kratos really operated as a MAN (as the advertising slogan suggests).  I want to know how all those events unfolded in real gameplay time (i.e. the killing of his family, his interactions with his family and the community, previous wars he fought in, his raging conflict with Ares, etc.).  THAT is the proper prequel for this title.  PERIOD.With that said, Santa Monica Studio deserves to be brought under a class-action lawsuit for false advertising.  1)  The advertising slogan for this game has absolutely nothing to do with the game at all, and 2) It is not a prequel.  I don't even want to go into the other things I encountered that are troublesome (for example, the off-beat combat controls with the R stick as dodge, the game-breaking glitch I encountered, and the fact that they had to update the game because the Trial of Archimedes was \"too hard\", thereby leading everyone to believe that they put out an unfinished product).Do yourselves a favor and rent this title.  If you must buy it, then wait until it drops to $19.99.  In the meantime, please jump on the bandwagon to sue Santa Monica Studio for false prequel advertising!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B007TYC8MI","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Lacks the epic boss fights and repeats areas too often","reviewText":"The Good: Fantastic production values, fun new passive abilities, interesting new locales, decent storyThe Bad: Combat is tweaked to nearly being broken, no interesting or memorable boss fights, poor pacing and balancing, so-so multiplayerGod of War was once Sony&#8217;s unstoppable power house that helped sell consoles and push them to their limits. While God of War was revolutionary for the time it is starting to show its teeth, and it&#8217;s never more apparent then in Ascension. While the game shines in production values the quality and content is seriously lacking compared to past games, even the smaller PSP ones.You play as the angry Spartan demi-god, Kratos, once again. This time you are playing through a prequel of the first game. Kratos is trying to free his bonds from Ares after swearing and giving up his life to defeat his enemy. He has to defeat the Furies along with his living prison Hechatonchires. The game starts out with an epic giant boss fight as usual and even a cinematic torture scene where you get to start beating down one of the Furies right off the bat. It starts out with a bang and quickly fizzles out once the combat system is introduced to you. Honestly, it&#8217;s nearly ruined. The combat engine has been tweaked so much that it just doesn&#8217;t flow like it used to. It&#8217;s now based on a momentum system where the more you hit without getting hit the more damage you do. I honestly hate this as it sets you back in difficult areas. What&#8217;s more is that the magic system has been screwed with too much and same goes for the upgrade system.I like the idea of having four different blades with elemental abilities but they don&#8217;t mean anything. Should my fire blades be strong against an ice enemy? Doesn&#8217;t seem so. Each sword is supposed to have one magic attack by they are acquired at certain upgrade levels which I really hate. The rage meter has been turned into a bar that slowly fills as you hit enemies. If you get hit it rapidly drops and your damage dealt is reduced along with your more powerful moves. The game is hard enough as it is with enemies wailing on you so your best moves are locked away until you can get enough hits in to &#8220;acquire them&#8221; temporarily. A horrible system that needs to go away in the next game.With that said, Ascension has the most cerebral puzzles in any God of War game which is a nice change. I had to actually think on nearly every puzzle and some completely stumped. Some new passive abilities is one where you can decay and heal objects. Another ability allows you to duplicate yourself to solve puzzles and do extra damage in combat. These are probably the only thing in the game that show an overall evolution.With that aside let&#8217;s talk about bosses. God of War is famous for its epic and memorable bosses that are larger than life. Ascension has the weakest bosses in the entire series. First off, there&#8217;s a lack of them. Most are small and about the size of regular enemies. The only exception are the beginning boss and the end boss. That&#8217;s nearly 7 hours in between with weak fights. The overall flow of the game just feels messed up and broken. I kept looking forward to amazing boss fights that blew me away, but I just kept getting regular fight after fight. This really brings the God of War experience down quite a bit. Ascension just feels like a basic bare bones God of War without all the memorable moments.Like I mentioned before, the production values are at least here. Ascension is probably one of the top five best looking PS3 games or even game of this generation of consoles. The game just looks freaking fantastic and will blow you away. However, you start to not care if there aren&#8217;t those amazing boss fights and fast fluid combat. Ascension is a step in the wrong direction for the series showing that tweaking something to the point of nearly breaking it isn&#8217;t the answer to innovation. Should Ascension have never been made at all? We certainly wouldn&#8217;t miss it if it completely disappeared, but what&#8217;s here is a decent game with some experimental multiplayer that will last for a few weeks and you will move on to the next game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2014"}

You do, however, get the fun of playing both as heroes and as villains, each with their own overlapping story lines.

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Ronnie Clay \"R.C.\"","summary":"The space adventure game","reviewText":"This is one of the greatest adventurous challenges to land on Earth.

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"Great potential and story with too many minor flaws","reviewText":"The storyline here is one of the best you'll find in a video game. And the designers do an amazing job of seamlessly transitioning from movie sequences to gameplay. The gameplay itself is action/adventure (containing the best adventure elements of a Tomb Raider game with the action mechanics of games like 50 Cent's Blood On The Sand). While not the most expansive shooter or the most clarity driven adventurer out there, this one stands out with the effect of its realism. This is exactly what you'd expect if you were actually hunting treasure. You'd have a gun, pick up a few better ones along the way, and your path wouldn't always be immediately clear. It would take some often frustrating guesswork. I was delighted to find that the enemies in this game had more realism than I've seen in almost any other game. They actually bob and weave! The bad begins with how often an off-center camera angle mixed with some overly simplistic controls can lead to your death. The cover system is majorly flawed. You'll notice this most in later stages when they force you to use it. You have no way to aim without looking down the sights. Therefore do not expect to line up any shots before looking down the sights. The game somewhat accounts for this by auto targeting when you aren't aiming. But this just ends up feeling cheap and suddenly makes you look like a novice gamer. It suffers from the same glitchiness as much as other games where you have to jump from one platform to another. And the camera is no friend in that department. You have control most of the time. But sometimes when it is most crucial, you begin moving only to have the camera move on its own and change the direction you are moving in. Treasure hunting here was not what I'd expected. You have to look around for it, sure. But it's not ever really hidden in any of the places that would seem like good hiding places. Mostly it is just strewn around at random. And why make these secret areas you can access if the treasure of that area is just laying there, visible in the corner when you first walk through the door? Even the load screen bothered me. It's just a spinning coin that doesn't give you any indication of where you stand in the load or if the game is simply frozen. The story (while wonderful) also takes on a sci-fi element towards the end that somewhat took away from the realism of the rest of the experience. All in all, it's a decent game. If the issues I've mentioned had been addressed, I would say it's one of the best. Hell, if all they had done was fix the cover system, I would be glad to give it a 4. But that didn't happen. So expect nice visuals as well as a story and gameplay that can be really good at times. But also expect some serious frustration here and there; thanks to a wonky camera and amateur controls.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2011"}

There are like 18 moves or more. The animation is cool, when doing a drop kick you fall to the ground then do a cool spin up on the ground. When enemies are on floor you can elbow drop them and more.SHOOTING.Shooting is great by doing side way dives to avoid getting shot. You can hold different weapons in each hand like machine guns.STEALTH.Stealth in this is crap. You just run through and push 1 button. You use deadly attack or stun. Stun is a karate chop and deadly is snapping thier neck, remember that E3 trailer in May/March 2003(I think) were it played the Above the law song and it showed Nick snapping that guys arm, it's a shame that you can't do that.

Why?  I have no idea, because after my playthrough, I can honestly say that I have nothing but respect for this game.  This is truly a well thought out and well designed game.  You really can't ask for much more than you get.  But anyway, enough of my endless praise, on to the review!Graphics (score 10/10): This is literally one of the most beautiful games on the PS2 I've ever seen.  Plus, it achieves this beauty by using stylized graphics instead of uber-realistic ones.  It's really quite refreshing to see a game like Okami when the general push in the videogame industry has been for ever more realistic styles of graphics.  Okami has the appearance of a painting; every bit of the environment looks like the swirling lines and bright colors of a watercolor painting.  Honestly, I have no complaints in this category.Music (score 10/10): The music is also excellent.  Okami features a collection of traditional sounding Japanese music, which fits the themes and settings of the game very well.  All of it is pleasant to listen to with none of it grating on the ears.  The game has some pseudo-voice acting, with the characters making sounds like gibberish syllables as they speak.  If you've ever played Starfox on the N64 then you know what I'm talking about.  Some people found this really annoying, but once I got used to it, it didn't bother me at all.Characters (score 10/10): Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun in the form of a wolf, is your main character.  She doesn't really speak; she only barks, whines or growls.  Issun, your tiny little sidekick, does most of the talking.  Overall, I have to say that I got a lot more character development and backstory out of this game than I was expecting.  Issun and Amaterasu are surprisingly well-developed.  Outside of the main characters, there are a whole cast of quirky and interesting NPCs, which keep things entertaining.Story (score 10/10): Compared to other RPGs, the story is pretty unique.  You start out with some back story about the evil demon Orochi, who was defeated by Amaterasu in the past.  This battle ended up killing them both.  But surprise! Neither of them is actually dead and you must play as Amaterasu to destroy Orochi once and for all.  Okay, alright.  So this is pretty much the same save the world scenario in every RPG ever made.  But Okami really handles this story well, and makes it feel fresh.  Not to mention, there are even some twists along the way, as well as several subplots to keep your interest.  I personally thought that their attempt to take a common RPG formula and present it in fresh new light was excellently handled.Battle System (score 10/10): This is an action RPG (no turn-based combat here), so everything takes place in real time as you smack enemies using the Square button.  Battles occur like this: you touch an enemy on the field (no random battles) and the screen takes you to an enclosed circular area.  You are free to run around this area and smack the enemies with your weapon.  You can also open the menu to use an item.  Now, I'm a huge fan of turn-based combat and don't normally like action RPGs, but Okami is truly a fun game to play.  I like the fact that it isn't so difficult that a turn-based fan cannot pick it up, but it still manages to remain somewhat challenging.  I especially enjoyed the creative boss battle designs.  I won't spoil those, but just know that they are very fun to figure out.Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  The controls work wonderfully.  The camera isn't unwieldy or difficult, which is very important in an action RPG.  Also, this is the only game I can think of where simply running is fun.  The controls for movement are fluid and smooth, and when you run, grass and leaves sprout in your wake.  It really does make you feel like you're controlling a goddess with proper divine abilities.Overall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  I don't often hand out perfect 10/10 scores for games, especially not in every category, but Okami truly deserves it.  I can't really recommend this game enough, especially if you are a fan of action RPGs, regular RPGs, or really any games in general.  It's pretty cheap now, so pick up Okami for your collection; it's really worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2009"}

The art style is the main drive of Okami and feels so refreshing and is just so easy on the eyes. The graphics also push the PS2 to the limits and the world in Okami is HUGE and vast and there is so much to learn and do. The second thing people will notice is the wonderful Celestial Brush game mechanic. When you hit R1 the screen turns into a canvas and you can paint different strokes to activate certain techniques you learn along your adventure. This mechanic is very intuitive and fun and doesn't get old at all.There are just so many fine details about Okami that you could never really say them unless you played the game yourself. The story in Okami is very original and interesting and you actually don't get lost in it at all. The characters in this game are memorable and you'll end up caring for most of them. The combat in the game is great as well. You can learn new combos and use different weapons and also use your brush during combat. The puzzles in this game aren't mind bending which is good and keeps the pace flowing and everything is just so well thought out and blended together.The only gripes really is that there's no voices and the noise they use for the voices instead is very annoying. Having to backtrack a lot can sometimes feel tedious especially when you want to move onto a new area. I also have to mention the infamous urinating and defecating skill you can learn to get extra loot from enemies! This is very funny and fun at the same time. Another note is this game has a lot of mature humor in it and isn't really for the youngins. There are just so many things that are great about Okami it would take too long to just say it all.The game is about 40-45 hours so you don't have to worry about this beautiful game feeling too short.

Graphics are great and framerate is a solid 60 FPS. Sound is pretty good, and the game can offer a challenge. Don't get this game if you plan to play alone. It's no fun. Get it only if you have someone to play with on a regular basis. It's a solid racing title overall, and considering that the GC doesn't really have a lot of them, it's a lot more appealing. But wait for it to go down to $20 before purchasing. Also try F-Zero if you want A LOT of speed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2005"}

Armed with double-chained blades, as well a selection of new weapons, Kratos must take on mythology's darkest creatures while solving intricate puzzles throughout his merciless quest to destroy Olympus and the mighty Zeus himself.Key Game Features","reviewerName":"Andrew K.","summary":"Zeus Pick The Wrong Guy To Betray","reviewText":"Zeus picked the wrong guy to betray. On the outset of God of War III, Kratos is on the back of Gaia as she ascends to the peak of a Mount Olympus put in a panic. Kratos is out to kill Zeus, and he'll get through everything, everyone, and every god that tries to stop him. And thus is the setup for God of War III, one of the most striking, epic, and, needless to say, violent games of all time.As mentioned above, Zeus got on Kratos's bad side, and if the deaths of approximately 10 bajillion people, centaurs, gods, or what have you are any indication, it's not good to get on Kratos's bad side. The story is a bit uneventful for the first six hours or so of the game. You'll wander around Olympus, and Hades, meeting various mythological figures, and usually end up savagely murdering them. Run-ins with Haephestus (voiced by Rip Torn), and Hercules rank among the most memorable.The cat and mouse hunt for Zeus is enough to hold your attention, but it isn't until the final act when God of War III truly shines. While I wouldn't dare give anything away, just know that it's truly memorable stuff, and you'll end up seeing Kratos as much more than the savage brute he seems to be throughout the whole series.The game's first hour, depicting the initial assault on Mount Olympus, is unforgettable. The knob doesn't stay at 11 for very long, however, as you'll soon be thrust back into the usual God of War formula: combat, puzzles, exploration, platforming. But, as per usual, all this stuff is awesome.Combat is pretty much perfect at this point. This remain pretty much the same, you'll get tons of moves, weapons, and magical powers which you can use to beat on your enemies until you can horribly dismember them through a quick-time event.Anyone who's played the previous games will know pretty much exactly what to expect, but there have been subtle refinements. Kratos has a new grapple move that pulls enemies toward him, which is particularly helpful for keeping up a combo. Most importantly though, and a vast improvement on something the God of War games have always struggled with in the past, all the weapons feel useful. Kratos starts off with his trusty Blades of Exile, and he'll acquire three more during his journey. All the weapons feel useful, they each have their own magical attack bound to them, and you can come very close to fully upgrading all of them, so needless to say, the Blades of Chaos (now dubbed Blades of Exile) might not be the go-to armament.Puzzles have been vastly simplified, and I imagine some may like that, and some might not. Unlike the constant, seamlessly integrated environmental puzzles of the second God of War, God of War III's puzzle rooms are very deliberate, and are presented as tests from the gods. The thing is, most of these puzzles can be completed quite easily. So, for those who just want to get back to chopping up bad guys, this is a welcome change, for those looking for the puzzle integration of God of War II, you'll probably be disappointed.Disappointingly, the constant barrage of set-piece moments that we're used to seeing in a God of War game is absent. The first hour of gameplay is pretty jaw-dropping, and there's a  particular boss fight around the middle of the game that will  blow you away, but other than that, God of War III is surprisingly low-key.God of War III's production values are some of the best the PS3 has ever seen. Models, environments, and effects are all top-notch, and the cutscenes rarely leave the in-game engine. The sound department is equally amazing. Stars like Rip Torn, and Malcolm McDowel are among an awesome voice cast, and the booming orchestral score is great.God of War III will take about eight hours to complete, but as it's paced pretty much perfectly, it shouldn't be viewed as much of a problem. Besides, the game gives you reasons for further play-throughs (beyond the fact that it's awesome) with Godly Possessions (items hidden throughout the game), and various other unlocks. On top of that you have the Combat Arena, Challenge of the Gods, and a ridiculous amount of making-of videos which are sure to occupy your time. While God of War III may not be as lengthy as it's predecessor, it has a lot more replay value than any other game in the series.God of War III is an excellent game. With near-perfected combat, truly jaw-dropping moments, amazing productions values, and great replay value, this is a worthy conclusion to the series, marred only by the scarcity of the aforementioned jaw-dropping set-pieces, and some underwhelming puzzles. Still, seeing Kratos's vengeance through to the end is one hell of a ride, and the story truly becomes something special during the last few hours of gameplay.

The graphics are so-so (I expected better) and the soundtrack is epic. What ruins the game for me though is the frustratingly difficult quick time events that are so freaking annoying to deal with, It absolutely ruins the game for me.Overall, I expected something far greater than this to end such an epic game trilogy.

To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file. The 8 MB Memory Card allieviates that problem by organizing and storing files much more like a computer hard disk.","reviewerName":"tvtv3 \"tvtv3\"","summary":"Sucking Money from Your Pocket","reviewText":"What I said about the PS1 memory card can be said about the PS2 memory card as well. Memory cards are evil. If Sony was wise they would do what Microsoft did with the X-Box and include a memory system as part of the system instead of having the consumer spend more money on an item that should be part of the system to begin with. But unfortunately, if you want to save any progress on any games you play, you have to have one. Also, unlike PS1 cards, the Sony PS2 card is the best memory card out there for the PS2 system so instead of saving a few bucks and getting a cheaper memory card, it's usually better to just buy the Sony version instead and save yourself some time, money, and trouble. PS2 memory cards won't save info from PS1 games, so you have to buy cards for both systems in order to play all games.

This may be a fun game, but the fun doesn't last long.You race other drivers to unlock new things.  But that is about the only objective.  Also, beating the races are very easy.  The only hard part about this game might be learning how to drift, turn, and powerslide, but that only takes about five minutes to learn.Also, the races are barely any fun.  You start out in last place and the car in front of you is always like 30 seconds ahead.  There's no qualifying or practice, you always start last.Also, gaining nitrous is hard and doesn't help much.  You gain the nitrous by powersliding (which slows you down), and you only gain about 1/5 - 1/4 of a tank (depending on the turn and speed)  After you get it, it lasts for about 5 seconds and you gain a little bit of speed, but then after that, you go back to the speed you were at before you ignited the nitrous.And the last thing I have to say about this game that it is overrated.  All the reviews I've seen say this is an awesome PSP launch game, but to me it an okay game.  I would recommend buying Need For Speed Underground Rivals instead of this.  But some people seem to love this game so I would recommend renting this game first at gamefly.com (that's what I did and I'm glad I did it because I didn't like it very much).

I can say that Dirt 3 is the best racing game I have ever played.The graphics are top notch and up there with any racing games including Forza and GT5  which are known for there graphics. Damage model in this game cannot be beat, cars take damage and it can either be cosmetic or cause effects to your car based on your settings.Fun factor is off the chart for me. Besides the regular awesome events which have tons of variations like snow rain time of day surface your racing on type of vehicle car, truck, or buggy.  There are Gymkhana events which are extemely challenging and fun. When you pull off the moves perfectly and get a platinum medal you def feel like you have acomplished something. These events seem to be love or hate. They are required to complete your career mode but are very easy to get a bronze or silver medal and move on if they are not your cup of tea. But if you like or love the events such as myself you can challenge yourself to get platinum.Controls are the perfect mesh of a sim and an arcade racer fun and responsive but weighty and technical. This game controls like a dream.The menu's and user interface are slick and classy.The sound is top notch there is no music when racing and no custom soundtrack on PS3 which is a conscious decision I beleive by the developers because they want you to apprecieate the sound of the engine and the gravel kick up as your tires spin out. The music that plays while in the menus and during loading is nice and add to the slick cool feeling you get when navigating the menus.Customization of the look of your car is somewhat limited to liveries for sponsors but gameplay options have numerous options driver assists and three main difficulty levels which can be tweaked even further for the amount of challenge you want. Choose if damage is purely cosmetic or if it will effect how your car handles. You can do some basic car tuning nothing as deep at GT5/Forza but still a very nice option.Multiplayer looks great and fun in the vids online I have seen but with the PSN store still down I havent been able to check it out yet hopefully the store is up by the end of May, but there is enough single player content to keep me busy for a while.This is the best most fun and complete racer I have ever played everything is top notch and the attention to detail is incredible. Codemasters have done an incredible job with this game and you can tell a lot of love and time went into this game I hope it goes on to sell millions of copies it deserves to be a major hit. If you like racing games at all you should love this game there is so much content and it is all amazing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2011"}

Nicholson","summary":"Crysis Warhead...short, but better than the original","reviewText":"I downloaded Crysis Warhead through 'Steam'; it took 5 hours, then another 5 hours for the upgrade download.Initially I was somewhat disappointed with this game, at first it seem to be a carbon copy repeat of Crysis; the enemy was the North Koreans and then the octopus-like aliens. However, about a quarter the way into this game I really started to like it much better than the original because it became a game that really focused on stealth and sniper combat and it also required a bit of thinking to accomplish your missions. That is not to say there aren't some out and out great battles with your comrades, because there are...many in fact.In addition, there were several vehicle riding scenarios. You get to use jeeps, armored cars, tanks, hovercrafts and trains; all are equipped with usable weapons (except the hovercraft). Also there was a great selection of weapons that can be used; twin pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, grenades, rocket launchers and explosives. Nearly all have some modifications available.Graphically, I ran the game on the 'gamer mode' option and never had any problems with regards to fragmentation or crashes. See specs below*Gone, thankfully, are the prolonged trek (towards the end) through the water/space tunnel and the VTOL flying episode that really turned me off the original Crysis.Conclusion:A great game! Much better than I'd expected and much better (IMO)than the original.A game that seems to concentrate more on the FPS aspect; all the while requiring careful use of your nanosuit abilities and your weapons modification options.The game is somewhat short...5-6 hours at most; and for this, a loss of 1/2 star.Overall, a worthy 4 1/2 Stars.* Sys Specs; Played on Vista with a Dual core processor, P5K motherboard, 3 GB RAM and nVidia 8800 GTS card","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2008"}
{"product_name":"B006WQR3OM","description":"","reviewerName":"Derek G","summary":"A Game of the Year candidate ruined by the rush to release","reviewText":"The original XCOM was a classic and, honestly, I was worried this would be ruined like so many remakes.  I underestimated Sid Meier and company as they have stayed somewhat true to the original and have improved upon it in a number of ways.  Some may complain that it has been simplified for accessibility to new players.  That is true, but XCOM: Enemy Unknown has managed to keep the deep strategy and addictiveness of the original.  Unlike the original, you can now choose from easy to tough-as-nails difficulty that will have you in tears if you make a single mistake.Like all great games, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is about choice and consequence.  You are the commander of an elite group of soldiers charged with the task of defending Earth from an alien invasion.  You decide how to equip your soldiers, where to send them and how to plan their attack formation, then each side takes their turn attacking and defending similar to a chess game.  Once the battle is finished, you return to base to use your victory to research alien materials and engineer more powerful equipment, or to lick your wounds and hire soldiers to replace the ones who were lost.  If your soldiers rack up victories, they rise in rank and acquire new powerful skills that can mean the difference between victory and defeat in tough battles.  Because of this, it's very easy to become emotionally invested in these digital characters, adding to the \"just one more turn\" addictiveness of the game.Unfortunately for you, the aliens don't care about your planet or your soldiers so they do everything they can to stop your advance.  The aliens are usually tougher, with more advanced weaponry which often leads to a feeling of being over-matched from the beginning.  With smart tactics and sheer force of will, not to mention a healthy sense of intuition and a little luck, you can defeat these powerful beings, learn from them, and possibly defeat them with their own weaponry.The graphics are nice, although reflecting the limitations of ten-year old console hardware.  The cutscenes are infrequent, serving mostly to introduce each new advance in technology.  The AI is decent, sometimes showing what seems to be intelligent beings working together to defeat you, and the many different ways your missions can end in success or failure ensures lots of replayability.  You can customize many things about your squad, including their names, (I tend to revert to juvenile namecalling like \"Colonel Sanders\" or \"Major Brownnoser\".)  A special mention should also go out to the soundtrack composer, who adds excitement and momentum to a turn-based strategy game.  Multiplayer adds what fans of the original wished was possible.  So why only three stars?Well, to start, some fun features of the original XCOM have been removed, most notably the \"base invasions\" where the alien threat finds and attacks your base and possibly cripples your advancement.  I may be prejudging here, but it also seems like a lot of the variety of different alien invasion scenarios have been replaced with just a few areas to do battle in.  This may actually hurt the game's replayability.  The world's most elite soldiers suddenly \"panicking\" over a single hit by an alien seems a little bizarre and, without spoiling anything, the ending isn't bad but it's not good either.  Finally, positioning your troops with a mouse is sometimes frustrating, especially since this encompasses a major part of the game. None of these issues are particularly horrible and, frankly, Firaxis would be missing some prime DLC opportunities if they didn't add additional places to do battle in.  If these were the only issues I would still consider it a contender for Game of the Year.What causes me to drop this game from five to three stars is all of the unforgivable bugs.  When the game was first released it was borderline unplayable on PC.  Even now, after multiple patches, you run into situations that make you want to pull your hair out.  For a game tough enough to force you to only make few mistakes during a 30-40 hour playthrough, the number of mistakes it makes will often cause and unnecessary and avoidable death of one of your squad.  Aliens will \"mysteriously\" teleport next to you, one of your squad may get stuck inexplicably, or an alien may walk into clear view of a squad on overwatch without being fired upon.  Whatever calculates your percentage chance to hit doesn't always to take objects and cover (or the lack of these things) into consideration.  There are times when you can be standing directly next to an alien and have less than 100% chance to hit, your UFO Interceptor aircraft may fly off and never return, sometimes your HUD will disappear, and on and on...  It's simply inexcusable to release a game with so many problems, particularly a game like XCOM where success is dependent upon limited mistakes.As much as I love playing this game, (when it works correctly), I simply cannot recommend it in its current state.  Perhaps when Firaxis releases a \"Complete Edition\" with all DLC it will be patched up and working.  Be sure to ask around before purchasing though.  Also, beware of any website that attempts to award this \"Game of the Year\" (looking at you, Kotaku...) because it doesn't deserve it in its unfinished state.  Often developers will make excuses about how games are so expensive to make, but you never hear about all the revenue losses from gamers who were willing to pay full price but waited for the game to go on sale after hearing about the game's many problems.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"Morgan C. S.","summary":"65 hours of haphazard story and buggy, imbalanced gameplay","reviewText":"I just finished this game less than 10 minutes ago, which marks 65 hours of gameplay for me.  Considering that I nearly rushed through half the game, this is quite a long game.  Couple that with the haphazard story and buggy, imbalanced gameplay, and I found it very hard to find a reason to finish this game.First and foremost, the game is completely imbalanced.  Put bluntly, rogues are terrible.  They do equivalent damage of a warrior, yet can't take damage like a warrior.  They do serve some purpose as lock pickers/trap finders, but that is nearly all.  This makes them more of a utility than a character - it feels like you're carrying around a repair man with you at all times, taking up a precious space in your small, four-person group.  This is especially true because thievery plays almost no role in the games roleplaying aspect.This means that 1/3 of your player class opportunities from the very beginning are pretty rotten.  Plus, many abilities (especially sustained abilities) are just bad - they seem less powerful (some, nearly a waste) to other abilities, and have almost no redeeming value.Additionally, the enemies are unbalanced.  Most of the game is a breeze on 'easy,' but boss battles, and mini-boss battles instantly become ridiculous hurdles.  The game says you must put thought and tactics into battle, but really I find the only tactic there is that changes the tide of battle is potion spamming.I began the game on 'hard' difficulty, and fought my way through by wisely using potions, but there aren't enough potions for you to make it on 'hard.'  Only halfway through the game do you find a way to get an endless supply of potions - talk about imbalance.One huge problem for the 'tactical' idea of this game is that, very rarely, we are given hard numbers and precise descriptions to work with.  For example, some skill might say \"Stuns target for a short duration.\"  Okay... that's all and well, but if I'm truly going to use tactical thinking, I need t know exactly how long the stun will last.  This is just a simplified example, but the problems are wrought like this throughout the game.Yes, it has quality graphics... but nothing extra-ordinary, especially in the PC gaming realm.  In fact, most of the world is just simply... ugly.  The entire world takes a monotone color scheme.  Many characters look identical - EVERY character of the same race and gender has the EXACT same body figure.  The only thing that changes is the head, skin color, and clothing.  The clothing is limited - there are not many outfits, and many are repeated in simply a different color (plate mail colored red, for example).Yes, it has a massive story... but most is reduced to menial MMORPG-like questing.  Your character has the task of basically saving the entire world from evil, but most of the game is spent running errands for people only partially involved in the world crisis.  Most quests are more fitting for mercenaries, not heroes.  But it always is the same story in the end - someone has a problem (usually solved with brute force violence) and we're the only ones who can fix it.  The world is so riddled with these minuscule problems that it feels too simulated - too fabricated, and unnatural.  And the side quests are reduced to trivial messenger boy status.The gameplay is incredibly buggy, and just simply hard to play - characters are unresponsive, the camera is wacky, and the game just has serious bugs.  Major side quests are bugged, and not possible to complete (mind you I am FULLY patched with the latest game updates).  I have fallen off the playable world before, forced to reload.  During times of graphical stress, the game's combat slows down significantly, and does not match the visuals - my character swings his sword multiple times and in 5-10 seconds then all the swings register at once.  The same applies to heals, and really makes it difficult to play when it occurs.  Sometimes my attacks just do nothing! -- my character swings, and it says nothing about the swing like 'hit,' 'miss,' or damage... what is happening?!The AI is horrid.  My characters sometimes would keep running into a wall, visibly trying to reach their target, but not making the connection that they can't get to their target that way.  I would always have to manually have them walk around the obstacle.  At random times, my characters would just stop their buffs (sustained abilities) for no apparent reason.  The 'tactics' system is limited, or buggy - some abilities don't show up to be used automatically for AI characters, and you can't use abilities based on being 'in combat,' or 'not in combat' - so, my rogue sits in front of an enemy who is wailing on him while he repeatedly keeps trying to stealth and won't fight back, because I told him to stealth in his AI so I don't have to keep stealthing him when we leave combat.  Often my characters would 'bottleneck' themselves around a corner or some obstacle, and not walk around, just keep trying to shove their way through.  Sometimes characters will stop attacking out of nowhere if an enemy runs or is knocked away, even on the \"most aggressive\" AI setting.Simply, I felt like I had to baby the AI, and do many things manually because they would just stop attacking or stop doing something for no reason.  Also, they walk into known traps and AOE damage spells as if there is no threat there, and there is no way to stop this other than almost completely stopping all their AI - meaning you have to completely manually control them.The characters are pretty interesting themselves, but most are just whiny babies.  Almost no matter what, someone will be unhappy, so you'll have to go to your campsite and talk them out of their depression, or shower them with gifts.  It all seemed so ridiculous for the supposed 'heroes.'  Some character responses seem bugged - they don't make sense or someone gets angry at me for telling them that I WILL help them.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2010"}

It takes everything that was great in the first one and refines it to near perfection. There is a world hub so that you can easily move from galaxy to galaxy without having to trek to the engine room first like in the original. That greatly saves you the gamer a lot of time and aggravation. The controls are basically the same, but I didn't have the reverse joystick control problem when walking upside down as I did occasionally in the first one. So that is a good thing. Some suits are added like primarily the cloud suit which is really fun to use to reach higher places. I do wish you could pick a suit before a level like the 2d mario games but they only include the suit in the level that you need. It would be cool to have an option of which suit to start with though.Another new add on is Yoshi. He doesn't seem to handle as well as Mario and he is not used that often unfortunately. He just seems like a tack on near the end of development. They could have done so much more with him but I guess we'll have to wait until the third one comes out to see what Yoshi can really do. The play time is about twenty hours, but you can play through the game again as Luigi to get some extras. I didn't opt to do that so I can't say exactly what you'll earn when you complete the game with both brothers. The final battle could have been more challenging as it just feels like a normal boss battle nothing special. It may sound like I'm bashing the game a little but that is far from what I am trying to do. Everything else from level design, music, controls,graphics, and charm are all top notch. This is the best 3d Mario game released yet. Let's hope Nintendo makes it a trilogy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2010"}

It has lots of die-hard fans, because the designers made the game in a deliberate attempt to attract them. \"Everyone liked the oprea scene in FF6? Then let's put a play in this one. And a card game, like in FF8. And some characters that were manufactured. And a princess, and a dragoon. And let's make everything cute. In the design of this game, eclecticism is a method rather than an influence, as in the grade-school exercise of writing a story and putting all of one's best friends in it, yet the presentation of this game still somehow manages to be more mature than that of FFX, although the plot is less compelling.The soundtrack for this game is superb, featuring a great amount of quality music, underscoring everything from the game's characters to its environments to its events. The ability to split up while exploring towns, and watch cut scenes chronicling the adventures of the estranged characters, is cool, and the characters are cool as well, but unlike in FF6, another FF game with cool characters, there is no dramatic impetus driving the story forward. As a player watching the cutscenes, it is hard to root for particular outcomes of events, because everything happens arbitrarily, and whenever it seems that the party has finally inherited a mission, the next plot point changes the whole situation and makes the mission obsolete, rather than simply throwing an obstacle between the player and the completion of the mission.This game has the least systematic innovation of the entire FF series, and the elements of the series' battle system reprised in this game were never the series' best in the first place. Battles are fought FFIV-style, with only one or two feasable choices for how to spend each character's turn, there's a lack of variety of monsters within each environment, and a lack of opportunities for the player to challenge himself by entering a dangerous environment before the plot demands it. The battle screen loads slowly, and the battles themselves seem to run less smoothly than in any other ATB-based FF game, with frequent incidences of irrational lag between character turns, and between the selection and execution of an action. Sometimes an ATB bar can fill from empty to full during this lag time, making the order of turns just as confusing as if there were no ATB bar at all. The prerendered backgrounds in FFIX are, individually, even more gorgeous than those of FFVII or FFVIII, but FFIX is significantly less atmospheric than either of those games, with many sections of the map seeming to have been pasted together randomly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2007"}

I have not played the original as I normally play FPS with a PC. That being said, I have finished the single player campaign and just reached level 5 in multiplayer for GoldenEye, and I have the following to say about it.Pros:- Call of Duty gameplay. I'm not implying that GoldenEye copied CoD, but the gameplay is very similar. It's a pro because the gameplay works very smoothly, but it's quite disheartening to see nothing new brought to the table.- Nice action packed campaign.- Some interesting multiplayer modes- Split Screen (why have console games been getting rid of this?)- One of the best FPS on the market for the Wii...which is unfortunately not saying very much.- Nostalgia. (I wouldn't know, but I'm sure this will bring back pleasant memories for the fans of the original)- Gamecube controller is surprisingly good for FPS games.Cons:- If you are a FPS veteran, you will gain very, very little from playing this game. Campaign does nothing new or interesting, and multiplayer is the same shallow system we have seen done repeatedly on the PC.- Slow frame rates. There are times during the the game when the game becomes sluggish, mainly when there are a lot of enemies. This also occurs during multiplayer. When I buy a game for a console, I expect it to be perfectly smooth.- Short campaign. Finished probably less than 5 or 6 hours.I can really only recommend this game to those who are fans of the FPS genre but are limited to playing on the Wii, for whatever reason. Even then, games like Black Ops, or Modern Warfare Reflex should still be much better choices. While GoldenEye has a very stylish and fancy cover and UI, the game itself is very bland and presents nothing new to the table FPS veterans have already seen. It's campaign is fun enough, but the Call of Duty series have much more intense campaigns with more interesting multiplayer, which make it very difficult to recommend GoldenEye to most gamers.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2010"}

That combined with Episode 1 and Episode 2 makes this package all the more tantalizing.  The graphics, physics, and gameplay have been the standard for FPS's for years.  Nothing new there except that the graphics look a little better.  Portal, on the other hand, is such a pleasant surprise that I can hardly contain my excitement.  The game is set in the Half-life universe where you find yourself a test subject having to make it through various puzzles using a high tech portal gun.  The portal gun looks and feels similar to the gravity gun.  In addition to creating portals, it can pick up and move various objects.  The first few puzzles are relatively easy to understand and get through, but as the game goes on they become much more involved and complex.  Portal forces you to rethink space.  Nothing is really linear anymore.  I've had to use the strategy guide to get through most of the complex puzzles because they're so darn hard.  There are a lot of unique achievements for this game, such as falling 30,000 feet (try to get that one).  I also enjoy the commentary by a robotic sounding guide who monitors your progress and dishes out ham-handed, sarcastic encouragement.

It's suprisingly addictive and has it's own strong appeal and charm.  The real time combat was a nice change from all the traditional turn based that seems to dominate most RPGs, and the I love the idea of the game being played twice--once from the female character's perspective, and once from the male's.  Particularly since they don't go all the same places together; at many points, each go through different dungeons, which are only accessible through that character's side of the story.Unfortunately, the game is not without it's flaws.  The graphics aren't always necessarily the best--the characters seem to have a hard time moving their legs when they walks sideways, at times.  I grew frustrated with only being able to save my game at the Goddess statues, and even more so by the fact that when my character dies, the game ends.  And with how easy it was for characters to be killed in the fun but flawed combat, I found myself tired of doing the same dungeons over and over again.  Also, while having two people participating in the real time combat is a good idea, it, overall, proves to be a waste.  The second person (whomever happens to be following your character at the time) is worthless, and usually wanders around, attacking only monsters that you attack, and being killed far too quickly and easily.  And the only way to control that character is to relinquish control of the first character.With the weapons, it is an interesting change to have the hot house where you can use seeds collected from the game and have the blacksmith there temper your weapons, but I prefer the more straight forward weapon progression; where you simply buy or find a weapon or piece of armor that is simply stronger than anything previous.  The same can be said for the spirits; cool, but mostly useless, except for a few key points during the game.  The only one I ever really used was the one that healed.Overall, I think it's a very fun, appealing sort of game.  It only took three weeks to beat, so it's nothing for the hard-core gamer.  But it's a fun jaunt, nonetheless.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2005"}

It can't be helped for a game so huge that can go so many different directions. Glitches are bound to happen but I've never played a game with as many bug problems as this one has. If anything you would expect that some of the glitches would have been fixed but instead the bugs in this new title are way more severe and numerous than Fallout 3's. I'm talking game breaking and it happens a LOT. I can't tell you how many times I've had to reset my PS3 because the game froze up. I've been stuck in rocks and had companions stuck in rocks. I've been unable to walk into certain areas even though they look perfectly fine for my player to walk into. I'm talking nearly flat, open paths my grandma could walk on. Now don't get me wrong. Fallout New Vegas is a very fun game. The gameplay doesn't stray far at all from Fallout 3. The quests are fun although not as memorable as Fallout 3, and the game is enormous and will soak up a lot of your time.YOU WILL NEED A LOT OF PATIENCE AND KEEP MULTIPLE SAVES if you are going to have any fun playing this game though. Normally, this game would get a four star rating, possibly five from me but with all the glitches it's definitely only three and it's a bit lucky to get that in my opinion. There's just no excuse for the amount of bugs that plague this game and they really needed to push back the release date to fix the problems.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2011"}

I was hesitant about picking up the game because I'd heard of its short length and wonky gameplay, but decided to take a chance at last and picked up a used copy. I was not disappointed. I AM not disappointed. I could never be disappointed in such a work of art as this.After a spectacular, adrenaline-rush opening set piece in which you guide the male protagonist, Monkey, off a slave ship headed to the East Coast almost 200 years in the future, you find yourself enslaved and forced to do the bidding of a young woman named Trip. What begins as a journey to travel 300 miles to take Trip home, however, quickly accelerates into a much bigger, far more epic tale that, even if you knew the ending ahead of time as I did, will have you walking away thinking of how incredible that odyssey really was.I wish I could say more without the risk of spoilers, but some of the best parts of the game are spoilers in themselves. The final set piece truly gives the feeling of an epic conclusion to an emotional journey. The three main characters may start you off thinking you could never get attached to them, but by the end of the game, you will. The vast ruins of New York, overgrown with greenery and blooming flowers, full of wildlife, with the sound of wind whistling past the higher up you get off the ground, are a jaw-dropping sight to behold. Gameplay is a combination of exploration and encounters with war machines that continue to increase in size as the game goes on, with some platforming and RPG elements thrown in. The controls are ridiculously simple, but can be used in a number of combinations to increase the depth of gameplay from button-mashing to timing and blocking to straight-up beatdowns. A few events provide honest frustration based on slightly cumbersome controls, which knocks the \"fun\" factor down one star (there really need to be half-star ratings).\"Enslaved\" was built on Unreal architecture - Unreal Engine 3 - which is beginning to show its age somewhat, but still flexes some spectacular muscles in terms of scenery, effects, animation, and controls. Anyone who has worked with the Unreal Editor can appreciate the engine that much more as it is still pushed to the limits of what it can do. Full performance capture - like in \"Avatar\" - add to the immersion as not only body movements but also facial features are fully captured to vastly increase the realism of the characters. And the story? The story starts so simple, but no journey is ever so straightforward as the back cover would have you believe...Video games such as these are works of art. They were made with love, and it shows. \"Enslaved: Odyssey to the West\" is worth picking up - for the gameplay, for the sightseeing, for the adventure, for the animation, for the emotion. You would be missing out on something amazing if you passed this beauty by without a look.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2012"}

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents.

It was a typical stupid-serious space marine saves universe by killing people story. The graphics are impressive, but the game world itself feels very sterile. A lot of the conversation trees really don't say anything, like it seems all bioware games nowadays, and just seem to be filler.This is a better game. To start off, it's a decent 3rd person shooter. controls are more responsive. I also liked the story. The beginning sequence is impressive and really pulls the rug out from under you. Also, the organization Shepard ends up working for gives intrigue since they aren't entirely the good guys.The gameplay is much more visceral. The graphics have been tuned to be more intense. But by far my favorite thing in the game was charging with my vanguard. What a rush! You basically shoot like a rocket at the enemy and knock him down. But then you're vulnerable so you have to be quick with teh shotgun. Or, charge away to a safer place. It made the combat satisfactorily chaotic. Also, melee attacks are fun since the voice actor gives this great war-grunt and the screen shakes.So that was enjoyable.the story is more interesting too. You have to...uncover some conspiracy of something by shooting people but it makes a nice set-up for a thought-provoking final boss fight. For me it was thought-provoking on like biological scale terms, like how single-celled organisms in time banded together into multi-celled organisms and up and up until we were formed.All the same, the standard irritations popped up. The dialogue trees still say a lot of nothing. The art is still sterile and lifeless. the characters have glazed empty looks on their faces. You can make \"decisions\" at the end of each quest, but they don't really affect the greater scale of the game but just are book-ends on what happens on that subpart of the story. The system travel was really stupid. LIke, really really stupid. The Normandy ship can move to any system without really worrying about the effect of, oh, I dunno, GRAVITY. It can just sail through stars like it's a exxon station or something. really dumb. space mining at least is interesting because they have a mini-game where you're basically one of those dudes walking on the beach with metal detectors.Another annoyance to me is what plagues a lot of games: linearity. IT feels like you're basically clearing each segment to be rewarded with a cutscene and advancing the story.If you mess up and die?Reload. Try to do it right this time.Like, in classic games like say, starcraft, the decisions you make in the first five minutes of gameplay end up impacting you throughout the entire game. Here, it feels like you're hitting A,B,and C before advancing to the next story element. Which is in many ways feels like a clinical psychological test that psychologists play on dogs to see how they can be manipulated.And judging by the demo for Mass Effect 3 that I played, the final chapter will have Shepard being a stupid-dumb good guy again with forced sentimentality about sacrifice and bravery, blah blah, fit for the idiots who take Tom Clancy novels seriously.So I\"m going to hold off on ME3. But ME2 has some good elements and is moderately fun. IT's worth playing, but I'm not so sure ME3 is worth the effort.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

I have never heard of the Warhammer universe, so its setting is very novel to me- this is a sci-fi, intergalactic romp. But what makes it odd is that your enemies consist of an orc horde, summoning fantasy worlds to mind, particularly The Lord of the Rings. Where this game really shines is in the fun of pure, melee combat- cutting loose against the vast quantities of orcs that are bent upon your destruction. This reminded me strongly of \"The Return of the King\" for Xbox and PS2, a game that I loved and played several times through.Developer THQ did a great job with nailing the camera and character movement, creating a tight experience. Combat against your orc foes (the bulk of the game) is fast, visceral, and fun, with a well balanced mix of melee and ranged weapons. It must also be mentioned that the intro/tutorial/first level is masterfully executed, as you drop into the midst of a battle upon a ship.A cover system (I can't believe that's missing) and some sort of leveling process would have been welcome additions. The graphics aren't quite up to snuff with the indsutry's darlings of 3rd person games (Uncharted and Gears), but they are very competent, particularly with regard to how many enemies converge on the screen at one time. All in all, this is a fun, easy to pick up game that's very enjoyable in short bursts.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2012"}

Now Atlus has released it's latest sequel for the 3DS called Shin Megami Tensei IV but is this a dungeon crawl you'd like to experience?First this is a direct sequel to SMT: Nocturne (which was on the PS2) and has you as candidates from the gauntlet rite. You are Flynn and you are a samurai and you are charged with fighting the demons that plague Tokyo. As with previous games you can not only fight the demons but recruit them as well. You do this by negotiating with them and if you are successful they will be added to your party. Also you can use demon fusion to create new and more powerful demons which will be an aid later on in the game.The system is still a turn based system as you issue commands to the characters in your party. However, in this installment there has been one new upgrade called the press turn system. In this system if you find and exploit an enemy's weakness you are granted more attacks in battle. You are also given the opportunity to smirk which not only increases your damage output but also reduces your vulnerabilities.This is an exclusive for the 3DS and the graphics are quite amazing as you will go through various environments, battle demons and engage with unique characters. As with other SMT games there is also a route system broken into law, neutral and chaos and depending on which route you take affects the way the story unfolds.Shin Megami Tensei IV is a wonderful addition to the series and if you have a 3DS and you're a fan of the SMT games you need to rush out and pick this up. And if you have already purchased Fire Emblem and this game you can get a $30 Nintendo eshop credit!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2013"}

Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation. InFinal Fantasy IV, players take on the role of Cecil, a loyal captain who questions the orders of his king, and for it is sent to slay a mysterious beast in a nearby valley.InChrono Trigger, Chrono must follow princess Marle's teleportation through time and locate her before an intergalactic parasite arrives to destroy the world. The original game, also on the PlayStation for the first time, was one of the first nonlinear role-playing games.

Scott Heitman","summary":"One of the Best Action Games Ever Made","reviewText":"Most people have never heard of this game....pity, because the perfect and very original action/stealth package it offers makes many more popular games pale in comparison.  In each level, the main character is given a new weapon or skill.  By the end of the game, you will have access to 3 VERY different weapons, very sweet stealth moves, your bird (who provides different vantage points to decide how to approach a situation), and your bow.  The rare detail here is that these are all VERY well-implemented, giving you choices on how you want to approach the level.  The combat is very addictive- you can map certain enemies to the four buttons on the controller by sweeping the right analog stick.  That, combined with a handy block button provide for some very strategic combat.  Or, you can take on one enemy at a time with some truly brutal combos.  The brutality, both in combat and in stealth kills, is truly something to watch- your character looks like he walked out a Disney movie, but his moves DEFINITELY betray this notion.  The art actually was provided by former Disney animators, so the game looks very good.  Just watch one of the load scenes morph into actual gameplay- you won't believe your eyes!  Meanwhile, the story, though short, is told by a very talented voice actor and entertaining cut-scenes.  Once you finish the game, it offers plenty of replay value- there are extra arenas and goals to get through, and you can unlock extra costumes for Rau (which actually look very cool, I might add).  Anyway, this is one of my absolute favorites, and I can't wait for the sequel!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Will","summary":"Full of Heart","reviewText":"Kingdom Hearts is a game you do not want to miss if you are a Squaresoft or Disney fan. Virtually every Disney Character is included and quite a few Final Fantasy characters as well.  The visuals are clear and crisp and sometimes slightly blocky.  The character models all look like their disney counterparts and sound the same too.  Donald, Goofy, and tons of other characters are voiced by the real actors who voice them in their animation.  I warn you RPG fans this is not your typical RPG, but an action RPG.  Battles are not turn based, you can run around using magic, summons and hacking and slashing.  Graphics are done nicely with the exception of the backrounds.  They really left me hanging and I think they could use some more ingenuity and detail.  Although this game has a younger appeal, it is packed with a good story line, good graphics, superb voice acting, music, and sound, fun gameplay, which equals a great game thats full of heart.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2002"}

{"product_name":"B008SBZD5U","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Simple and Clean","reviewText":"Kingdom Hearts was originally released in 2002, and at the time of its release I don't think anyone thought the series was going to be as huge as it was.  Originally a lot of people weren't excited for Kingdom Hearts.  With so many various Disney characters thrown into the mix there was many a cry of how \"kiddy\" the game was going to be.  Yet in the end it not only turned out to be a success, but also one of Square-Enix's biggest properties.  With so many HD Collections coming out recently it's a wonder why it took so long to get a Kingdom Hearts one out there in the first place.  It's not entirely what I had expected, but it's still a solid remaster.There's not much need to go into the story of Kingdom Hearts.  Let's just say that of all the games in the series, the first one is by far the simplest as the plot hasn't had too many revelations yet.  You'll play as Sora who ends up coming into possession of the keyblade to fight the heartless and uncover the secrets behind them.  You'll do this by traveling to various worlds populated by Disney characters.  All of these things are remastered in HD and it looks really gorgeous to see some of your favorite characters and worlds.  It's also a pretty noticeable and the presentation is really good.Of all the HD reissues there are few that have the kind of care taken as Kingdom Hearts.  The entire presentation has been reworked for a 16:9 aspect ratio and is displayed in wonderful 1080p.  Other HD remakes tend to not touch things such as pre-rendered backgrounds, but in Kingdom Hearts even the pre-rendered stuff is displayed in gorgeous HD.  You'll hardly spot any blemishes or muddy textures.  It all looks brilliant.  The fonts are easier to read as well.It's also nice to know that there have been a couple of changes made to the gameplay to suit some of the features.  Originally the camera was a nightmare to deal with in the original game, but now it's relegated to the analog stick and easier to deal with.  You may still have a couple of camera issues, but with the camera no longer being set to the shoulder buttons, it's easier to deal with.  Likewise, much like Kingdom Hearts II, there are some moments where instead of selecting it in the menu you can just press the Triangle button during a context sensitive moment and perform certain actions.  These little tweaks help Kingdom Hearts out a lot.  Especially being able to press triangle to do simple things like open doors as opposed to having to select it in the action menu.  Likewise, the ability to pause and skip cutscenes is especially nice as this wasn't an option in the original release at all.  On subsequent playthroughs you'd have no choice but to watch every cutscene again.  Here you can just as easily bypass all that stuff.  It's overall not just a good HD upgrade, but also controls better.Other than that, combat is pretty much the same as you remember.  You'll roam around areas, enemies will pop up and you'll have to dispatch them quickly to earn experience points and level up skills.  This take on combat is still pretty cool stuff today.  Though it lacks some of the refinements of Kingdom Hearts II, it's still fun and simple to play.  But most important, the combat doesn't bog things down by constantly having you transition into a battle and then out of a battle so that the story can progress.There are some things that have not aged quite as well in Kingdom Hearts, however.  Chief among them are the gummi ship segments.  For the most part many of them are simply long, repetitive and slow paced.  Flying to a new world just doesn't really provide a whole lot of fun.  It feels counter to the fast paced action of the rest of the game.  Some of the platforming segments are also a little off at times.  Jumping from one platform to another can sometimes feel like a hassle, especially before you get the abilities that help simplify it.  These things aren't really \"bad,\" mind you.  At the time of the games original release, it probably didn't matter much but now it stands out a little more.  Thankfully, though, Kingdom Hearts is still a blast to play.  All the characters, the story and the gameplay is just as fun as it ever was.Unfortunately, the original Kingdom Hearts is all that's really worthwhile in the collection.  While Chain of Memories has a good story (actually a rather great one) the fact that it still has a pretty toned down card based battle system is urksome.  The combat simply isn't that much fun.  The fact that it also must transition into a battle as opposed to being right there in the action like it is in the first game is also a drag.  Granted this is a game that was remade from a GBA title, which certainly plays a part in that, but just the same it's a shame that while some enhancements were made to the original game to make the experience better, this particular game doesn't really have any that do.  Chain of Memories is also well known for just not letting you explore a ton or anything of the sort.  The story, however, is essential to understanding the overall plot of the Kingdom Hearts series.  It links to the second game and actually enhances the experience of that game.  It's worth playing through Chain of Memories just for the story alone, but the gameplay isn't all that exciting.The last bit is Kingdom Hearts 358/2.  The game was originally released on the DS.  You are NOT actually getting that game, though.  All you really get is the cutscenes from that game--enhanced and reworked.  They look gorgeous but it's not really all that exciting.  Granted, it probably would've been a bit much to remake the entire game in the same manner as Chain of Memories, but what you realize is that much of the cutscenes in 358/2 are quite dull.  It's worth watching for the sake of the story at least once.  And they're fully voiced and acted, but it's nothing too exciting.  For the most part much of it is rather dull.Even though the Kingdom Hearts HD Remix isn't as good as other collections out there, the price for just the original Kingdom Hearts alone is pretty worthwhile, as the game itself is amazing.  Even though there are some aspects that haven't aged that well, the game still looks and plays incredibly well even by todays standards.  If you haven't experienced the original Kingdom Hearts or you want to experience it again, this collection is for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2013"}

It was a Final Fantasy I had played when it was new and then lost access to. So, being somewhat of a game collector (my series of choice to collect is Final Fantasy and Armored Core) I picked up this one pretty cheap on amazon. The gameplay itself is pretty much standard fair, of when JRPGs or Final Fantasy's were still you know. Good. I'm sorry, I can't stand in any way shape or form the horrible ATB system that Square seems to have such a hard on for in their semi turn based gameplay. I couldn't stand it in X, was even worse in X-2. (I can't call it \"10, 2\" It's degrading) and guess what horrible thing they are including in 13? Yep you guessed it.Twelve gets a reprieve from this sentence because of the Gambit System and the fact that unlike 7, 10, and X-2 it actually has a plot worth mentioning. But I will get back on target now.My biggest problem with Eight, is it has a large slew of Happy coincidence that would make even Charles Dickens cry. I mean seriously, damn.  Squall being well...Squall... ugh. Why couldn't this game be about Laguna instead? *head desk.. head goes through desk* Squall continues the paradigm set by Cloud, in that they have to stick the worst or one of the worst characters in the game, as the main character. Because the guy that makes the 7+ (Tactics, IX and XII aside) can't write good characters up as protagonists to save his life. I hate, squall. Really hate Squall. Almost as much as Selphie.. No scratch that.. more than Selfie.Unfortunately as Squall is a core component of the game he drags down what could have been a good story down to mediocre. Every other character in this game is far better than he is in terms of character development. The plot itself is standard fanfare of a group of mercs, end up fighting some evil big bad thing bent on world domination/destroying the world (I'm trying not to spoil things here), and discover their significance in the greater scheme of things as the story progresses.So they have a solid working core for the story, and the secondary characters stories are fairly well constructed.... but Squall... again rears up his head and smites the story down from any high heights this solid foundation can achieve. Just like Cloud.The battle system can be turned into turn based combat (which given that there are no AI scripts for Allies, is a very good thing), thankfully. But there are hints of cracks in the franchise's integrity that appear in this game.I think personally these cracks were evident in 7 in abundance but the majority of gamers were too busy doing naughty things to themselves over 3-D graphics to notice. 8's coming out did not receive the fan fare because by the time it came out Gamers were used to 3-D. These cracks become larger as the series progresses. At first of course it's the little things _like those Dickens Coincidences) and a poor main character... Later it becomes things like basic premise and story. All in the trade off for shinier and shinier graphics. And of course stupid gamers buy more and more into this.My biggest beef with 8 is that reviewing it Four Games Down Later, that honestly you can see the start of Square's fall with it. And that fall started when they let go of the original Final Fantasy creator.Eight should however be cherished though, as it in my mind is one of a dying breed. Good JRPGS. JRPGS in general need to smack themselves silly and ditch the TROPES they have been running with for umpteen years, Japan is quickly losing relevance on the stage of the gaming world, because quite frankly American and European Rpgs decided \"you know what? let's make a good story, rock solid characters, and an enjoyable non turn based experience\" And you know what? You can't argue with the results. I doubt anyone would disagree with me when I say this. Mass Effect and KOTOR are some of the best rps ever. Fable II easily blows the post 6 FF series out of the water.So don't hate on Eight. Hate on it's maker. There is alot of gold left in 8 to be enjoyed all of these years later. There's still rock solid gameplay, a good enough to get the job done story (Damn you Squall damn you), and even better it's cheaper than the modern JRPGS to pick up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2009"}

The only way to get stronger is to find monsters with different spells and steal their spells for your attributes, which is fine and all, but it got extremely annoying having to do that until you reach 100 and for each character! It doesn't sound necessary but trust that's the only way to get stronger because as your level goes up, so do monster levels, so yes there's no point in even leveling up. Really stupid in my opinion, but it's a different type of thing that I think some people actually did like.  Not me. Every other FF was great as they were because they did not deviate the gameplay to this extent.For every thing else, the story was a definite plunge from 7.  FF7 blew everyone away and when this cam out, the characters were ok, but the story was pretty lame, but not too, too terrible and the music was forgettable.  The environments were about matched with that of 7, but less enjoyable. So overall, this is not a great game.I feel like this game is extremely overrated, getting so much positive feed back, but for what? My expectations were much higher after being so impressed by 7.  Maybe the bar was just set too high.  Maybe Square needed a break.  Then again, there are obviously people who love this style of gameplay, which gives them a much more different gaming experience.  Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst game ever, but it's just not the same Final Fantasy experience everyone loves.So bottom line, if you're new to final fantasy and haven't played this yet, I would say consider a different FF game.  But give it a chance if you're not that picky with RPGs.  Just don't expect much.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait. You can't buy a much better game.--John CockingPros:A story to beat all storiesCharacters worth caring aboutHey--it's from SquareSoftStunning animationsCons:Too many random battlesCombat is, as always, turn-based and offers minimal excitementWeak souls might give up after two or three discs of play","reviewerName":"The Gifted One","summary":"One of Squaresoft's greatest works...","reviewText":"I first found out about FF8 from the TV commercials that were in heavy rotation when it first came out.  It looked great and I heard it was an unprecedented 4-discs long.  For some reason I never got around to buying the game until the price dropped to $25.  I then bought it for $25 and the official strategy guide for a sale price of only $2.  I was amazed.  I've played this game 5 times.  Which is more than I've ever played any other RPG.  So you already know the replay value is immense.  Now for the breakdown review.GRAPHICS:  FF8 abandoned the cartoonish look of FF7 and Squaresoft opted for more realistic looking graphics.  Some of the scenes in this game could give some early PS2 games a run for their money.  The GF animations are crisp and clear and the characters look much better than FF7.SOUND:  FF7 had an incredible soundtrack that enhanced the gameplay and made that game even more memorable.  FF8 is no different.  I truly have to thank Nobuo Uematsu for all the hard work, time, and effort they put into this game's soundtrack.  Even the introduction music is stellar.  At times I would find myself humming some of these tunes in my head.GAMEPLAY:  This is where some have complained about FF8.  Obviously the gameplay is different from FF7 and as you already know, Squaresoft dramatically changes the gameplay with each FF release.  Sometimes it's for the better as it is here and sometimes it just doesn't work (FF9).  Materia has been replaced by GFs or summons.  Each character relies on them for abilities and what not.  Stats are increased by leveling up and by junctioning magic to certain stats.  Magic must be drawn from enemies or various draw points.  MP has been eliminated and replaced by the draw system.  GF abilites are learned by attaining AP from enemies after battles.  The actual battles are almost the same as FF7 except limit breaks can be used only when a character is near death or when he or she uses an Aura spell, whereas in FF7 they were charged as the character takes damage.  The difficulty level of this game was too much for some gamers.  Enemies get stronger as your characters get stronger rather than certain areas containing different level enemies.  I personally loved the difficulty level.  FF7 became too easy around disc 3 and FF9 was WAY too easy throughout.  The sidequests were more challenging than the other titles as well.  This game was a great challenge for me and I loved it.  Another great addition to this game was the Triple Triad card game.  This was an incredible mini-game throughout the whole game.  Even after you've beaten everything, you can still have fun playing Triple Triad.  Squaresoft should make the next online FF title have an online version of this card game.  The only drawback to this game is the number of things you can do inside the cities.  The cities themselves are vast and much more detailed than FF7 but the problem is that there are few places you can actually go to in the cities.  On FF7 and FF9 you can go inside item shops, houses, and other various places.  Even the massive city of Esthar only has about 8 places you can actually go inside of.STORY:  I don't want to spoil too much of the story for those who haven't played or beaten the game yet.  FF7 had a critically acclaimed storyline.  The storyline for FF8 is great as well.  The story will seem boring through much of disc 1 but by the time you've gotten to disc 2 they heat up (other than the horribly boring event at Trabia Garden).  At that point in the game I was hooked.  I came home from school everyday just to play this game.  You'll find yourself always wanting to know what will happen next.REPLAYABILITY:  As I stated above, it is incredible.  I played this more than any other FF title.If you're an RPG fan then you probably already have this title.  Then, if you're one of those people who are afraid of the effort required to play an RPG, you'll feel differently after playing this one.  I recommend this title to all gamers except for the weak-minded ones (the ones who complained that this one is too hard).  You may get bored in the beginning but by Disc 2 you won't be able to stop playing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2004"}

There are male contestants who either look mighty, cool or just plain weird. The female contestants usually dress classy or slutty. Hehe.Anyway, there is a bunch of different modes to play. The most fun is probably the adventure mode where you can upgrade things. Oh yeah--and Link from The Legend Of Zelda series appears only in this version of the game.

I have tried both of the other characters, and Spawn is cool, but a little awkward to fight with. Heihachi just sucks and is boring to experience.It's not the best fighting game ever but it is fast-paced and fun. Give it a go if you have a Wii or GameCube and some spare change to purchase it.

It's the first post-launch title that is interesting enough for me to validate purchase, and in my mind at least is the best game yet to showcase the PS4 capabilities.Let me preface my review by saying that I played the original, and really liked the gameplay, but the graphics left one wanting.  That is one area where this title really shines!I also must state that I have not yet completed the game, but so far I am really enamored with the game overall.Pros:+ Great graphics/visuals/effects -- not just talking specs here, as most know this one runs at 1080p, and plenty of Hz to keep the action fluid.  I don't know the FPS, but I'm not certain that would matter for my situ anyway, since my TV is 120Hz, with interoplation built in, whatever's the case, it's buttery smooth.  Character and textures are great, on my set at least.+ Most importantly -- Great gameplay --  loving the powers and controls are easy for me at least.  I'm playing the good right now, haven't tried the bad as of yet.I can't really find any cons thus far, maybe except the lack of PS4's out there, limiting some gamers from being able to enjoy this game.Overall:  5 stars.

One can run around and just hel folks (or punish them), spray paint using the DualShock 4's gyro sensor, invade antagonistic compounds to bring havoc to them, or even run through a storyline mission.Open world games often run into issues in which they quickly become repetitive experiences, sadly Infamous Second Son also has this issue, as each of the many districts basically have you do the same thing (Conquer the antagonist compound, then do the video file mission, hidden camera, drug busts, etc), doing this 16 times is pretty tiring and boring as it doesnt really vary much from place to place, though with several different powers to use things can get a bit varied in how one defeats the foes.Overall I had fun and it is thus far the most definitive PS4 available, the voice cast is amazing especially for delsin , fetch, and eugene, while the story really makes one feel for both protagonists and antagonists alike.

I stick up to date with games more than I play them and I wasn't impressed by the trailers. I decided to try it out because I got a good deal on the 32 gb version which included Nintendo land and zombie u. Also, I purchased the updated monster hunter tri.I was immediately surprised to find myself addicted to the Wii U pad and the new Nintendo home screen. For being something so large, it has a very comfortable feel when holding and its pretty cool to  use two screens at once instead of having to navigate menus. A lot of people complained about how long updates took, the updates were not bad at all. If someone thinks the updates are a pain, I believe they may be surprised when more and more games continue to require post-release patches.This brings be to another positive. Wii u is finally getting some of the more popular titles on the Xbox and PS3. And because of the touch pad, its able to do some pretty cool and different things.That and its backwards compatible with Wii games and all the Wii's hardware (controllers). You can bet money that its the only 8th generation console that will be backward compatible; the ps4 isnt backwards compatible and things aren't looking much different for the Xbox.Nintendo has also started better supporting online games which will will open up the market for several gamers who wouldn't even consider the Wii U. I'm also a fan of how I wont hear 9-year olds cussing each other out on the Nintendo network.The bad side is... well, can be pretty bad depending on what your looking for in a console.  Nintendo does a *superb* job of exemplifying \"fun\" over raw console power. But 32 gb is a rather limited space, though Nintendo was smart about this and allows expansion by SD / SDHC cards which are considerable cheaper that new hard drives and next to free when compared to the vita card. Some people may prefer a bigger hard drive while others are content with the cards. One things for certain, games are also requiring more hard drive space for installation as time goes on.This brings be to the next concern, the Wii u is not a huge upgrade in terms of performance when compared with how the current 7th generation ps3 and 360 are. 8th generation games are going to require more space and faster processing. I can see the wii u needing \"load\" times which wont be necessary for the future competitors.Although the wii u continues to put resources into its online aspects, its still pathetically far behind the ps3 and 360. Nintendo will have to do some serious work in terms of content and prices. My first system was a sega, I also played nes and snes in depth. I have plenty of memories playing games on all these consoles.... But the prices for these games has got to be cheaper. Im loading up on psn games (yes i know they wont be naively compatible w / the ps4) that are made with modern technology and high end graphics for the same price as donkey kong. Dont get me wrong, donkey kong is in every way as good today as it was  in 1994, but the price isnt worth the nostalgia when compared to the PS3 and Xbox game technology and prices. This is especially true when you consider console games have been emulated flawlessly on the computer for nearly 2 decades.The last downside im going to mention is only one gamer \"pad.\" Its impractical to even have 2 given that the thing takes up the entire charger. This is limiting in terms of the old fashioned everyone get in the living room and play the same game way. But again, it is compatible with all previous hardware so you wont have to buy any additions for the at home multi-player games you already have.So overall, for the time being, the Wii U is a great console; though unless Nintendo is planning another \"upgraded\" system, Im apprehensive to believe the Wii U will survive on fun alone. It has many unique features and is continuously improving its online, but its far behind competitors and old games are too expensive. Oh, and one other thing I forgot to mention, you can copy all your downloaded Wii games to the Wii U once you get a network engineering degree at a high end school for about $67,000. I inquired Nintendo about reimbursement but to my surprise, they do not refund you for the degree required to transfer downloaded games. But all in all, its not bad for a $67,000 console.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2013"}

Can't blame EA though, the maps are WAY bigger, and there are tons of vehicles.The single player is just okay. There are some pretty fun parts, but I wouldn't put it anywhere near the best single player games, like halo 3, MW2, MW1, etc. The last level is pretty sweet though. To note is that this campaign is a huge improvement over the last one (BC1), especially with respect to the NPCS/your squad mates (their dialogue is a LOT better)The multiplayer is where it's at. Here is where I mean that it is a nice contrast. It's really nothing like MW2, and in many ways its more realistic. The maps are massive and of course there are vehicles. The squad-support jobs of the classes are great and actually encourage you to act as a team and not just an individual. The teamwork found in this game almost can't be found in any other game, and when a squad really works together, it can be a ton of fun. Great game to play with buds, especially when you get a helicopter. There aren't a ton of customization options and such like in MW2, but you still get the feel that each class is really fun and important.

Stanley \"Viper_29\"","summary":"Great game, even with a few bumps...","reviewText":"Well, I have been enjoying Dead Rising for a week now and I can't honestly think of a game out there that is more fun than this one. While I do agree with everone else that the small font puts a damper on the mood, I have just learned to move on with it. I can read it but it is tough on the old eyes. I have a standard def 36\" WEGA and while it is small, it is legible. I will try it on my parents 61\" Hidef this weekend to see any difference. I can only imagine what the graphics look like if they look this great on my standard def TV.This game is very deep. The save feature is disappointing and you will find that you will learn to constantly bring up the map to check for save points. After you play for a hour or more and die and have to replay through it, you quickly learn. Another thing I don't care for is having to restart the game if you miss a \"scoop\" and it throws the rest of the game out. You can still play and do the missions, atleast for a while but you can no longer find the truth. This happened to me twice. The first time, I just plain didn't realize that it would happen and did not do the scoop missions in a timely manner. The second time I played through it, I thought I was doing great time and kept checking the watch (another feature you learn to do quite often) and when it said my next mission would begin at 3:00, I noticed that when it turned to 4:00, the missions ended and once again I lost the remainder of the scoop missions. Learn to watch the scoop timelines. They will slowly count down and turn colors to warn you. I guess I just had too much fun whacking zombies and lost track of the in game time.The depth of this game comes from the many ways in which to dispose of zombies. You can pretty much use ANYTHING in the game to take them out. One spot had me pick up a power auger, which is used to dig post holes. I stuck a zombie and cranked the gas and watched him spin around. Then, I proceeded to walk through the crowd of zombies and take them out. In the process of this, the zombie spinning on my auger started to break apart. This was a great laugh. Again, you can use pretty much everything in the game and while most do eventually tear up, you can always find something else. Another fun part was walking to the other end of the mall through the Leisure Park and seeing a push mower/brushhog and mowing down the crowd of zombies.I was completely impressed with the graphics of this game. While the zombies do tend to look a lot alike, the environment is just gorgeous. Capcom did a great job to put so many of the zombies onscreen at once. Later through the game, you will encounter bosses that can be difficult to beat. Just be sure to save before you fight a boss, although the first time around it is hard because you don't know when you will fight a boss. You enter a store and then wham, you have a boss fight. As you play through the game, you are encouraged to take pictures and help escort people to the security room, which is basically your home base. You will see that if you can capture pictures that pick up on drama or horror or even erotica, among others, will get you more points and these points along with the points for saving people will get you to level up which will help you increase your life or the amount of things you can carry or unlock special moves.This is definitely not a game for the younger crowd as it is very gory. I think Capcom has a hit on their hands and hopefully they can work it into a sequel in some way with improvements to the aforementioned bumps but hopefully they will get a patch over Live to help correct the text problems. Most of the time during the normal text there is not much voice over work. During the cutscenes, which are nicely animated, there is no problem as their is good voice over acting, incredible good when compared to the Resident Evil series. You won't go wrong with this game. It is a great game to enjoy so long as you are old enough to understand that things that you can do in the game can't be done in real life. As dumb as that sounds, there are those out there who might want to recreate something they did in the game.Enjoy this game and know that you will die often and have to repeat things over again but for the majority, it isn't a problem as things aren't often the same way the second time around, except for cutscenes of course. That is another great thing about this game, the repayability is incredibly deep. Forgive the text, the dumb AI and the lousy save functions and enjoy the game for what it got right.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2006"}

The controls are good, the camera is good, the sound is rich and unbelievable, the graphics are great, the lighting: unworldly.  The plot isn't super creative, but it doesn't have to be.  The concepts, as some have pointed out, have all been done before -- but it doesn't matter, they are all done _really well_.  I can't stress enough how much of an actual pleasurable experience this entire game was.I played the game through on \"Medium\" difficulty.  I didn't find it super challenging, over all, but it did have some moments thick in adversarial chaos.  I would say the game is more an Action Sci-Fi Horror game with elements of Survival Horror.  As you progress through the game resource management becomes somewhat more of an issue, but usually only in temporary bursts.  You do, eventually, feel the weight of your upgrade and load out decisions.Atmosphere, environment, level structure, and good game pace are all at the lead of the pack of factors that make this game so outstanding.  It is true that sometimes some parts are predictable, but it doesn't seem to bother me.  I just kind of lean in, grit my teeth, and yell \"Get some!  Get some!\".  Sometimes you see things coming, but it's so fun that you don't even care.  Lack of atmosphere and zero-G environments add to the diversity of the levels, which are diverse themselves.  There are definitely times where I just stopped and look at all the fantastic art.  Other times I just stood still and listened...  murmuring, strange half-heard prayers, things clanging around in the vents, all manner of strange ethereal audio clutter punctuated with moments of disturbing quiet.  Wait until you are fighting with no atmosphere...  downright creepy.There are, well, puzzles through out the game.  Most of them aren't very complicated, but they are fun to participate in, anyhow.  Every so often the game will throw you something that may not be obvious at first, but figuring it out usually isn't too much of a chore.Combat is really where the game does set itself apart from the average third person shooter.  I'll steal Penny-Arcade's description:  You are trying to inflict certain shapes of damage to specific weak points on the enemies.  It really does make for an interesting dynamic.  You can't just head shot or dump rounds into the body...  you really have to use the right weapon in the right manner or it takes too long or consumes too many resources.  There is enough of a variety in enemies that you keep busy with learning different tactics...  and then you have to adapt those tactics when you are attacked by groups...  even different tactics depending on the content of each group.I could go on and on, but if you aren't already convinced that this game is something you'd like to try then there is nothing I can say.  Very few games capture my attention like this one did, and even less I would even begin to describe as a pleasure to play.Fun.  Plain ol' fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2008"}

The overhead view of a car which you hijacked making its way through a city and you kicking ass was totally unprecendented for its time.  When the PS2 launched Grand Theft Auto 3, a new revolution in video gaming was born.  GTA3 paves the way for GTA: Vice City and GTA: San Andreas as three of the best games ever made for the system.  After beating San Andreas I decided it was time to go back and take a look at all three of these games, and decide which was the best.  GTA3 as stated before set the bar for the future GTA games.  The story is probably the most solid in this game, for the simple fact that it is tight, compact and does not involve too many subplots.  Vice City and San Andreas involve plots that are bigger than some movies.  The main reason for GTA3's success is it's central character known simply as The Guy and its scenery.  Yes, this is the smallest landscape you will encounter in the three games.  Yes, there is no map and your only sense of direction is the small circular radar in the bottom left corner of the screen.  Along the way you meet many interesting characters, many of whom you will kill by game's end and this is something you will learn to cherish.  You do kill most of the characters who are nice enough to give you work, but you know them for a long portion of the game before you so nonchalantly take their lives.  You easily do a good 10 missions for Kenji Kessen before Donald Love tells you to give him the axe.  This is something that is missing in both Vice City and San Andreas.  Going back to The Guy, he is clearly the most badass character in the GTA series and he pulls this off miraculousy without saying a word!  His demeanor, attitude and kick ass mentality will leave you smiling after his trail or corpses and dust.  Finally, the scenery in the game is top notch.  GTA3 is much much darker than both Vice City and San Andreas.  The late 90's setting is apparent in the gloomy, overcast three islands, which is essential to the storyline and characters.  You can't picture Tommy Vercetti wandering through these streets and making the same impact as The Guy.  This isn't to say that Tommy isn't a bad dude, but Vice City's glitz and glamour suits him much better.  GTA3 sets the bar for the two games which follow it, and it sets the bar very high.  This is a milestone in video gaming, yet Rockstar soon surpasses its milestone with its next installment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2005"}

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"MikeB \"Metalhead\"","summary":"Huge letdown","reviewText":"I was a huge fan of Mass Effect. I also liked Mass Effect 2, despite some disappointing changes in the core fundamentals of the game. I was really hoping that with the third and final game in the Mass Effect trilogy, Bioware would make the perfect game, listening to fan feedback, correcting past mistakes, and combining the best of the previous games. Unfortunately, Mass Effect 3 is the worst game in the series, making a lot of mistakes and omitting the parts that made the previous games so great.I loved the deep RPG elements of the first ME, so when ME2 streamlined (simplified) a lot of the RPG elements, I was a little disappointed. I hoped that ME3 would bring back some of the deeper RPG stuff, like weapon, armor, and character upgrading, but they kept it streamlined much like ME2. This makes the game feel more like an action shooter than an RPG.ME3 also simplifies a lot of your conversations, reducing the dialogue wheel to just \"renegade\" or \"paragon\" choices, and nothing else. For me, having tons of dialogue options made me feel more in control of my character. Now I feel like I can only play one of two characters Bioware forces me to be, instead of being \"my\" character. Less is the name of the game, and in an RPG, it comes as a letdown.The side missions in the first ME were not as good as the main missions, and after a while got repetitive, but I still liked that they contributed to my character's progression, both in experience and development. In ME2, the side missions were fewer, but felt more realized, and were overall better. Often, characters I saw and helped in ME would reappear in ME2, and in some instances they would give me more side missions. Your choices in the first ME seemed to have consequences in ME2. In ME3, most of your decisions in ME1 and 2 have little effect on ME3. Mostly it just results in one line from an old character, and you can't even respond to them. Then there's the side missions. Or, rather, the lack of them. What happened?ME3 was supposed to be the biggest, best, deepest game in the series, but it wound up being the smallest, shallowest game.The addition of multiplayer is interesting, and can be fun, but to force players to partake in multiplayer seems unfair, especially if you don't have an Xbox Live account. If you don't play multiplayer, it will have a negative impact on your single player experience. This is just plain wrong, to punish players for not paying for Xbox Live.The shooting gameplay is solid. It is very similar to ME2, with a few tweaks here and there. The addition of the stab action is neat, but doesn't make the game better. Overall, no real complaints in the controls or gameplay area.The biggest disappointment with ME3 has to be the ending. You've probably heard people complain about it, defend it, call it artistic, theorize about indoctrination, etc. The fact is, the ending is just sloppy. I won't spoil it, but without going into detail, I can say that the ending is nonsensical. For the people defending that it's artistic, I ask, what is the artistic merit in making a confusing, irrational ending that gives no closure and breaks continuity? For the people claiming that it's indoctrination, that doesn't make the ending less terrible. That's like stories that end with, \"it was all a dream\". Every writer worth his salt knows that \"it was all a dream\" is a cheap device that lazy writers use because they can't be bothered to wrap things up in a clever way.The biggest crime in the ending is that all of your decisions, big and small, don't count for anything in the last hour of the game. Renegade, Paragon, level 20 or level 50, male or female, which characters you saved, who you romanced, and all of that doesn't matter. No matter how you played, you will be funneled into a room and given three choices. Each choice result in the same ending with different colored explosion. What was the point of all my decisions up to this point if a level 20 female renegade can make the same decision and get the exact same ending as a level 50 male paragon with different squadmates? For a game that puts so much emphasis on letting players affect the story, the ending throws that out the window at a time when it was most important.Bioware offers up some DLC, and some say that future DLC will give closure to the game's ending, but this doesn't change the fact that I paid $60 for an incomplete game with a very poorly executed ending. Also, DLC doesn't fix the ending for people who don't have Xbox Live, or don't care to spend even more money on DLC. You must evaluate a product on what is presented, not on what could be, or might be, or speculation for the future. What is currently presented on the ME3 disc is a disappointment.There are some good moments in the main campaign, but side missions are few and poorly executed, RPG stuff is too streamlined, character development is limited, and the ending is just tacked on crap. Had this been the first game in another series, I would have just been content to say, \"bad game\" and move on. But I have invested both time and money into the previous games because of their excellent quality, and I had reasonably high hopes for the third game to conclude the amazing stories of these engaging characters I had grown to love. Instead, everything that mattered was discarded, and the ending was the final nail in the coffin.If you don't buy this game you will have to suffer through the lack of closure to your story, and if you buy this game you will have to suffer through the lack of closure to your story.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2012"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"R.

JAGELLA","summary":"No Game is Great Forever","reviewText":"After playing the first two missions of No One Lives Forever 2 (NOLF2), I thought I'd found what I previously thought did not exist: namely, a flawless game.  Everything seemed perfect, but alas, nothing is perfect in this world especially when it comes to computer games.Don't get me wrong; I find a lot to like in this game, not the least of which are the graphics.  My PC features a 128 MB Radeon 9800 Pro graphics card, so I was able to turn up the graphics options.  I believe NOLF2 may have the best looking rendering of people of any game I've played, and the AI is above average too.  There's a lot of detail in the visuals in this game, and almost everything looks clear which is a real plus considering that many of the newer games often look indistinct especially when they try to render tree leaves.Getting back to the first level or two--not only did the levels look good, but the gameplay, AI, and everything else worked really well.  You can even ride a snowmobile which I did even when it wasn't necessary.  These levels showed off the graphics of NOLF2 (see above), and I was impressed with a waterfall on the first level and explosions on the next level or two.But it didn't take much longer to see some flaws in this game.  Since it's a spy game, you naturally need to do a lot of snooping.  What I didn't like about the searching is that you need to point your cross hair all over the place to find text that tells you that you need to press the use key to do something like activate a switch.  It's very easy to miss these text prompts, and I spent a lot of time wandering a level or even going back and forth between levels only to realize that I'd missed a prompt when I was very near it a half-hour earlier!  Very frustrating.Another problem with the game is the stealth missions.  Most of the time NOLF2 is rather forgiving in that you can blast your way through trouble if you are spotted, but on at least one level you must either go back to the beginning of the level if you are seen or load your last save.  It must have taken me the better part of an hour and numerous reloads until I finally found the room I needed to search for without getting caught.  Nevertheless, the stealth missions in this game are better than what you find in most games, and you learn tricks to get through them.

The Old West. The Wild West. It has always seemed like a setting ideal for videogames, rife with lawlessness and conflict. Yet, the few forays we've had into this marvelous era of American history have been generally flawed or stricken with mediocrity, entirely unable to capture the spirit that made the period so enthralling. Until now.Rockstar Games has managed to deliver one of the few truly satisfying Western games the medium has seen - a game that also happens to be one of the finest in the industry as a whole.Set in the American Old West of 1911, Red Dead Redemption follows, in name alone, its predecessor, Red Dead Revolver - a property picked up by Rockstar that was somewhat well-received. The game centers on John Marston, a reformed outlaw after being left for dead by his gang, whose bloody past comes back to haunt him as he is forced by government officials to track down and kill his former brothers in arms for the safe return of his wife and son.  While the Easter Eggs are welcome, the nods to all of my classic Western favorites are plentiful, and there is plenty of humor (aside from the much prevalent satire/irony), Red Dead is mature in its story-telling, offering up a thought-provoking and poignant narrative that is as much social commentary as an interesting character study featuring revenge and redemption.The story spans miles of untamed and inhabited territory that makes for a compelling, dynamic open world, brimming with life and personality. The landscape is diverse, featuring plenty of locales, and often awe-inspiring, capturing the beauty of a once untamed west.  Stand around too long, however, and action is sure to find you. The game world is littered with dynamic and unique events which you can typically choose to partake in or ignore, whether you stop to help a women stranded out on the old dusty trail or find yourself being robbed at gunpoint with a decision to make.There are a lot of decisions to make in Red Dead Redemption, in fact, which all play into the gameplay. While most actions net a certain amount of Fame, they also award Honor - positively and negatively, which each have their own impact on the game. Drive Honor downwards, for instance, and people will fear you, quaking in your presence. Acting as an upstanding citizen (not trampling, kidnapping, or otherwise killing citizens, for example), on the other hand, makes you popular among the locals and eventually leads to discounts from most shopkeepers.While both paths have particular benefits, those treading the less honorable path will likely find themselves in a familiar scenario - being hounded by sheriffs with a \"wanted\" sign and a bounty on their head. Different crimes have different bounties - drive the price high enough and more law enforcement officers will be after you, including US Marshalls. Bounties can be paid off in most towns and cities dollar for dollar or with a pardon letter. Of course, there's also always the option of paying your debt to society by spending some time in the slammer.There's still more to do in the world of Red Dead Redemption aside from the main quest and unique world events. Towns are brimming with life, offering all of the amenities one might expect out west - various shops and gunsmiths, property to purchase, random (and often hilarious or interesting) encounters with \"Strangers\" offering side missions, jobs breaking horses or doing a night watch, and gambling minigames ranging from Texas Hold `Em to Liar's Dice to Blackjack to arm wrestling to horseshoes to Five Finger Filet. I remember saying to myself that Red Dead Redemption, for me, held up its $60 price tag simply as a  poker simulator, given the insane amount of hours I spent simply cleaning chumps out in Texas Hold `Em and, later, Liar's Dice - all of which is tracked, including your earnings/losses, in a comprehensive \"statistics\" page.On top of all that, there are four classes of \"Ambient Challenges\" with increasing levels of difficulty, ranging from herb collecting to treasure hunting to marksmanship and hunting skills when roaming the plains. Hunting the many species of animals in Red Dead Redemption is another remarkably fun way to spend countless hours (and rack up major profit selling skins), too. Larger towns and areas also offer bounty boards, where you can take on the challenge of going after bounty heads for decent payoffs - more if you bring your catch in alive.Still, with all of that being said, there's more that I've failed to touch on in terms of interesting things to do and ways to spend time in Red Dead Redemption's remarkably detailed and stunningly accurate portrayal of the old west. There's no way to truly capture the games open spirit until you wander its lands aimlessly for hours on end, feeling wholeheartedly engrossed.While the game features a wide open representation of the Wild West, it's not without direction. The main story takes on a familiar mission structure, which introduces a full spectrum of unique and interesting characters that we've come to expect in Rockstar games. More surprisingly, missions which one might expect to eventually feel repetitive or mundane  stay fresh and avoid becoming a slog - possibly because the genre is so underrepresented in videogames, or possibly because they help to establish the world and its inhabitants as honest, real, and believable characters. Even when you might feel like going from mission to mission to mission is taxing (though there's an unbelievable amount of content available to enjoy between missions at whatever pace you like) or that you're being jerked around like an errand boy, the irritation actually works in context of the story, helping you identify even more with Marston.The game controls in the standard third-person shooter manner, with a convenient weapon select wheel for quick access to your diverse, period-accurate arsenal. Auto-aim is turned on automatically for all but \"Expert\" targeting, allowing you to quickly snap to foes and dispatch them with ease. One main gunplay mechanic, lifted from Red Dead Revolver, is Dead Eye mode, which stops time, allowing you to paint targets with the targeting reticle commensurate to the number of bullets in your weapon and blow them away. The horse controls are also some of the best I've experienced, while the horse's movement animations impress.Visually, the game features wide open vistas and stunning landscapes with admirable draw distances. The west has been recreated with a noticeable (and remarkable) attention to detail and authenticity. Character models are look good in whole and the art direction is top notch. Character animations are smooth, while the physics make for some visceral and compelling gunplay (especially when you realistically blow out a leg and watch the varmint try and crawl away). The lip-synch is also well done - a must for a game this dialogue heavy.The voice work is great, adding another layer of believability and immersion to the game and enhancing what is an impressive, thoughtful, and gripping narrative, while gunshots and other ambient sound effects enhance the world even more. The writing is some of the best the video game industry has seen, with almost all of the content a reflection and poignant critique not only on the society and culture of the game world and old west, but of today. As usual, Rockstar once again offers a variety of both layered and downright insane, hyperbolic characters. The narrative is at its best in the game's closing chapters, offering a unique and unexpected game design decision not made lightly.Rockstar San Diego was also so kind to offer up multiplayer options in addition to the content-heavy singleplayer mode. In Free Roam, players are free to roam the exact same vast expanse of the singleplayer map, meeting (and potentially killing) players along the way, earn experience and leveling up through the completion of a huge list of challenges, and posse up with up to eight other players. Leveling up gives your character access to a variety of perks, including better mounts (horses), weapons, and new character skins.Multiplayer also features competitive game modes. While at their core they are standard multiplayer fare (TDM, death match, capture the flag), they feel fresh enough with the period-unique weapons, map, and game world to be incredibly fun. One particularly inventive decision is that each match starts with a duel, with all characters meeting center stage and scrambling in a wild shootout duel to see which team or character gets off to the better start.If all of that's not enough for you (greedy!), Rockstar has recently released a Co-op mission expansion pack, Outlaws to the End, available absolutely free of charge.Anyone citing the Western genre's lack of prominence in gaming as a concern for Red Dead's quality need not be concerned. Anyone fearing the title to be no more than \"Grand Theft Auto in the west\" need not be concerned, either (coming from someone who was overwhelmingly disappointed with GTAIV). What we're left with is a genuinely fun, interesting, unique title that is brimming with content that could easily eat up hundreds of hours, not even including the multiplayer and newly released (free) co-op DLC. Red Dead Redemption is a benchmark for both story-telling and compelling open worlds in the industry and an absolute godsend for those of us who love the Western genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}

Installed to HD, popped my 50\" Panasonic G10 into 360 mode. Hot wife and I took turns playing, we both took off work for a Bioware Holiday.BIOWAREThe Bioware Story-RPG is one of my favorite video game genres. I played through Mass Effect 7 times. Dragon Age 4 times, Jade Empire 3 times, KOTOR 5 times. BG2 twice. If you are one of the two million Bioware fan-person-types, you're in for a treat.MASS EFFECT 2 vs MASS EFFECT 1Bioware hasn't made a cutting-edge-technology game until now. ME1's graphics looked sexy in conversation-mode, but got a bit chunky in action-mode, and bizarrely pop-in-y in cutscene-mode. All of those tech-engine problems have been solved. They've been spanked like a naughty librarian. Like, if ME1 was Kate Beckinsale in Uncovered, then ME2 is like Kate Beckinsale in Underworld. If you rank graphics by sexiness per game-hour, Mass Effect 2 could give Uncharted 2 a run for its money. It's the most attractive Bioware game ever. This totally changes my outlook on the future. If Bioware can step up and make such a fantastic looking, smooth-playing bio-rpg in 2010, then I no longer think the world will end in 2012, and I'm going to stop nagging my hot wife about her carbon footprints (hottie can get a little dirty). Mass Effect 2 makes anything possible.ME2 vs MODERN WARFARE vs HALO vs GEARS OF WARMass Effect is a first-person shooter because they want shooter money. MW2 sold like 20 million copies. Halo 3 sold like 11 million copies. Gears of War both sold like 6 million copies each. Mass Effect 1 sold like 2 million copies. And its fps controls were suspect. ME2's controls feel fantastically better than ME1, they feel like AAA fps controls. ME2 has much better story than the comp. BUT. 1. No real multiplayer. 2. No constant action. Bioware makes Story-RPGs. (This is a beautiful thing.) A 35 hour game, I would guess, has 25 hours of interactive conversation and cutscenes, and 10 hours of shoot-shoot bang-bang. Mass Effect 2 has 4-star shoot-shoot experiences--inside a 5-star choose your own sci-fi adventure story. If you know Bioware, you know this. If you don't know Bioware, learn what they are, and what they are not. Mass Effect 2 is all about STORY.6 COMPLETE CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE NOVELSME2 is standard Bioware length. 35 hours per play through, average. 20 if you speed. 50 if you waddle. Multiply that action by how much of the experience you want. I play all three types, warrior, tech, superpowers. I play all three ways, good, naughty, wild card. I play male and female, and go though all the \"romances.\" And I play all the side quests. Even if you layer that action, it's a 120 hour + game. That's fantastic entertainment at 99 cents per two-hour session. That's as good a deal, per hour, as getting blu-rays from an  online mail-it-to-me company. That's like 12 novels long. Like 5 complete seasons of TV. Bioware's the only developer on the planet that makes this kind of beautiful uniqueness. This kind of awesomeness only comes around once every few years. Is this flavor of hot awesomeness perfect? No. Is amateur pornography perfect? No. Sometimes the pacing is off, or the dialogue excessive. But it more than gets the job done. The job is to delight. To experience a genuine human story--even if you're a lesbian space thief. Mass Effect 2 is classic VG storytelling. And better written than 99% of sci-fi novels, tvs, and movies.RATED M+17 MATURE = PG-13 (RE: SEX, VIOLENCE, PROFANITY)I told my hot wife about the ME1 controversy. The sexbox, the lesbian simulators, the blue alien \"hot talk.\" She asked if ME2 kept that or dropped it. (My hot wife likes lesbian threesomes. In books. In movies. In video games. In our kids' crayon drawings.) She never played a Bioware game before Dragon Age, but its lesbian threesomes made her a loyal fan-for-life, because, even though the presentation was lame, Bioware attempted to portray adult relationships. Now, in Dragon Age, the depiction of sex isn't much more sophisticated visually than taking two barbie dolls and slapping them together in slow motion with pimp music. ME1 is even more \"clean.\" No nudity, no nipples, no sideboob, half an asscheek if you don't blink. ME2 continues the PG-13 tradition, except it adds sexual profanity. ME2 has new romances, hotter than the previous. ME2 has new \"sex\" scenes, hotter than the previous, but I would say equally subtle. They're less graphic than Firefly/Battlestar. They're less graphic than vicky's secret catalog. The \"hardcore\" is that some of the dialogue, i.e. the punk blad chick, can get a little David Mamet-lite. The second Star Wars prequel had more sexxxy with Portman's pokies. So I told my wife to keep her expectation in check, that if she wants some big bouncing bowchikawawa to do a mefeediasearch for alicegoodwin. Mass Effect 2 is good wholesome fun, with robot violence, and a few spicy dialogues thrown in for Character. Our kids are young, but if they were in high school, I would let them play this game. It's like when The Matrix got an R-rating just for having one kick-to-the-head. Even Titanic brought the naked. ME2 is purely a PG-13 experience. Maybe someday Bioware will sack-up. I don't know if the problem is uncanny valley breast animation or fear of losing sales, but, I hope that they get off the fence and either go T for Teen and sell better, or put some actual mature 17+ content in their M+17 games. Sorry for the rant. I love Bioware, but I'm 32 years old and sometimes I feel they only care about the 12-24 boys. I guess it's selfish to want them to age with me. In any case, of all the PG-13 sci-fi stories in books, movies, tv, and games, ME2 is what they say. Fantastic character-based storytelling. Dark plot. Wicked powers. Witty dialogue. Sacrifice. No ewoks. Mass Effect 2 is the Empire Strikes Back of games.BUY IT, RENT IT, OR IGNORE ITWe hold all the power. We change the world everyday with our wallet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2010"}

I can definitely tell you this game deserves a lot of sales and a significantly larger fanbase. It's an amazing \"sequel\" I guess you can say, to Oblivion. Heck, it could even be Game of the Year worthy. That's just my opinion. However, there are some fields where the game falls back, and some things that make Oblivion stand out better. So, here are TWO pro and con lists, one for Skyrim as a standalone, and one comparing it to Oblivion.Pros Standalone+You can shake hundreds of hours out of this game, on one file. Thousands if more than one file!+Specific things level the more you do them, and there are several branches.+Looks amazing. (though personally I don't care for graphics)+Hundreds of quests and objectives, and the game helps you walk through them.+Huge selection of weapons, armor, apparel, and even in game books that teach you stuff or start quests.+Ability to decorate your house the way you want... to an extent (more on that later)+Several different groups to join, and deep stories within each one.+Every location in the game has a significance, not just it being there to kill monsters. There's a quest or story behind each location.+Several different magic spells to use.+It has a sense of realism to it, even if it is a fantasy RPG.Cons Standalone-Even after the two updates we've had so far, the game takes even longer to load. It takes awhile.-Speech is one hell of a skill to level, and it never seems the shopkeepers have enough money to sell most/all of your loot until you either take the long route to master it, or you take advantage of something, which makes the game unfair.-Money is really difficult to make in the beginning of the game, let alone storing your extra gear.-There are still a ton of glitches after the past few updates, such as when you try to place items throughout your house, when you leave/reenter the area, they fall back on the floor, and on some consoles the weapon plaques don't work... just go on the UESP wiki, there's a page full of glitches that haven't been fixed yet.-Game has frozen on my Xbox a few times, and at terrible timing.Pros VS. Oblivion+Less skills to level, but they have combined most similar skills (such as Blunt and Blade and Hand to Hand) for more unique skills.+Speechcraft and Mercantile have combined and made the skill overall slightly easier to level up, basically by talking to tons of people and using persuasion/intimidate/bribery, or just selling tons of crap one item at a time.+Your Magicka is no longer capped at 200 without fortified equipment.+Ability to use two swords (personally my favorite way of fighting in any RPG)+When an enemy parries an attack, you don't get recoiled/knocked back as irritably as you did in Oblivion. Come on, you all know how much fun putting up with that was.+Bound weapons last longer and don't cost an obscene amount of MP to use it for 15 seconds *coughBoundSwordcough*+Bound Bow has its own arrows so you don't have to waste your arrows (kinda goes with the Bound weapons section but still)+Healing spells don't cost an obscene amount of MP to heal as much HP (247 MP to heal 25 HP a second for 4 seconds? I don't think so!)+Enchanting is a lot better in this game than Oblivion, considering the side effects of the enchantments are a lot more powerful, you can boost the effect of your enchantments with Alchemy potions, and they are more effective than that enchantment altar.+Finding the 'Stones' I guess you can call them are easier and more effective, as they are marked on your map. (The stones from the signs from Oblivion, such as the warrior, steed, etc)+Riding a horse is easier.+The leveling is easier in this game and less stressing (such as trying to get that +5 attribute increase per level) You can choose between HP, MP, and Stamina, and then save your perks for when you decide. You can also level ANY skill and it level your progress up.Cons VS. Oblivion-Can't have stuff equipped in both hands and still use magic (such as a sword and shield, bow, and warhammer) You have to have one hand free to use the spell.-Alchemy is dumbed down by quite a bit. All of the effects are a mystery (unless you eat the first one but it's hard to find two ingredients that have the same first effect) so you're stuck either wasting time doing trial and error to find ingredients that match, wasting time to look up online or on a guidebook for what ingredient has what effect, or wasting up to three perks to eat an ingredient and having all the ingredients in the game's database. Leveling Alchemy is much of a bigger pain because now it doesn't base off how many potions you make. It bases off the value of the potion you make, and making expensive potions can be a pain, let alone finding a good amount of the ingredients to make such potions. I mean yeah now you don't have to worry about raising Alchemy level to unlock more effects, but this isn't worth it.-Increasing your carrying capacity is more of a hassle. In Oblivion you could cap your strength at 100 and have 500 capacity, plus anything from fortifying Strength/Feather on equipment, let alone using a Feather spell to increase it even further! While in this game, you have to level your stamina (which after awhile becomes a waste) to only get FIVE more capacity per level! Speaking of which...-There aren't as many useful spells in this game as there were in Oblivion. *Feather's gone, which is a major setback to all those looters out there. *Chameleon is also gone, but it was exploited in Oblivion so I guess I can understand.*Light is replaced with a crappy ball of light that only lasts a minute, whether you have it floating above you or stuck somewhere.*Night eye's gone.*Cure disease/poison is gone. Now you have to lug around potions or wear equipment that gives 100% resistance to it (luckily there are quite a bit of 100% resist disease equipment out there)*Fortify health/magic/stamina is gone.There are some more but I don't wanna just rant on and on about it.-No spellmaking.I know it sounds like I'm just bagging on the game's flaws, but I am pointing out how amazing this game is. I know the game came out nearly a month ago, so there could be updates coming out, and this review could be updated accordingly. If you have the money, get this game. You will not be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00020LZBG","description":"The third installment of the Ratchet & Clank franchise incorporates new elements of gameplay not seen previously in the series, including online and offline multiplayer capabilities that will appeal to a wide variety of players.Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenalreturns gamers to Planet Veldin, the setting of the originalRatchet & Clank, where the duo set off on a gripping new adventure through a multitude of diverse planets to fight for galactic peace. Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"Absolute Best of the Original Trilogy","reviewText":"At the time I played this game, I had only played the very first two \"Ratchet and Clank\" games, so I am not sure how this compares to the new ones.  But, as far as the original trilogy is concerned, it seems that every \"Ratchet and Clank\" game gets better than the one before it, and this one is just awesome.  If you are familiar with the series and like the other games, I can tell you right now that you'll love this one.  If you're new to the series, then let me tell you a bit about it.  The top things that makes this series stand out from others, I think, is the weapons and the humor.  In this game, you can explore lots of different planets, all the while using a variety of really fun weapons to destroy your enemies, such as rockets, little robots that go attack things on their own, and even a gun that turns enemies into ducks.  This game, like the others, is also very funny, including some of the funniest cut scenes I've ever seen.  This game, of the original three, is the funniest, I believe.The game has a fairly interesting story, as well.  In this game, a robot named Dr. Nefarious wants to kill all living things (which he calls \"squishies\").  If that's not bad enough, the moron Captain Qwark is in charge of the fight against Nefarious.  He's even assembled a little team of characters from the first game, Helga, Al, and Skidd.  And also a monkey.  I enjoyed the story and characters in this game even more than in the previous two.  (And this is the first game to have Dr. Nefarious, who I think is a really great addition to the series.)Anyway, this game has new weapons, of course, and I really like the fact that they can level up even more now than they could in the previous game.  Unique to this game is a hub-like area, the Starship Phoenix.  This is where you go in between missions.  You can train here, buy weapons and armor, and even play vid comics.  The vid comics are fun little side-scrolling games starring Captain Qwark that tell of his past fights against Dr. Nefarious.  And like the rest of the game, they can be pretty funny, too.This game is a decent length, and it helps that there are also some extra things to do, as well.  There is multiplayer, though I can say nothing on that because I've never done it.  There are also trophies and Titanium Bolts you can find.  The trophies don't seem to do anything, but collecting Titanium Bolts allows you to buy different skins to change how Ratchet looks.  There are also Skill Points like the previous games, which you get for completing certain tasks (though, you don't know what they are until you do them).  Like the last game, there is an arena where you can battle enemies for bolts.  Unlike the last game, the arena also has a dangerous obstacle course, which is fun.  There's also another Insomniac Museum, showing things that didn't make it into the final version of the game....This game can be quite challenging, which is nice, though I find the Titanium Bolts easier to get than they used to be.  Any flying areas are easier than in the previous game, too, but that's an improvement for me, as the flying parts of the last game were a pain.  Once you beat the game, there is also challenge mode, if you want more of a, well, challenge.A few random things to mention.  The graphics look nice in this game.  I thought the music was better (but maybe that's just me).  The voice acting is great, like usual.  I felt almost everything in this game was either just as great or even better than the previous games.  I really enjoyed it, and it made me a much bigger fan of the series than I was before.  As I said before, any fans will enjoy it, and anyone who hasn't played before should start out with this one.  It's a lot of fun.  I love the weapons, the characters, the humor, the vid comics.  Why not give it a try?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"Jack Fox, Badgerlord","summary":"Decent FPS. Not the greatest Bioshock game","reviewText":"I'll probably get a bit of flak for this... But I don't think it's as amazing as everyone else seems to. Keep in mind these reflect my opinions, and the things I dislike may be the reason everyone likes it. Also keep in mind this is based on 3.5 hours of gameplay.Neutral Thoughts:The game takes place in 1912, and if you don't like overly religious tones in a game, or you get easily offended by things like Black people still being treated as slaves, you may want to stay away from this game as both of these are everywhere. I don't know a whole lot about how the story will progress, but they do talk about it quite a lot in the game such as separate white and black bathrooms etc.... I categorize it all under parody, and they aren't being offensive that's just kinda how it all was back then. I only say this because a friend of mine really disliked that part of the setting and it bothered him so it may bother others as well.In a bit of a different take on things the main character has a much more drawn out history in the game. The in the original Bioshocks you knew very little about the main character until about half way through, and on top of that he never spoke. This time around it's like the main character won't be quiet! But you do get bits and pieces of his past, and you learn why he's there as the story progresses.Likes:+Still got the Steampunk feel.+The storytelling is as good as ever, it's one of the my favorite things about bioshock it knew how to tell a story, and without interrupting the action with a long cut scene every 2 seconds, you stay in the First person perspective the entire time. You hear tidbits of the history of the city in audio journals as you progress and you can piece together what has been going on.+Tonics and Weapon Diversity. There are plenty of options for weapons and tonics. From pistols to Snipers to Rocket launchers if you have a fav gun type I bet it's in the game plus the tonics offer a few fun options as well. The only problem I have is that they removed the ice tonic =(... and the Crossbow.+Melee is there for those that like it... I don't. I never use melee if I can help it but i know a lot prefer too and there are a good deal of options and customization with gear later on for Melee.+Traveling on the skyrails is interesting and doesn't feel clumsy or difficult to do at all+You can upgrade your weapons and tonics with money and you don't have to find a power to the people machine to do so+You can find gear that gives different bonuses and abilities such as fire attack when you melee or bonus damage to certain tonics etc...+The main villain's presence is everywhere and it is done very much the same as Andrew Ryan's presence in Bioshock 1 and I like that.+Scavenging and looting is still around and is the same as it was in previous titles.So those are the things I like, and all in all it makes for a decent game... that all been said I have some minor problems with it that kind of bring me down. (remember these are all personal dislikes, others will like the game for these exact reasons)Dislikes:- The game has turned into less of a bioshock style FPS and more into a Call of Duty/Halo style FPS, and I'll explain what I mean by that below.- You only get to have 2 weapons at any point in time. I FLIPPING hate when I'm limited to two weapons, it's the thing I hate the most in recent FPS games, and I wish to hell it would go away. I want my RPG, My sniper, my Machine gun, my pistol, my shotgun, I want them all at once. This game forces you to put down a weapon and pick up another when you need it. For instance, I had two guns I really liked, the carbine and the shotgun, then the game gave me an RPG, so I switched the shotgun for that cause I like explosives but I kept the carbine for the longer ranged needs. Then of course the game basically forced me to pick up the Sniper Rifle, and I love snipers but I don't like having a Sniper and an RPG, it leaves me vulnerable in middle-close range. At least with a Carbine I can shoot fairly quickly if I needed too. IF there was a place I could store weapons and switch them out later... Maybe I could have accepted that, but there isn't. The game gives you a weapon and if you leave it there, you can't get it later unless you find it again. That may work for Halo, that may work for Call of Duty. But this is neither of those games. In the past bioshock games we had all the weapons. Why change that now?- Gone are health kits and eve hypos. Now you have regenerating shields and no ability to recover salt (eve). At least not without special gear I assume may exist later. I am personally not a fan of regenerating anything, I liked how bioshock 1 and 2 were throw backs to the old days of Quake or Doom (Corridor shooters I believe some call them). In B1 and 2 if you were low on health and out of medkits you were put in a state of careful tension, trying much harder to not get hit etc and personally I liked that style of gameplay. It was still run and gun, but you had to be careful.- I feel the enemies have less... I dunno I guess less heart or emotion. In B1 and 2 they seemed to have a personality and a life of their own.... now it's just another game where you fight normal people with guns. I liked the splicers, I liked that everyone in rapture had gone insane and weren't just blindly following a leader.- I miss Mr.Bubbles- Controls... I don't have a lot of complaints about the controls, only two minor issues, first maybe it's my PC but I can't seem to get the mouse Sensitivity to work right, works great in every other game I play, but this one either seems to fast or too slow and there is no in between. Second, and maybe this is another personally thing, but WHY did they make the aim down the sites a toggle? I don't know why but it drives me crazy, I only want to aim down the sites when I hold the button down, not click once and have to click again to stop aiming. This may just be how I play but I switch in and out of iron sites constantly (And i mean CONSTANTLY) in other FPS games, but this one makes it more difficult and clumsy and I wish there was an option to hold to aim, not toggle. Other than that, controls are fine and you can remap them like I did, which is always nice.All in all, I think the game is good. But I can't shake the feeling that while it looks, and sounds and smells like a Bioshock game... it doesn't feel the same. It doesn't have the same magic that I think the first 2 had.I give the game a 3.75/5 (rounding to 4 cause it's still fun), it's a good modern FPS. But not a great Bioshock Game, and not as fantastic as I was hoping.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}

To me it looked like a Bioshock type of game set in post-apocolyptic times.  I was way off.Graphics:  3.5/5  -  This game can look really good at times, and really bad at others.  The weapons are A+ in detail, along with most of the underground vehicles and enemies.  Other times, when you are on the surface, the textures are just plain ugly.Story:  3/5  -  The story isn't terrible, but it isn't great.  It just never really leads to anything.  There is an alternate ending though, which I didn't meet everything to see.  So the other ending could be a lot better.Replayability:  1/5  - The game is VERY linear.  There is little to no exploring.  Nothing that isn't just going slightly outside the main path.  Although you can visit each chapter and section after you beat the game.  For achievement hunters.Other:  The enemy AI is terrible.  They won't even notice you at times, and other times they will see you when you are supposed to be hidden.  The stealth aspect doesn't work as well as it was supposed to in this game.Overall I would say it's a good rent.  The achievements aren't too easy, but not too hard.

{"product_name":"B0017ZIIK6","reviewerName":"Supreme Warrior","summary":"A Different Mortal Kombat game","reviewText":"MK vs. DC Universe is a surprisingly good game. The gameplay is pretty deep for a Mortal Kombat game. Freefall Kombat and Klose Kombat add more depth to the game even though it seems more like luck than skill when trying to figure out the right button presses to defend yourself in Freefall and Klose. Rage is also a great and powerful addition to the game. Test your might is OK but the game probably could have done without it. The Kombos that are powerful enough to help you to be very good at the game are very difficult to do, but in many cases you can create your own kombos making it easier to do more powerful moves. The story does not make too much since to me. Superman is vulnerable to kryptonite as we already know but what many people don't know is that he is also vulnerable to magic. If Superman was loosing his powers to magic particularly his super strength then superheroes like Wonderwoman and Captain Marvel who also have super strength, are not vulnerable to magic and they should have been able to retain their strength. In other words some of the other DC heroes and villains would not be vulnerable to magic like Superman and then should be able to easily defeat any MK character. But I guess when the realms were merging it was effecting every characters powers even though they could still use it in Kombat.

While the game's &#34;hacking&#34; element never really goes much beyond quick button-mashing and simple mini games, it does create a very entertaining and satisfying gameplay element which challenges you to slow down and be creative about how you progress in ways that GTA just doesn't. The more creative you are, the more rewarding (and hilarious) your antics become. This added layer takes a very little while to get used to, but before long you're experiencing a whole added dimension to the way this kind of game has played before. Honestly, this is the game Rockstar SHOULD have released in GTA V...which was a complete letdown imo (just more of the same, no different than GTA IV). Lots of fun, lots of replay value, feels somewhat familiar yet breathes a whole new life into this type of game. I also noticed quite a bit of inspired visuals from Deus Ex: Human Revolution, a wonderful game in its own right. Worth the purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2014"}

What I'd like to focus on, in particular, is my favorite scenario in the game, and the one that makes this game an absolute 360/PS3 classic, in my opinion...Pripyat, Ukraine.Without a \"shadow\" of a doubt (\"S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl\" is a PC-only game focusing solely on Chernobyl and its surroundings), this game is nothing short of a \"Chernobyl\" freak's (for lack of a more appropriate phrase) wet dream.  If you know anything about the Chernobyl disaster, and the evacuated town of Pripyat (which was built solely for the workers of the plant), you know that this game not only represents it very faithfully (with the exception of the proximity of some of the locations to one another (e.g. the \"dodgems\" being within twenty feet of the ferris wheel (neither of which are near the pool, btw))), but places you (after approaching it with the Chernobyl plant clearly in the background, then storming through dilapidated (and ransacked) apartments) in the most notable parts of the city, including the hotel, the swimming pool, and the amusement park (complete with the aforementioned famous ferris wheel and bumper cars (neither of which were ever used), both of which you can actually use as cover as you await extraction by your team).  Not only that, but it gives you a clear view (probably closer than would be in reality, based on the actual distance from the hotel (over 2 km)) of reactor four (the one that exploded) with its surrounding sarcophagus, all in photorealistic detail (as you snipe the bad guy immediately in front of it from half a mile away).  I haven't had the chance to play \"shadow\" yet (don't have a decent gaming PC to play it on), but I'd imagine that until (if...not likely) it arrives on home gaming consoles, \"Call of Duty 4\" will continue to contain the most accurately detailed rendition of Pripyat available to non-PC gamers, and I will continue to enjoy exploring it as fully as possible.Having recently researched (prior to playing the game or having any awareness of it) all of this out of mere fascination (the city has been central to studies regarding human-evacuated areas and post-apocalyptic Earth), I was stunned to realize that this game not only recreated this devasted scene, but used it as a central plot point in the game (Chernobyl being the source of nuclear materials for the antagonist).  While one can't complain in good faith, I would have absolutely loved to have fully explored the Chernobyl site (with full radioactive gear, of course) as well...though the story probably wouldn't allow for it, I'd love to see this in \"Modern Warfare 2.\"  Perhaps they can weave some sort of story involving the new dome that's being placed over the reactor (which is supposedly going to contain the radioactive material for the next 100 years)...?  Eh...it's an idea, anyway.Diverting from discussion of this one scenario, the rest of the game and its locations are equally impressive.  The \"training\" scene is one of the most intense gaming moments I've ever experienced, as you have to race off a sinking ship and jump to your extracting helicopter literally without missing a turn.  All of the locales are faithfully recreated (apparently using photographs/video, as with Pripyat), and contain truly great voice acting (unlike most modern games, they don't sound like voice actors (e.g. \"Bioshock\")), and you actually feel like you're a part of whatever location you're in (thanks largely to the steady 60 fps framerate (note that the game is actually exceeding this and is limited by v-sync to keep it steady), a goal that every modern game should be prioritizing (\"Metroid Prime\" had us there six years ago, and was intensely immersive as as a result)).  Aside from the typical FPS action, you will also have missions such as firing on ground troops from an AC-130 (using infrared via TV to strike...very realistic) that are a welcome break from the intensity.All things considered, \"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare\" is every bit the masterpiece that it is hyped to be (imagine that), and honestly, there isn't much that could have been improved upon in any feasible way, given the current limitations of console hardware.  If you haven't played it for some reason (especially if you're as equally fascinated by Chernobyl and the Zone of Exclusion), you are genuinely missing out on a fantastic gaming experience that simply blows all other FPS titles out of the water (even the aforementioned \"Bioshock\").  Forget renting it...spend the money and own this title now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2008"}

Rhodes","summary":"\"War Has Changed...\"","reviewText":"Pros:+Very satisfying story+Incredible voice work+Incredible cinematics+Eagle eye attention to detail+A lot of gameplay elements+Memorable Music SoundtrackCons:-Long cutscenes.  To the point where you feel more like you're watching than playing.  This goes a long way as you'll play for five seconds to be treated to cutscenes several minutes long-Some load times are really annoying-The Camera can sometimes be a painAfter three and a half long years of waiting, Metal Gear Solid 4 finally drops down on the Playstation 3.  With a lot of questions to answer and some mighty big shoes to fill, Metal Gear Solid 4 is easily one of the most anticipated video games ever made.  For the Metal Gear fan, the game is absolutely fantastic.  Continuing an already mesmerizing story, Metal Gear Solid 4 proves to be one of this generations greatest games.Metal Gear Solid 4 is the conclusion to Snake's story.  The game is told through some gorgeous cutscenes.  There's a lot of detail to the characters faces, their actions and it has some fantastic voice acting to boot.  You'll want to grab some popcorn, though, because there are definitely a lot of cutscenes in Metal Gear Solid 4, and some of them are really long.  This is easily the biggest problem with Metal Gear Solid 4 and it's one that has often plagued the series.  While the cutscenes are very dramatic and well written, and while they even shed some humor, some of them are just too long, some of them seeming almost useless.  If a cutscene is getting a little long, though, it would be a grave mistake to skip it as you might miss some important parts of the story.  And if there's any Metal Gear Solid game one should be playing for its story, it's this one.  The other big problem with the cutscenes is how they come at you, even early on.  There are moments where you'll play for a matter of seconds only to be sit through a cutscene that's several minutes long.  At the very least, you can pause the game during the cutscenes.  However, it's hard to get over the fact that some of them really drag on.  When you get to play the game, though, Metal Gear Solid 4 is amazing.Metal Gear Solid has always been about stealth.  The same is true of Guns of the Patriots.  The difference being that you're also in the middle of a war and there are two sides fighting against one another, the PMCs and Militia.  You're able to help the militia and doing so can have its rewards, such as characters being willing to give you items or being able to go through certain areas more easily. Although, you can also turn the Militia against you.There have been some improvements to sneaking around, though.  The camouflage system has returned but it's much better.  Rather than having to go into the menu constantly, Snake's camo will change automatically to blend in with the environment and help him evade enemies.  You can also hold up enemies just like before, only this time you can perform body searches while holding them up rather than having to shake them down.  You can also restrain them to the ground to knock them out.  If you really need to get by an enemy and you're running out of options, you can always play dead.  This also works when you get spotted and knocked down by an enemy.There's also the implementation of the Solid Eye.  This is more vital to sneaking around than anything.  It works very similar to the radar in Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, showing you how much noise you or your enemy is making.  Also new to here is the threat ring.  The threat ring surrounds Snake at all times and will begin to act up depending on how close an enemy is to him.  All of these seem like they'll take forever to get used to, but you'll quickly adapt.  Just like previous games in the series, if you're spotted, you'll have to escape from the enemy and hide.There are also moments where you can take control of a Metal Gear Mk II, a very small version of Metal Gear that is controlled by Snake.  This little guy allows Snake to scout out the area ahead.  You can also use the Metal Gear Mk II to stun certain enemies.Lastly, Snake has a psyche gauge.  This is very similar to the stamina gauge in Metal Gear Solid 3.  The gauge depletes depending on how stressed or exhausted Snake is.  You can refill this by eating certain snacks like Rations or Noodles, but you can also refill it by resting for a while.  But there are plenty of factors that affect Psyche.  For example, if Snake has been in the sun too long, you'll have to move him into the shade.  If he's been in cold water, you'll have to get him out of it.  As his psyche gauge gets lower it becomes harder for him to perform certain actions, such as being able to aim properly.  In other words, from time to time Snake will need to rest.  Though there are also certain points in the game where his psyche gauge is restocked automatically.You won't always be in stealth mode forever, though.  There will be times when you have to fight, and the shooting mechanic works much better in Metal Gear Solid 4.  When you're thrust into combat, the game plays very similar to a third person shooter.  Allowing for more precise aiming and no longer forcing you to go into first person view to land a well placed shot.  There's also a weapon shop where you can purchase, upgrade or customize weapons to your liking, another element that works to your liking and gives Metal Gear a lot of customization.All this variation in gameplay means that Metal Gear Solid 4 has several different ways to approach it.  Combine it's various gameplay elements with a selection of difficulty levels to up the challenge, and Metal Gear Solid 4, like the three before it, becomes a game you'll want to replay again and again.  Sometimes it's just fun to mess around with your enemies or just to see how else you can go about a certain area.Visually, Metal Gear Solid 4 is incredible to look at.  There's a ton of detail in the environment, and the atmosphere is also a good one.  You're very much immersed in the world of Metal Gear Solid 4.  There are a couple of load times that can be annoying, especially the installation.  The camera, while it's great, can sometimes be a pain.  It's easy to control, but sometimes you'll find yourself fighting with it.Music wise, there's a memorable score to Metal Gear Solid 4.  There's a lot of voice work as well.  Much of it is great, although at times you will get the feeling that some of the voice actors and over-acting.  On the whole, Metal Gear Solid 4 is a beautiful looking, (and sounding) game.Metal Gear Solid 4 is an amazing experience.  If you can handle lengthy cutscenes you'll be satisfied with the final results.  If you can handle a couple of annoying load times, you'll be satisfied.  The amount of gameplay here is incredible, and the fact that there are so many ways to go about each area is also a lot of fun.  For Metal Gear fans, Metal Gear Solid 4 is easily the reason to own a Playstation 3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

The amount of weapons and moves that Ratchet and Clank have is just amazing. Also the graphics, oh man. They're great! The graphics remind me of Daxter, but they're very good. Overall, this is a game that'll keep you involved for hours without seeming like work. If you liked Daxter or anyother game in the Ratchet and Clank series, give this one a shot. Even at the price without playing one of those games, you could give this one a shot. It's worth it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2009"}

I feel like Rockstar brought together a lot of fantastic elements from prior GTA installments and meshed them nicely in GTAV.I like the characters and story so far.  I like the ability to swap between characters almost whenever I want, depending on who I feel like playing.  The car customizing is a lot of fun too.  I look forward to this showroom I keep hearing about.  Driving controls feel about where I'd expect.  LOVE the property purchasing aspect, which I really liked in Vice City!  A lot of the side missions are very entertaining/funny, and can be played from each characters perspective (some, not all...or at least that is my understanding).One thing I hate, which is fairly minor, is the swimming controls.  I just find them awkward but that could just be me.  Minor bugs here/there which has had almost zero impact on my enjoyment of the game as a whole thus far.In short, very impressed at roughly 30% and look forward to continuing to explore the game!

As a whole, it has plenty of its own merits, but doesn't really live up to the legacy of either series.Killzone 2 depicts a war between the \"good guy\" ISA and the \"bad guy\" Helghast. The former are conventional-looking space marines, while the latter are clad in gas masks and bulky gear. Really, though, the storyline acknowledges that there aren't many differences between the two sides morally; both sides are guilty of various war crimes, and so on. Otherwise, the story is completely standard for a space-based game. In single player, you play as an ISA special forces soldier fighting through waves of enemies to try to capture the Helghast leader. In multiplayer, you take on the role of a soldier on either side of the conflict.The game's FPS system is nothing particularly special. Killzone 1 made an effort to show the player's body, for example when climbing ladders. This was meant to be different than older games that treated the player like a box with a gun strapped to it. In Killzone 2, that spirit is alive, but it's no longer \"unique\", so it just feels like a standard FPS. The weapons handle somewhat poorly, but not in a badly-designed way; rather, it feels like the game is trying to emulate the difficulty of actually handling weapons. The player moves and turns slower than many other First Person Shooter characters. Additionally, for whatever reason peripheral vision is poorly represented in the game; playing online, I was often ambushed - and was able to easily ambush others - from their side, and generally nobody attacked from the side noticed they were being shot at until they had already died. There is also a cover system available in single player mode, where the player takes cover and ducks out to shoot; oddly, this system is not usable in multiplayer, and players must make do with ducking behind cars or walls.The game has a fairly standard complement of weapons, with a few more unique guns in the single-player mode. Both the ISA and Helghast have a standard assault rifle (though the ISA's rifle has a better sight than the Helghast one), and there's the usual assortment of shotguns, submachine guns, sniper rifles, and rocket launchers. In the campaign, more exotic guns are featured; flamethrowers, bolt-guns that staple enemies to the wall, and lightning guns. All of these guns have fairly detailed reactions from their victims, which is at least more interesting than the standard \"shoot them and they die\". Finally, there are two types of grenades: frag grenades, which can be \"cooked off\" to detonate on impact, and lightning grenades, which shoot out tendrils of lightning instead of exploding. Neither is thrown particularly well, and they usually seem to fall short of where they ought to go.Multiplayer is one of the main attractions of the game; its primary feature is how it handles game modes. When you go into a game, each map is divided into multiple rounds. Each round is a random game type (depending on the server), so you can have a regular Team Deathmatch followed by a Capture The Flag round followed by a Bomb-Planting mode. This makes for a more fun and dynamic mix than most games, where you end up playing the same game mode all the time. The game modes also do a good job of staying reasonably in-character, rather than being outlandish or ridiculous; the \"capture the flag\" mode is actually grabbing a single propaganda speaker and putting it in a safe location, rather than stealing an enemy's flag from their base. Multiplayer also contains a class system, similar to Battlefield or Team Fortress. At the start, the player can only use the Soldier class armed with a default assault rifle. As they play the game, they gain points that grant them levels. Leveling up grants new weapons for the soldier class and entirely new classes. The soldier class is the most widely armed class, as it can be equipped with an assault rifle, a shotgun, a submachine gun, a light machine gun, or a rocket launcher. The medic class can only be armed with an assault rifle, but is capable of reviving near-dead allied units. The engineer class has a shotgun and can build sentry turrets and ammo boxes. The tactician class can set new spawn points for allied units and call in air strikes. The assault class runs faster and has more health than a normal soldier, but can only be armed with explosive weapons (not good for close-combat situations). Saboteurs can disguise themselves as members of the enemy team and throw C4. Finally, scouts are the only class capable of wielding sniper rifles; they also have the ability to cloak themselves and mark enemy units with data that's transmitted to allied units (so that everyone can see where an enemy is).In addition to direct leveling-up, there are certain actions that give permanent rewards. For example, having ten games where you score more than ten kills grants you an extra frag grenade on every spawn, while having ten games where you score 20 points and don't kill yourself or any allies grants you more ammo. These kinds of bonuses are primarily useful for longevity; that is, they don't affect actual combat, but just allow you to get more done without having to go back to an ammo resupply (which is useful in and of itself).The multiplayer maps are probably the game's best point. Ranging from urban environments to military bases to remote wasteland villages, the maps are huge without being overwhelming. They add to a feeling of having an entire battlefield, and combat will generally move around to different points of the map based on objectives. Therefore, it avoids what a lot of games have where combat always ends up being in the same spot. It's also a lot less linear than a lot of FPS maps, allowing keen players to sneak around the enemy lines and take them from behind.As a whole, Killzone 2 is a solid game. There's nothing new or unique about it, but it works and it's fun. Currently, it doesn't have a lot of competition on the PS3 (whereas with an Xbox release it would have most likely been overshadowed by Halo 3), so PS3 owners owe it to themselves to buy this. However, by itself, it's not worth buying a PS3 for.We purchased Killzone with our own personal funds.Rating: 8/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2009"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E6NE","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Good game, but ruined by poor controls, sub par mechanics, and an idiotic save system.","reviewText":"I have loved both the previous titles in the BioShock series and really found the underwater city of Rapture to be both a captivating and nerve wracking experience.  When BioShock Infinite was announced I was admittedly worried if 2K would be able to capture the creepiness in Columbia as they were able to in Rapture.  In short, the creepiness is still there; just not as much as it was in Rapture.  Overall it is a good game, just there are some glaring problems that makes this title not as good as the previous two.Before I talk about the negatives, I am going to talk about the positives.First of all, the city of Columbia is beautifully rendered and does a very good job in making you feel as if you are really in the clouds.  Buildings in the distance can be seen literally floating in mid air, even bobbing up and down as you get closer.  The atmosphere of the early 20th century is captured very well.  From the cobblestone streets, to kids entertaining themselves playing Rock, Paper, Scissors, and the simple shops in the market area of Columbia, to the early 20th century dialects all did a very good job in making me feel like I was actually in the 1910's.  This is one thing I think Columbia did better than Rapture.  In Rapture I wasn't sure of the time period (until I saw the Happy new Year signs), but in Columbia there was no doubt in my mind that it was set in the early 1900'sVoice acting was superb,  Booker DeWitt (your character) actually speaks throughout the game instead of walking around silent the entire game.  His interactions with other characters in the game are excellent especially with Elizabeth.  Dialogue in this game is always believable and doesn't feel forced or out of place as I have experienced in other games.Speaking of Elizabeth, even though she follows you around for most of the game, you don't need to worry about protecting her.  As the game states, she takes care of herself and even is very helpful in finding you salts, ammo and health during the heat of battle.  If you play this game on Hard then you will find her assistance invaluable.  Not during battle, she also finds money, points out lock picks, and even picks locks for you.Gameplay is pretty much the same as it is in the previous BioShock titles; even though its not in Rapture, it still feels like BioShock  You have your right hand for weapons, and your left hand for Vigors (Columbia's version of Plasmids).  It seems to me BioShock 1 and 2 had more Plasmids to choose from than the eight Vigors you get with Infinite.  In the end, I suppose it works out pretty well, but I would have liked to have a little more choice and not just be limited to eight.  The weapons are pretty straightforward and while I used them all briefly some I didn't bother with much because they were too weak, slow in shooting, reloading and being downright hard to use.  For the most part, I just stuck with the shotgun, sniper rifle, and machine gun occasionally using the the Hand Cannon and Volley Gun.  There are many upgrades you can purchase for your weapons and vigors, but upgrades are very expensive (especially upgrading vigors).  And being that money is so scarce during the game, there is no way you will ever get to try them all out.  Very few of my vigors even had one upgrade because purchasing one would nearly completely wipe me out.The storyline is very well done as it has been in all other BioShock titles, so there is little surprise here.  However things do get very convoluted and confusing towards the end and if you are not paying close attention you will be very lost.Now for the bad.I have BioShock 1 on the XBOX, and BioShock 1, 2, and Infinite on the PS3.  Playing BioShock 1 and 2 on the PS3 I had no problems with the controls and the game was easy to play as well as easy to switch between weapons and plasmids.  However with BioShock Infinite I noticed a big degradation in the controls.  I found myself constantly fumbling between my vigors and there also seemed to be a slight delay when you asked Elizabeth do open a tear, or for you to even pick up a health kit, or other items during the heat of battle.  This delay caused many frustrating deaths during the game that I think could have been avoided if buttons were more responsive.  Also during the the heat of battle when I'm running for cover, I found my character constantly getting stuck on something resulting in even more senseless deaths.  Everything always seemed to be in your way when trying to get to cover.Also something seemed missing in this game.  I seem to remember in the first two BioShock games you had the ability to have an inventory and store away health packs to use when you needed them.  In this game, the only time you can refill your health is when you happen to come across food, or health packs laying around.  This is wasteful.  If I'm at 80% health, and I come across a large health kit, I would rather save this kit for later instead of being forced to use it right away.  But in Bioshock Infinite, you have no choice; its basically \"use it now, or lose it\".Going back to gun battles, I found the combat very frustrating.  Perhaps its because I opted to play this game on Hard difficulty, but during battles you are constantly bombarded by enemies that attack you in all directions but because of the cumbersome controls it isn't easy to adjust to all that is going on.  Most of the weapons are more effective when aiming down the sights, but because things move so fast during battle you rarely are even given the opportunity to aim effectively.  For example you are told to shoot the Handy Men in the heart for more damage, but you can't even get a good shot at his heart before he is right on you.  Vigors help slow him down some, but by the time you get a vigor off on him, you are being shot up by other enemies before you can even shoot his heart.  When you die, you are revived by Elizabeth, but many times as soon as you are revived, you are dead again in 5 seconds because as soon as you re-spawn you are being shot up again.Most of my combat issues may be attributed to completing this game on Hard difficulty but what I really HATE about this game is there are no manual saves.  All game saves are determined by the game and are saved automatically when you pass an invisible checkpoint.  Its amazing that games still use this idiotic save method when no option to save when the player wants to.  This save system does nothing but frustrate players and causes them to want to rush just to get the next save point so they won't lose all their progress.  This also causes players to have to repeat sections they have already done adding more to the frustration.  Many people don't have time to play games many hours at a time so an option to save when they want to is very important.  I don't know whose bright idea was it to remove manual saves from this game, but its idiotic and I have no idea why game developers think players love doing things over and over and over again.  In addition the dumb save system makes it impossible to go back to other chapters without overwriting your current save point. I remember in the other two BioShocks, i would frequently go back to other chapters to do some more exploring or to go back to pick up things I missed the first time through, In BioShock infinite, this is no longer an option.  As bad as I found the controls in this game, My main gripe with this game is the save system and there is ZERO excuse for this system making it into the final release.Overall BioShock Infinite is a good game, but I don't think its as good as the first two.  It is however, a good addition to the series, and wasn't a complete disappointment as Uncharted 3 was to me in relation to the first two in that series.  The length is pretty good and its not over in 6 hours like so many games these days which is great.  However due to all the issues with controls and mostly the dumb auto-save system, I'm glad I waited for this game to go on sale before purchasing it. I played the first two entries in the BioShock series through multiple times to get the different endings and because I enjoyed the games so much, with BioShock Infinite I am still up in the air if I will play through it again.  Not only do I not want to deal with the save system again, I have heard that there is only one ending anyway so I'm wondering if it is even worth my time to play it again, or should I just move on to the next game.  Judging from the final product, this game was slightly over hyped and just further solidified my reasoning for refusing to buy games when they first come out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J5JW","description":"","reviewerName":"humanbeldot","summary":"A fantastic value for Tomb Raider fans","reviewText":"Quick note: this trilogy seems to have been made primarily for one of three groups of people - those who have/had a PS2 but not \"Legend\" or \"Anniversary\", those who have a PS2 and a PS3 but no longer  have \"Legend\" or \"Anniversary\", or those who have a PS3 and were wary of playing \"Underworld\" due to the lackluster reception and sales. Well, rest assured, your worries are unfounded: this is quite possibly one of the best collections I have ever seen.Crystal Dynamics' impression of the Tomb Raider series is an impressive one, to say the least. While all three of these games can be completed in less than ten hours each, they are never anything short of enjoyable or fun. \"Legend\" begins the trilogy by providing a creative, compelling backstory and heavily story-driven gameplay.\"Legend\" takes Lara all around the world, from an ancient underground castle to the chilly mountains of Nepal, boasting breathtaking scenery, fantastic music, and an intuitive control scheme that rivals many of the other games I have played. The story is surprisingly personal and rarely boring, as Lara begins by looking for \"an ornate stone dais\" in Tiwanaku, Bolivia, that eventually expands to include Arthurian legend and an old Soviet project called \"Carbonek\". The ending both provides a sense of closure and a sequel hook, proving a short but wholly engrossing experience that only Lara can provide.\"Anniversary\" is an expanded reimagining of the original \"Tomb Raider\", revamped to fit with both \"Legend\" and \"Underworld\" while providing tighter controls and a wider moveset for Lara, set in - as a series staple - beautiful crumbling ruins and lush, hidden jungles. Lara now has the ability to use her grapple for wall-running. Some levels from the original game have been compressed into one another, some streamlined, and still others made bigger to account for Lara's new abilities. The story takes Lara from Peru to the lost continent of Atlantis as she searches for the fabled Atlantean Scion, a device her father had been searching for, and one he had hoped would discover where Lara's mother disappeared to. Lara continues his quest, leading into the last and, in my personal opinion, best entry in the trilogy.After hearing so many complaints about \"Underworld\", I was reluctant to pick it up, but this collection forced me to, and I am very pleased with it. Although graphics don't necessarily \"make\" a game, they help with the sense of immersion, and \"Underworld\" does exactly that: immerses you in a huge, unbelievable, gorgeous world with a story so tight and twisting that to mention much about it would give away plenty of spoilers. Varied enemy types, massive underwater complexes, and intricate puzzles will keep you fascinated for hours. Lara looks, moves, and acts like a real, living woman, and her expanded range of moves not only makes her believable, but also gives some unique answers to puzzles and gameplay. All in all, the game gives an awesome wrap-up to the series while providing a bittersweet sense of closure - both as Eidos Interactive hands off Tomb Raider to another developer, and for Lara and going on twenty years of pure awesome.Technical details:- The trilogy includes some media for PlayStation Home, a PlayStation theme pack that changes the wallpaper and icons to a Tomb Raider style, and making-of videos and trailers all accessible from the trilogy's main menu. Each game also launches individually while all being loaded on one disc - my guess is that the disc is dual-layer and Square Enix packed all fifty gigabytes full of content. It shows.- \"Legend\" and \"Anniversary\" are indeed the Xbox 360 versions of the games transferred to the PlayStation 3. After having heard this mentioned once, I double-checked using bug notes and screenshots and discovered that this is true... meaning that these two games come with all the bugs and glitches the 360 version has. This includes a potentially game-busting bug in \"Legend's\" England level that requires you to load an earlier save if you happen to come across it. Replaying this level after completing the game, though, does not re-trigger this bug.- \"Underworld\" has its share of bugs, though I encountered none of them due to having a walkthrough listing the game's bugs handy. If you find one of these and follow it carefully, you won't have any problems at all, especially some of the game-breaking ones in Mexico and Croft Manor. In spite of complaints to the contrary, I rarely had issues with the camera and mostly fought with the controls. If, however, one keeps the pace down and is patient with Lara rather than rushing through the game, you shouldn't have many issues with the controls at all.- The Xbox 360 exclusive downloadable games, \"Beneath the Ashes\" and \"Lara's Shadow\", are not included.- All three games run at a maximum of 720p. Upscaling to 1080p will cause some anti-aliasing issues, while upscaling to 1080i will cause blurring, at least on \"Underworld\". All three look perfectly fine in standard definition and nothing is lost if that's your only option.- Load times for \"Legend\" and \"Anniversary\", but particularly the former, are surprisingly long. Considering the capabilities of Blu-ray, I was very surprised with the waiting, especially after accidentally killing Lara. \"Underworld\" has long load times when first beginning a level or loading a manual save, but considering each area is essentially one massive level with cutscenes splitting it into manageable bits, this is understandable. Load times after sending Lara to her death are refreshingly brief.- Both \"Underworld\" and \"Anniversary\" have a manual save limit, which is unfortunate.Overall, the collection is a great buy for any fan of Tomb Raider - from those who began with Lara's very first adventure to those who never got the chance to play it way back when, for those looking for the thrilling conclusion to Lara's tale, for those looking for a graphical paradise and a great sense of immersion, and those who never got to play the first two when they were released on the PlayStation 2, Lara never fails to disappoint in her many globetrekking adventures. A great swan song to the old series, and a great example of a three-part story done very, very well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Ware","summary":"Nice upgrade to 360","reviewText":"I always planned to buy both the Xbox one and PS4.  I currently have PS 3 and Xbox 360 so replacing both is part of the plan.  I decided to start off with PS4 due to the price.  I figured I would try out the PS 4 and check out the Xbox one sometime next year.  So I pre-ordered a PS 4 from Amazon and it arrived with great excitement on my part.  I unboxed the unit, hooked it up, and then nothing.  My new PS 4 was dead on arrival, blue flashing status light.  Tried everything recommended but eventually gave up, packed it in the box, and shipped it back to Amazon.  I didn't want to deal with waiting around for Sony to send replacement and with what seems like a number of units failing that were purchased from Amazon I wanted to give it some time for Sony to work out their issues.I was just going to still wait on Xbox one but decided to check out a local Microsoft store to see if they had any available on launch day.  I was surprised they did have some available outside of the pre-order process.  So my geek excitement got the best of me and I picked up the Xbox One.  I had to return some PS 4 games and extra controller to GameStop and buy controller and games for Xbox.  I wasn't sure what to expect of the Xbox.  I like my 360 but not a fan of Win 8 tables, PC's, and phones.  So I was worried Xbox was going to be an attempt by MS to push that platform.  I was also a bit worried as my first Xbox 360 got the red ring of death and forced me to buy a replacement. I have never felt that MS is great at building devices.Once home I unboxed the Xbox and was impressed by the packaging quality and the look and feel of the Xbox itself.  I decided to hook it up to my satellite box to see how the TV functions work.  Everything powered up just fine and the setup was straight forward. The Xbox seems more mature than the Xbox 360.  The quality of the unit seems better from a look and feel and the quality to me seems a step up.The user interface is similar to Xbox 360 so I was used to how it worked.  I must say the interface works and I like how it flows.  There are a few areas where it doesn't flow very well, mostly under the settings area, but the main home area works pretty well.  The TV integration works pretty well also.  Only thing I don't like is that the Xbox can't be a pass through for HDMI for when I want to watch TV and not have the Xbox turned on.  Easy enough for me to have both on but for other family members who don't think the integration is cool, it is another step to turn on the xbox even if it is by voice.  The voice integration works well even though a few times it didn't.  For the most part I can tell Xbox to change channel, or turn up the volume and it does.  The TV integration is a nice feature but not critical for me.  I will say, Xbox so far does it better than others I have tried like the Wii U TV integration.  I think Microsoft did a nice job on the TV integration and it will be interesting to see how it developed over time.My first two games are Lego Marvel and Call of Duty Ghosts.  Playing with the new controllers works well and the games look good.  I can't say I notice a big difference in picture quality for the games but I guess these games might not be taking full advantage of the new hardware.  I will buy Forza next as it looks stunning.  One thing I noticed on Call of Duty is the install time for loading the game onto the local hard drive.  It took much longer than I expected. Not sure if some performance tuning is needed on the Xbox side or on the COD side.  I'm sure it will improve as updates happen with Xbox and various games.One area, not Xbox related, that Microsoft needs to do a better job on is with issues around Xbox Live.  I renewed my Live Gold account with a card I bought.  My son got a little aggressive with scratching off the code and I had trouble reading a couple letters/numbers.  I went back to the store to see if they could void and reissue a new one but they said I had to talk to Microsoft.  I used the on-line chat and the representative was worthless. I told him I couldn't read all of the code but had my receipt, reference number, and card number and was looking for a replacement code.  After the representative spent time seeing what he could do he wrote me back and said \"If there is something I can do here I will do it for you\".  I wrote back, \"ok\".  Five minutes went by and the rep. wrote again and said, \"is there anything else I can do for you?\".  I said, \"yes, I spent sixty dollars for this and I can't use the card\".  The rep replied, \"that is a lot of money, sorry.\".  I wrote back, \"this can't be the first time this has happened so MS must have some policy in place for damaged cards\".  The rep stated, \"sorry, nothing I can do.\".  What kind of customer service is that? Really, a card is damaged by accident and that is it, you are out sixty dollars.  Come on MS, figure out a policy that works and do something for your customers.  After using my cell phone camera to zoom into the code I was able to try different combinations and make the code work but MS should have a better way for this situation.Overall, I like the Xbox 1.  It is a noticeable upgrade to the 360 in system quality.  The reduction in noise produced from the unit is alone worth the upgrade.  I always wondered why MS wanted to make the 360 the TV centerpiece when it often sounded like a jet taking off.  Nice job to the hardware group for making this product very quiet.  The question is, does the Xbox justify the extra $100 over the PS4?  For me right now, yes, at least it worked out of the box.  It is expensive and that will hurt sales beyond launch type buyers but I do think MS did a nice job on this device and I look forward to using it and see how MS enhances it over time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2013"}

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising.

Nicholson","summary":"Farcry 2...A FPS that gets better as you progress","reviewText":"I downloaded this new FPS from Steam; it took about 4  hours on DSL but it went smoothly and without a hitch.A couple of items before I discuss the game1.Steam mentions upfront on its Farcry2 page that this game comes with \"SecuROM \" and 5 machine activation limit.2.Some confusion regarding the KeyCode: (from the 'Steam' download)Once installation began I got a pop-up screen on my monitor with a KeyCode telling me to copy it and paste it in, when ask for by the game. However, when I got to the point during the install where a dialogue box appeared, asking me to put in the keycode, I noticed that there was another much longer keycode immediately beneath the dialogue box...Which keycode to use? in the end you need to use the first KeyCode that appeared in the pop-up box (the shorter of the two keycodes).The Game:There is a long cut scene to open the game; you drive by taxi to the town from the airport. During this long trip you get a look at the scenery and the conditions that you'll be dealing with during the game.The first section of the game is basically an extensive tutorial on how to use items and how to obtain and accomplish missions.There are two types of missions:1.)Mission from other people; completing these, result in payment of diamonds, earning respect and trust, and making valuable friends and allies. Diamonds are the money of this world and with them you can visit the arms dealer and purchase better weapons, upgrades, repairs kit and  healing kits. All of which you will eventually need in your ongoing ultimate quest, which is to kill the 'Jackal'.2.)Mission from arms dealers; completing these, results in no monetary gain but instead makes available more and better weapons, upgrades, repair kits etc. at the arms store.Missions take some thought and planning, you cannot just go in with guns blazing; stealth and reconnaissance is needed to successfully complete most missions. Also, since you can carry only three weapons at a time, it is important to consider which combination to use for any given mission, as some weapons are more useful on some missions than others.Graphics are beautifully done. The audio is also excellent; the music has a definitively African touch to it.Two concerns:1.) the map and GPS. You can use the map/GPS while you walk or drive but unfortunately you must use both at the same time and as a result they fill most of the screen and impede visibility. If they'd made it so you could use one or the other (instead of both) it would have made movement much easier. I found when the map was off, it was very easy to get disorientated and lost.  So I was constantly turning the map off and on to navigate.2.)the geographic area involved is huge. I seem to spend huge amounts of time driving from point 'A' to a remote point 'B' and then back again to claim my 'reward'. And often the next mission is as far away as possible from where my last mission ended. There is a 'bus' system you can travel to eliminate some of the travel, but even with this you spend a lot of time on the road.Conclusion:Minor concerns aside, this is an excellent FPS with RPG type upgrades. I liked the game more and more as I got deeper into it.If you liked the first Farcry I think you'll like this; it has the quality of the original, but with the difference in location, this game has a different feel to it.The graphics are stunning and the audio is beautifully done, reflecting an African motif.Sys specs: P5K motherboard, nvidia 8800GTS video card and 3 GB RAMAddendum Nov 3/08Having finished this game I can say that it was fun; a FPS with weapons upgrades. The most serious reservation I have was the recurrent travel required over the huge geographic area involved. Travelling from point 'A' to remote point 'B' to do a mission and then back to point 'A' to collect your reward was VERY time consuming. Also a lot of new missions involved covering the same roads and terrain you had already covered many times before with previous missions. The amount of time spent travelling was a MAJOR detraction from this otherwise interesting and fun game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2008"}

I have been an avid fan of the series since the inception and now on the 3rd game I am totally immersed in the AC world! Nothing could go wrong in this 3rd installment. My anticipation for this game shoots up the roof when it was announced. But then I was asking myself how could ubisoft create another one in the series in such a short period of time? 1 year to be exact between the release of AC2 and AC: B. So I thought to myself that perhaps they have a separate team working on this title while the other team worked on AC2. How thoughtful indeed to keep the masses to continue have an undying interest in AC.So what is the difference between B and AC2 you might ask? The story continues where AC2 left off. The minute the game commenced, you are in the exact same spot where AC2 ends and then the story developed incredibly and expanded in all directions. I have loved AC2 and then B gave me a whole new world and possibilities to toyed around and dived into the life of the protagonist and his journey. I really thought at the time AC2 came out it was an awesome game considering that ubisoft have added so much to AC2 and created a new hero Ezio. I thought to myself what could ubisoft possibly top themselves with this new one? I was amazed and disbelief with all the new addition to the gameplay, story, character development, side quest, the awesome soundtrack and the entire package as a whole. This is something to be thrilled and enthused about.The minute the game starts, you are put in situation where new development take place. The action and the adventure placing you in a world of imagination, bewilderment and awe in the AC universe. I felt myself pulled in to engage in an ancient battle between the good and evil in a world unlike anything I have seen before. I really love playing as Ezio since his introduction in AC2. Now I can continue to play as him and find out more about his journey and adventure. His family, mother, sister, uncle Mario and the rest of his alliances are such an exhilarating experience to discover and and to be part of. And the new addition to the gameplay especially being able to be on the offensive side if you choose to is a great new feature found in B. Ezio is now able to do so much more compared to AC2.The side quests are just enormously exciting and invigorating to take on. And Rome is such a magnificent and vast world to wonder and to explore. The people, the structure, the environment, the location, the time period and the overall representation of Rome is incredibly inviting. I find myself immersed in Rome, wondering about and completing side quests, collecting treasures, flags, feathers, assassinating borgia captains to liberate its town, people from their tyranny. Building the town up from scratch in its different province after liberation is also very additive as the more I build the more money I have in the bank allowing me to upgrade my weapons and armor and to help progress the story and experience the AC world like never before.Another point I want to add is the Romulus quests of treasures in the underworld of Rome. The diversity and the platforming is just unbelievable! The discovery and the exploration is vastly expanded. Compared to AC2, B toppled it easily and in every way. Love the climbing, jumping, shimmering and swinging from one location to the next to discover a world beyond words. It is at times so spooky and intriguing and the other so inspiring to uncover whatever is hidden. There are 6 Romulus treasures to be explored and each is vastly different from the other, giving you a diversified experience and amazement that ubisoft has thought this out incredibly well and the execution of these 6 treasures design is commendable.The thought of building your own clan or brotherhood is greatly added to the mix. I found myself wanting to recruit more assassins to my cause, send them to missions all over europe to better themselves and to allow them to gain experiences as an assassin so that their ranks and levels would increased overtime and enabling them to be a valuable comrade when I need them or when circumstances calls for their aid. This is indeed a new awesome addition to the game and the world of AC at my disposal. I could have never been able to progress without the assistance of my fellow assassins. So it is truly a wonderful experience to have backups and to know that I have other assassins at my side supporting the creed and purpose of our existenceLastly the soundtrack just compliments the game in every way. The universe of AC is greatly enhanced with the emotions and feelings for Ezio and his quests. I find myself experiencing B like never before. The composition, the choir, the orchestration, the soothing female voices and the dark male voices, the suspense and the thrill it creates when in conflict or when engaged in missions, battles or your quests to right the wrong really brought the game to a whole new level. The experience is indeed extremely elevating. As I am writing my reviews, I am on my third play through. I find myself craving for more and wanting to experience Ezio's liberation for Rome and to build my brotherhood and to see the creed of the assassins take center stage.

Players begin their adventure as an angel-like guardian. In order to achieve a heavenly design players are sent to the world of mortals to retrieve the magical fruits of a sacred tree. These fruit have the power to grant wishes, but are also perilous, containing the unexpected power to transform those who eat of them into monsters.

I liked the idea of remote play. It never ended up working very well on the PS3 though, so I'm glad I waiting till now. After getting it, I cant believe this thing is super popular. There are a bunch of really run games, and remote play with the PS4 is SOOOO good. It works really well. This device is a great piece of hardware.This bundle is also a pretty good deal as well. I picked it up for $175 around Thanksgiving of 2013. The 4GB card will have to be upgraded if you plan on any other digital games howeverThis brings my to my only Con for the system. Sony made a memory card, and has greatly marked up the price for it. I wouldn't doubt if the card is identical to a micro SD, but with a different plastic mold. I picked up a 32GB card, which should fit a good number of games...its just a bit of a bummer that you spend a good amount for a system, then have to pay upwards of $75 to have a decent amount of storage.OVERALL:Besides the price for memory, I am in LOVE with this thing. For the price I paid, I will have a ton of entertainment time. I can remote play my PS4 (I have tested it from over 450 miles away...still worked well). And PS+ offers free games for the Vita every month, so I have plenty of games to play without to much added cost of buying new gamesGame Suggestions:- Tear Away (AMAZING!)- Little Big Planet (Entertaining Light-Hearted Game)- Flower (Beautiful game for $6...and can be played on PS3, PS4, or Vita once bought)- Walking Dead (Great Story)- Gravity (interesting game mechanics)- Soul Sacrifice (Good RPG for a more hard-core gamer)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2014"}
{"product_name":"B002BRZ9AG","description":"No More Heroes 2 Wii","reviewerName":"Carlos A. Ramos \"Voltaire Tempentry\"","summary":"A Disappointing Sequel, but a Fine Standalone Game","reviewText":"No More Heroes 2 Desperate Struggle is an odd game, just like its prequel. Its a game with violent, sexual humor that parodies the video game culture that has arisen in recent years. While it has many things in common with its successful prequel, No More Heroes 2 ultimately falls short of the original, and for 3 large reasons.NMH2 is a much slower game. Not in story progression, and not in frame-rate, but in overall fighting controls. For the most part, Travis swings his beam sword like an old lady. His swinging animations takes much longer to come to a close, and his dodging animations take another while to respond. Also slowed down is the finishers; instead of a motion followed by slash instantaneously on screen, the finishers have an awkward second or two that detaches the player from the satisfaction of a \"slash\". This combination of elements completely ruins the fast paced feel of slashing perfection that made the original so fun to play.Another issue (touched upon by other reviews) is the disastrous camera. While not broken by any standard, it is definitely a pain that could have easily been avoided. The original game had a better automatic camera that, combined with manual control, erased any qualms anyone would have with the camera. Not only is the camera control removed from NMH2, but the automatic camera itself is actually worse. The game uses a \"stylish\" low set camera for many occasions, including when \"locked on\", that is designed to \"swivel\" and turn easily as one circles an enemy. This low set \"swivel\" camera is very difficult to handle since the game constantly uses narrow hallways and pillars that threw off the auto cam.The original game was praised for having fun and creative boss battles, and all though NMH2 has MORE bosses, it doesn't mean they are better. In fact, ill say only about half of the bosses are \"fun\" or \"creative\", and much less are BOTH \"fun  and creative\". Mosts boss characters lack a soul and personality, and some are flawed technically and frustrating to fight.NMH2 is still a good game, but it not great. The terrible camera, lame bosses, and slower game mechanics make the game a few notches below the original. NMH2 does do some things right, such as improved graphics and a more streamlined experience, but the core gameplay that made the original so great has been changed for the worst.Bear in mind, however, that those new to the series will find MUCH enjoyment from a very solid game. I whole heartedly recommend NMH2 to anyone looking for a funny AND fun game, but veterans returning to Santa Destroy may be disappointed. My review represents the thoughts of a fan of the original, though my score is indicative of the game as it is, and not as a sequel.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2010"}

I've played just about every hot FPS that has come out in the past year or so (and reviewed MANY of them on amazon, but this one needs its own category.The graphics are truly awesome. The sound is up there with Ghost Recon (although not QUITE as intense), and the game play is great. Anyone who says the enemy AI is no good is obviously playing this game on amatuer level or something. At some points its actually to GOOD. You get 5 quick saves per section, which is usually plenty if you use them wisely. The story isn't the GREATEST, but hey it works just fine. The weapons are cool, but the real difference in this game to others is the graphic violence.There is a parental violence lock in the options menu, and you'll soon find out why. With full violence enabled, you'll probably be shocked at what is shown after you blast your enemy 20 times with an AK 47. I wont go into details, but this is DEFINETLY an ADULT game if violence is fully enabled. Trust me. If your into that kind of realism, then it just adds to how great this game is. Personally I think its amazing just how real it all is.Overall I think this is one of the better games that has come out in the past year for the PC. Its a fun, fast paced, eye candy loaded game.

{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"MMORPG without all the fat","reviewText":"First off...I am amazed at this game....I was close to swearing off MMORPGs because when you figure that you pay upwards to 50 bucks per game (and stuck with it if you don't like it) and then pay a monthly fee (that is like another bill if u already are paying them) You almost have to play them a lot and I don't have that kind of time. I also didn't like the camping, loot stealing etc found on a lot of those games...worse yet ...level grinding....grrrr.That is where Guild wars is different.For the one person that complained earlier about this game...info about what this game was about has been around since October...those who knew that, knew what this game was about....That is what I like about Guild wars...when you go on a mish, you have the whole map to explore w/o worrying about others ruining the fun and taking key items, not to mention you have plenty to do because SOMEONE will always have a mish in store for you. Also you mish actions really do shape yorur playing world.Also, if you like soloing and dislike waiting forever for parties to form, you can do it with very competent NPCsBest of all, most quests are relatively short taking anywhere from 5 mins to 30 mins to complete and are done at your level meaning you won't go on a mish and be expected to take on a horde of monsters 3x your level.Check this out, I have a level 8 Warrior/necro char. that I had since day one. I decided to make a new character because I know I missed a whole bunch of early mishes on the game so I created a Ranger/monk....I would say in about 5 hrs yesterday, I managed to give him a decent amount of skills and built up to level 6. Most other MMORPGs I probably would have spent that same amount of time getting to level 3.And as said many times before, It's all about your skills that you get and not about leveling. Keep that in mind. And attaining new skills is something you can do as soon as you get on the game. No having to slave away just get to level 10 or 15 before u get a secondary profession.Another great thing is that you will be fighting a variety of enemies from the start...no fighting wild rats and rabbits for 5 or 6 levels.This game is fun, intense whether you fight alone with NPCs at ur side or with friends.The graphics are great even on low settings. And the storyline is tight to keep you drawn in...My only complaint however is with the party system.The plus is, no matter where your friends are you all can meet up on any server and play (no having to all have to join and stay on one server just to play) but if the party decides to break up and head for the main city, everyone gets dispersed between servers before they can form up.But that is my only complaint in an otherwise great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2005"}

She is captured during her investigation and sent to a prison on a desolate island.InResident Evil: Code Veronica X, players control Claire at the beginning of the game, and later assume the role of Chris Redfield in their efforts to halt Umbrella's devious plans.

Jongeling \"slice of heaven\"","summary":"A classic of its time","reviewText":"In 1999, lots of gamers were complaining about the Resident Evil franchise becoming stale - and with good reason. The treasure box and tank-like movements of the characters remained fairly consistant through the first generation of RE games. Although I never tired of the series (I was 12 - and today would gladly take them over the sorry excuse for the new generation of RE games) Code Veronica X seems to keep that same formula but adds a fresh breath of air to the gaming experience.Code Veronica X starts out with Claire in a prison cell, when suddenly the guard is killed and the cell is opened. You must use your lighter to find weapons and clues, and finally burst out onto the lawn where a cemetery of undead begin to drool all over you. You realize that the nightmare has never ended - it has just relocated. The graphics and gameplay look very much like a late 90s Windows PC Game, but thankfully on the PS2 version some of that goes away (Gamecube version retains the PC-like graphics). The game is exciting but requires attention to detail. As a young gamer I was really turned off by this game, it was too hard and nothing made sense. There are some crucial puzzles in the first half hour of the game that will leave the faint-hearted shutting off their consoles and tiring of the game (Hint - you must duplicate the metal object into a polycarbonate and deposit the real metal object into the bin to keep the alarms from going off). I would actually say there's less action and more strategy to this game - although it sure picks up the pace later on. The great thing about this game is that you don't stay on the island you're on. Once the island is desolated with zombie corpses and only fires and whispers remain, you actually travel to another continent to do more research. And once you're there, THAT is when the game gets extremely exciting and you can't put your controller down.You have a partner who helps you a little throughout the game. Steve is a very embarassing character, saying corny lines and thinking he's a hot shot. Claire won't have any of it. That kid with a gun is dangerous. Later on you hear his back story and he becomes less annoying and a tad entertaining. Don't get too attached, though - you may find yourself in trouble.When the game ends, you breathe a sigh of relief. You feel as if the game has resolved itself and it's not underwhelming like some games. Code Veronica X keeps in traditional Resident Evil form by having an epic ending and replay value. This is probably the last TRUE resident evil game in the series. It's both great and depressing at the same time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2013"}

The hot crater level is awesome with huge in-row loops, loads of rail, and alternate freestyle paths. The music plant level is beautiful and fantastic, you can bounce of piano keys like tiles on a pinball table and music notes in zig zag fashion like those multiple mound bumpers on a pinball table, you can choose multiple routes thru the wind pipe like shooting thru different ramps, there are other cool mechanisms and spinner features that allows you to lauch at angle of your choosing.

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

The environments look great and so does the character models. The game is long but can be longer if you get lost. However, this game has a few flaws. One (and it's a big one) is that you have to always carry the flashlight around. because most FPS only have the character have one weapon on one hand at a time and have the other hand to be non-existent, you constently have to switch between the flashlight and a weapon. So when it's dark and you have to fight, you have to either hold a flashlight and keep whacking your opponent until it's dead or stay in the dark and shoot your enemy which you can have a hard time finding it. the second con is that (unlike Half Life 2) you can't really interact with much. you can't grab certain objects and drop them or throw them. And a final con, which comes to one word: Imps. these are the most annoying enemy in the game. you constently fight them and it can get annoying sometimes. otherwise, a game to get.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2006"}

It just seemed too difficult and intimidating.  After playing through Dark Souls over 80+ hours, I decided to pick up Demon's Souls again on the assumption that I would enjoy it more this time around, having some idea of how the game mechanics worked.  And I certainly did.  After finishing Dark Souls, if you are still on-the-fence about picking up Demon's Souls, you definitely should.  It does not feel as refined as Dark Souls, but has all the elements that make its successor such an excellent game.Really, Demon's Souls (Demons) feels like a less-matured version of Dark Souls (Dark).  The combat feels very similar compared to DS; if you enjoyed the combat in the later, you will not be disappointed by Demons.  Many of the \"worlds\" in Demons are analogous to those in Dark (unfortunately, the awful camera and precarious footing from Blighttown are present in an analogous world in Demons, ugh).  Enemies are challenging and aggressive, but maybe slightly less \"intelligent\" than in Dark.  They are also not really placed around the level, as they are in Dark, so that you are often tactically overwhelmed (e.g. fighting ranged and melee simultaneously).  But still, the overall level design in Demons is top-notch and much better than the action-RPG standard.  Online stuff was very similar I thought, but I didn't use it as much, with the exception of the hints which were extremely useful and prevented many, many possible deaths.I didn't die as often in Demon's souls but I did finding myself grinding a lot more, just to get potions and herbs and such.  For me, the game was much easier than Dark Souls.  I don't think this is anything inherent in the game itself really, but reflects my familiarity with the game mechanics---gained from Dark Souls---and possibly because I played a magic user in Demons (rather than a melee in Dark), which made some of the boss fights very easy.Overall, pick this one up.  Especially at this price and even if the servers go down.  You'll still have a blast and if you've crushed Dark Souls, the lack online won't be much of a handicap to finishing the game.  Honestly, it's worth playing through just so you can back-stab Patches---deceitful as ever---earlier in the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2012"}

I had read horror stories about heat and DOA units. I'm proud and happy to say I had niether problem with my Shiney new 360S. From the fine styling, to the 3 extra USB ports and the much needed dedicated Optical out (that's right not funny dongle thingy). This console screams quality. I like the fact that it also has a dedicated Kinect port which means you won't need and extra outlet for Kinect when it comes out, like any older 360.I tested the 360S all day and most of the evening so I could report with some degree of certainity that it runs as quiet, and smoothly as it does. The reported heat problems/??? I don't know, I think its overblown. It might also be people who don't even have it yet or will never have it. there are  a lot of very silly people reporting some untrue things. That's all I will say. Yes it gets warm, but no warmer than any other piece of eletronics used for hours at a time. WARM not HOT big difference. Now I have to say this, I'm not placing it inside any type of cabinet or enclosed space, so maybe that makes a difference, but I think any item you would use in that way would get hotter. Now on to to how amazingly quiet it is, I had to put my ear right next to it to hear anything, even then. I so love that compared to my old refurb launch twice replaced unit. My Wii now makes more noise than either my PS3 Slim or my 360S.The controller is pretty much the same, but somehow I felt it was slightly more accurate, it might be my imagination. There are few things I don't like, I'm using a USB stick for my gamer tag so I can use it between my two 360's the problem with the back USB ports is they are recessed so a slide out type USB stick won't fit the recess. A minor quibble as you can use the two front ports no problem. The other thing I don't like, the DVD tray beeps when you open and close it. No big deal I just don't like it.Overall though this is a class a system and it is what it should have been from the beggining. I have not tried Wifi wireless N yet, I find wired connection is better in every case. But I will try and add to this review later on when I do try it. I can say as a gamer for many years, over 30.

The Wii fit does not really replace the \"real\" thing, but it definitely provides a workout that will leave you panting and wide eyed at the realization that a \"video game\" could put you in that state.I doubt I will use this every day, but what it will provide me is a great way to break up my already existing (and sometimes monotonous) exercise routine.  Wii fit has a wide range of exercises to chose from that will let you switch things around and keep things interesting, and exercise parts of your body that might not normally get any attention.  It's also great for those vacation days or Sunday mornings when you want to get a good workout in but just don't feel like getting out of your PJ's.  Or for when you just need a quick pick me up before starting the day.Obviously you could do all of this stuff on your own without the TV.  Wii fit does provide a minimal amount of training help though (and although it can get a bit annoying) the training helps to keep your speed and balance where it needs to be to get the most out of the exercise.  I've found that to be really helpful, I didn't realize that my balance and posture were off when I was doing some of this stuff and trying to keep these things under control has proven to be part of the workout for me.The four stars is for the negative reinforcement that Wii fit gives.  Personally it hasn't bothered me too much, but I know how easily it is to get discouraged from working out, especially when you realize you have a long way to go to reach your goals.  There are a lot of insults and other discouraging traits that you get if you don't reach certain levels, all of which are covered in other reviews so I won't get into it here.  We all now though that you need to be encouraged to reach personal levels of fitness, especially when you have a long way to go.  Being told by the Wii fit on the first day that you are obese and a couch potato might not be that encouragement that some people need.In a nut shell, this is a great exercise machine and has the potential to really expand your routine, but can get pretty discouraging with its cute little insults.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Tanya McHenry","summary":"What a Great Release to a Fun, Hopefully Long-lived Game","reviewText":"Before I go into the review, let me give you a little background so you can consider my experience and bias when it comes to this MMO. I loved EQ 1, the game that exposed me to MMOs in the first place and opened my eyes to the possibilities of an online world with others. I have also enjoyed City of Heroes, Lord of the Rings Online and Uncharted Waters Online. When it comes to Bioware, I really enjoyed Dragon Age Origins (NOT DA2), Mass Effect 2 and Jade Empire. Of those three, I enjoyed Dragon Age Origins the most. Finally, when it comes to Star Wars, loved 2 of the 2 original movies, enjoyed the first 1.... Find the last 3 worth a late night nothing else on watch.Now that this is over, let me start by saying this is not an Sandbox game. If you are looking for a hit the road and explore as EQ offered and Uncharted Waters Online also kind of offers (UWO is mostly a strategy title though), this is probably not the game for you. If you enjoyed Mass Effect 2's style, minus the combat which is very different, and would enjoy playing in the Star Wars Universe, might be worth having a look.There are two sides to choose form, the Jedi and Sith, basically good and bad although, as you play the varying class stories, each class, 4 for Jedi and 4 for Sith, have their own stories, you will see that some of the choices and events happening make you stop and wonder, if only for a moment, what is really \"good\" or \"bad\". The good is the classes do play differently although their mirror counterparts are very much the same. I play a Smuggler which is basically a long range DPS. I also played the Imperial Agent on the Sith side in beta which plays very similar to the smuggler. Although there were early claims from Bioware about maybe not relying on the holy trinity, healer, tank and dps, they still do BUT the trinity is not required to complete the game. You can finish your class quest, enjoy a lot of encounters with other people and due to companions or some hybrid classes are fine without the trinity. If you are taking on flashpoints that are higher than you, like my group does, or just hitting areas that are purposefully challenging, the holy trinity is more important but still not 100% required like others. I play a DPS. I do fine on my own, my companion (all classes are pretty much \"pet\" classes\") tanks for me and if I join up with others, and I am still very functional. I also have a very handy mez against droids so versatile on some levels too.The two sides have interesting stories, but the Jedi, at least at this time, seems more flesh out to me. They play differently because of the story, but beyond that... not that different.Character CreationLacking. There is a variety, yes but not really on par with other game releases. I play a cyborg. While I could get a single eye replacement on the Sith side, I couldn't with the Jedi. I know where I wanted my implants but there was nothing I could do to get what I wanted. Hair choices are limited, skin tone is a good choice. In a world of aliens... surprising lack of choices, EA/Bioware defended this choice earlier on... I still don't buy it. It is certainly possible to run into your exact twin... unlikely. There are games out there that such a choice would be one in maybe a million, but these are not this game. I've actually found myself chasing after the wrong group not realizing it. Everyone looks too similar. The clothing choices, the color scheme... even heights are all so drab it's unfortunate. Don't get me wrong. It is a nice looking world but it's just lacking in this department.FlashpointsFlashpoints are my favorite, by far. They are basically instances where a group, usually a full group, spends about an hour trying to complete some sort of mission together with ample reward and sometimes death. They are challenging and fun, and the death penalty isn't so great to try and avoid them. You can repeat the missions, and we do, challenging ourselves to do better each time until we move onto the next one. The only real down side to flashpoints is Jedi or Sith... they are, at least as far as I have gone, the same. Sure the story is different, but the map is repeated, the bosses are even the same and it's not really something you could play on the \"other\" side and feel you are getting a fresh experience.CraftingI am a crafter. I craft in every game and enjoy it. Having said that, crafting in this game is so easy and non-intrusive even those against crafting are enjoying it. You don't need to spend an hour each day crafting or, as some would see it, not I, not playing to get crafting down. Your companions can do it. If you are in a full group not using your companion or have more than one, you can send them on their way making things for you, getting things for you and you can pick up supplies/material as you are playing without delaying your whole group for long.Inventory SystemSucks, it really does. I feel like I have fallen back into some sort of early 2000s game that has no clean way to organize my stuff. It's just a bunch of squares that don't sort nicely. You have to turn on, in preferences, your ability compare your companions gear to the gear you have acquired and only then if they are with you. I haven't found a way to compare my ship upgrades to what is acquired at all and have to manually toggle between that.  The nice step up from the early, early days of MMOs is the mission items are separated into their own tab, thank god, and the currency you can use to exchange for items is also separated out, though slightly buggy. I have one commendation I can't spend or destroy or do anything with. Customer Support has yet to personally respond to me on anything I have inquired about. I don't know that they will ever address any of my minor issues.Spaceship CombatI was pretty against the rail, watered down system that was released with this game. I still find it... lacking on a number of levels. For one, it is a single-player only. When I play these mini missions I just keep wishing others on the massive online game could play with me. The controls are simplistic and the challenge is... there but not in a strategic way so much as itchy trigger finger way. There is some fun to be had. Because they have this minimalistic space combat in the game... I fear there may never be a richer offering.Bugs/ ServersSome servers seemed to have 2 hour waits. Mine had 20-30 minutes tops on peak days. I just come home, clean up, eat, whatever while I que and have plenty of time to play after work or during the weekend. I have not found the queues to be a problem at all.Bugs, yes there are bugs. One of our flashpoints, we couldn't tell if my long range attacks was being read as an exploit or bug which made a particular boss incredibly difficult at times or standard at other. There are bugs in either case. The mail system is shockingly slow. The eyes of characters keep disappearing in my conversations. The leaves are flashing like mad around me.  We had a treasure chest not unlock during the flashpoint. Having said that, this has to be one of the cleanest MMO releases in recent memory. This might even be one of the cleaner just plain game releases for me in a while. The industry is just so used to release buggy, shoddy, barely working products to fix later after they've taken our money that I wondered if they cared at all about what they are putting out on day 1 anymore. There is no reason to wait for this game to be \"cleaned up.\" It's pretty good already, although I suspect Slicing (crafting skill) will be nerfed at some point. I should also mention I thought Rift beta'd pretty cleanly as a reference and Star Trek Online at release was a disaster.Solo vs GroupingAlthough I question why some people would join an MMO to play solo, it's entirely possible. You can play 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 and enjoy all thoroughly. You will want 4 for the flashpoints, but you won't be held back by them. I've played in mixed level groups, had plenty of fun too.  While the xp and loot is garbage, I've played grey quests (no xp) to finish off story lines. The Flashpoints are the reason why these side missions and my class missions turned green or greyed out on me.Overall, this is a nice MMO to play, for veterans and certainly new entries into the genre a like. Is it everything I hoped it would be? No, not necessarily. For all the story emphasis, unlike the single-player RPGs, our choices in the storyline have no real effect. It's an MMO after all, and we're not at the point where player choices are changing the world in any meaningful way. It's hard for me to real get drawn into a story I feel I have no real... \"choice\" in that matters, but not impossible. I am not sure what EA/Bioware is going to offer to justify their monthly pittance, possibly nothing. This might be another pub claiming they need 15 dollars a month to house data and offer servers... I hope that is not the case. I know what servers cost... and it isn't 15 per person.This game has a lot going for it out of the box. That says a lot for any PC game and certainly bodes well for an MMO. I hope they don't drop the ball and figure their job is done and it's time to nickel and dime players to death, read milk to death, and offer no new content and overpriced expansions. It is my hope that Bioware, and EA will let them, will treat this game and their player-base, well. For now, I am willing to ride along and ride with that hope, enjoy the game while doing so, and hope to see the rest of you online.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"More fun than you can possibly imagine","reviewText":"I admit to having some reservations about how well BioWare would do with their first MMO, seeing as how it's a whole different story from developing a single player game. Rest assured, they did as good a job with this as they did with any of their previous, excellent titles. In fact, if nothing else their single player focus has helped rather than hurt this game. The Old Republic plays more like its single-player predecessors (Knights of the Old Republic I and II) than your typical MMO. This is what really sets it apart from others of the genre, and it's a relief to see someone finally doing something new in this space besides trying to copy World of Warcraft.Quests and dialogue choices: Possibly the greatest strength of this game, all quests have two-way spoken dialogue- with GOOD voice acting, and most of them are nonlinear in choices. Typically they have a light and dark option, possibly a neutral one, and in any case your active companion can approve or disapprove of it. Most quests have reward choices, typically either an item or a lockbox/badge. If you don't need the item, you can try for a random of equal quality (lockbox) or just get badges, which can be used to buy blue quality gear. Pretty much any quest of your level is worth doing; there's no rewards that will be totally worthless. This is more than can be said for pretty much any other game out there. All group quests are repeatable once per day for added rewards, which also greatly helps finding a group since it's not a 'one and done' deal like group quests in practically every other MMO. The exp and items are well worth redoing them, and some are quite amusing as well. Quests are outlined very clearly with markers showing the objective, area, or transition point to reach it. Each class has its own galaxy-spanning storyline, and for a wonder it's actually interesting. That's right, folks- they took the time to write a story instead of sending you off on 5000 random Fed-Ex and farming quests!Area design, sound, and graphics: All right, as many have noted, this isn't the most eye-popping game out there. Character customization is average, detail is so-so, and as of now the game doesn't even support antialiasing natively. The bright side to this is it runs smoothly on pretty much anything that can fit the game files on its hard drive. Additionally, while the detail might not be awesome, the area design is. Each planet you visit is totally unique in appearance and layout- no cookie cutter nonsense or canned indoors areas. This makes the game pretty visually impressive despite the fact that it won't set your graphics card on fire. The musical score is, as one might expect, pretty awesome- even where it isn't just movie tracks. Sound and visual effects are all well done, and in some cases quite spectacular.Grouping: The standard group size is 4 players, which is a bit fewer than most other games. This is good in the sense that it's easier to get a group together and also possible to do many group activities with even fewer players, but it also does mean you have to be at least marginally competent. One interesting thing about groups is you can see the quest status markers for anyone in your party, which facilitates helping friends through quests. Practically all quests can be shared (the exceptions being story/class specific ones) and pretty much any of them can be done with a group. Doing group quests also gives you social points, which can be used to buy special items.Companions: These are essentially secondary characters, one of which can be active at any time. They're about as fully developed as any RPG character can expect to be, complete with their own equipment and reputation. You can even start a romance with a few of them. This aside, they fight for you in various roles and perform gathering and crafting if ordered to. This is an ingenious system that takes a lot of the mundane 'find node, click node' harvesting mechanics out of the game (although there still are those, if you miss it THAT much). Companions also make it quite easy to two-man or even solo any of the group quests or dungeons, assuming you kept your buddies reasonably up-to-date gear wise. There's 5 companions for each class plus your friendly ship droid, and they fill varied roles and have different tastes in terms of gifts and what they like to see you do. Improving your standing with companions improves crafting, among other things.Space: Though totally optional, space missions are worth doing if for no other reason than they're easy experience and really quite fun. Space combat is arcade style, pretty similar to what you'd see in Rogue Squadron or Starfox. You can buy ship upgrades that make it easier and/or more fun, but they're not particularly difficult even with few to no upgrades. Either way, it's a good break from running around planetside. In some respects this is like the reverse of Star Trek Online, where it's largely space based and you beam down for away missions. However, space combat is much better implemented and more fun in this game than ground combat ever was in STO. As yet, there's no group space missions or PvP, but I imagine that will change.Technical: As is to be expected, the first few days there were some pretty heavy queues, but they've added enough servers to stave this off for now. It is interesting to note that once you get in, the game has remarkably little lag and never disconnects you. Sure, there's a spike here and there, but many games that have been out for years have that too. For a launch title to be so stable is pretty darn amazing. The servers are down quite frequently in the early morning for maintenance, so if you're one of those folks that play mostly in the AM you might want to roll on a server in a different timezone (at least for now). There's no current means of doing server transfers, though this is something almost surely to be added.Progression: After you reach a certain point in the character quest line, you can create a 'legacy,' which is essentially a surname that allows you to carry over some gear between characters on the same server. This is a rather unique approach to the typical 'bind to account' setup, making it easier to level alts. Keeping your gear up to date is pretty easy; you'd have to try to fall significantly behind, yet it's also not welfare-styled like Rift (which means there actually is an economy before the cap, and a reason for leveling tradeskills). Due to the many options in character progression, varied companions, two specializations for each class (which are essentially different classes, for a total of eight), and the very different starting areas and game-spanning unique quests for each class, the game has true replay value. In most other MMOs, what they call 'replay' is actually rerolling, and aside from possibly a different start area the only new thing is your class and abilities. TOR does a lot more than this, and it makes it truly fun to start over.PvP, Dungeons, Raids, etc: There are warzones (PvP), flashpoints (PvE dungeons), and raids already implemented. I've yet to raid- don't think anyone has as of now, but the flashpoints are quite well designed. Of particular note, if you wipe and re-enter, you start on the same floor you died on- a nice touch that saves a lot of walking. Dungeon quests and bonus objectives are well implemented and easy to figure out. End bosses can be quite challenging, but rewards are commensurate with the difficulty. There are dedicated PvP servers in addition to the usual warzones, dedicated PvP gear and rewards, and quests. It's entirely possible to level just doing PvP. As of now, there's auto-matching for PvP but none for PvE groups and no cross-server grouping. I imagine this is something that's being worked on. Right now most servers are so high pop, however, that it's very easy to find a group for anything short of a raid.General Mechanics: There's no basic features missing in this game; and all elements function well. There's an auction house (the galactic market), mail, chat channels, guilds, and friend lists. One thing I could wish for is that some of these were more polished, such as adding guild perks or achievements. These are things that could certainly be added later, though, and they're not particularly critical for such a new game. Inventory is split into an expandable regular bag, a quest items bag, and a ship cargo hold (which is accessible even before you have a ship). Between the three there's plenty of space, especially if you routinely vendor junk or tell your companions to do it for you. There are as of now no macro or addon options, but this is also something that I'm sure will be added in time.The bottom line is that TOR is an awesome game, especially seeing as how it just came out. It's had the smoothest launch I've ever seen for an MMO, and it can only get better from here on out. Is this finally the WoW killer everyone's been looking for? Possibly. It's my experience that displacing an entrenched userbase with people that have invested huge amounts of time and money in it is a difficult feat indeed. However, I would say that due to the fact that it does many truly unique things, TOR has by far the best chance of any MMO to date.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2011"}

Soda machines, power grids, traffic lights, possibly toasters&#8230;if it has a computer chip and an internet connection, you can apparently hack it.Now this can cause some problems for you. I tried hacking traffic lights and the like while in a high-speed police chase. This did not end well for me, nor for the four or five people I ran over in the process (sorry, guys!). I&#8217;m also unclear why causing a power outage in a baseball stadium causes light figures to explode and power outlets to spark. Apparently this universe&#8217;s version of Chicago managed to develop pretty much all the same technology that we have, except, alas, for the circuit breaker.But speaking of Chicago, the whole city seems to be lovingly rendered for your amusement, and it looks just gorgeous. The whole game does, really. On my PC (which is what I&#8217;ve been using to play), the graphics are just amazing! Textures on cloth, reflections, etc, everything looks wonderful.On the other hand, the sound. I have very good speakers. I have them turned up all the way. I have the volume on my PC turned up all the way. I could barely hear any of the dialogue. I went in and adjusted the sound settings in the game, and there was no real change. So I think we might have a glitch. Hopefully this will be fixed via a patch sometime soon.That minor complaint aside, this really is an impressive game, and I look forward to logging many, many more hours.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2014"}

Yes, I've played through all three console versions of Blacklist, which is a bit nutty, but it allows for a better review. I find the 360 and the Wii U versions to be the superior versions of Blacklist, although in different ways. I like the voice integration of the 360 version and I appreciate that the 360 versions uses the Kinect better than most games (although it still leaves something to be desired). Just the fact the 360 version has these extra bells and whistles and the PS3 is kind of a no frills experience is enough to have me endorse the 360 version. That said, I preferred the gameplay on the Wii U if only because I really enjoyed the GamePad integration there.So gameplay-wise, the 360 version of Blacklist is on par with the Wii U for the version you should go for, but I still wasn't impressed by the game as a whole. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good. I felt it was one of the lesser Splinter Cell titles out there, especially in terms of storytelling.

Warren \"gamer\"","summary":"The classic game that started it all!!!!!!!","reviewText":"Ah, sonic the Hedgehog.  The game that established the Genesis as a figure in gaming, the character that became a pop culture icon (at least in the gaming world, but it went a little further), was able to stand right beside Mario, and lest I forget, gave Nintendo the first taste of competition.  I had a Genesis, but I sold it, but after playing it on the great Sega Genesis collection on my PSP, the old days returned.  This game was a classic in so many ways.This game was fast, and gave out the message that fast games are fun games.  Sonic was a great looking game, with wonderful themed areas, which would beat Mario's plain blocky world.  The game was also great because it eliminated many cheap deaths.  The games during the time were great, but alot of the games (even Mario) had the annoying death thing.  If you hit something, you die.  It gets really really annoying, and it's no help either that you usually have to start over again (the usual way to continue would be to memorize annoying passwords).  Sure, Sonic had many start over deaths, but the fact that there were shields and rings Rings are much easier to get back if you lose them, and since it's quite easy to get them after they fall out of Sonic, made the game a lot less annoying.  And it was easier to kill enemies.  SOnic may not be as revolutionary as Mario (or the fact that new Sonic games get 3,4,5 scores, while Mario still goes strong), but I could see a discussion on which game had a better design. I can't really decide either, so I will just be neutral in this discussion.  However, you have my approval to bring up MY topic in a schoolyard conversation.Aside from the great design, Sonic was just plain fun.  It's faster, more action, easier to kill enemies, and there was a lot of slick puzzles and a great plot.  The stages are filled with many booby traps, from the raging lava river from the Marble Zone, to bumpers that luanch you into enemies, this game is just brimming with exciting obstacles that sometimes make you don't mind that you just died and have to start over again.  I do reccomend learning how to do level skip, so you don't have to start  over.  Of course, you don't keep your score, but getting a record score is already done, so don't shed any tears if you lose your points.  And the music is jammin' to, it's not as good as the music from Sonic Adventure, but it's very good.This is a classic game, and even though it's not as good as the masterpiece sequal, it's amazing how this game has stood the test of time.  Like other classics like Castlevania (the very first one released for NES) and Final Fantasy 5, these games are just classic.  Expect to see them around for quite a while longer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2007"}

It was Sega's attempt to make themselves the popular gaming company after Nintendo released super Mario Bros. 3 in 1990. And I am happy to say they made a great success.The story starts off when we're introduced to Sonic--an anthropomorphic, speedy, blue hedgehog with red shoes and the ability to curl up into a ball and run super fast. The storyline, however, is simple: Sonic must save all the woodland creatures from his arch-nemesis, Dr. Robotnik/Eggman.Almost all the levels in this game take total advantage of Sonic's ability to perform speedy platforming. However, such obstacles such as Robitnik's robots, spikes, and bottomless pits will try to stop you from reaching the end of the level. Thankfully for you and your speedy hedgehog, you'll find powerups such as speed boots--which let you run extremely fast--invincibility--which allows you to kill enemies at the touch, and extra lives. One of the last things you can pick up in this game are rings. If you get hurt while you are holding at least one ring, all your rings will fly out of your reach. However, if you get hurt WITHOUT holding any rings, Sonic will die.There are a total of six zones in this game. From the first to last, they are: Green Hill, Marble Zone, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Starlight, and Scrap Brain. Each zone has three acts--two of which you will simply have to run through in order to beat. At the end of every third act, however, you will find yourself fighting against Dr. Robotnik. After defeating him, you will have to blow up a capsule containing a large amount of animals, seeing them free as a result.If you manage to collect at least fifty rings at the end of either act 1 or 2 of a particular zone, you will have the option to have Sonic jump through a ring at the end of the stage. Upon making your way into the ring, you will enter a \"special stage\", where you receive the opportunity to earn a \"chaos emerald\". The chaos emeralds don't do much in this game, however; they only give you a slightly happier ending when you're done with the game.Now onto gameplay; the controls of Sonic the Hedgehog are absolutely amazing! The physics are entirely momentum-based--meaning that you have the ability to roll down a slope in order to pick up speed. To do this, all you have to do is walk up to a downward slope, press the down button, and watch your hedgehog go. While in this ball form, Sonic will kill almost any robot he touches.Speedy platforming makes this one of the fastest games for the Sega Genesis. The momentum based physics, obstacles, and enemies makes this the perfect game for people who want to challenge their reflexes. This game tests your reflexes by giving you only split-seconds to react to the obstacles you are thrown at while going at top speed. I recommend this to anybody with a Sega Genesis--or at least for people who want to go through an enormous amount of speedy platforming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2012"}

This version will have new weapons, veteran and rookie drivers, weather effects, and night driving.","reviewerName":"Pat O'Donnell","summary":"Best of the series!","reviewText":"My goodness! This has to best of the series edging out TM2 in my opinion. Very fast, handles great and has a *really* fun 4 man multiplayer. There are about 15 characters(including Sweet Tooth!) and about 11 levels for single player and 18 different ones for multiplayer, so theres alot variety. Some levels are compact and some aremassive, like the Suburbia level for example. Dont ask me how they did it, but they made this game run at an almost perfect 60fps at all times. Thats unbelievable considering all the particle explosion effects, including weather effects such as pouring rain and heavy snow in some courses, all the players and landscape this title shows all on screen at once, with no noticeable fog in the background......amazing. Soundtrack is also top notch. Its very dyanamic as well. For example, when there is alot of action on screen, the music will get louder and play more riffs, but for those couple quiet moments, the music will dim down a bit and make things peaceful. It adds so much to the game, espescially if you have a Dolby Surround sound system. The destruction and speed of this game compliments this series really well, taken to the next level with the better technology obviously. The particle effects are CG like and the maneuvers, handling and physics are extremely polished, unlike TM3 and TM4. The A.I is a little difficult but not enough to get frustrated, but definitely challenging. Thankfully there are cheats you can use if its gets too hard. The multiplayer is also a blast. 4 player splitscreen and stil runs at 60 fps most of the time! I mean it, this is the most enjoyable multiplayer game I've played in a while. Lot of unlockables, CG stories for each character. There's really nothing I can gripe about. Superb handling, slick menus, plenty of playable chracters and levels,  2 and 4 player splitscreen, all with a smooth framerate and short load times, literally the best car combat game on the market. Again, welcome back Incognito, you made the TM series great once again. Buy it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2002"}
{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Siklootd","summary":"Fun At First....But Due to Bad Gimmick....Gets Old Fast","reviewText":"The Nintendo Wii has been stated by many to have revolutionized gaming as we know it.  A drastically deep claim to make in such a powerful entertainment medium that revolves around technology.  A claim, that I believed as well.  The idea of playing games with motions is intriguing, enticing, and exciting, something that many use as a decision maker when it comes time to purchase a console.  I was one of the many people who waited in line all night November 18, 2006 for the Nintendo Wii.After taking it home that first morning, I was dying from anticipation of playing the newest console made by Nintendo.  I opened the console, I liked what I saw.  The Wii Menu is unique, and is a great way to navigate the console.  The menu displays the contents of the Wii's internal hard-drive, displaying items such as downloaded games, and new channels that may have been purchased.  Navigating the menu requires the usage of the sensor bar and pointing the Wii Remote at the screen to choose the desired channel.The games feel unique at first, requiring motions to control on screen avatars within the games.  However, as time goes by, the feeling of revolution is replaced with tedium.  After a few hours of gameplay it becomes obvious that button presses of the past have simply been replaced with simple gestures that do not represent the actual on screen action.  For example: in past games in order to attack you may have been required to press \"A\" but the Wii replaces this with a simple \"shake\" of the controller.  It doesn't even matter as to which direction the controller is shaken in either, seeing as the gesture will not match the onscreen motions.  The majority of the games on the Wii really only use five different gestures, simply recycled over and over again.  These gestures include: shake controller left, shake controller right, shake controller up, shake controller down, and thrust controller forward.  These gestures do not actually allow the gamer to feel immersed in the game, since these gestures are no different than button pressing.  The added drawback of these motions is the inaccuracy of the detection of them as well.Where I started to lose faith in the Wii was after picking up some hardcore games for the console.  I began by purchasing Resident Evil 4, Okami, Madworld, No More Heroes, Mortal Kombat Armageddon, Dragonball Z Tenkaichi 2 and 3, Twilight Princess, and more.  I started to realize that with these games, precision is an absolute must.  However, the Wii remote's motion controller actually takes away from the precision due to the poor detection skills of the controller.  This results in lag, delayed moves, incorrect moves, and more.  In several of these games, I found myself repeating missions and levels simply due to the fact that the Wiimote would make my on screen character perform the wrong moves.  For example:  in Twilight Princess, the shield bash is done by pushing the nunchuk forward, however, sometimes this registered as the nunchuk being moved to the side which corresponds with a spin attack.  Similar scenarios began to play out with all of the Wii games I purchased.  Every game began to get more frustrating and I began to play my Playstation 3 more and more.  Finally, I came to a conclusion, traditional controls just work better for playing games, period.The graphics of the Wii are fine, in my opinion, despite the lack of HD.  Graphics alone do not make a game fun, and that is why I continue to play PSOne and Nintendo 64 games to this day.  However, the unresponsive controller gestures of the Wii are enough to turn me away from the console.  I'm still hoping that Microsoft and Sony don't try to follow Nintendo too much with motion control gameplay seeing as it actually makes games more difficult and frustrating to play.  If you're a gamer looking for a console with great games, is a lot of fun, and can be played for hours on end with full precision and control, don't go with the Wii.  You can't go wrong with either a PS3 or a 360 though, both offer a wide variety of games in every genre and both respond the way you tell them to.  The Wii may have enough perks to attract you if you stick to games such as Super Smash Bros Brawl, Guilty Gear and other games that allow the option of playing with either a classic remote or a GameCube controller, but not enough games give players this option.  Also, if you're not looking for games that contain in depth controls, than perhaps you will do just fine with the Wii.  The Wii has its ups, and its downs, but for me personally, it has been a disappointment.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2009"}

First of all, this game has good graphics, big maps, and seems mostly well polished.  The game is also long, but not in a good way.  It is repetitious, which makes it boring.  You have 9 people to kill, but you must perform 3 investigations each time.  This involves thngs like eavesdropping and pickpocketing.  Before that, you must first climb various towers to discover your investigations.  THe climbing is always the same-there is no puzzle solving like in Prince of Persia.  On top of that, you have to ride back to your boss after each kill.  This is a long and pointless trip.  Combat is also slow and clumsy and you have to constantly walk around slowly to blend in and not alert guards.

It is a Role-Playing Game/First Person Shooter developed by Gearbox. With that in mind, most of you will think \"Oh, it's just a Fallout 3 clone.\" Well don't, it's far from it. If you need a game to compare Borderlands to, it would be best to think one of Blizzard Entertainment's massively successful games: Diablo II, or World Of Warcraft.Graphics:If anyone has been following this game for any length of time, you know that about halfway through development that Gearbox made a dramatic change in style from a grimdark realistic look to the now, cel shaded-esque \"Concept Art Style\". Typically you loose a lot of detail in cel shading, but with Gearbox's method you maintain the style, while keeping tiny details like a wrinkle on cloth. The graphics are very suiting of the game, but there are hitches here and there. Water effects are nonexistent, and on-character shadows tend to be fragmented. With previous few I cannot say for certain if they are a product of the Unreal Engine or not, however, the ridiculous texture pops are. You would think that people would either find a work around or license a better engine. Oh well, I guess it can't be helped.Audio:The sound fits the game unbelievably well. Walking unknowingly past a skag nest, only to hear one running at you from behind is at intense at it gets. Guns sound different to the point that really fell them for what the are. Be it an assault rifle that sounds like an anti-aircraft gun or an SMG that sounds like you could kill ten people without them even noticing, it's really amazing how many different sounds they have. The background music is a bit western and use a lot of plucking in strings to give it that authentic feel. Needless to say, if you enjoyed the music of Firefly, you will feel right at home here.Gameplay:This is where Borderlands truly shines. The game consists of either single player, or up to four player co-op in Borderlands' nice open world. You have buggies that come in various colors and in either a rocket launcher or chain gun variant where one player drives and the other guns. Borderlands has a quest system set in place to where you find a quest giver, fulfill the requirements, and return for the reward, not too different than you standard RPG. Quests come in the \"go here, kill that\", \"go here, find this\", and \"go here, find this, and kill something with it\". If you have ever in your life played an instance on World Of Warcraft you know exactly what to expect from \"dungeons\" on here. You go into an area, fight your way through many a \"peon\" and several sub-bosses to make it to the final boss. And when I say sub-bosses and bosses, I mean exactly that. Be prepared to have yourself killed SEVERAL times in the process of fighting through the instance as well as burning through most of your ammo supply. Dying consistes of two stages. 1) You are knocked to the ground and can either kill someone while downed to get up, or wait for a teammate to pick you up. 2) if neither of the previous happen you will respawn at the last checkpoint marker you passed, aptly named \"New-U\", You'll come back with no real penalty other then a loss of money. You really feel the need to work together, and I'd say doing so is more important than Left 4 Dead. On to one of the most touted aspects of the game. Guns. As has been said, this game has guns, guns, and MORE guns. You will literally never find the the same gun twice. Even if you find a gun that has the same sight, the same barrel and same name, they will not have the same stats. The amount of variety in the game truly does match that of Diablo and World Of Warcraft.As an obvious statement, no game is perfect. And Borderlands is no exception. You will come across bugs here and there such as getting stuck between a ramp and a rock. The only way to get free, being dying. The occasional graphic glitch during respawn, or shadow not lining up correctly. But in all honesty, you will be enjoying the game too much to care.Graphics: 8.2/10Audio: 8.9/10Gameplay: 9.7/10Overall: 9.2/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2009"}

Much of the setting, action, and controls have survived the  translation. The difference here is that there's just more of a good thing in  the PS2'sDark Legacy.

It's somewhat amusing to mindlessly hack away at hundreds of enemies, but it becomes tedious pretty fast and the gameplay and story do little to prop this title up.Audience: I suppose this game is meant to appeal to fans of hack and slashers and capitalize on the fan base of games like Baldur's Gate.  Dark Kingdom is an unoriginal game, and it's pretty easy to see it was modeled after Baldur's Gate and games like it.Graphics: The graphics are okay, though I don't think they capitalized well on the PS3's power.  Some of the cutscenes weren't even fully animated.  The background of the levels is pretty bland and repetitive, and while there are plenty of special effects (especially while fighting using the mage), the animation falls short.  I also noticed several glitches, where a character's sword would pass through another character but wouldn't show the impact, for example.Gameplay: The hack and slash nature of this game makes combat an exercise in mashing buttons, but that's to be expected.  This is a role playing game, so you can collect gear and increase your character's attributes as you level up.  You can also collect 'essences' from fallen foes, some of which restore health and mana and some of which are used as a sort of currency to upgrade your gear and purchase powerups for your weapon.  Beefing up a character is always fun, and Dark Kingdom was no exception, though the gear selection is pretty bland and should be considered standard fare for a game like this.The storyline for Dark Kingdom is incredibly dull and uninteresting--a shame for an RPG.  The dialog is pretty bad as well, and ranges from mildly corny to downright ludicrous.Control:  A lot of pressing the X and square buttons.  It's pretty easy to control your character in this game, and it doesn't require much time to get the hang of.  The camera, which swings wildly at time and often makes it difficult to see what's happening, makes this more difficult however.Challenge: This game is not very difficult to master and, as far as I can tell, raising or lowering the difficulty just tweaks enemies' strength and doesn't do much to make the game itself more of a challenge.Multiplayer:  This game does have a 2 player coop mode, which is nice.  You can also join in a group online, which I did not try.This game is a good rental, and may be worth borrowing from someone.  I personally wouldn't recommend buying it since the game is short and the replay value is probably very low.  With only 3 classes to choose from (standard fare--warrior, mage, scout) it doesn't take long to expend the character possibilities (you can customize, of course, but not enough to make it worthwhile), and the world of Dark Kingdom is just not interesting enough to really get immersed in.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2007"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HCNI","description":"","reviewerName":"The Czar","summary":"Fun Family Co-op. Son Loves It!","reviewText":"I'm a big Star Wars fan and casual gamer. My five year old son loves Star Wars as well. I really wanted this game for us but I was hesitant on buying this after the E3 debacle. I decided to take a chance since they supposedly went back to the drawing board to work out the issues and also because I have been waiting on \"That\" game for Kinect. The one that would take it to the next level. I have to say this game comes close but we're not there yet.We popped it in as soon as the UPS guy delivered it cause my son couldn't wait to play it. Unlike other games for Kinect this game was fairly easy to get started. We were able to jump right in with little hassle. The first mode we tried was the Rancor destruction mode. Pretty much a mindless but very fun romp through various Star Wars worlds. You basically run around smashing everything in sight, tossing droids, troopers or anything you can grab and eating humanoids for energy (My son really enjoyed that)! The controls were good but not perfect and turning around could be a little difficult. Still it was alot of fun! Then we tried the story mode which was pretty good as well. You get a nice tutorial as you are a young Padawan in training. Again the controls were good but not as responsive as I would prefer. My son had some issues with a few maneuvers partially due to the imperfect response and partially him being five. Nothing that was a deal breaker though. We had alot of fun with the Speeder Bikes through the forest on Kashyyk. The Light Saber battles were fun but a little repetitious. There are enough variances in the combat though to make you want to improve and use them all. We liked tossing Droids around with the Force. That more than anything gave me that feeling of being a Jedi and using the Force!We ended up playing for about 3 hours straight and I had to practically drag him away from it. Overall I think we'll get our money's worth from this game. My son loves it and that's what ulitimately matters for me. It just falls short of what you would expect from Microsoft teaming with Lucasarts. There are a few glitches and at one point the Droid who is kind of your guide, a C-3PO kind of Droid named TC-38 I believe, walks right into the crossfire of a Laser battle nonchalantly instead of hanging back til the area was cleared. Kind of funny actually. Also when a co-player steps in or out the game goes into slow mo and gets a little jittery. Again no deal breakers though.So far had a great time with my boy and look forward to seeing the rest of the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2012"}

Players take on the role of a wiser, more industrious heroine who sets out in this third-person 3-D action game to free Wonderland from the tyranny of the Queen of Hearts. Alice will confront a host of weird creatures in surreal settings and solve numerous puzzles through more than 15 levels of gameplay.","reviewerName":"Marc Ruby&#8482; \"The Noh Hare&#8482;\"","summary":"A Problematic Game to Consider","reviewText":"McGee's Alice is a unique recasting of the Alice in Wonderland mythos into a game context.  I'm sure the reader is already aware that this Alice, and this Wonderland, is horribly twisted by Alice's inability to deal with the tragic deaths of her parents.  Alice follows the white rabbit once again and finds herself faced which the terrible task of cleansing and healing the world of Wonderland.The task is made harder because, in order to heal Wonderland, she must heal herself.  To do that she must conquer fear, guilt and anger.  In Wonderland's terms she must slay the Red Queen, who is really the reflection of Alice's own pain.The game interface is smooth and transparent.  The disturbing artwork is truly superb.  All the characters have lost their innocence and appear as distorted caricatures of their originals.  The world itself is incredibly fantastic, rich in imagination and detail.  The game may be worth its cost simply as eye candy.To me, the game's really serious flaw is that it's story and action is on a very adult level, but the level of challenge it offers is low.  Now, I am not a regular hack and slash player, so the ease and linearity of Alice's challenges were really welcome and allowed me to enjoy the visual and narrative parts of the game.  But experts used to Deus Ex and Quake Tournament will find the game too simple.  Levels are completely linear, and the weapon set is limited in features and utility.  The only challenge is keeping a big enough supply of 'will' (the game's equivalent of ammo) to keep shooting.  Despite the violence and traumatic plot, the game would work best for a 7 to 9 year old.  Actually the violence the game offers is really only moderately graphic.  I'm not sure that the mature player warning is completely justified.Still, most collectors will want to own this game.  And most players will find it enjoyable.  The storyline itself is very touching, with a strong, positive ending.  As American McGee's first solo effort it promises much for his continued career.

{"product_name":"B000P46NKC","description":"Resident Evil 4 Wii","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Everything old is new again","reviewText":"Resident Evil 4 was a departure for Capcom's influential survival horror series in terms of gameplay and style, and it worked for the better to say the least.  Originally released on the Gamecube, and later the PS2, Resident Evil 4 was undoubtedly the best game in the franchise, and one of the best games ever made for either system as well.  Now Capcom has ported the game to the Wii, and be glad they did.  Everything that made Resident Evil 4 so good the first time around is here in spades, along with the additional features from the PS2 version (including Assignment Ada) and a new control scheme taking advantage of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk.  Playing as Leon, the survivor of Resident Evil 2, you are on a hunt for the President's missing daughter in a Spanish village.  Things aren't as they seem however as the blood thirsty townspeople begin to attack, with even bigger (and boy do I mean bigger) developments to come as well.  If by some odd reason you have never played Resident Evil 4 before, you have been missing out to say the least.  The overall ultra creepy atmosphere is retained, and the game still looks, sounds, and plays as superb as it has before.  The control scheme really makes taking down enemies easier than before, as the laser sight from your weapon is done away with and replaced with a sight using the Wii Remote to pump bullets into your enemies.  The Nunchuk is used to move Leon around, and it works flawlessly.  The only real downpoint of the Wii Edition of Resident Evil 4 is that there is no brand new content made specifically for the new release.  However, this is only a minor complaint at best considering the relatively cheap price tag to go along with one of the best games to be conceived in the past few years.  All in all, whether or not you have played Resident Evil 4 before at any great length, it is definitely worth playing once again for the Wii.  And if you have never played Resident Evil 4 before, consider this the definitive version of a classic masterpiece of modern gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2007"}

I loved Modern Warfare 2 and was expecting more of that level. This game was not. I loved the various Special Ops Missions in Modern Warfare 2 and this games 2 zombie missions doesn't even compare! Also, the solo campaign was way too linear with too many long movie-like cut scenes. And the interrogation room got old very quickly! The ending with you being JFK fighting off zombies was very gay. I did like the combat training aspect but I'm not that into multi-player Black-Ops. Already sold the game after only 4 days...Waste of money and I hate Treyarch. Looking forward to the next game by Respawn Entertainment!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2010"}
