{"product_name":"B00005NZ1M","description":"When Microsoft releasedNFL Fever 2000on the PC in 1999, it gaveMaddena serious run for its money. It's been a few years, butFeverandMaddenare once again going head-to-head on the Xbox,  and once againFeverproves itself a serious threat to EA's perennial  football powerhouse. That's not to say thatNFL Fever 2002is a perfect  game, because it isn't, but it does offer great graphics, decent AI, and plenty  of bone-crunching gameplay.NFL Fever 2002features several gameplay modes, including practice,  single game, and season, which itself contains a couple of different options,  including dynasty and fantasy challenge.Fever 2002has a full NFL  license and includes all 31 current NFL teams--and 15 fantasy teams--along with  all the current stadiums. Dynasty mode is where most players will find  themselves, as this mode lets you manage all aspects of your team, including  signing and cutting players, negotiating trades, and making sure that your team  comes in under the salary cap.A great feature in dynasty mode is Dynamic Player Performance, which adjusts  players' ratings (which determine how well they play) based on past game  performances. So if you have a second-string running back who rattles off three  or four great games in a row, his rating will increase, which should keep him  performing at that high level. On the flip side, if a player has several poor  games, his rating will decrease.Because it was designed specifically for the Xbox (unlikeMadden NFL  2002, which was ported to the Xbox from the PlayStation2 version),NFL  Fever 2002looks awesome. Player animations are highly detailed, the  stadiums look fantastic, and the weather effects are topnotch. Beyond the  obvious features, though, there are many subtle details that really add to the  experience: the field will get torn up in wet weather, player uniforms will get  stained with dirt, and the crowd will begin to thin out if the game is a  blowout.In terms of gameplay,Fever 2002delivers a solid experience. The AI is  pretty solid, especially on the defensive side, and if you call a perfect game  it's possible to get a shutout against the computer, even on the higher  difficulty settings. On the downside, the computer rarely runs the ball, even  when it has a high-powered running back like Corey Dillon, and AI play calling  is rather suspect at times.Those complaints aside,Fever 2002is a lot of fun. It offers great  graphics, multiplayer is a blast, and the dynasty mode features a good deal of  depth. If you only want one football game,NFL Fever 2002deserves your  consideration.--William HarmsPros:Dynamic Player PerformanceGreat graphicsSolid defensive AICons:Computer rarely runs the ballGameplay a little arcadelike at times","reviewerName":"punkviper","summary":"A real rush... once you get used to it","reviewText":"Everyone wants to know &quot;How does NFL Fever 2002 compare to Madden 2002?&quot;  The answer is that Fever compares favorably, but is ultimately a different sort of football game.  If you always thought Madden was &quot;too arcadey&quot; then you might want to steer clear of this one, as it plants itself somewhere between the simulation efforts of Madden and Sega's NFL 2K2, and the kamikaze kinetics of the NFL Blitz series.  Fever is actually a very compelling and fun game once you get over the fact that you aren't playing Madden.Fever easily pulls off the best graphics ever in a console football game.  From the integration of many different intro shots for each play, to the exacting detail which accompanies every hit, jump, and stiff-arm, it is fantastically clear that the developers went the extra mile to really draw you in to the game and create an exciting &amp; colorful world.  The players jabber at one another, celebrate successful offensive achievements, and showboat after a steller defensive effort.  It really does make Madden look fairly pale and colorless as a result.The commentary suffers from some uneven choppiness (&quot;FIVE... yard... reception by... ENGRAM!&quot;) but does give some timely insight in certain situations (&quot;The defense is in a 3-4, a run would be successful here.&quot;)  The much-touted graphics are indeed a step-up from Madden, but are not letter-perfect.  The detailed faces are a very nice addition, but disappoint when Jerome Bettis looks nothing like Jerome Bettis.  He's detailed, but looks nothing like the real guy.  But it sure beats Madden's cheesy Kewpie-Doll faces.The bottom-line really comes down to gameplay, and Fever tends toward &quot;the big play.&quot;  Interceptions are more common than in Madden, big runs, big returns, long gains, freight-train tackles, all of it brings make Fever seem a little over-the-top, and really makes Madden seem slow &amp; pensive in comparison.  Which is why some won't take to this more reactive arcade style of gameplay.  Traditional football playcalling &amp; tactics still apply, but the realism factor is purposefully loosened to create a more no-holds-barred atmosphere designed to ramp up the fun-factor.Honestly, it took me a few times before I was ready to accept this type of football (not to mention getting used to the XBox controller) but once I did, I really started to appreciate the flair and style that Fever brings.  I guess the telling thing is that I tried to go back to Madden and really had to mentally shift gears to prepare for a different sort of football experience.  NFL Fever 2002 is fun, easy to pick up and play, easy to like, great 2-player fun, and a lot deeper than your average console football game.  And they did an admirable job of injecting some life into a stale genre by pushing the fun-factor way up while still retaining the confines of real football.If too many years of Madden is gradually putting you to sleep, get into the Fever and see how much fun a football game can be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2001"}

First great game of 2010!","reviewText":"I'll admit I was probably one of the only people NOT looking forward to Bayonetta before it came out. While 3rd person action games are probably my favorite genre, just about everything that's come out lately is either a 1st person shooter in a 3rd person guise or another God of War/Devil May Cry rip off. I'm happy to say Bayonetta is not only my favorite game from the last couple years it's probably the best 3rd person action game out there (for the next-gen systems anyway)!The game starts off uneven trying to cram a creative but unrealized story of a witch fighting heavenly creatures into a tutorial/prologue level. This was probably the low-point for me since this game had at least three different openings, one controllable, one in voice-acted film strips, one in full-cutscene and all of these were confusing at best (not to mention VERY overwhelming). Also throughout the game there's alot of characters introduced. Despite being a story-driven game I found the less I thought about the story and what was going on the more I enjoyed myself. There are texts you can collect throughout the game though that will give you a bit more backstory as to what's going on.Thankfully the narrative is the ONLY weak point to this game. Once you start the first chapter you will be literally blown away by the gameplay mechanics. The game very much plays out just like Devil May Cry with you chopping and shooting your way through hordes of demons and excellent bosses and the game gives you alot of different things to do this with. There are so many weapons, techniques, accessories, items, costumes to try and unlock that you'll actually WANT to play through each stage multiple times. You can also equip any combination of melee weapons and guns on your hands and feet which drastically can change the way you fight.The music in the game is the usual j-pop fare. I'm not a huge fan of it, but it seemed to fit the game well and never felt out of place. The voice acting is also flawless despite alot of silly dialogue.I really can't recommend Bayonetta enough. It's got terrific graphics, excellent gameplay mechanics, and a never ending sense of fun and creativity. I bought the XBOX 360 version because I heard the PS3 version had a never ending amount of issues. I can't vouch for that version but if you're an action game fan and own a XBOX360 this game is a must buy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2010"}

The XBox has been lacking exclusive RPGs and Sudeki (along with Fable) looked like it might fill in some gapping holes.  However after picking up a demo of the game at Gamestop prior to it's release my entire opinion flipped. The demo was plain awful, the combat seemed to be lacking and to put it lightly i wasn't at all impressed. So what did i do? I cancelled my reservation.Several months latter (after watching Sudeki pretty much bomb sales wise) i decided to pick up a copy because of the price drop and i have to say that my opinion completly changed. Hidden behind all of the hype (both negative and positive) i found Sudeki suprisingly addictive and enjoyable.Graphically the game is beutiful and despite the simplicity of the combat it's enjoyable (not bad hack and slash at all) - the boss fights are also alot of fun. The story has depth and despite the annoying voice acting (and it is very annoying) i can't say anything other then i enjoyed the game.I guess i leaned my lesson - don't trust a demo to give you an honest accesment of a game and don't believe the hype. There are quite a few games that were overlooked and have become classics. (especially RPGs)Give Sudeki a shot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000QUYHIK","reviewerName":"Michaele L.","summary":"Let's call this brain age \"squared\"!","reviewText":"Just a little humor there - look at the package, the two is a superscript so I like to call it Brain Age squared!At any rate, this is a wonderful addition to the original Brain Age with some more brain sharpening tools.  The same explanation is there at the beginning, i.e. the one where the host presents pictures of MRI images of the brain at  \"idle\", while figuring out a difficult math problem and while reading or working simple problems.  It's worth noting that the brain working simple math problems or reading aloud demonstrated more activity on the MRI scans.  That said, working out the brain does not have to be difficult or super frustrating and can indeed be fun.There are some clever additions such as identifying which mathematical symbol belongs in an equation.  Again, these are not difficult problems and the goal is to recognize what symbol is needed FAST - just as jogging or doing some other form of exercise daily, these little work-outs keep the mind sharp.The addition of  \"Making change\" is brilliant!  We need more activities like this - not only is this brain sharpening, it is something that can be used in every day life when making purchases.  Of note, this reviewer does this regularly - whenever paying for something, my own little game is seeing if I can figure out the change before the clerk tells me (without cheating by looking at their computer)!The piano playing addition is enjoyable albeit having been a musician for years, I might have just a bit of an edge over a non musician.  Nevertheless, I love the connection between music and the mind and hope to see more research in this area.Admittedly, I have not tried anything that requires the voice.  I was disapointed in that regard with the first go round but since I have not tried it, I cannot comment on the quality.  Another reviewer comments that it seemed to go well.Finally, there are new Sudoku puzzles and a new addiiton, virus busters, kind of like tetris in a way.  The game instructs that this is not meant for training but more for relaxing.  Rather enjoyable once you get the swing of it - your mind works by strategizing where to place the \"capsules\" and just how to turn them.Contratulations and kudos to the developers of this fine software - it's a wonderful addition.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2007"}

I don&#8217;t know why because Sly Cooper is just as good if not better than those. This game shows exactly what many games today are missing today, just simple fun.First, the games only fatal flaw are the numerous bugs and glitches in the game are unforgivable and can make the game very frustrating. It kills me to do it, but they are so unforgivable that I had to take off a point.These games don't feel aged at all. The writing can be downright hilarious (although sometimes cheesy), but it all adds to the light-hearted Saturday morning cartoon feel the series has. The environments are fantastic. The games are just fun.I agree with the sentiment that the second was far superior. It was laid back, more of a sandbox play style, had by far the best dialogue, and wasn't nearly as frustrating. The third is significantly more varied, but was often frustrating because of the bugs and found the difficulty much harder than it should have been.

{"product_name":"B0045U01OG","description":"","reviewerName":"Jon","summary":"WELL worth the money!  A few things I did note.","reviewText":"I finally got a PS3 a few months ago and knew from the hype this was a game to get - no disappointments here.  And with the other two games included in the pack (you load the game and the first menu you get to is which game you want to play) it's well worth the money.The game is obviously good enough (just look at the reviews - like GTA: SA, it's an open world where you can drive around and do what you want) that I figure I'll put down a few minor things that were of note for me personally (may be different for others).I did set my controls (as is an easy option to do) to the \"classic\" setting, where 'X' is accelerate, square is break, circle is e-brake, etc., since I found immediately I just could not get down using the top R and L buttons to drive.For me, the camera view gets frankly really irritating at times when you're driving - it doesn't quickly center itself, and you have to double-tap I think select or some other button to get it to do so.  So when you're, say, in the middle of a mission and a guy you're chasing hangs a hard right, sometimes it's hard to have the proper depth perception to be able to follow him properly until you're able to get around the corner.  You may end up hitting a parked car, for instance.I did miss the \"car customization\" shops GTA: SA had.  Also there are three different clothing shops total, and the area comparable to Manhattan and Times Square pretty much just looked nice but there wasn't much you could do other than drive around it.  I mean San Andreas had little hidden spots where you could play basketball, more obvious spots where you could gamble in casinos, and was massive enough you had to fly to get places faster, for better or worse.  It was those small little things where you could interact with that blew me away in GTA: SA but where there aren't as much in this game.You can visit strip clubs, bars, a comedy show, and play pool though.  It's kind of like they got rid of the tiny little intricacies and hidden treasures and turned them into fewer but more grand of activities, which I guess showcases the power of the PS3 more, but at the expense of tiny little nuanced aspects.  There are some amazing-for-being-in-a-video-game tv episodes you can watch, and the internet feature was somewhat cool.  I also do like the taxi option of being able to get around much much quicker.  That was nice.One thing of note is if you want to explore the map, as you obviously should, you will want to go to the cell phone and turn the missions off, otherwise you will continue getting inundated with phone calls.  I don't like talking nonstop on my cell phone in real life, so it's even more irritating to be trying to do something and get calls from random characters wanting to yak - and if you dare ignore the call, then you lose respect points.Frankly I have not even gotten to the other two \"Grand Theft Auto filler games\" as I think of the smaller games released between GTA: San Andreas and GTA4, and these two, but I imagine they're the standard fare: more linear and smaller than the main game, but still enjoyable in their own right.So those are not even necessarily CONS as much as just things I noted for myself slightly irked me.  But all-in-all, still an amazing game.  Maybe not quite as all-around perfect as San Andreas, but still amazing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2011"}

It has always been a 2D fighter. This latest iteration helps this long in the tooth fighting game revive some of its newness and lost luster. Now you can fight as all of the original fighters plus 10 new ones. I have not played the online multiplayer yet.Gameplay (+)This game is a fantastic 2 player game to have at your house when your friends come over. Its so much fun to battle your friends head to head as characters you have played in the past. The mechanics are still the same and you can pull off combos with the right joystick movement/ button combo.Graphics (+)The last street fighter I played was probably 4 years ago and at that time they were trying to introduce 3D into it. It was never that convincing because one of the beauties of this game is actually the 2D space. By restricting you to only forward and back you can concentrate on the killer moves needed to take out your opponent. What this version does (and others prior to this might but I never played them), is bring in 3D movements and marry that to the 2D space. Now your fighting moves are very lifelike and yet you are bound to the restrictions that make this game work.Scenes (+)The scenes are just great. Each one of the characters has their background that fits their look. Each one is animated with great characters or objects.New Characters (+/-)I like the new characters. Each has their own style and special moves. I have not unlocked special characters as of yet. The main selectable new characters have cool looks, and genre specific styles that emulate where they come from like Juri is Korean and has a Hapkido/Tae Kwon Do look to her style. The negative I can see is that the new characters are archetypal versions of what we already have. The big muscular slow fighter, the fast quick light fighter and so on. Nothing added is really innovative other than their special moves.Special Moves / Finishing moves (+)Some of the finishing moves are absolutely hilarious and great to taunt your friends with. An example is Hakan; this fat slow guy that resembles a hippo. Some of his finishing moves I have tried out are awesome. He slimes himself up so when he fights hes slippery. He uses that slime to do some cool finishing moves on people. I have not tried every character out, but have seen some of the moves watching friends play this in the arcade.Tactics: (+)You could go into this doing the same combo over and over and quickly see that you would have your butt handed to you. This iteration of the Street Fighter series rewards you for tactics in that there is more damage done when you pull off the harder moves and not spam your opponent with them repeatedly.Summary:Overall this is a fantastic fighter to have in your arsenal of games. The price makes it even more appealing. I highly recommend it!Thanks for reading my review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2010"}

And boy, was I disappointed.  Lets list the good and the badPros:Impressive graphics, considering it's a playstation 1 gameGreat Music by Akira YamaokaAmazing Camera angles (especially during the opening run down the hallway type thing)Fun to playGood atmosphere.Cons:Not fun at all in the daytime, so you have to wait until night to enjoy it at it's fullestThe atmosphere is NOT backed up WHATSOEVER!!  This was my biggest gripe about the game!  Stuff like resident evil and dino crisis have less of a crazy atmosphere, but what atmosphere they do have is backed up by the sudden and unexpected appearance of enemies, and the extreme difficulty of killing the enemies.  Plus, with a lack of ammo, you're usually panicking.  Silent Hill has great atmosphere, but plenty enough ammo to kill the generally weak monsters that are found throughout the levels, and most of them are slow and don't do much damage to you, therefore they don't pose much of a threat.  Silent Hill 2 had Pyramid Head, and at some points I actually was too scared to continue on with the game on the fear that he might show up and slaughter me.  Silent Hill has absolutely nothing to back up this atmosphere, and if you can get past the disturbing look of things, and realise that there is nothing making the scary noises, you're just walking around a deserted area that has the lights out, some monsters, and creepy music.  What's so scary about that?  Nothing.  And when there are an abundance of enemies, it's not scary, it's just annoying, because if you can't pick them off one by one then you're overwhelmed and you die.Like I said above, absence of enemies makes the game far too easy, but too many enemies makes the game too hard.They should have had your character have crashed on the outskirts of town and had you walk to town in the middle of the night.  That would have been scarier, and better than just appearing in the town.The alternate dimension is overused.  This problem was fixed in silent hill 2 though, and was executed perfectlyAfter my list of the good and the bad, you tell me what you think.  I wasn't scared playing this game (maybe made nervous a few times, but never terrified like I was playing the sequel).  It's definately a good game, but terribly overrated, and you can tell it's their first effort at the genre.In all, being the silent hill fan I am (I own the first 2 games and origins, have seen the movie(which sucked, btw), and plan on buying the third and fourth titles when I have the money) I'm glad I bought this game, but It's not as good as the hype leads you to believe.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2007"}

Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game.

With over 400 reviews to testify towards it's greatness. The game is constantly referenced when reviewing similar games in magazines and the Internet. I will only add that the game is well written and the graphics beautifully done. I can't however buy the fact it happened 4000 years before Luke and friends with relatively the same technology. Maybe 50 to 100 years by no way 4000 years. The decisions you make can change the outcome of the game and though it starts slowly on Taris by the end it's fast and addictive. Unfortunately, this isn't a perfect game. The Xbox version has slow loading times for each map. The camera angle can get stuck with you not seeing the enemy in battle. Although I choose the actions my group takes, I feel disassociated with the characters in battle. I can give moves, how to attack and preps them for battles but it's up to them to fight. I'm left on the sidelines like a coach watching the action. The battles themselves seems clumsy with swipes being made to enemies followed by long pauses and points being calculated. The main problem if it can be called that is the time it takes to complete one game. 40-50 hours depending on side quests. That's a big chunk of time for a game. It took over my life for 2 weeks. The game time was clocked at 52 hours (I fell asleep playing the game one time. Still, a game that made a mark in the video game world. The other annoying issue I had is the \"recycling of secondary character faces\". It's like a race of clones. The recycling of the Sand People came and the Eder Camp is forgivable the people that we interact really cut corners. The only other issue I can see is that the characters can use \"steriods\" to improve strength etc. through injections. The performance enhanciing items are just not explained well enough to use them to any advantage. Maybe KOTOR 2 improved on the tid bits.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2004"}

You eventually can pick up another nine characters, including Jedi, a Wookiee and droids, one of which is one of the most amusing characters I've ever seen. As the story takes place thousands of years before the events of the films, you don't need to be a Star Wars junkie to dive right in.The game features lots of ways to customize your character's abilities, and more than enough sidequests to keep people interested. Many of these quests influence your alignment - the more you lean toward the Light Side, the more comfortable people will feel around you (and thus, I found, they will give you more quests as the game goes on). The Dark Side is pretty profitable, though, to make up for that.The biggest thing that one has to get used to is the combat mechanic. It is very D&D-style;, using a simulated 20-sided die roll to resolve actions (for example, a base target of 10 + 5 (for opponent's defense) - 3 (your attack bonus) = 12 (modified to-hit target). Thankfully, this mechanic runs in the background and is quickly ignored. When you sight an enemy, you can choose to engage them, choosing a series of actions to take (e.g. normal attack, special attack, throw grenade, normal attack) that you can modify on the fly. Hardcore shooter fans will hate it, but most people will adapt to it fairly quickly. Plus, the later stages of the game are frenetic enough that most people will appreciate KOTOR's approach to combat.The game also has significant replay value - besides the obvious filling out your quest and item logs, your choices influence the ending. So if you played the first time as a goody-two-shoes, you can run through it again as a horseman of apocalypse and see what happens this time.This game requires a serious investment of time - you're looking at least 25 hours, and that's only if you're amazingly good, uncannily lucky and do none of the sidequests.A few minor complaints I have about the game: first off, the only time you can change a character's equipment is when they are in your active party. This is particularly frustrating when you are in your base with all nine standing around you, but becuase you haven't selected them, you physically have to leave the base with two at a time to change equipment (good luck if your pulling a 4-character switch like I did :( ). Second, some of the videos a dialogue animations are buggy. Third, there is a convenient \"Return to base\" option; the problem is, it is not always active. This is fine for, say, a boss stage you can't escape until you defeat said boss, but in some cases it makes no sense (i.e. I can walk back through one doorway and it will work on the other side).Minor complaints aside, KOTOR rightly deserves those Game of the Year awards it won. If you like (or can at least tolerate) a true RPG, pick this up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000PS4X7S","reviewerName":"Jeff Johnson \"Jeff Johnson\"","summary":"Repetitive cooperative first person zombie shooter with an emphasis on cooperation for your survival","reviewText":"The zombie apocalypse is here and that's the entire story you need to know in this cooperative first-person shooter and all the story you're ever told. You play as 1 of 4 survivors (Zoey the college student, Bill the war veteran, Francis the biker, Louis the IT guy). The character doesn't seem to matter, it's just a different voice and skin. They will talk to alert you of things like health, weapons, reloading and where you should go next. Left 4 Dead is geared toward online multiplayer, but you can play solo through the game where your computer partners are competent enough, but need to be guided by you. Instead of online multiplayer where the other players seem to just run right through each level.The controls are simple, point and click to shoot like any first person shooter, right mouse button is for melee for when foes swarm around you and they will. You have a long range weapon (shotguns, oozies, assault rifles and so on), a pistol (or 2) with limitless ammo, a medipack to restore your health or someone else's, pain pills that will temporarily give you a health boost and finally an explosive thrown weapon like a flaming cocktail or pipe bomb. You can jump or crouch for better weapon accuracy and that's it. The combat feels very limited because of this.The big drawing point to the game is some sort of smart engine called the director that will generate random zombies to come at you, so no play through is the same twice. Such as a zombie that was at point A of your first play through might be a wall of zombies or no zombies, or a female zombie in your next play through. These zombies will race toward you after a few moments of shuffling their feet that might result in your terror, but an entire game of zombies running to you gets old very quickly. Zombies can climb up areas, go under truck trailers and the animations are good in general. Weapons and ammo scattered outside of safe rooms will not be in the same place twice.The game is broken into campaigns and levels that you can access any one at any time. The campaigns are brief and really take you out of the action when you need to load a new campaign after completing one. The levels have good atmosphere, dark, spooky, but it gets old very quickly. Most every level feels the same with generic buildings, generic exteriors, generic trucks.Between the levels are safe rooms. Leave a safe room and make it to the next safe room to cap off the level. Then at the end of the level, you see your score and how you did against the other players. Who killed the most zombies, who took the most damage. Stuff like that.To be honest it's not that good. It feels very one dimensional. Within the first few levels, you've seen all the game has to offer. You will quickly see all of its small variety of enemies zombies run straight at you, witches that stay huddled until you put a light on them, stalkers pounce on you until you are saved, smokers use a tongue to strangle you until you are saved and explode smoke, exploders that vomit on you and tanks that can throw you and take a giant amount of punishment. You will really need to rely on others for survival. The computer players will be very willing to help you, but the players in multiplayer may not be as willing or can't when you've been left behind or gone ahead.That's it. The game isn't very long and for a game that touts its random enemy generator, it doesn't make me want to replay the game again and again. Combat is simple, enemy variety is lacking, but the game plays very smooth. Essentially left for dead is about mowing down tons of zombies and if that's your thing, this is the game for you. If you need puzzles in your FPS or weapon depth, it's not for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2012"}

Too Human was basically stuck in development hell and was supposed to be a big Playstation epic (that's the first machine by the way), then on the Gamecube then finally on the Xbox 360. But is it one of those projects where the wait was worth it? Nope and in fact it seems only to enhance the problems of the game actually since it makes me look at the repetitive hack-and-slashing of the \"Dynasty Warriors\" games in a better light thanks to this: those are easier and quicker to make, fun in that boneheaded way and has enough story to at least compel in the slightest. Too Human on the other hand feels like it took so long because they didn't know when they wanted to stop.Story: Using Norse mythology as a template, the game centers on Baldur, son of Odin who's been tasked to defeat the machine armies who seek to vanquish all life. Only the Gods are actually enhanced by cybernetics and Baldur with his non-cybernetic ways makes people see him in a lesser light, thus making him be \"too human\". The story follows Baldur through several levels as he takes on numerous enemies and the political ideals that are encouraged.Graphics: For all of its copy-and-pasting of environments, Too Human's graphics look quite stellar with dozens of enemies on screen at once, facial animation and detail in cutscenes to be cool and \"cyberspace\", a garden that looks more real than anything in the normal world has a nice tranquility and feel. There's the occasional slowdown and inexplicably, collision detection with melee attacks actually not connecting in close quarters or power-ups I can't seem to grab even though I should be able to but other than that, it's a great looking game.Sound/Music: The music is going for that cinematic and epic feel which is strange because outside of cutscenes, I barely noticed it. While I might appreciate more on its own, within the game it was like I was unconciously phasing it out and not even hearing it. Voice acting on the other hand is quite stellar and really delivers. Aurally, it's a mixed bag but some people might love the score while others are hearing some much sword clashes and explosions that you'll probably just tune it out.Gameplay: As with other games, there tends to be a familiarity in your tasks and controls and it's up to the game to give fresh uses or change it up a bit via a vehicle section or special mission (i.e: the stealth sniper mission in Call of Duty IV) but in Too Human's case, it's a case of \"get used to this because you're going to be doing it for a long time.\" It's basically a dungeon crawler hack-and-slash and believe me when I say this game get can mind-numbingly repetitive to the point where I get the feeling it took 10 years just to program the levels themselves since they seemingly go on forever. The phrase \"here we go again\" definately applies here as you'll be doing a lot of one thing the entire time.The first of which is looting where better weapons and equipment can be found throughout the levels with better damage, better sell value and whatnot (though they have really silly names that sound like D&D; to the extreme) and it's a common occurence to go into your menu and switch equipment, sell crap equipment or add Runes which act like special bonus abilities. Another way you progress is with the skill tree where you can get better damaging attacks, added status effects or new abilities to use and thankfully you can buy back your skill points should your initial choices suck. If you're a collection gamer and love getting that one weapon with better damage than the other than you're going to love this. The problem with this is that enemies scale with you so there's no real progression in your character, that fun moment when the enemy finally drops that one awesome weapon, it might as well just be another sword.Now we come to the big issue and the one chief offender I have with the game: the Valkyrie cutscene. Essentially you don't really \"die\" in the game so much as respawn a ways behind where you were (though sometimes it spawns you in the thick of battle anyway) and it's unskippable, unnecessary since a \"now loading\" screen would've done the trick or for co-op, just have them disappear then re-appear later but the big problem: how many times you'll run into it and there's even an achievement for dying 100 times meaning seeing the cutscene that much. Enemies will continually firing lasers, big \"trolls\" pound the ground or litter the ground with bombs, swarms of enemies coming up to you and sometimes exploding with incurable status effects temporarily or freeze upon contact and let's just say the cutscene will not be a favorite among anyone.Oh and for those of you who haven't found out, you melee attack using the right analog stick. Just push in the direction you want to attack in and Baldur goes from there though he'll actually stop should you stop so instead of repeatedly pressing B in a button-masher way, now it's a stick masher as one game website described it as. This leaves you having to rely on an ineffectual camera that will shift for no apparent reason, changing your direction and resetting the camera doesn't help either because it's trying to say \"quit trying to reset the camera and look at something I want to show you.\" Also there's no lock-on meaning instead of focusing on the one missile launching cronie, you're shooting some foot soldier that you can vanquish with the greatest of ease. Also you have to actually be pointing at the dude so on one encounter I wanted to shoot a troll's arm so he'd quit shooting bombs yet I couldn't just lock on, I had to turn around, then start firing. It's the school of thought some developers have where it \"sounds like a great and unique idea\" but never figuring out how to make it work properly because it's too focused on how unique it is.And yet after all this, I like it. Why is that? Who knows and I don't think I'll ever figure it out either. It's like Assassin's Creed, another short and repetitive yet beautiful and unique game that you want to dislike and yet you catch yourself going \"I want to play that again\". Maybe you had fun with it. Couldn't be cause you went on a rant about it but I guess that's sometimes the case. Critically acclaimed games are called \"overrated\" (coughs*GTAIV*coughs) and yet mediocre games are just simply \"misunderstood\", the black-haired outsider with the heart of gold on the playground. To be honest I don't know why I'm having fun with it and I like how Denis Dyack, lead designer behind this is trying to say it's not just gameplay but story, music and the presentation that make a game. Methinks he's just trying to convince people Too Human really is this awesome.In the most egotistical and ill-fated development news, Too Human is apparently part 1 of an \"epic\" trilogy which is strange considering Too Human's story is interesting sure but doesn't have the draw a trilogy needs for return visits and considering Too Human's length of at most 10 hours, it's best that Silicon Knights either work on making Too Human 2 vastly improved over the original or don't even bother and work on new exciting material or an Eternal Darkness sequel...one that won't take 10 years to make.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2008"}

Even though it was badly beaten up by its previous owner, the card has never had a single issue connecting to the GameCube, reading, or writing data.  It has plenty of space for the dozen games I own with more left over if I get any new ones.  My friend has had his for years and he says it still works like the day he first got it.Just a heads up, there isn't a battery backup or anything to run out, but because of the way flash memory operates it will theoretically only retain any given save file for around a decade.  Anytime you write to that save again it would restart the clock and give you another ten years.  It has to do with how long the memory physically retains the imprint of the save.  The same principle applies to common USB drives or camera memory cards.  It really won't affect you unless you're planning to keep the machine a really, really long time, but it's good to be aware.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003O6CBIG","description":"","reviewerName":"The Tech Fanatic \"The Tech Fanatic\"","summary":"Modern Warfare 4","reviewText":"I am a longtime fan of the Call of Duty series or otherwise known as COD. I have played World at War, Modern Warfare, Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops and Black Ops II, and now this, Ghosts. Let me just say that it's all about preference so no review will be the same as each person has a different take on a game. Those that are offended by a review need to grow up and understand that not everyone shares their point of view. And so I contribute my point of view which I am sure is different from everybody else's.Call of Duty Ghosts feels more like Modern Warfare 4 than anything. It looks almost the same and the game plays just about the same. I am not saying that that is bad because I did enjoy Modern Warfare 3. For some reason it did not generate the amount of interest as Black Ops. Maybe that's because Black Ops had the Zombie mode. Or maybe that it was had more going for it.Let me start by going over the things that I did like about this iteration of the series. I like the addition of the dog in the game. It does add a little feel to this game that is unlike the other iterations. The dog will accompany you in your battle and will alert you to any enemy coming in. It will also attack and even avenge you should you get killed before he is. It brought a smile on my face when my dog took out an enemy that took me out. Also, the dog's panting by your side gives you a sense of security. But you don't get the dog until you have reached a certain kill streak. I pretty much got the dog often so I really enjoyed that experience.I really liked the lean and slide abilities. It's about time that they added these features. I use these abilities often as they can mean the difference between getting the kill or being killed. The slide itself takes practice but I recommend it to those who like to run and gun. This maneuver helps to reduce a sniper's ability to get a lock on when you are moving about in the open.Another thing that I did like about the game is that the graphics has certainly been improved. The environments are even more realistic than ever. Modern Warfare 3 had such great graphics and this one upped the ante. The details go as far as the swaying of leaves and the details on the leaves themselves.Speaking of environment, the set pieces, at least some of them, are destructible. In one case, for example, I placed an I.E.D. next to a gate and when it exploded the gate actually fell down. The ground on one map actually shook as you moved around. It gave you a sense of urgency and a feeling of uncertainty as you went to battle.The maps themselves number about 14 with one having been at one time a bonus downloadable content. You will be happy to know that that map is now added to the included maps with the recent update. That map is named Free Fall. I personally didn't really care for this map but others will definitely like its height. Modern Warfare 3 had a similar map where you went up several stories to do battle. So for those of you purchasing this game used you will not be denied the opportunity to play on this map.Another thing that I liked is the perks system. You can purchase upgrade with tokens much like in BOPSII but now you can purchase them ahead of time before you are allowed to use them. That way you don't accidently use up those tokens for something else. For example, if you want to be able to load three attachments on your weapon you can buy that perk but you have to wait until you reach a rank of 30, for example. The token system really works well in this game.The addition of the squad system of play is great. I really like it. Here, you get to play against a team of AI soldiers and your teammates consists of AI soldiers, too. It is basically a simulated online match but just with AI characters. You can practice here without feeling the pressure that comes with joining a live online game. This will give those who never get those high scores to feel like they accomplished something as it is easy to rack up the kills.Another thing that I like is the I.E.D. At first I missed the Bouncing Betties but after having played the online matches for a longer time I prefer the I.E.D. The problem with the Bouncing Betties is that some players have become very adapt at lowering themselves to avoid receiving damage. I notice that the I.E.D. gets more kills. Of course, there is a perk to reduce explosive damage and that will nullify its effects.Another thing that I like is that the controls seem to be tighter on this iteration. It feels more smooth and easier to control. In some iterations the controls felt a little too loose. Now it feels more like laser shooting.Now, for the stuff that I didn't like. First, I didn't like the fact that they removed the theater feature. You can no longer save a match to share with friends. In Black Ops II, or BOPSII, you could save your best matches. You could prove to your mates that you scored such and such or that you pulled off an incredible stunt. I think that was a step backwards for the series.Another thing I did not like is the fact that the textures are no longer downloaded into your Playstation 3. Now, it is loaded every time you play. That is not such a good thing because it makes your Playstation 3 work harder. The result is that it will lead to a lot more wear and tear on your unit. And with more wear and tear your unit will not last as long. You see, the unit will be overheated by the constant loading of textures. Black Ops II' designers were considerate enough to preload the textures to avoid this additional wear and tear. It also speeds up the loading process.I did not like the fact that they did not continue the ability to mute all players except party members. Now, you can only mute other players one at a time. It can be quite annoying when you have more than one player who is a man-child who can't stop verbally abusing other players. Yes, you can report these offenders but it was a step backwards from BOPSII. We should not have to put up with these jerks or have to leave a lobby just because of them.Another con in this game is that you have to purchase the season pass in order to receive special gun called Ripper. Come on, all the weapons should be available upon purchase. I can understand the customization for this guns such as skins but going as far as selling the weapons is going too far. It can possibly give an unfair advantage to those who have the means to purchase the season pass over those who are on a tighter budget. Yes, sixty bucks should include all the weapons.Another con to this game is that you will often respawn right in front of an enemy. I have often found myself being killed almost as soon as I respawned because other players would know where the opponents would respawn. You would think that we would have the technology to place the respawn points away from enemies.What I didn't like as with other iterations such as BOPSII is the strike packages. They can be downright overpowered. It kind of ruins the game when your team is struggling and then someone calls in the strike package to destroy your team even more. It can be downright discouraging. These should be toned down a bit or set up so that the player has to actually run the strike package but in a more limited area.Another think that I don't like about this iteration is that the number of players on an online match has been limited to a smaller number. Having more players add to the chaos and the increased action. I don't know why the number has been reduced but it really changes the game.Finally, the wait time for matches seem longer now. I don't know how that could be as there are now less players involved in the online matches. It could be because they now have to deal with an addition of Playstation 4. But whatever the case, the wait seems a little longer.On a side note, I notice the use of tanks as set pieces on maps and they look pretty and all that but that's all they are. They could have made those tanks an actual part of the game. Treyarch used the tanks in World at War and that was a favorite of many players as they would go scampering after the tanks like bees to honey. I myself enjoyed using the tanks. They were not overpowered and multiple kills were not easy as there would be anti-tank missiles coming your way. And some players enjoyed taking down the tanks. I do hope that Treyarch and Infinity Ward will bring back the tanks as they gave the game more dynamics.If you are wondering whether to get Call of Duty Ghosts or not, you should go ahead and get it as it is fun. Just don't go into it thinking that it will be like BOPSII. If you really enjoyed that game but not as much of MW3, you may end up going back to BOPSII and this game would just collect dust.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2014"}

{"product_name":"B002I0K898","description":"","reviewerName":"DAMIEN \"XXVI\"","summary":"THE BEST MMORPG GAME FOR THE PS3","reviewText":"I would like to say that I put in over 100 hundred hours of gameplay.I downloaded this game for FREE! via playstation network. After a few hours of playing I realized I was going to lose sleep because the game is that fun.Here's breakdown:The game is free to download but you are limited of how many characters you can create (2 characters only) and limit of $1,500 in-game currency. If you decide to pay a subscription (which I did) you can create 16 characters, unlimited amount of cash, 150 replay badges, access to all the DLC (downloadable content), and trade items/cash with friends.Let me explain why I chose to pay for the subscription (legendary staus):You can play the entire game with two characters (I would recommend a Hero and villian) and still experience a great game.The reason I decided to pay the subscription is a.) I'm not planning to get any games anytime soon b.) I want to get the full experience what the game can offer c.) I would like to play multiple characters with different weapons and powers and d.) unlimited cash and 150 replay badgesMy reviewFirst, I would like to say I am a huge DC fan, working together with your favorite DC character is very rewarding.The game has a lot to offer when you create your character you enter to an open world of Ai villians and heroes and other people like yourself trying complete a tons of side missions which you can pair up and complete it together.Note: when you create a character you have the option to choose PVE or PVP. PVE means player versus environment which I recommend because high level players will attack as soon as they see you if you're in PVP. By the way, Phase shifter allows you to migrate from from the PvE to the PvP, and vice versa. The phase shifter is located in the Watch Tower for heroes and Hall of Doom for villians.You start as level 1 and grind through the game until you hit level 30. My first playthrough was great because my friends and I helped eachother out to complete a lot of side missions and take down several bosses. As you progress through the story you'll be receiving a lot of loot which contains of better weapons, armor or items.Levels between 1-30 is basically a tutorial. Reaching to level 30 gets even better, the game offers different/bigger missions, game modes, etc. The other game modes are Raids and Tier, you can party up with 8 other players complete more challenging missions or you can pair up with 2-4 players for missions as well. The incentive for playing in the higher end missions are the loot and buy the Iconic battle suits.For those who want to compete with other players there is a game mode for that: PVP arenas and PVP legends.PVP arenas consists of different maps and game modes such as, captue the flag, team deathmatch, king of the hill, etc.Fyi, when you decide to play PVP arenas make sure you get some armor for that game type. Let me explain, for PVP you need to find armor that has a high amount of 'toughness'. If you used the armor (armor that has a high amount of 'defense' stats) you get from your 1st playthrough you will be taken out fast by PVP players. You can find PVP armor at certain vendors throughout the game.PVP legends is very different, you can play as your favorite DC character against other players. You can play as the Joker, Batman, Bane, Power girl, Robin, Superman and many more. As for me, I chose Bizarro, its nothing better than playing as a dumb Superman LOL! However, it will take some work to play your favorite characters, you will need to earn Mark of Legends (another form of many in-game currency), and if you have Light dlc you will have more access to characters. This is one of my favorite game modes from the game.Having said that, the game does suffer technical issues, if you turn on your mic/headset in the game 50% of the time the other players can't hear you; so what you need to do is exit out the game completely turn on your mic/headset first and restart the game.If you are gong for platinum I would not recommend it because you will need to go through six playthroughs and 90% of the missions are the same. It doesn't make sense why would the developers decided to make a player to complete six playthroughs if He/She wants to get platinum. I won't be doing that again for any game.Needless to say, I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to experience an mmorpg (massive multiplayer online role playing game) that has tons of replayability.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2012"}

Johnson","summary":"Very Addictive. Makes GTA III look like Barney and Friends.","reviewText":"After recently hearing all the hype about the first edition of GTA San Andreas, I had to check it out. Instead of buying the censored 2nd edition, I went to Ebay and got the first edition.  While I do agree that games like this should not be played by children, what I don't agree with is that mature adults have to be forced to play a censored version of the game, just because some parent does not monitor what they buy for their kids and want to cause a big stink about it.  Some idiot grandmother in New York wanted to sue Rockstar because she bought this game for her grandson and saw how bad it was. How can you sue them for the game when YOU BOUGHT IT FOR HIM! Why even have the rating labels on games if parents aren't going to pay attention to it anyway?  Rockstar should not have succumed to the pressure and continued to sell the 1st edition.  Like another reviewer suggested, if you want this game, get the 1st edition, and not the censored 2nd edition one.While I really enjoyed GTA III.  I thought Vice City was very boring and after playing it for a couple of days, I got tired of it.  San Andreas is totally different.  It took a couple of plays to realy get into it, but now I can't put it down.  Rockstar has really outdone themselves this time. Your character, CJ can do almost anything.  You can buy all types of clothes down to different color bandanas and chains, go to the gym, get haircuts, tattos etc etc.Basically the story starts off when CJ returning from Liberty City, to bury his mother.  As soon as he gets back, he is stopped by some crooked cops and is basically forced back into a life of crime.  He meets up with his old friends and with them they start rebuilding their gang.  One of your first missions is spraying over rival gang graffiti with your own.All of the elements from the previous GTA games are back; carjacking, picking up prostitutes, beating up robbing people for no reason etc.  But also this time around there is so much more you can do.  First of all you can go to the gym and make yourself stronger.  You start off pretty skinny, but after a while you are given the opportunity to go to the gym to build muscle and stamina.  In addition to this you can get haircuts to pretty much any style you want, you can get tattoes all over your body, you can buy clothes and change them as you like.  You can even go outside in nothing but underwear if you want.  The game gives you so much freedom is amazing.The voice overs are done amazing well.  MC Eiht is the voice of one of the main characters (Ryder) and he does a very good job.  Other notable voices in this game are Samuel L. Jackson, The Game, Ice T, and Charlie Murphy.  One of my favorite things is that this game has so much more varieties of music while driving.  As for me, growing up in the late 80's early 90's, a lot of these songs I remember playing in my own car crusing around with friends.  A couple of song's from Dr. Dre's Chronic are on there, as well as the soundtrack from Deep Cover with Dre and Snoop.  Tupac has a song as well as NWA.  include Cameo, Isley Brothers, Rick James, Slick Rick, James Brown, ths list goes on and on.  I don't even play my own CD's during the game, because there is such a wide variety of music.The graphics are pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  During the cut scenes you will see alot of pointed edges and the animation is sub par.  However this does not take away from the game at all, the game is so fun to me, that I don't even pay attention to the graphics all that much.  They are just good enough to keep you involved, and don't distract you at all.  While walking down the streets of San Andreas you will feel that you are actually there.  The scenary seems lifelike and the styles change depending on what part of the city you are in. The game even went so far to add the famous \"HOLLYWOOD\" sign in the hills.  Although it does not say \"HOLLYWOOD\".  Also the Watts Towers are in the game as well. The people you encounter as you are walking also change depending on where you are. If you are downtown, you will see a lot of people in business suits.One of the downsides about the graphics is that its easy to get stuck in very weird areas and not able to get out.  I recall I went to a club and jumped behind the counter where the bartender was.  I ended up on top of the bar and couldn't get down.  I finally had to turn the game off.  I don't know if its because I enabled the \"Hot Coffee\" cheat, but that was pretty frustrating to say the least.Another complaint is that it can be very cumbersome to shoot people especially when performing drivebys.  There is just so much stuff you have to do to aim, you will find your hands fumbliing all over the place.  Hopefully I'll get used to it as time passes.One of the coolest parts of the game is just interacting with the various characters in the game.  People are always walking down the street talking to each other and even to you sometimes.  Outside your own home people are always hanging out with the occasional prostitute or bum walking by.  Go to the wrong hood, and you will get shot at by rival gangs, if you are driving and stop, they will pull you out of your car and beat you up and/or kill you.  I found myself in redneck country one afternoon and saw people driving tractors in the road.  I even got in a fight with a couple of hillbillies because I hit their car with a pool stick.  To top it all off, a cop in a cowboy hat got out of his Ford Bronco cop car and started shooting at me.  While I enjoy the missions as well, the freedom to do anything you want is probably the most enjoyable part of the game.After being dissapointed with Vice City, I didn't expect to like this game very much, but I plesantly suprised.  It is very addictive, and I rarely even play my other XBOX games anymore.  It is a very fun game but IS NOT FOR KIDS.  There is a lot of cursing for one thing; every four letter word is said in this game, something I never even heard in a game before.  I have a small child, so I only play this game if he's not home or has gone to bed for the night.  This is the first game that I honestly can't play around my son. Like my title suggests, GTA III is nothing compared to San Andreas, but its still a very good game for mature ADULTS.For the parents who complain about their kids playing this game, I have one simple solution.  DON'T BUY IT FOR YOUR KIDS! DUH!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2006"}

The graphics r really good for the psp and the sound is excellent. The music is really good and it is fun to listen to. To unlock the other cars u need to beat story mode with one person and beat the challenges at regular battles. Each time u beat the story mode u unlock a new video for each charecter. After u beat it with every charecter it is fun to go back and just do regular battles. However if u play it for a long time it does get boring so i stoped playing it for about a year and now i love it again. It is sometimes hard on regular battle but i usually win each time. Each place has hidden things to shoot down or hiddden tunnels in it so u can expand the battlefeild. This is my favorite game for the psp.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2009"}

It's become so complex,that it even goes against it's own storyline.(WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD)To start with,when is this game taking place?Is it after soul reaver 2?Playing through Raziel's walkthrough,I would say yes.Because he awakes in the underworld after being consumed by the reaver.But then why is Kain trying to break into the Sarafan stronghold in the begining of this game?He was already IN the stronghold with Raziel.There are even bigger mess ups as the game progresses.Janos Audren is perhaps the biggest mistake in the LOK timeline.I understand that he was killed by Sarafan Raziel before the events in Blood Omen 1,and he is resurected by Raziel with the Heart of Darkness in this game.But between those two time periodsthere was Blood Omen 2,to which Janos appeared perfectly alive and well.Again,how is that possible?The other deal is with Moebious.In blood omen 1,Kain beheaded Moebious in a village.So I understand Kain and Raziel went back in time,and that's how they speak with him in this game.But at the end of this game,Kain impales him with the reaver.So if Kain killed Moebious in the past,then how can he be alive for Blood Omen 1 to be beheaded?This legacy never even bothered to explain how Vorador magically came back to life in blood omen 2,after being executed in blood omen 1.The problems with these kinds of stories involving time travel,is that they end up tripping over their own histories.I also never really understood how Raziel is Hylden;it just sort of threw that out there on a whim.The whole Hylden/alien race seems kind of dumb to me;they belong more in a sci-fi story than one about vampires.The game itself is extremely fun,the graphics are beautiful and the voice acting is superb.But unfortunatly,they've just dragged this story out too far for too long;and now it's starting to collapse on itself.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2003"}

I got one preowned for $40 so at that price I think it was a good value, but at the regular retail of $100 or more I think it would be a let down.When first booting up Kinect Adventures it is immediately impressive what you can do it is not until playing with two people for an extended period of time you experience its shortcomings.I am playing at 6/7 fee away from the Kinect and per the calibration I have placed the sensor a little low but don't feel like reorganizing my entire entertainment center to accommodate a gaming accessory I use occasionally. I feel the space requirements are unrealistic and too specific.The tracking two people at once while jumping ducking running and dancing is kind of buggy. Often while playing Kinect Adventures one person will get lost by kinect and than have to try an relocate them which is fine at first but gets annoying after a while. I also have Dance Central 3 which is the best dance game out when it works. It feels like the arm movements are very accurate but the leg movements seem to be hit or miss. The menus are terrible to try an navigate just using Kinect so it requires a controller which kind of defeats the purpose of a Kinect only game. I also have Forza Horizon which allows you to voice control you GPS system and responds to a few voice commands and that works really well for me. You don't need to yell at it just speak and my sensor responds which is cool.Overall I feel happy with my purchase of Kinect at $40 I would not recommend a full retail purchase though there is just not enough content and value to warrant it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2012"}

But it requires to use some thinking, and it punishes any mistakes. In certain respects it is easier then Demon's Souls (gear costs less, for example, 50 souls for a fire bomb comparative with 300, and easier to grind, the first boss is super-easy and goes down much faster comparative to Phalanx), but it is also harder. A cheater's bow strategy is eliminated, it seems ;)My advice: run to the merchant and buy a spear. It is so much easier then a sword. You can hit while holding block, you know. With a spear you won't have any problems with ordinary enemies.Buy fire bombs, they are super-cheap.Also buy a bow with arrows. All these pesky guys throwing bombs from roofs - two-three shots and they are history. Arrows now are also cheap as dirt.If you are like me, a melee fighter, when fighting demon on a bridge run towards him, as close as possible. Then it is rolling and hitting, till he goes down. Or climb up, jump down on his head hitting him while falling, and then again roll and hit, roll and hit.

{"product_name":"B0050SYZS0","description":"","reviewerName":"Patrick","summary":"Now that the ending is fixed the game is great","reviewText":"This was very well done game and with the new Ending my biggest issues with it are gone.  Many improvements over the first 2 and its Bioware's best shooter to date.I cant give it 5 stars becuase you need to spend $10 or purchase an $80( more now if you can find it)collectors edition for DLC that has a sizable impact on the story. To really enjoy this game you need it. The case for the Collectors edition was a disaster. I had to spend 5 minutes trying to carefully get the discs out of the case without breaking them. Then trim the plastic insert with nail clippers so I could put them back in and they still stick. I keep my discs in 2 old dvd cases since they are so hard to get out of the case.Gameplay: Bioware made some welcome improvements to the game play. The annoying mini games are gone the weapons are better and upgradeable. The powers are more polished than they were in ME2. As a shooter goes this is Biowares best one to date. It is significantly more challenging than the first 2 games. My only issue with game play was the cover system was touchy at times.Kinect: I purchased one specifically for this game and it was not as grand as I thought. There is a delay when in combat and about a third of the time I had to say commands twice or more. It is sorta fun and makes combat slightly better when it works. If you don't own one already I wouldn't buy it just for this game.  It also picks up all the sounds in your play area so if you have alot going on in a room you will annoy players in multiplayer who can hear it.The story was good and my choices from both other games had an impact on it. You also had some tough emotional decisions to make along the way. I was a bit disappointed with how many of the characters from ME2 were simply footnotes in this game. The games graphics are falling a bit behind but they are not terrible.Multiplayer:  Bioware has lowered the war asset requirements so you no longer need to play it to get the best endings.  The multiplayer is fun and with three levels of challenge most players will find alot of enjoyment from it.  It does lock up at times and some people quit early which means you will have wasted your time.  The random money and character unlock sytem can be frustrating trying to open the weapons and characters you want.  As a whole I say its 4/5 due to lag and at least one lock up per day.  You also have to deal with people who play too agressively or unsporting alot of the time.Bioware redeemed itself by adressing its ending and adding closure to the game.  Its not a perfect game however it is definitely a very solid game and worth buying.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"An epic Final Fantasy masterpiece!","reviewText":"Having finally finished this game, I can say with certainty that Final Fantasy XIII is among the finest games to carry the Final Fantasy title.  This is being said despite the \"controversial\" changes that were made to the formula.  The gaming press and the gaming community at large had a field day talking about the lack of towns to explore, the lack of NPC interaction and the linear nature of the game.  Let me tell you that in this game, the setup works and it works well.In Final Fantasy XIII, the story is front and center the entire time.  I would say that this is definitely the most story-centered Final Fantasy game ever made.  You control your characters through the game world, fighting enemies along the way, until you reach a waypoint which usually triggers a cutscene.  However, the story in this game is REALLY good!  It's surprisingly deep, and it does require you to keep up with it as there's so much back story, but it's brilliant.  The characters undergo significant growth throughout the story, and those that you're not particularly fond of at the start become incredibly likeable by the game's epic finale.  To describe the plot in this review would take up quite a bit of space since there are so many aspects to it, but it's up there with the plots of Final Fantasy VI, VII and X.  There's a lot of jargon thrown around, especially at the start of the game, but it's all explained as the story progresses.  There's also a datalog containing short and very insightful recaps of the story, the characters, locales and deities.The battle system is simply a triumph here.  You control one character and the computer AI controls the other two.  You queue up attacks, spells, abilities on your ATB gauge and they'll execute in that order.  There's no MP as each character takes on specific role (Commando, Ravager, Medic, Sentinel, Saboteur and Synergist) with specific abilities.  For example, a Commando can't use magic, so they have a variety of physical attacks.  A Medic only uses healing spells.  A Synergist uses spells such as Protect and Haste, etc.  You set up what are called Paradigms, which are different combinations of roles for the three characters in your active party.  During battle, you Paradigm Shift as needed to win the battle.  You may start out with a Paradigm consisting of two Ravagers and a Commando, but as your HP runs low you shift to one with two Medics and a Sentinel, then back whenever you're all healed up.  This leads to some truly fantastic and fast-paced battles as everything is going on all at once.  It's thrilling!  You get a Game Over if your party leader dies (regardless of the state of the other two), so it's important to keep him or her well healed!Leveling up your characters has been very streamlined.  After killing enemies, you're given CP or Crystogen Points.  You can access the Crystarium from the main menu, and this is where you beef up your characters.  Similar to the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X, you spend your CP to activate crystals along a path for each Role.  Crystals to activate are Strength, Magic, HP or Abilities (such as Fire, Cure, etc.), ending in a Role Level crystal.  The game only allows you to go so far in the Crystarium, and won't let you continue until you expand it by finishing certain portions of the game.  This keeps level grinding to a minimum, as you can \"max out\" before any major encounters.The game's pacing is a subject of severe scrutiny by most people.  I'll say it now, this game is very linear.  The path you're supposed to take more often than not a straight and narrow one.  When you begin, battles are very simple.  You don't gain the ability to Paradigm Shift until chapter 3!  But as you progress, the game adds more layers and depth to the battles, so they end up being quite a challenge later on.  After about 25 hours, the game opens up and allows you to choose which characters you want in your party, and it opens up side missions (these are similar to the Hunts in Final Fantasy XII).  While all this may sound a little TOO linear, as I mentioned before it works perfectly in this game.  You can finish the main story in about 50-60 hours, but after you beat the last boss you obtain one final Crystarium expansion, and you're free to finish the 64 side missions in the game and level your characters up to very maximum.  This should add at least 20 more hours if not more.  And yes, there are no towns in the traditional sense, so all shopping and upgrading is done at save points.Finally, let me say that Final Fantasy XIII is just GORGEOUS!  It's easily the best-looking RPG I've ever seen.  Running at a native 1080p on the PS3, it's truly a sight to behold.  Also, the game performs incredibly well, with a very constant framerate and no loading times during play.  If you buy the game on Xbox 360, the game comes on three discs with disc swapping necessary only after Chapter 4 and Chapter 9.  The voice acting is top-notch and the detail in the cutscenes is astounding.If you have even the slightest interest in Final Fantasy XIII, I'd say to give it a go.  As I said, the game's linear pacing and extended tutorial sections all work well despite how they sound.  You have to play it to believe it.  The story and characters are simply among the best in Final Fantasy and cannot be missed.  Truly epic!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2010"}

Hoover \"chicagojosh\"","summary":"From Someone Who Didn't Like Online Play","reviewText":"Before CoD4, I really wasn't someone who enjoyed playing games online. Being schooled in the art of the Deathmatch by 13 year olds wasn't exactly my idea of a good time. Still, when the multiplayer demo for this game hit Xbox Live, I went ahead and put my trial Gold membership to use and gave it a go-around. I'm incredibly glad I did.Yes, the single player campaign is short. On the other hand, it's by far one of the best single player FPS experiences I've had in a long time. The varied gameplay will keep you hooked through the entire campaign. Of course, there's less campaign to keep you hooked, but it's a matter of quality vs quantity for me.Please Note: as has been stated previously, you're paying $60 for a multiplayer game. Playing the demo really did convince me that it would be money well spent. I enjoy the fact that, in non-ranked matches, you can level up even if you aren't exactly a top tier FPS veteran. While bonuses are given when you do well, nothing is taken away when you do poorly - you simply receive less xp. This was a big deal for me, as part of the draw for the multiplayer component is the slew of unlockable content that is level dependent.While damage regeneration is a factor, it isn't overpowering. The ease at which even a moderate player can take down an opponent more than makes up for this.FOR LEFT-HANDED GAMERS: I have a modded controller, which has both the thumbsticks and underlying buttons flipped. Because of this, I don't know whether or not the thumbstick buttons can be flipped along with the movement and aim controls. What I can say, is that the use of A,B,X, and Y haven't been an issue for me. I've logged enough hours to say that I've never felt the button mappings were a hindrance to gameplay (*cough* Gears of War *cough* *cough*)This game made me want to get an Xbox Live Gold subscription (I've also started to play Team Fortress 2 to make myself feel like I'm spending the money more wisely.) It's definitely one of the top games to hit the 360, and a must for anyone who doesn't mind ponying up a little extra cash per month for a sweet sweet multiplayer experience.Oh, and one more thing, if you're not in a clan, and you get put on a non-clan team against a clan based team, you should take a few deep breaths right before the match starts; you're about to get your butt handed to you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2007"}

Of all the FF games I've played, this is the only one which has succesfully made me doze off while holding my controller.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2006"}
{"product_name":"B002EE5ROO","description":"Set several years after the events of the first game in the series,Dead Rising 2contains all the fun and over-the top carnage which gamers associate with a zombie apocalypse. As with all releases in theDead Risingseries, it is a survival horror game. Players take on the role of an all-new character, with equally new motivations to survive and resources to do so. These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode, an optional prologue to the game available as downloadable content and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"Better, but more of the same...","reviewText":"Dead Rising 2 gives you more of what the first game was all about. There has been a zombie outbreak and you have to wait three days until help arrives, rescuing survivors, staying alive, and defeating those who have gone mad in the chaos, while getting uncovering the truth of what really happened to cause this. While Dead Rising 2 does improve on a lot of things, ultimately, this is the same exact game as the first one.STORY/PREMISEAs explained above, there has been a Zombie Outbreak, only this time, instead of being in the small town mall of Willamette, Colorado, it's in the Las Vegas area locale of Fortune City, an entertainment resort. Here is where Chuck Greene, our protagonist, competes in a Pay Per View, zombie-killing motorbike show titled Terror is Reality. The Willamette zombies have all been gathered here to be killed, and a zombie rights group called CURE have been protesting the show. Someone, however, has set off a bomb, causing the thousands of housed zombies to break free. Many die, but many more escape, including Chuck and his young daughter, Katey. Chuck, famous for his Pay Per View prowess, but respected by few, is framed for the terrorist act, and now has the time until the military arrives to clear his name, with the help of CURE activist and leader Stacey Forscythe and super-sexy hotshot reporter Rebecca Chang. For those who have played the first game, the plot and events play out exactly the same way, even though this is a new story in a new town.GAMEPLAYLuckily, the gameplay has been made a lot easier over the first game, which to be honest, I was not a big fan of. The first game was way too difficult and was impossible to complete the first time around, because in the Dead Rising series, you have to level up, to make yourself stronger throughout the game. However, you only have to do this once, as subsequent playthroughs will permanently keep your enhanced skills, and abilities. In One, it was almost impossible to get to the truth without nearing maxing out your skills, first. However, refreshingly, in DR2, you do not have to keep playing until you're strong enough to take on the real story.In the three days you have until help arrives, you can rescue survivors and take them back to your safe house, and take out dangerous people who have gone insane in the zombie madness. However, the A-Story is finding out the truth behind the outbreak, and in this game, who set you up. Everything has a time limit and more than one thing are often going on all at once, meaning time management is crucial in this game. It takes real dilligence and commitment to try to save everyone AND get to the bottom of things in the time you're given. They say in life \"you can't save everyone and do everything,\" but in this game, that is the ultimate goal.In DR2, things are a lot easier (in the first game, you actually had to be extremely profient and schedule things PERFECTLY in order to save every single person and complete the story). I think part of the reason things are easier is because the in-game time moves slower in this one. It's still the same timeframe, but because it doesn't go in real time, you have to go by the game's simulated time. (I believe the time ratio is 1 to 12, meaning 5 minutes in real life is an hour in the game, and two hours in real life is an entire day.) In the first one, the clock moved a lot faster than it does in this one, so a slower clock means things are slightly easier and you have more real time to rescue survivors, take out psychopaths, and do the real missions. However, the area you're now in is also a lot larger than before. It is a whole entertainment resort. And as it was before, it is impossible to actually run in the game. Your character merely walks fast. So overall, the slower game clock means things are a bit easier then the were before, which means less frustration and more time to actually get things done.One added new featured mission to the game is keeping your daughter alive, as Katey Greene has been infected before the Fortune City incident and needs a medication called Zombrex everyday between 7 and 8am to keep from turning. (Without giving away spoilers, this is also why good guy Chuck competes in zombie killing derbys; Zombrex is expensive and katey needs it daily.) Of course, during the chaos of the zombie outbreak, Zombrex is hard to find and there are looters all around Fortune City. You'll have to somehow find Katey her medicine and make sure you give it to her, between 7 and 8. The game makes this a challenge, but it's never too frustrating. You can do specific missions and gain the drug off of hard-to-kill psychopaths. Luckily, the game also gives you options to buy it off of looters. (For the crazy price of $25,000 for just one dosage!) If you have to, you may need to sacrifice some survivors and just spend half the day breaking slot machines and ATMs to raise the funds needed. Also fortunate that money in this game is infinite, albeit hard to collect.DR2 also gives you the bonus game, the Pay Per View show Chuck Greene competes in, Terror is Reality, where you have to use your motorcycle to kill as many zombies as possible and get the highest score.WEAPONS & ITEMSIn the Dead Rising series, everything move-able can be used as an improvised weapon, whether it be true melee weapons, like knives and bats, or furnishure, toys, food boxes, drink bottles, playing cards, jewelry, potted plants, or firearms. Each thing in the world has it's own damage rating, as well as method your character attacks with. Heavier items like sludge hammers obviously do more damage and last longer before breaking, but are slower and harder to attack with. In DR2, you now actually get the ability to combine objects to create newer, stronger, deadlier improvised weapons. For example, taking a wooden baseball bat and a box of nails gives you a spiked bat, taking a broom handle and a knife blade gives you an improvised scythe, and taking a whiskey bottle and a rolled-up newspaper gives you a molotov cocktail. And although they were made out to be really cool in some trailers of the game, they're really not that big a deal. Most of the items you'll need to combine aren't that easy to find and although they work much better and do more damage, don't last that much longer than regular objects.Besides the new improvised super-weapons, you'll still have food, beverages, alcohol, and mixed drinks to keep in your inventory. Mixed drinks are like the beverage and alcohol version of improvised super-weapons in that combining two of them will give your character temporary heightened abilities. Such as combining two caffeniated drinks will make you really hyper and boost your walking speed. Mixed drinks also existed in the first game. Some mixed drinks, however, can make your character sick, causing him to often throw up controllably. So can some uncooked foods, rotten food, and alcohol. Regardless, all of these can still fill up your health, so while not preferable, they still have their uses.The inventory use system STILL remains a very annoying issue. In the Dead Rising series, all itmes you keep, including weapons and health items, are all kept within the same inventory. And when one item is used up or discarded, it automatically switches over to the next item. And there is no way to organize things in your inventory. So AS before, you'll often find yourself accidentally using things you didn't intend to, because of this, such as the game switching you over to a food item and you accidentally eating it, because your weapon just broke. It really remains an annoying problem.Another annoying thing is the food/drink animations. They still take way too long to play through before the actual health restore kicks in, they're STILL completely, 100% un-interruptable, and they STILl will get you killed in a dangerous boss battle because of this. If you can't picture this, try to imagine being down to your last two bars of health, against a really fast, really dangerous enemy, and having to wait for Chuck to drink the entire bottle of beer (about three to four seconds) and for that animation of him doing it to completely play through, before it actually heals him. THEN imagine the enemy attacking you, interrupting it, while you still have low health and trying to do it again, only for the really fast enemy to attack you again. Yeah, it's REAL annoying!Oh, and you also get more vehicles to drive in this game, as Chuck Greene is an aging motorcross star, after all.PSYCHOPATHS & SURVIVORSOkay, one of the big things you'll be doing (or not) is rescuing people in the zombie madness. In the original, this was extra annoying as the survivors were complete dummies who'd rather stand around and get swarmed by 20 zombies than simply follow you and you had to practally beg them to follow you and not get killed. On top of which, their health was really low. The survivors in this have better AI and are improved as when you run for safety, they always follow you and don't stand around like idiots as zombie bait. Many of them also come equipped with weapons (survivor weapons never break, even if you hand them a nearly used-up one) and much less of them ask you to do stupid favors for them just so you'll save their life, like feed them lunch. The ones who do, do it for sensible reasons, like an over-tanned who's dehyrdated and needs something to drink in order to keep moving. Some are annoying in which, they won't give up their weapon, no matter what, so that you can feed them and restore their health. And many of them also are more opposite than the first game's in where, instead of being too cowardly, they are too brave and may often rush out into a zombie mob to start killing instead of laying low and letting you handle the dirty work so that they won't die. Although I can't say for sure, I think the survivors actually have difference AI's in this game and act diffrently than others. In DR1, they all acted the same, no matter their personalities, and were all cowardly, weak, and stupid, making rescuing them needlessly frustrating. So it's refeshing that you now won't have to worry about them so much and that they are much more self relant.As for the psychopaths, they are also different. In the original, you would often stumble across them by mistake and would have no choice but to fight them, despite being unprepared, or in low health. You couldn't leave the battle. Plus, they were a LOT of them! Here, there are far fewer psychopaths and the ones you do face are much more dangerous and a lot faster, but now, you can actually retreat the battle without worrying about getting the hostage killed or losing the misison. If the battle is too tough, you can just retreat and come back later, when you're better prepared. Plus, all damage you do to them remains throughout. This is also a sigh of relief. Of course, as stated, they are still quite a challenge, and even the fat ones move with unusually high speed and grace. Most boss fights are near-impossible to win until Chuck gets the Dodge ability. Without it, he is slow and easily hurt to the fast-moving bosses. This is easily and above all else the most important and useful fight skill you'll learn in this game.Also, either Chuck is a short man, no taller than 5'8\", or ALL of the psychopaths are just really really big. You can almost always tell who is a psychopath based on their relative size to everyone else, before you fight them. Some are normal sized or short, like the dilligent psychopath postman, but most are big and easy to recognize. Even the sexy Bailey twins are at least 6'1\" and really powerful, compared to the relatively tiny Chuck. (It kind of reminds me of Super Punch-Out for the NES.) And like I said, what's weird is, they're not only huge, but REALLY speedy and agile, as well. Most, like before, carry really lethal super weapons. What's good is, like before, you get to keep these weapons after the fight is over and they tend to last a long time and not break very easily. Plus, they regenerate after you use them up, meaning you can keep using them, although you can only hold one at a time in most cases.OVERALLDead Rising 2 is a good game, and much better and less frustrating than the first. However, the one thing that really hurts this game is how similar it is to the first. Even the plot plays out exactly the same way. Had this been released two years or less from the first game, this would have been forgivable. However, this is a game that is almost FIVE years down the line from the first one. Overall, the improvements made in the game don't change the fact that this still plays very very similarly to the original. If you have played the first game and enjoyed it, then this will be more of what you liked and then some, and the feelings of the over four year wait will vary between individuals.However, if you played the first game and didn't love it, then you might not want to play this, as it's pretty much, the same stuff, with new bells and whistles on it. And those new things don't make the overall game new and fresh, but rather, improves on what's already there. So I guess it all depends on how much change you like in a game. Those who prefer very little change and enjoyed the original will like this, too.Those who have never played Dead Rising before may want to rent this one and not buy it. Just know you'll be dealing with time limits, challenges, and struggles throughout. The killing zombies in this game (the main focus) is actually secondary as the zombies are literally infinite. But if you're up to the challenge and like time trials and killin' zombies in as many creative ways as possible, it's worth a playthrough. Just can't recommend buying it without being a big fan of the first one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2011"}

Anderson \"Flying Gamer\"","summary":"WARNING:  Seriously flawed for completionists...","reviewText":"My experience with Rage started out very well.  I was very impressed by the graphics and immersive environments the game creates.  Everything will be ugly after playing this.  Playing Black Ops reminded me of what it was like to go back to playing an original Xbox game after experiencing the Xbox 360 for the first time.  The graphics in other games now seem so... simple.  The Xbox 360 hardware has a hard time keeping up with this visual feast, and graphical detail draw-in is pronounced in the more complex levels (Dead City comes to mind).  The game's pretty face goes much farther than being just a pretty face.  Id has put an incredible amount of time and effort into this game and it shows.  Clever Easter Eggs abound, and the ambiance the game creates is second to none (although others argue it's derivative, which at times, it is).  So why the three-star rating?  Two critical design flaws that will make you want to throw your Xbox out the window.  The lack of auto-save and the inability to backtrack to closed off areas.  These seem like minor complaints until they screw you over, and believe me, they will.  First, the auto-save problem.  Initially I thought it was just a minor inconvenience to have to save the game every few minutes, but at around eight hours in I became complacent and managed to go through an entire level without saving.  At the very end of the level, as I was leaving, I became \"stuck\" in the ground.  My character then fell through the floor to his death, giving me the joy of re-playing the entire level.  The only safe way to play this game is to have the discipline of an auto-save feature.  Meaning after every battle, after clearing each area, you need to pause the game and physically save it.  It is beyond my comprehension why a FPS in 2011 was built with this feature omitted.  My second complaint will apply to the completionists out there.  There are things that you need to collect along the way that will bring the game to 100% complete.  These things are VERY easy to miss, even if you scour the landscape, and will become closed off to you with little or no warning.  I was foolish enough to start playing this game without this knowledge and spent several hours wasting time looking for the hidden cards in the game.  After dredging my way through every level and backtracking in an attempt to find missing items, I got sick of searching and referenced an on-line guide.  Low and behold, the card that I was missing was locked away in the Outrigger Outpost, an area that becomes closed off to you in the first hour or two of gameplay.  Since the achievements require everything to be completed in a single playthrough, my entire playthrough was a waste.  Around eleven hours...  I had to take a step back and think about this when it occurred to me.  In 2011, in an already over-saturated FPS marketplace, id puts out a game that (it seems) is designed to infuriate you.  I understand that id is the grandfather of first-person shooters.  I get it.  If it weren't for Doom back in 1993, maybe none of us would be here.  Much respect.  Maybe I deserved to be taught a lesson by their game.  But here's the problem.  I already have a laundry list of games that I'm trying to get through.  With plenty more coming out this holiday season, I've got my hands full.  It's not 1993 anymore, and id is not the only thing going on anymore.  So, instead of starting the whole miserable process of another playthrough, I asked myself, \"why bother?\"  I decided it wasn't worth the effort.  If id can't evolve, why should it be my problem?  I've already suffered enough with this game.  That said, if you are planning to get the most out of this game, I would urge you to start from the beginning with the use of a strategy guide.  If you're just looking for a weekend distraction or a quick run-through, don't worry about the closed off areas and add another star to my review score.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2011"}

You start out in one city on the continent of Vvardenfell play for 20 or so hours and you begin to realize that you have covered exact four tiny squares on the map.  And the more you wander, the more you find.  Eventually you decide you want to get on with it, but it gradually becomes clear that you aren't quite sure what 'it' is.  You break down, by the guide, and you finally realize that Morrowind and its subgames are inconceivably huge.There are hundreds of cities, dungeons, fortresses, monsters, and NPCs.  All with individual stories.  And the only way you have any hope of finding all of them is to wander forever or buy the guide.  The guide provides heavily annotated maps, and descriptions of all the major and minor quests.  Various hints, and even discussions about what to do in Morrowind between tasks (go out and kill a few diseased crabs).  Even with all 400 pages, I doubt that the guide covers much more than half the possibilities.  The scouring of Vvardenfell could take years of play.Even with everything that is in the guide, there is yet more that I would like to have seen.  In particular, indexes and where found guides.  I guess the publishers decided that anything more than 400 pages would scare away the average buyer.  Seriously, though, a guide is almost a necessity if you want to get full values from the game without dedicating your life to it.  It is well written and organized.  I would have preferred better quality printing but not at the price it likely would have cost.  If you get a chance pick it up, it will greatly increase your appreciation of the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0002B90SA","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Good Universe, A Few Flaws","reviewText":"Talk about a long title! The full name of this game is Star Wars - Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords. As you might guess, it's a game based on an early Star Wars timeline.We're about 4 thousand years before the events in the Star Wars movie series, when the sith (bad force users) and jedi (good force users) are battling it out for control. This game is 5 years after the first KOTOR game. You are of course one of these force users, choosing between good and evil. Much as in Fable, your choices affect the way you look - and the way your friends look as well.You begin by customizing your character. You can be male or female, and choose from being force based, saber based, or a balanced type of character. As you move through the game, you get pieces to build a light saber, increase your skills, build out the plot, and make choices that have sometimes unintended consequences.I enjoy the KOTOR series because, since it's so far in the past, you don't start with a preconceived notion of what \"should\" happen. You have the fun universe of Star Wars to enjoy, but without the extremely well defined plotline.The graphics are quite good - you have translucent objects, sparks and smoke from damaged items, and good detail on robots. The sound plays themes that are fully traditional Star Wars, with matching sounds for doors, robots, and other items.If you enjoyed the gameplay of KOTOR, you'll enjoy KOTOR II as it's pretty much exactly the same. In fact because of the plot progression I highly recommend playing KOTOR first, before buying and playing this one. That will fill you in on the characters and situations, many of which play a role in this sequel.That being said, I don't think KOTOR II is nearly as rich as the original. KOTOR gave you a great sense of accomplishment as you moved through the missions, and a sense of completion when you reached the end. If anything, KOTOR II seems more of a 'transition' to rush you along to a spot from which you can buy KOTOR III. I had the exact same issue with Halo II, so maybe it is a common failing.

Not that that's a bad thing. All the features that make up a classic Megaman game are here - 8 robot bosses, weapons gained from each, a Rush with a couple of adaptations (jet, coil, submarine) along with a couple of other things (Balloon and Wire adapter, which must be found/searched for as opposed to being rewarded after defeating a Master) and a final confrontation with several different giant robots. My personal favorites are Pharaoh Man and Skull Man.A couple of new features are introduced here - Flip Top Eddie who appears at certain points in some levels yo give you random energy boosts, and the fact that you could turbo-charge Megaman's shots by holding down the fire button. These features definitely add to the gameplay.The bad guy in this one is Dr. Cossack, and his castle looks distinctly Russian (very reminiscent of the gorgeous palace at Red Square in Russia with its minarets and domed roofs) but the near-ending of this game reveals a surprise twist. Okay - to some, it isn't much of a surprise, but I shan't spoil it for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2010"}

Toad wants to test everyone and see who can be the super star and thus the game that destroys friendships begin. The original Mario Party is known for its difficulty in terms of mini games as the controllers back in the day were either unresponsive or some were just way too hard and required luck. I might even add that some mini games like the tug-o-war required you to twirl your controller to the point that it might even break or hurt your hand. Yeah some of the mini-games are brutal. On the plus side, there are some memorable mini games where you had to work together to win the game and personally we didn't see that until Mario Party 9 with the boss battle.The game overall had the most nostalgic feel and introducing the character's personalities through the stages. This game kind of set up Peach's obsession with cake and Luigi being the gadgeteer of the two brothers. The music for the stage is very cute especially in Rainbow Castle. I love how whoever gets 4th place gets the butt monkey treatment and attacked by the stage while 1st player achieves the mission needed.Overall, a good start for the series, but good luck finding this game. This game never reached the virtual console because of the controls so its a rare find in any trade in store without it being at extremely high prices.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2013"}

After having played the series quite a bit, we decided to go back and play the original to see how it's held up.It's intriguing to wonder if back in 2009 the creators of the original Drake's game realized that they would have such a popular series on their hands. It's tempting to think that they did. The characters, right from the beginning, grab at you. Drake is like a young Indiana Jones. Sully is like Sam on Burn Notice - older, wiser, a great back-up. Then there's Elena who has got intelligence and spunk.The movie mixes in cut-scenes and action, with jungles, puzzles, action sequences and exploration. The humor is laugh out loud funny.Certainly it's easy to say that game makers have progressed since this came out. They have improved how they handle graphics, movement, and enemies. But the basics are all solid here. A variety of weapons, intriguing characters to interact with, collectibles to find, and a fun storyline. You actually grow to care for these characters, with their quirks and foibles. Which is great, of course, since you get more stories in the future to continue the path with them and learn how their lives progress.If you somehow played the games out of order I highly recommend that you go back and play this first one to see where it all began. If somehow you haven't seen the series at all, then absolutely I recommend you start here. Get to know how it all began with Drake, Sully, and Elena. And know that once you begin to form that relationship with them, you're in for a treat, because the subsequent games are quite fun as well.Are there any down sides here? If you hate action-adventure style games where you're jumping over platforms and wall-climbing through dense jungles, then you probably won't like this. It is like Indiana Jones come to life. This isn't a farmville game or a tetris style puzzle. It does involve three-dimensional thinking and accurate button pushing.But if you're a fan of this style of action game, I highly recommend it.We purchased Uncharted - Drake's Fortune with our own funds in order to do this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2012"}

Wake is able to sleep again, but after he meets a mysterious woman, he begins to have terrible nightmares. As he puts these nightmares on paper for a new book, he soon notices that all the things that happen in his book are coming true right before his eyes.Using cinematic effects and technology such as real-time lighting, shadows and reflections, you'll be treated to a game that is oozing with atmosphere and able to invoke an emotional response from the player.

It's an ocean.","reviewText":"Alan Wake looked fantastic for the past couple of years, but with all the delays I wasn't sure if it was ever actually going to be released. However, I am extremely glad that the delays didn't spoil the game with overproduction.It is quite interesting to use light-based weapons in conjunction with normal weapons, and here the game succeeds, because the controls are very simple, even though you can do quite a lot with them. As someone else said, you point the flashlight at something, and it becomes your targeting reticule. Very cool.The story is...confusing. You think you know what's going on, and then you find something out, but then it turns out not to be true...or is it? Who's lying? You don't really know. I spent a great deal of the time trying to figure out what was real and what wasn't. Because even about halfway through the game when you start to gain allies who believe how crazy things are getting, you wonder if maybe it isn't a dream. Anyways, it's a psychological game, not as dark as Max Payne, but in the same vein.Basically though, it comes down to this: The game works. It is emotionally engaging, the characters feel real and believable, so we care about them and what happens to them. I'm sure more will be cleared up with downloadable content, and the ending is open enough to leave room for a sequel. The game doesn't take too long to complete...I started it last night and only played for about an hour, and then knocked out the rest in about six hours. And this is really the only drawback, and the reason it gets 4 stars and not five. Well, two reasons. There isn't a whole lot of replay value in this game. The tension and horror in the story comes from the unknown of it all, playing it again knowing where the scares are (Yes, there are some) and knowing where the story is going before the reveal would probably make it fairly boring. The second reason is the enemies. A lot of the game takes place in various forest setting and, to this end, the concentration of enemies in the forest is rather high, and it gets to be fairly repetitive. Luckily though, with the various light-based weapons the game manages to stay quite fun for a first playthrough.Based on the relatively short game length and low replay value, I would honestly recommend most people rent this game. With a suggestion like that, I had to ask myself, does it even deserve 4 stars? But yeah, I still think it does. I forgive the game for being short because, quite honestly, the game doesn't BS around. Your character does what he needs to do, period. And I prefer that style to that of doing pointless filler missions to try to bulk up on the length of gameplay. You certainly won't find yourself thinking \"Come on! Get to to it already!\" If anything this game suffers a little from a lack of revelation. But being a psychological/horror game, you don't really expect characters to stand around monologuing all damn day.One last word, and this is for people who have played it. The game is divided into six chapters, and at the end of every chapter, there is an intermission (with the option to skip it). The very first song played is \"In Dreams\" by Roy Orbison. Ughhhh, so awesome. I thought maybe they'd use that song for every intermission, but no. It's five different songs. And my gripe is about the other four after In Dreams. They all seem to really hit you over the head with simple lyrics and straightforward ideas. Turned out making it feel kinda hokie. But whatever, the songs are short and you can skip them anyways.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX7BQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Erik Massie","summary":"Unique and one of a kind...","reviewText":"A little backstory about this game for myself, I've been eagerly anticipating this game since before it was publicly announced at E3 in 2012.  It's been the #1 game on my \"most wanted\" list for that entire time, and was/is, what I feel, the last game capable of dethroning Bioshock: Infinite for my personal GOTY for 2013.  Needless to say, there was plenty of hype, and excitement in the months, days, and hours leading up to release day.  And after I completed it (took me about 10.5 hours), I debated for an entire day about how many stars I should rank this, and came to the decision that it was worth the 5 stars, for it truly is one of the most unique and touching games I've ever played.That's not to say Beyond: Two Souls is without its flaws though.  There are a few of those, a couple which really bug me.  I will say the story/plot does have some glaring holes in it (something I feel should have been cleared up/answered personally), and whether those are intentional or not, who knows, but they leave the game feeling sort of \"incomplete\" for me.  Second, I'm still not sure I agree with the way David Cage and the team at Quantic Dream decided to tell/go through the narrative.  I mean it makes sense near the end once you learn why, but still, I didn't find it gave the best delivery of the story...I think a rearranging/fine tuning of the order of scenes you play would have made a huge difference.  I mean, I'm fine with using flashbacks and going through different time phases, but the way the game did it, it just felt all over the place and somewhat disorganized.I also just want to say, that unlike Heavy Rain, your choices in this game don't seem as important...at least not til the very end. That too left me a little disappointed...with all the talk of 20 or so different endings (not sure if that really is the exact number), what difference does it make if none of the choices until the very end matter with any of those?  I think the team should have taken a step back and put in more critical plot points/decision making in different parts of the game that would have affected the outcome (the beginning, middle, etc).But why keep focusing on the negatives of the games?  Afterall, I'm still ranking this as 5 stars.  Why you ask?  Because honestly, this still ranks as one of the best gaming experiences I've had in a long long time.  You really create a connection with the characters in this game, especially Jodie (obviously).  I ended up really caring for her, and her emotional state...and in fact, in every scene, I really just wanted to protect and keep her safe, and not because it helps me \"get to the end of the level\" but because I truly wanted to protect her and keep her safe because I really cared about her.  Her story is heartbreaking at times, and you can't help but root for her, trying to help her out in anyway possible that's presented to you.I also thought the control scheme here was much improved upon from Heavy Rain.  The controls feel much more natural (thank you for allowing us to use the left stick to move around/walk), and the method they developed of using the right stick to push to the nearest orb on screen is pure genius (hope to see it in their future games).  I thought the switching between Jodie and Aiden was done really well too.  Playing as Aiden is really original and fun, and you end up forming a connection with him as well.Overall, you won't find very many games that create this emotional touch that this game has.  The level of detail in this game is just amazing.  I just loved walking around exploring areas (with Jodie AND Aiden) and by the time I got to the end of the game, I was  so deeply invested in the characters and story (even with it's flaws) that I found myself wishing, heck, BEGGING, for this game not to end.  And you know what?  The great thing about this game is you can go back play it again and get a different experience from the one you got originally (though not as much as advertised I feel), and that right there is pretty amazing in of itself, much like this game.  If you own a PS3, I think it's safe to say the purchase and playing of this game should be mandatory.  There's nothing else like it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2013"}

Another issue are the lack of game on the new map packs.  The most popular game types from premium are easy to find, but games like CTF and maps from the Armored Kill pack are harder to find.  EA wanted to give the reins of the gaming experience to the players, through custom server rentals, but the reality is that there really aren't any dedicated EA servers for the new map packs.Many player servers recycle through the vanilla maps and Premium ones, but EA should have done more to give players who payed for Premium, better ways to experience more maps with more players.  But again, that's to encourage players to rent a server.Aside from that issue, BF fans who want to go Premium should go no further than this edition of the game.  4 of 5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2013"}

I'm not a game programmer and I'm not a professional gamer, but I have played many hundreds of games, on DOS, 3.1, 2000, XP, Vista, Win7, Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Sega, Sega Genesis, Xbox, Xbox 360, PS2, PSP, PS3... Not every platform in history, but certainly most of them, and like I said, many by quantity over the last 15 years. I'm a big fan of FPS, TPS and RTS games in particular, with occasional RPG fixations.Never in my gaming days have I seen a game as absolutely gorgeous, expansive, stunning, detailed, and for lack of a better term, artistically articulate, than Assassins Creed II. The first game certainly had all the right stuff, and was instantly on my best-ever list (comprised of Return to Castle Wolfenstein, FarCry, HalfLife2, Supreme Commander & expansion, Bioshock, Assassins Creed and Assassins Creed II).  While I still adore all of the other games on my best-ever list, ACII really just blows all of the others away in terms of the breathtaking, stunning, and perfectly-rendered environments. You are treated to a trip to Renaissance Europe. You will traverse, in every nook & cranny, several entire cities, developed in a scale and level of detail and artistically-refined rendering that is, to my knowledge, completely and totally unprecedented in gaming.It's still \"just a game\" but the scope of the environment and the attention to detail in which it is rendered makes it literally an order of magnitude greater than any other. The scale will be similar to a \"big\" RPG like NWN, Guild Wars, or the like, but the level of detail, the BEAUTY of the environments gets in to every tiny nook and cranny, every corner, every alley. It is truly astonishing to behold. You may spend half a year playing this game daily and still not see every corner & secret of the immense cities presented here.You CAN NOT be disappointed by this game; so take that as a categorical assertion. If you happen to especially enjoy the style of gameplay (e.g., you liked/loved Assassins Creed), be prepared to have a kind of epiphany, a catharsis. I am still absolutely in awe of this game. I purchased Xbox Live simply to download the DLC for the game. Yes... it is absolutely stunning and beautiful. Buy a copy today. Pay whatever you have to pay.

And honestly, my first impression was \"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?!?\" I couldn't comprehend why people thought this simple, cutesy jump-fest was very fun. After all, I had to look at computer screen tutorials in every level. There was a level that taught me how to RUN. &lt;yawn> What a bother. The game went on my shelf, and there it stood for months, while I slogged through plenty of other dreck on the system.Finally, upon my return from vacation, I decided to give the game another try. And instead of playing the story levels, I went online.And I was blown away.There were thousands upon thousands of online levels, and the strange part was, they were FUN! I was sure that user-created stuff would be a tremendous bore, but here I was, playing level after level after level. One day passed. Five days passed. And after that, I was addicted.But, this was the online stuff. The story levels were still boring, right? Well, as it turns out, after you get through the initial tutorials, the game provides amazing platform action, with plenty of bosses, secrets, challenges, and the like. Initial instincts are often sound, but even an experienced gamer like me can miss the boat. But anyway:The Good:- This game is fun. There's no two ways about it. Yes, it can be a bit cutesy, but if someone is too serious about their gaming to play this, they need to lighten up.- The challenge is there. Try to find all of the items without cheating. You can do it, but you'll be working for a while. Try to get through every story level without dying. It's been a while since I've felt a game was this rewarding.- Variety. After playing through 8 worlds in game, go for a spin online and see literally hundreds of thousands of well-thought-out levels. LBP's heart system allows you to skip the losers, and get right to the great levels.- This game is a blast in multiplayer mode. Up to four people can play together, either from controllers at home, or via LBP's online community. And there are ALWAYS people online (I've never seen less than 10,000, and there are often 100,000 during peak times).- The trophies, for once, are well-thought-out and fun. I have mixed feelings about the trophy system in general, but this one gets it right.The Bad:- The camera. It can be incredibly annoying at times, particularly when you are trying to ace some of the difficult levels. Someone complained that you feel dizzy at times, and I can understand the criticism.- The control can be frustrating. LBP allows the player to move along three different levels within each platform. The computer will often pull you into one of the levels automatically, which was be incredibly annoying when you are trying to pull off a tricky jump or land in a precise location.Neither of these are deal breakers, but it would be nice to see them fixed in the next incarnation.That's about it. I am sorry I missed so many months of solid platform action, but I can't recommend this highly enough. Sony was known for taking chances in the past with their games, and with this one, they scored a home run. Here's hoping that more solid exclusives like this find their way to the beleaguered system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2009"}

Suhr \"naraku junior\"","summary":"A classic preuqel to a classic game","reviewText":"I remember playing this game growinhgup  when I was inbetween the age of 5 and 13 I rented this for about a week. I only got to the Pirahnha Plnat boss. I though along with Super Metrioid in was on of the harder Super Nintendo games to master. If you were a novice at mario like I was. Here are  boss statics and startegies froma speed run on you tube recently posted. This was done use tool assitance like slowly the game speed down and like saving possibly more frequentylu than normal. The real game may take you longer or more than about 103 minutes or less to complete excluding the credits. But here are some startegties for most of the boss battles. I may have left out one battle before  baby Boswer when you might have to fight the evil Kopa Magican that kidnapped bady Lugi and  appears in ever boss stage making the enemies bigger most of the time. IF you don't want this assitance than close the website and find out on your own I only have about 9 minutes until my class. Yoshi Island Sattics. first boss enlarge has 1/6  damage resitance against egg shot attaacks.Next boss shot with and egg until it splits up enough to the poin that the enlarge yoke is destroy this guy I think shout multiple eggs at the same times the exact damagage resitance is not clear because he does it so fast.The Next boss is and enlarged boo using magic the evil minion of Baby bowser enlarge it. Hit him with five eggs each hit he will expand after the fifth eggs hits he will explouded and be reduce to endoplasimic goy d one in the box we be fast he be slow! (A alternation of a quote from ghostbuster 2\"Four forth boss it is simple all you got to due is push the  jar of the edge by applying more pressure than the shy  guys that are try to push it back from the center of the platform. This was a toll assited run some you maye have to do it more than once in the real game with out enhancements to defetas this boss but that is the general method for defeating this boss.  27 minutes into this video will continue after second appoint ment with Jannet gets done around 2 because next appoint is not until 2:45 its only about 2 to  15 minute walk or run.  Going to play yugio don't think I can beat the arcade ninja turtles in under 15 minutes yet not good enough at dogging and countering yet.For the fifth boss the frog instead of making the frogg bigger the evil Koopa that captured baby Lugi and failed to get mario shrinky uo the frog swallows you. You must go inside while doggin the dijest juice hit the gage relexflex with six jumbo size eggs it will flash when hit the boss is defeated you are pulled down the and come out of his but. You will grow to your original size and the frog will be standing there back side up like a beached turtle. Got to go sending the next boss which I think is the enlarge Pirahan plant later. Total damage resitance 1/6 for the frog not sure for the egg  yoke boss was done to quickly. This game is slowed down in parts and saving is done more than usually due to reduce speed and auto or save more often  emulator code.  About 35 minutes into the video minus about 17 to 45 seconds of rewatching.This guy super cheat at the pirhan plant boss taking it down befor it grow to  about size of a full grown naudrey II maybe large. I think he used a push a button to drain energy cheat kind of like the drain boss health with vital which they had on the megaman collection cheats up until the cheats were created four number five or six than they did away with it. Here the really way to beat the Pirahan plant if I remember correctly it grows bigger tries to attack you there is like a sticker with like and X down near the bown of the plant near its root. You got to shot the egg of the wall and across the water at certain angel  you due it right it will hit and plant will flash I think about 2 - 10 time you have to repeat this process with out loosing baby mario. I higly recommend get the starts they increase counnt down time if you are hit so you can rescue baby mario before he is grabbed and taken away you have to repeat from last stage over again until you get through the whole stage with out baby mario getting capturing they also give you a higer point score for the stage you can use your points to by two items per area if you get a certain score.. I belive the max time he can stay of before being captured is about 30 second unless there is a cheat to increase that.  I am about 53/103 the way done with I am past the Pirhana plant the next ball is some kind of dust ball or something like that.  To defeat the this bost ground pound it six time each time it will break up into smalller dust ball after six time it is defeated you have three stage to go before the next boss.  The player is  about to enter the next boss castle. I am getting of in about 2 to 5  minutes  so I am going to fastfoward to the boss then I am going quick email my best friend. Which is a giant turtle.  Hit it with 4 egg and another four hits using those ground pund attack this boss goes down. I am about 59/103 of the way done due to fast forward about four minutes  plus about 2 minutes to watch the boss fight maybe less.  To beat the slug it it has 1/10 ressitance against  hit it ten times it will exploud.  I am now 65 minutes into this  due to 6 minutes of fastfowarding because I only had about 12 to 25 minutes to class started. To defeat the enlarged raven that you fight on the moon hit with three ground pound attack these will send sock waves through the moon or bring up some short of post that will hit it it has a weak 1/3 damage resitance do this move correctly three times it goes down.  75/103 about done with this will post other statistics later.  This boss has 0 percent resitance dfeat him the same way you defeated the first Koopa kids in super marion on. Break enough of  block with out you falling in the Lava will do in this giant porcupine like boss. I am now 84/103 done with this speed run the static will probably be posted withing the next 11 hour 58 minuntes maybe less.  I have three minutes to get to the next boss mninus ten to wait in the loby so I wont me marked trady.  The final boss fight with bowser  has 1/10 damaga resitancte ground pounbd three times when  kid bowser is small it will send a shock wavd due it correctly it will hit he will flash them his wizard maske him grow bibbger than hit him  with 7  bigger eggs froma distanc ehwild doging the flying builders the destroy the platform hit him 7 times there mwill be the explosion effected  he will shrink and take off them you free baby Lugio and the stork and congrulations you have just beat Super Mario world II Yooshi's island.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2007"}

Newberry \"agent_47\"","summary":"Horde Mode Blows My Mind!!!!","reviewText":"Well the SP mode has its peaks and valleys , where some parts of it are great and some are'nt so good. There's too many linear vehicle missions and simple 'walk through' missions where all you do is run through the entire level. But once you get to level just after defeating the reever and you have to defend Jacinto, the game takes on a new life of hectic action. But all of the single player elements pale in comparison to the AWESOME Horde mode. Do yourself a favor and try this mode by yourself offline on insane difficulty and you'll be treated to some of the best gametime you've had in just about all of your gaming life. Yes its that good. There's ever increasing levels of waves of enemies who increasingly try to outflank you and supress your position . Then once you get the feel for Horde mode go online and hook up with a couple players and take care of business. I'll admit I was at first very dissapointed with Gears2 in the SP , up until I got to Jacinto. But where the meat and potatoes of Gears2 is the online mode Horde. Love It!! By far one of the best modes of the year. If you can get to level 10 by yourself on Insane mode in Horde offline with bots ,your my frikken hero. Is the SP really that bad? Ehh ,there's some crummy vehicle flying,driving missions on rails, SNOOZE,but there are some moments of eye candy ,the game does look good,and like I said earlier its really kool once you get to Jacinto and you have to assault into the sinkhole. But I can clearly see EPIC spent allot of there time developing the co-op and multiplayer horde modes. Don;t get me wrong the SP is good ,just not great . What's Great ? Horde Mode all the way baby! Plus those of you who don't have online LIVE access can play all of the multiplayer maps against bots , just like Terrorist Hunt in RSV. Definitley a well polished gaming experience.The only downside to Horde is sometimes it takes awhile to find a match , on average I wait 5-20 min for a match , BUT , Horde is such an awesome game mode I'd gladly wait 20min.  Just ONE Horde Match I played recently lasted 3 1/2 hours!!! Holy Moly almost four hours for just one match , we made it all the way to level 41 before we finally got taken out. I cannot express how kool Horde mode is , it goes beyond the normal death matches as there's more of an emphasis on reviving your buddies and Horde tends to punish those who go out on their own witthout back-up.PLus the enemies flank with supreme agressiveness, if a enemy gets hit too much coming one way at you , you can see them change direction and eventually they'll be right behind you. What an awesome game! Buy it for Horde alone, its worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2008"}

As Well","reviewText":"If you've ever played Gears Of War some of the actions and controls in this game may seem familiar throughout the gameplay and even if you haven't as long as you have played third person shooters then you shouldn't have any problems with this one.  The basic premise of the game is that you're the commander of a special ops team trying to find out what has happen to a army unit and it's famous commander who disobeyed orders for what was supposed to be a seemingly humanitarian reason but may have been something far more insidious.  Throughout the game there will be situations that will question your morality as you must decide a certain action for yourself and your squad, some maybe be helpful others villainous but your choice is the final one.  The gameplay and effects as well as the scenery and soundtrack are incredible as the creators have made a eye appealing action game and the voice cast have also been picked well as you can hear the emotional stress as they face the situations and how close their breaking point is on sanity.  All I can say at the end though is while this is a great third person shooter game this isn't the usual heroes who come and try to save everyone the people who made the game seemed to try and factor in the real human psyche for what people might do in a possible situation like this and more then half the time people are not heroes.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2012"}

I understand why people didn't like the ending or just didn't expect it to end the way it did, but giving it one star is a little harsh.  Maybe 1 star for the ending, but 5 stars for the rest of the game would average to about 3 stars at best.  I loved this game all the way through.  The voice acting is still great, the graphics have been improved and the storytelling is very compelling.  They took out the hacking and bypass puzzles from the previous games.  Also taken out is the mining for raw materials from planets.  There aren't as many characters to choose from to go on missions as in previous installments.  As you progress through the game, you can see why.  In my opinion, this game should get game of the year.  It's still an epic journey from start to finish.

Boeshaar","summary":"Great game, but more of the same. Fun factor depends heavily on how your PC handles the game 2/21/11","reviewText":"NOTE: When the game first came out, it had a LOT more bugs/problems than it does now. Thankfully, Treyarch have been consistently releasing bug fixing and balancing patches. So the game has progressively improved for the most part.I have 2 main computers that I have tried running Black Ops on:1) My desktop, only a few months old and very powerful.2) My HP Laptop which is about 2.5 years old, but is pretty powerful for a laptop (I can run most new games, albeit at lower graphics)Both are ATI/Intel combinations.On PC #1: The game runs like a charm, very few issues after the patches which fixed some crashing/freezing issues (unacceptable to have this in a released game).On PC #2: Game is actually somewhat choppy, and this is a laptop that has run every single previous version of COD very smoothly including most recently Modern Warfare 2. This is basically the same unreal engine yet it has performance issues on my laptop, I have like a weird delay when playing sometimes. It's playable, but it's not comparable to the game on my Desktop, it's like two different games.PROS:- Very few games come close to how good the CoD multiplayer experience is.- Treyarch opted for dedicated servers, after the disaster hacker infested garbage IWnet of MW2 crashed and burned miserably. This means admins and kick/ban powers, a lot less cheaters on good servers.- Game has everything you'd expect from a COD game, but the maps are a bit smaller than MW2.- Single player is better than Modern Warfare 2, and the storyline makes a lot more sense and is a lot less like a horrible Michael Bay summer blockbuster.CONS:- Optimization sucks on certain PC specs, can ruin your gameplay experience and frustrate you to no end depending how bad it is.- It's more of the same, this is Modern Warfare based in the Cold War era. Same engine, killstreak mechanics, and fast paced shoot first or die.- If you are one of the no skill idiots who aimbots/wallhacks in MW2 because there are no admins, then you should stay away from this. First of all because you're a loser and you suck, second of all you'll be banned from all the good servers.CONCLUSION: Look, if you love COD/FPS multiplayer games chances are you will love this as well. And if you hated the previous CODs, same logic you probably won't like this.The LOW RATINGS you find here are a bit unfair, in the sense that the game is a LOT of fun if your computer can run it well.My advice? If you have a friend who has the game, borrow his/her steam account and try out the game on your rig. If you go through all that trouble and it works well, what are you waiting for? This is a big improvement over MW2 for PC gamers (a lot less hacker galore servers)RATING: On a bad PC 3/5 stars, but otherwise:4/5 Great game, but more of the same.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}

If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"J.

With the WaveBird Wireless Controller, you can play up to 100 hours on just two AA batteries.","reviewerName":"Scottypiper \"Scottypiper\"","summary":"The best wireless controllers I've ever used","reviewText":"I recently bought 2 of these controllers from some local video game retailers for pretty cheap ($14 for one, $17 for the other). Not sure why I didn't get any of these during the GameCube era but I'm glad I have some now. I have over 160 games and my daughter is just at the age where she can start playing some of them.Quality: Official Nintendo brand and the best I have used. Quality is higher than any 3rd party controller.Playability: Each Wavebird and receiver has a frequency wheel numbered from 1 to 16. You just have to match the controller frequency to the receiver frequency. With 16 frequencies you can easily use four Wavebird controllers and just set each one to a different frequency.Conclusion: I have been using wired controllers for the GameCube since 2002 and with these wireless Wavebirds, I don't notice any difference in lag than with wired controllers. Absolutely the best controller for the GameCube and it will also work on the Wii for GameCube games. Not having cords to deal with and not having to worry about someone tripping over the cords and either ripping the controller out of hand or knocking your GameCube or Wii over is well worth it. The range on these is amazing. I've used them at 15 feet without any problems and they probably go further than that. The controllers run on two AA batteries. I just use some rechargeables. If you still play GameCube games on the GameCube or Wii and you don't want to worry about cords, get some Wavebirds. You won't be disappointed.Update 01-04-12: I found a local seller for 2 more of these controllers. They were cheap so I jumped at the chance. I am now using 4 Wavebird controllers: 2 Platinum, 2 Grey. I had a lot of older kids over for my New Year's Eve party and they all had a blast playing the GameCube with these controllers. I set each controller and receiver to corresponding frequencies (I used 1, 4, 8, & 12) and used some rechargeable AA batteries. Everything worked perfect.

Unfortunately, the game let me down a bit, being nothing more than... &quot;good&quot;.As I told you before, the game has unbelievable graphics. Controls do take some time to learn, so they're not that good. The soundtrack is very good, but the voice acting feels a little weird for me since I can't understand what they're talking (I speak spanish, english and portuguese, but I don't speak any japanese, so...). Fortunately, the english subtitles help me a lot.I didn't get the game's story. Every place, every character and every situation is just so weird for me, I feel like I'm playing during an effect of some drug... I know it sounds crazy, but that's what the game is for me. Crazy doesn't mean bad, but since I don't get what's going on behind all that beautiful nonsense I see, it turns into a bad thing.But since I see that lots of people like it, maybe it was just me who thought this game was &quot;just good&quot;. I was playing this game in Easy mode, and even there I had some serious difficulties to continue the game in some parts, that's why I didn't beat it (I'm not the only one who complained about this game's high difficulty). But a good aspect from this game is that it has tons of extras. Extra levels, some texts and much more, you'll spend some time just as this game's extras.

{"product_name":"B00005AV8W","description":"A dark shadow is spreading over the N64. Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.In the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.The passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.Once the sun goes down, though, you should exercise extreme caution. When night falls, more creatures come out to play, and they become more aggressive as well. Some tasks are impossible to perform unless it is the correct time of day. A clock will allow players to calculate the time and plan their explorations accordingly.Konami has planted many cinematic sequences throughout the game. These scenes are surprisingly creepy, and may make you decide not to pick up your controller at night. Enemy characters are designed to terrify, ranging from the traditional horde of skeletons to half-woman, half-spider mutants. There are some gruesome bosses lurking in the darkness, as well. You will have to defeat Dracula in three different time periods, but don't expect the passage of time to improve his disposition.Reinhardt and Carrie will both have analog control, with different animation sequences for walking, jogging, and running. Reinhardt's whip works on a targeting system. When gruesome enemies are threatening, a green crosshair appears on the screen. If an enemy crawls, slithers, or slides within range of the whip, the target lets you know by turning red. The target automatically hovers over nearby enemies, so once it turns red you are guaranteed of a successful strike.Castlevaniahas 28 different areas to explore and four different special items at your disposal to fight the forces of evil. An eerie soundtrack tops off the package, creating a satisfying game that takes you on a unique adventure through spooky surroundings.","reviewerName":"Axel Law \"The Happy Seizure Kid\"","summary":"The beginning of a series","reviewText":"Castlevania.  No true gamer alive would hate this series.  I mean, seriously, who wouldn't want to go kill Dracula and play challenging platform missions?  Well, if you don't like that then you're gay, pure and simple.  In this first installment, we take a look at the very first game in the series---simply titled Castlevania respectively---that was released for the NES back in the late 1980s.  How does it measure up?THE GOODFirst off, let me say that these are some of the best graphics I've seen for the NES.  Very good for their time in my opinion.  Secondly, it's a FUN game and you can see where the roots all go back to in the series like Holy Water, the whip upgrades, etc. Practically every classic aspect about Castlevania is here!  The music is classic as well and has been remixed in subsequent entries (especially the infamous \"Vampire Killer\" theme).And since it's an old NES cart, what's that phrase again?  YES, this game was \"made back in the day when NES games were made to kick you in the [...] and make you love them.\"  I've used this quote time and time again and this one of the few NES games I feel VERY STRONGLY about when it comes to that phrase.  VERY difficult and to this day, I have not beaten it.  The levels are insanely hard and Dracula's even harder once you get to him.  You might think this as a \"bad thing,\" but I love a game that's insanely hard, so this aspect of Castlevania really enthralls me.THE BADI was put off by the lack of passwords, but given this is the first title in the series, I'm not going to rant on it for that.  I feel that since this is the first title in the series, I won't go overcritical on it LIKE SO MANY OF YOU HAVE.OVERALLThis is a definite must-own for your NES, ESPECIALLY if you love Castlevania.  Even with the sequels, this is still one of my favorites.  I think this game is overlooked because \"it's raw\" and/or \"It's too hard!\" (I'm noticing a pattern here, after my Mega Man review...)  BAH!  I'm a big Castlevania fan and I can honestly say that this game is still great after all these years.

All the while, he'll compete against a brutal rival from his past in a quest to capture the ultimate bounty, dead or alive.Gameplay emphasizes intense combat and physical action in the relentless pursuit of prey across six fantastic worlds and 18 levels. Jango Fett faces off against an onslaught of the worst scum in the universe, including crime lords, corrupt politicians, and enemies of various species. He is equipped with an arsenal of powerful weapons such as dual blaster pistols, a flamethrower, missiles, and a distinctive jet pack.","reviewerName":"Gadget junkie","summary":"four stars and two stars","reviewText":"This game was very disappointing.The graphics are great, and some of the animations are very good. I would like to finish the game to only find where the plot is going. The cut scenes are very...VERY well done.That is the good points.The game quickly turns into a bad Tomb Raider copy. Bad level design, horrible missions, and even worse main character design. Your first mission involves you losing your jet pack(???) and having to chase down a 'mark'. Upon chasing him, you will catch sight of him occasionally and he will round a corner and disappear or lock the door behind him or make a jump that will force you to go around and around a city jumping and climbing. You will get your jet pack back, which only lets the designers make even more frustratingly bad levels.The 'monsters' have a terrible AI routine running. It has them 'asleep' until you make them aware of your existence, or always knowing where you are and where you will come from. And..AND this game has a very annoying 'feature'. Kill the bad guys in front of you, now turn around and kill the ones behind you. Turn around again. There is even more there! Now, kill them off and turn around to kill the ones behind you. This just repeats. There is no logical place for them to be coming from, and to my knowledge the Star Wars universe does not have any teleporters.In conclusion, if you have not played any of the other newer/better shooters such as Splinter Cell, Spiderman, DMC1/2, Tenchu3 then this will be a great game. Especially for younger gamers. It is not for those of us brought up/beat the Tomb Raider series, nor got bit by the Indiana Jones game from a few years back that tried to be TR. So, the average rating is not completely wrong per se. So, for younger/less jaded gamers I would give this a *four*. For older gamers, I would give this a *two*.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00008QOL6","description":"When it comes to first-person shooters, there are two schools of thought. One harkens back to the originalDoom--frantic action, scary monsters, big weapons, and story is given short shrift. The second school is best exemplified byHalf-Life: strong narrative, consistent real-world weapons, consistent monsters, and settings.Doom'sheirs up until now have beenQuakeandSerious Sam, but nowPainkillercomes onto the scene leaving bloody footprints, and &#x85; let the carnage begin!You play a man who dies in a pathetic car crash (he's distracted because he's holding his girl's hand) and has spent a long time in purgatory. He thinks this is unfair because, despite being well-schooled in the art of killing, he maintains that he's done nothing wrong. Heaven makes a deal with him. Take care of a little invasion problem concerning Hell, and our hero can enter those pearly gates.Weak storyline aside,Painkillerbasically amounts to a brilliant series of arcade-style levels and challenges. The settings include darkened monasteries, graveyards, a horrifying asylum, a medieval town under siege, and even H-E-Double Hockey Sticks itself. The level design is brilliant, varied, and jam-packed with enemies. There seems to be no end to the amount and variety of cool monsters to fight, and they each explode into chunks of blood and gore in a most disturbingly satisfying manner. At the end of each level is a challenge, such as collecting a certain amount of gold or killing a Boss within a time limit. Winning the challenge gives you tarot cards you can use to make the game easier. The different cards bring haste, double-damage, invulnerability, and so on. This simple mechanic makes the game far more replayable than your average shooter.The graphics are first rate, which means you need a powerful PC to run the game with all the detail settings maxed out. The only other problem is a CD-copy protection bug that makes the game unplayable for some (a patch is available).Painkillermay seem a bit silly at first glance. But the gameplay mechanics, replayability (full multiplayer is also available), variety, and brilliant level design make it one of the finest and most satisfying shooters ever made. -Andrew S.

You are a photographer, and have been hired by Professor Oak to document Pokemon living in the wild. You ride through levels on a fixed track, snapping photos. You have a few items at your disposal to help spur the Pokemon into different actions, which racks up better photos and more points. The graphics are somewhat average, but the Pokemon animate well. Controls are easy to master.So yeah it's very different and very fun, but in the end much too short. You have six levels and a bonus seventh level (that really isn't much of a level), but you see less than half of the original 151 Pokemon. Getting better photos gives the game some replay value, but you can basically see everything in a weekend.

While not able to view the game at the level of detail or clarity that a top notch rig might; I should still be able to play the game.The game is fun, don't get me wrong. The little bit i've been able to play is great. The story is immersive, the cell phone is a neat tool and everything smacks of GTA, but better.However, the graphic rendering in the game is awful. The port job from the platforms was extremly poor and the game will not only stutter, but everything becomes invisible due to bugging in the waypoint system.  However, It is not as bad of a port job as Bully *gag*.  The waypoint system acts like a GPS navigational device which is great (when it works)  Sometimes setting waypoints or turning them off will cause the world to disapper and you will be driving through empty gray space ala Back to the Future.Another problem that has been mentioned is the need to be online to save games. Simply installing and registering for everything when first installing the game is a HUGE PAIN IN THE BUTT. I've registered my car online faster than it took me to sign up for all the junk I needed to play GTA IV.I'm sure folks like the multiplayer aspect of GTA IV, but i've never considered GTA series an online expierience. They should have made a MMORPG or stricly multi-player game out of the series rather than try to combine everything into one package. I dare to say most people buy GTAIV for the good story, fun gameplay and a little time to be by themselves and be a bad guy.Now here is the important question: Can you still play the game? Yes, you can..you can muddle through it, do little tricks to unfreeze the game by unpausing and pausing and turning off/on waypoints, but it's annoying. Annoying to pay 50 dollars and have to muddle through a game that has serious port flaws.With the combination of the bad port flaws by Rockstar Games with Bully and GTAIV I can safely say that I won't be picking up another Rockstar PC game in the future, until i've seen substantial dedication from the Rockstar studios to improve their ports back to the level they did during GTA: San Andreas (which still wasn't totally perfect).They have released a patch, but this hasn't fixed everything and the problems mentioned above are still there.If you do not own a computer that is high-end bought/made within the last 2 months I'd say skip this purchase or buy it on a console platform.  If you are willing to wade through the technical problems, then i'd wait a month or so and the price will drop significantly as PC gamers like myself will start to dump their copies for sale a lot cheaper than what you would pay full price for at the store.Pros:- Good storyline- Great voice acting- Very large world- Combat system is fun- Fun gameplay (when it works)Cons:- No Tutorial- Serious port problems to include:-- Graphics rendering-- Game stutters/freezes- Must be online to save game- Very painful registration process which you must go through if you want to save your games","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2008"}

Over the past year, they've taken the chance to release some fun, Mature-rated games on the Wii with House of the Dead: Overkill and MadWorld, and do so again with The Conduit: an FPS that may not revel in blood and gore, but is definitely not something that targets the usual kid-oriented Wii audience.  The Conduit tells the story of Agent Ford, who is at the center of an impending alien invasion.  Graphically speaking, you won't find a better looking FPS on the Wii.  There are times where the graphics engine really pushes the limits as to what the Wii is capable of, which doesn't always work out for the best (as graphical glitches are apparent), but where The Conduit really shines is the use it makes of the Wii's motion controls.  Tossing grenades and hitting with the butt of your weapon is all accomplished either using the nunchuk or Wii-mote, and it all works wonderfully to boot.  Other technical points, from voice acting (featuring Hercules himself Kevin Sorbo) to multiplayer modes, are all fine as well.  The single-player mode is pretty short, which in itself is disappointing, but still, this is definitely one of, if not the, best FPS' you'll find on the Wii.  All in all, if the Wii is your only console destination, The Conduit is definitely worth owning, but if you own any other of the FPS-saturated consoles, you won't find much here you haven't seen plenty of times before.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"Andrew Hamada","summary":"A very, very good start.","reviewText":"This review is necessarily split into two sections, each addressing the game differently.AS A DJ SIMULATION: a good start.  The game is quite good about replicating a ton of elements of real mixing, such as eq/fader effects, dynamic crossfading, etc.  There are a few notable areas where it makes some compromises, though.  The crossfader is pretty much the polar opposite of a feather fader, and it requires a ton of effort to move back and forth.  In-game, the crossfader plays are only 3 point recognition, not analog, a simplification that strikes me as necessary to make the game fun.The buttons being ON the record is an interesting idea (and necessary, in order leave a hand free for fader/fx), but because the scratching is always paired by holding down one of the three buttons, the simulation breaks down, as trying to scratch near the center of the record is awkward and pretty unrealistic.  The solution is to platter scratch, which is terrible, but one does what one must.  It also introduces a dynamic not found in real life: intricately (and rapidly) switching fingers mid-scratch, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.There are some obvious compromises that a lot of DJs seem to be griping about but I think make perfect sense.  The single turntable, for example: sure, it's less accurate (what exactly are you crossfading between...?) but the game needed to be MANAGEABLE to the average human being.  The platter doesn't move on its own, so you don't get the same sensation of fighting direct drive torque when scratching, but motorized parts = higher cost, more frequent breakdowns.I appreciate that the game's \"star power\" allows you to ignore the crossfader temporarily, which lets you concentrate on tooling around with the effects knob.  This pretty accurately recreates the idea of being a bad-ass in the zone, where the basic elements of the mix are handled so well that you can devote your time to the fun stuff.  I just wish there were more samples/stabs available more often.  Maybe the sequel could feature more Rock Band drum type freestyle sections.Despite the technical inaccuracies, the game does a very good job of simulating the excitement and power of club DJing.  I think anyone griping about the game's realism should play locate a copy of Beatmania in an arcade, then come back and heap praise on Activision.AS A VIDEO GAME:  The game is relatively forgiving and easy to get in to at lower difficulty levels, and the craziness ramps up rather quickly.  The higher difficulties still make sense (you don't get the GH3 sensation of \"those jerks did this just to screw with me\"), although expert is incredibly challenging.  The music is fantastic, and there's something for everybody.Even if you've played rhythm games before -- even if you've specifically played a DJ rhythm game before, e.g. Beatmania -- I think you'll find that DJ hero is a totally fresh addition to the genre.  It provides the departure from the \"guitar & rock\" formula the genre desperately needed.I can see more casual music gamers getting frustrated with DJ Hero quickly.  The mechanics of manipulating a crossfader are strange at first (although anyone with ANY mix experience will feel right at home), the multitude and variety of input styles with the scratch hand can be overwhelming.  One suggestion, especially for those who got into music games because they like guitar: start at lower difficulties, even if you don't feel like you need to, and work your way up.  The game's greatest learning curve difficulty comes from the fact that the mixes are new, and people without a lot of background listening to remixes and mashups may find the timing of a lot of the stabs, transitions, etc. bizarre.  Expect to play with your eyes for a little while.One last suggestion for newbies: when using the crossfader, resist the temptation to grip it between two fingers and wiggle it back and forth.  Instead, try holding your hand flat on the controller and putting the fader between your pointer and middle fingers.  When you move the fader, slide your fingers over, then move the \"inside\" finger back to center position (i.e. if you slide the fader to the left, move your pointer finger back to the middle position).  This way, your \"inside\" finger acts as a stopping guide when you move the fader back, and you avoid accidentally sending it too far.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2009"}

And I didn't needed because our little girl likes to play Eye Pet and for her to play it the camera needs to be UNDER the TV, because she plays on the floor and the camera would not see her if it was on top of the TV. So, briefely...You WILL need the clip and you will be happy you bought it IF you have a flat panel TV AND your Eye camera can't sit on top of it naturally. The Eye will actually sit quite comfortably on top of any TV for as long as it's flat because it happens to be bottom-heavy and therefore very stable.

You will not need one, of course, if you decided to place the camera under your TV.My advice, based on what I've experienced so far is: \"if possible, have the camera under your TV.

On top of that, there was a change in map style (which some people weren't used to) and multiple overpowered or underpowered weaponry. Some players also didn't like the shorter TTK (time to kill) and were of course not used to it. But needless to say, I am surprised that I am actually good at this game!Now anyway, 7 months, multiple patches, and 3 DLCs later, we have a game that is somewhat stable. I can say they have actually put in their time to try to fix their mistakes and bring back some fun gamemodes as well (Gun Game, Drop Zone, and a new one called Reinforce). There is also a smorgasbord of micro-DLC which include gun camoes, character skins, and extra weapon slots. Not that those matter, but the option is there. Almost everything bad that I remember about this game has been fixed (mostly the weapons and the dreaded IED)Why is this a good deal to get today? It has dropped to $22 for the standard edition on the Xbox 360! And the hardened edition for the Xbox One is now $57! *I can only recommend giving this game a try.

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Ronnie Gunter \"Yeshuaishope\"","summary":"Amazing Amazing Game","reviewText":"Once Again, Capcom has made another absolutly amazing Resident evil game.

Instead of basically putting a little new polish on an old title, Need for Speed: Undercover instead finds EA's long running street racing series reverting back to the days when the franchise was churning out tired and boring installments.  Undercover follows the same formula we've pretty much seen with Need for Speed: Most Wanted onward, only Undercover hardly has any of the charm, or fun factor, of that game, Carbon, or Prostreet.  The open world setup of the game just comes off as being a pointless feature considering there isn't too much that you can actually do in it.  Add to the fact that the city itself just bland, lifeless, and dull.  The racing itself isn't too bad though, although it won't take long to get repetitive and just come off as what you've played before in countless other Need for Speed games, albeit done much better and more exciting.  The game's soundtrack is decent and the cars look pretty alright as well, but in the end, the game is a sadly boring breeze.

{"product_name":"B00BGAA0SU","description":"","reviewerName":"Sreenadh","summary":"A Must Have (In-Depth Review)","reviewText":"Infamous: Second Son is a superhero game that purports to be about something deeper than blowing stuff up.Surely you've heard that Stan Lee classic: \"With great power comes great responsibility.\" That moral lesson has been focused on, deconstructed and returned to over and over in superhero comics since the 1960s. Meanwhile, superhero games have always leaned a little harder on just letting players have fun &#8212; all power, very little responsibility.Set seven years after the universe-altering events of Infamous 2, Second Son follows new protagonist Delsin Rowe. As a rebellious graffiti artist, Delsin lives to annoy his brother Reggie, a cop on the Pacific Northwest reservation where the two live as part of the fictional Okomish tribe.The first two Infamous games tried with mixed success to introduce more ramifications to their virtual superhero stories, and if anything, Second Son has even nobler goals in mind. While this semi-reboot still plays with the origin story trope of a hero coming to terms with the impact of his new abilities, it also toys with darker issues: the overwhelming nature of surveillance in modern society, trading freedom for security, society-wide fear of the unknown.These themes form an undercurrent to Infamous: Second Son that has strong potential, but they're underdeveloped in the main narrative. By the time credits roll, the game has undeniably chosen power over responsibility yet again. Because it backs down from its grand vision, Second Son may not hit as hard as it should have. But I was having so much fun blowing s*** up that I almost didn't notice.This relatively peaceful existence is brought to an end when Delsin is put in contact with a conduit &#8212; the Infamous universe's name for people with superpowers &#8212; and discovers he can siphon their abilities. This gift sets Delsin apart from previous protagonist Cole in an important way: Delsin gains entirely new powers as the game progresses, beyond the regular upgrade paths afforded by the game's leveling structure.While you'll use your powers to navigate the city, float through the air and search for hidden blast shards (which can be cashed in to upgrade powers), combat takes up the vast majority of time in Infamous: Second Son. There are some side missions, and the handful of boss battles often have a small gimmick to figure out, but all primary progress comes back to blasting bad guys. And it's a hell of a lot of fun to do so.Each power set in Second Son is kept small &#8212; so as to not overextend the control scheme &#8212; but with enough options to never feel constrained by your current choice of powers. And they all feel suitably different as well. Both smoke and neon have regular shots, but smoke shots hit harder, while neon rewards you for carefully aiming at specific body parts. Both sets have more powerful, limited-ammo shots, but smoke's is a rocket that causes massive area-of-effect damage, while neon's is a more directed sniper shot that has a sizable charge-up time to take into account.While I eventually settled on neon as my personal favorite of the game's options, I appreciated the variety and how well the game encouraged mixing things up from mission to mission. Between blast shard upgrades and narrative progression, I always felt like I was unlocking something new to mess around with.A big part of the draw of these powers comes from your ability to cause lasting destruction in Second Son's playground of virtual Seattle. You won't be taking down actual buildings or legitimate landmarks in the game, but Delsin finds himself up against the DUP (Department of Unified Protection), a government agency in charge of rounding up and jailing conduits. As part of locking down Seattle for their search, the DUP has built militarized checkpoints, makeshift headquarters and other imposing structures &#8212; blights on the beautifully rendered cityscape that are just begging to be knocked down.Let's say you approach an intersection with a checkpoint where DUP soldiers are checking civilians for the conduit gene with a special scanner. Two watchtowers stand on either side of the checkpoint, with a small bridge extending above it. A few feet ahead, there's a giant cage where \"suspicious\" individuals are being held.You could just rush in and start taking down individual agents with melee attacks or smoke shots. Or you could collapse the bridge, instantly knocking out the guard on top of it while taking out the scanner, buying yourself enough time to rip open the cage door so that you don't accidentally destroy it and hurt the innocent people inside in the ensuing shootout. The options are empowering, and no matter how much time passes in game, the cage will remain opened, the bridge will remain destroyed, and the scanner will be gone for good. Your surgical strikes against the DUP have a lasting impact.The best moments in the game are reserved for skillful use of your ultimate powers (or \"Karma Bombs,\" as they're known in-game). These abilities are charged by doing good or evil acts, depending on your alignment (we'll get to that system in a second). Once charged, you can unleash them at any point by tapping a single button ... at which point you can sit back and watch the chaos unfold. A single ultimate move can handily wipe out a whole battalion of enemies, likely taking out nearby structures as well. It feels incredible to launch into the air and smash down on enemies like a comet, leaving the area cleared out.Though the number of powers at my disposal keeps it moving, I wish that Second Son had more activities to offer. We're on a new generation of consoles, but Second Son's general structure is identical to its PlayStation 3 ancestors: a few different tiers of activities, side missions and main missions that virtually all culminate in the goal of beating up more soldiers or thugs. You can explore a little, finding more blast shards and the like, but there's not much in the game built to support any interesting experiments with powers and navigation. That lack of vision extends to the game's narrative as well.While Second Son does a great job of making your combat choices feeling meaningful and engaging, I can't say the same for the handful of story choices. At a few set moments as the game progresses, a cutscene will pause and you'll be given two choices presented as blue (heroic) or red (villainous).From the very first choice 20 minutes into the game, these are obvious, binary decisions of the least interesting variety. A few missions are locked off based on whether you've chosen a good or evil path, but in terms of story, it mainly dictates Delsin's overall tone. I had trouble feeling much connection to my choices when they were so cleanly split between being a decent human and an absolute monster.It felt like Sucker Punch could have done better here, because they do so much better elsewhere. Second Son's moment-to-moment writing is a giant leap over previous Infamous games. Delsin, Reggie, even the game's scenery-chewing villain are infinitely more likable than Cole and Zeke, the duo that led the first two games. And cutscenes feature some of the most impressive facial capture I've ever seen in a game, which makes the natural tension present in dialogue between the two on-edge brothers even more of a joy to listen to and watch.But just as the serious theme of life in post-9/11 America becomes a mere backdrop to Delsin's story, the moral choices in Infamous: Second Son seem like more of a burden than a boon &#8212; like something that the game is expected to have even if it doesn't add anything of value to the story Sucker Punch is trying to tell. As a character piece alone, Second Son delivers a well-developed arc that drew me in. As a full-blown narrative, it disappointed me.Conclusion:I struggled with feeling let down that Second Son isn't a brilliant shift for action games. My small disappointments come mostly as a result of undeveloped potential. It had a chance to be a superhero game about more serious issues as well as a showcase for the power of the new generation of consoles. Instead, Second Son is more of the Infamous I already loved last generation, prettier, with more powers and better writing. But Second Son still kept me excited to discover each new power set and happy to shoot fireballs at fascist thugs long into the night. Maybe it's not so bad to just let go of responsibility and blow stuff up once in a while.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2014"}

For example, prices fluctuate at the character store so that in one click a character might cost 2000 and later might cost 600. Overall, the game is a shameless port, and it's clear that Capcom did absolutely nothing to improve it for the PS2.At $20 as a greatest hit, it might have been recommendable simply because there is some fun to be had with all the characters and combinations. But considering that every seller is willing to gouge the price and rip people off, don't even bother. There are better fighters out there like Soul Calibur III or Tekken 5. If you hate 3D fighters, there are several 2D fighters for the PS2 that are excellent and cheaply priced to boot such as the Guilty Gear series or Capcom vs. SNK 2. Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is simply too outdated and too expensive for your money.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2006"}

{"product_name":"B001ASJISG","reviewerName":"Eric San Juan","summary":"Aims high but falls short","reviewText":"Prince of Persia has the standard jumping, acrobatics and Arabian flavor of past PoP games, but otherwise the game has no ties to previous incarnations of Prince. It's an attempt to breathe new life into the series. `Twas a noble enough attempt, with a pseudo-open world style courtesy of the Assassin's Creed engine and the strongest focus on characterization to date, but no amount of witty banter or half-hearted sandbox design can rescue the game from its monotonous gameplay.This is especially unfortunate because the platforming heart and soul of the game is quite fun. The controls have been criticized as too easy - the levels are almost never challenging and even when they are, it's literally impossible for your character to die - but that doesn't lessen the satisfaction you feel after completing a series of really cool looking jumps. The controls are so streamlined even a novice can be executing amazing sequences leaps, bounds and maneuvers without a second thought, while veterans will find the challenge of blazing through the levels at top speed an enjoyable experience. People have criticized the choice to have your partner, Elika, rescue you from every failed jump, but never having to see a loading screen was a fantastic design decision.Where the platforming falters is in variety. You'll see every almost variation on every obstacle only a short way into the game, and because they're so painfully easy - even without the \"can't fail\" aspect you'll rarely miss a jump - the action eventually becomes mindless. Once in a while it's invigorating, notably when the game makes you feel as if you have to rush (a timer would have added a great deal of excitement to some of these sequences), but rarely is it anything but more of the same.This issue is probably exacerbated by the game's pseudo-open world design. At the start of the game a small handful of levels are available. As you progress through the game you unlock access to more levels, all of which are interconnected in one seamlessly branching world. You choose which levels you do and in which order you do them. But the extent to which Prince of Persia presents players with an open world is deceiving. The environments are wide open and often lovely to see, but the openness is an illusion. The path through each level is always linear. The only choice is the order in which you tackle the levels - and since the levels are all but identical in style and difficulty, the choices don't really matter.The issue here isn't that the levels are bad - in fact, a lot of the sequences are pretty terrific - it's that there is little in the way of fun twists to keep the gameplay fresh. Previous games often incorporated puzzles to accomplish this. These served to break up the monotony of jump jump jump and forced players to engage their brain for a little while. Prince of Persia has all of four puzzles, two of them nearly identical and coming within thirty seconds of one another. That's too bad.Instead of puzzles to break things up between platforming, Ubi went with combat. And to say the combat is tedious would be an understatement. UbiSoft got lazy, forcing the player to confront the same four bosses (five if you count Elika's father) no less than five times each. Because some of the final battles are presented in multiple stages, you really end up in combat with some of these villains six or seven times. And it's always the same. Block, run through the same sequence of tired QuickTime events, throw a combo or Elika at them, rinse, repeat. Yawn.If all this sounds harsh it's probably because this is such a \"coulda been a contenda\" game. You've got to applaud the attempt at innovation by injecting an open world element, Ubi clearly did a lot of work to make these characters people you could like - though I question the decision to go make the Prince and Elika sound like a couple of American college kids trading coffee shop banter - and the much-criticized \"can't fail\" design system is really to the game's benefit. There is a lot to like here.At the end of the day, Prince of Persia is a game that aspires to be something a little different than what came before, and that is to be applauded. That it falls short of its potential thanks to repetitious gameplay is unfortunate.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2010"}

The presentation is unique and it was a plus for me.  Everything from the menus to the levels and characters has a very distinct look about them and I like the cutscene animations, too.The tutorial is a good level where you learn the basics and the first level I played through was pretty exciting.  Until the last portion of the first level where your boss tells you over your radio: \"get out of there, I don't care how, just get out of there\" To me this is an invitation to get a little creative and see what ways I can get off the building while you have cops storming the building and shooting you.  The catch is that there is only one way off that building.  You don't really have a choice or any alternate route, you have one jump to make to get off that building and that's it.  Oh, you'll die 20 times trying to make that jump, but once you realize that the game is essentially you running on rails and getting punished for it, it loses a lot of its charm.There is, at its heart, a great idea.  And I can imagine gameplay like this in Grand Theft Auto's world would be sweet (Niko and Johnny are both pretty clunky compared to Faith's smooth moves).  Its a shame the only way they could build up the challenge was to kill the player like its going out of style (if I want to die, I'd go play a multiplayer FPS).  Seriously, this game is a $50 version of Pitfall.  I'm sure whatever sequel comes along will address these issues and I have higher hopes for the future.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2009"}

I had reserved it two weeks prior but so did every other person so there was a line. I was a little shocked that an elderly grandmother was purchasing it for her 12 year old grandson. This game ain't for kids. There isn't a \"hot coffee\" mod yet but there's enough adult stuff going on in this game to well earn it's M rating. That being said now to the actual review.This is a fantastic game. The graphics aren't as sharp as say Gears of War but it's pretty close. The story is like an episode out of the Sopranos meets Eastern Promises. It's good for a gangster story and has surprising depth while playing through it. Some of the characters are a bit cliched though. The missions are of medium to hard difficulty. The harder missions involve driving which is the first gripe I've got with an otherwise perfect game. It's harder to make fast turns now and easier to flip over. When you're chasing somebody to complete a mission it gets a little frustrating. I like the targeting system in shootouts though there are times when it's not so easy to flow with taking out targets, the first Playboy X mission got complicated in this regard but all the missions are passible without using codes. Getting away from the cops seems difficult at first but after a few times it gets easier. I'm only about 7 hours into the game but after playing for a while you get better at driving for one and shooting. The soundtrack is pretty decent, though I would've omitted a few song selections, the entire electric radio station.This game lives up to the hype. It's different from the other GTA's in the series however not so different that you won't be able to pick up on it right away. It would've been nice to at least hear about some of the past characters in the GTA series. What happened to Cipriani and the Bistro, and the entire Leone family?

I have played the best with titles such as Grand Theft Auto Vice City, and I have played some of the worst like TOtal Recall.  However throughout all the games that I have played only one stands out as the number one game of all time.  That title is Final Fantasy 7.What makes Final Fantasy 7 so great, especially considering the past titles, the sequels, and other great titles such as Dragon Warrior Series, BReath of Fire, and so on.  It has a special something that few games really have.  Any game can draw you into a story, hell old NES titles such as Ninja Gaiden and Zelda could do that.  However what makes this so great is that it is one of the select few titles in the relm of video gmaes that can do something that no other games can, but I shall reveal that later.  LEts talk about the game.FInal Fantasy 7 starts off like an action movie might.  You control Cloud Strife, an ex-soldier (equivelent to the  NAvy Seals) who is now a mercenary for hire.  He is currently working for the terrorist organization known as Avalanche ran by Barrett, a big burly black man with a chaingun for a hand.  His second in command is a girl named Tifa who was a childhood friend of clouds.  After a few succesful missions cloud is seperated from the team where he meets up with a young girl named Aeris.  Little does cloud realize at first is that Aeris is beign pursued by the conglomerate Shinra (Shinra is what Avalanche is trying to bring down.).  CLoud decideds to help her out but when she is kidnapped he must rescue her.  MEanwhile a ghost from the past returns to not only haunt him, but destroy the world.This is the main focus of the first few hours.  The story itself will slowly evolve into something that if you show dedication to than you will be very satisfied when it is all said and done.  Now lets talk about some technical aspects.The graphics for the time are outstanding, however when compared to today it is proof of how dated graphics can get quickly.COntrols are fluent enough and the menues are asy to scroll through.COmbat is never really one sided however if you don't build up your levels (by the end of Disk one should be level 40 or higher for the whole party) you will be whipped.The music is what seperates this from most games.  The music is the pinacle of greatness here.  As I am writing this I am listening to Aeris Theme which is one of the greatest tracks in gaming history.  This alone seperates this from most gaems past and present.However there is one factor that seperates this from most games.  The secret to why this one of he best is that it is one of the few games that can touch you emotionally.  Any game can give you an adrenaline rush.  However it is very select few gaems that can touch you emotionally, and even make you cry.  Final Fantasy 7 has accomplished this.  THis is one of the select few titles that has ever done this.  To date the only other title to do this is the cult hit Ico.In conclusion Final Fantasy 7 is the greatest game of all time because it has an incredible story, incredibel music, and the fact that you will be sucked in if you give it time.  But that is the thing, you must give it time and dedication.  This is however the greatest game of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2003"}

It is nearly flawless in terms of design and gameplay. The story is virtually tightly-woven and will keep you entertained until the credits roll.Level design is probably the most interesting that I have seen in a game yet. Although there are dead-end points on each level, and sometimes you need to travel to these points, for the main missions the levels typically loop around a central \"safe\" area, so that if you leave that area in one direction, you'll return to it using a completely different path. This prevents a lot of backtracking and keeps things fresh.The enemy AI is typical for survival-horror. None of the enemies take cover, none of them really hide from you, they simply charge at you. This can sometimes be annoying in certain areas, especially when you are trapped in a room with quite a few of them during a quarantine sequence. I consider these spikes in difficulty (or \"mini-bosses\"), which can frustrate at times until you develop your own strategy for handling them. Completing these moments is fun and satisfying.The third person viewpoint works well for this game. You really get a sense of what is attacking your character.  The complete 360-degree movement of the camera around the character is amazing, allowing you to keep track of everything around you at all times. The camera, however, is not without its flaws: if you back into a corner, Isaac will virtually disappear, or you won't be able to pan the camera in the direction you need it most. This can lead to some very frustrating deaths.The lack of a HUD display is welcomed. You really become integrated with the character since everything you need to know is displayed on the back of the suit or on the weapon equipped. The inventory system is interesting. You can equip up to four weapons at a time, and switch quickly between them using the D-pad. Having certain weapons equipped determines what ammo pick-ups you'll find during the game. I especially enjoyed the fully-integrated store and safe, so that you could easily manage your inventory in one spot. However, although weapons were a button-click away from reloading, refilling the power to your \"stasis\" ability requires navigating into the inventory during play, while being attacked during battle. The number of button presses required to do that was simply annoying, and quite often took me \"out-of-the-game\", leading to some frustrating deaths.The upgrade system is interesting but tedious. Depending upon how you spend the cash you locate throughout the game, and how much you conserve ammo, you might be able to upgrade fairly quickly. Upgrading requires acquiring power nodes that are inserted into slots on an electrical schematic. It's slow and tedious, although most players will be able to upgrade the most important equipment by the end of the game.The game is quite immersive and will make you lose all track of time while you are playing. What seems like 5 minutes will turn into an hour, easily. The game has excellent atmosphere, and everthing comes together to make a nearly perfect virtual experience -- level design, textures, enemies (there are fast enemies that are really creepy!), sound, and music. The musical score is very similar to that found in the Alien/Aliens movies, and is very fitting to this game. Near the end of the game, it becomes less scary -- but still remains extremely tense and anxious.On the normal difficulty, expect to play between 15-20 hours. Ultimmately, it depends how cautious you are and whether you explore every possible area in the game. The achievements for the 360 are well-designed and should provide at least some replay value. Most gamers will probably play this title twice. Potential downloadable content -- in the form of suits and weapons -- could provide extended play in the future, but the game is not designed to support new maps.  With all of this in mind, this is a \"must-play\" game, not a \"must-own\" game.Dead Space simply must be experienced. Although not entirely ground-breaking, it is well-polished and entertaining. If you enjoyed Bioshock, you'll enjoy Dead Space.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2008"}

The gameplay is stunning, the story is excellent, the cutscenes are never too long, and yet at the same time it is still quite humorous.Now for all of the naysayers that are giving the game bad scores because of its content...if you don't like the subject matter, then don't play the game.  Would you agree that it is pretty tough to judge a game for its gameplay if all you can focus on is the content that you don't like?  The point of the GTA series is to be able to commit the most heinous acts of brutality and still be able to get away with it, but at the same time still be involved in a highly functional plot.  If you are offended by such things, then the game simply isn't for you.  This is a hijack/drive/shootfest that is developed around acts of violence that are taking place in the WORLD OF CRIME.  Organized Crime is VIOLENT!!!Now back to the game.  The graphics, for their time of release anyway, are functional.  Nothing is so poorly animated that it truly affects gameplay.  The variety of cars is quite nice, and no mission is truly impossible.  This, however, is not to say that the game is just a quickie.  It took me about 25 hours to reach 100% completion in the game; times may certainly vary.  The weapons selection is also quite good.  The standard flamethrower and rocket launcher are options, and there is the option to use more than one rapid fire weapon.The lack of a linear structure really enhances the game.  Playing the game is not simply doing mission after mission. The free-roaming capability allows the player to reorganize and customize the character, pre-plan the placement of cars in garages, and accomplish other little tasks that will enable 100% completion.  Also a player can snag a cop car and do vigilante missions, use a firetruck and put out fires around liberty city, and steal a taxi to make a little money.Of course...there is also the ability to cause trouble outside of missons.  The cops are extremely vicious in this game, but it isn't impossible to ourtun them...even at a 4 star level.  5 and 6 stars, without a tank, gets to be pretty difficult.  This part of the learning curve can be a little frustrating at times if you have an itchy trigger finger and a tendancy to \"accidentally\" run over pedestrians.Bottom line, the gameplay is great, the graphics work, the story also works, and the loose gameplay gives a bit of freedom to the player.  Ok...the game isn't perfect, but nonetheless it is definately entertaining.  At the price of about 10 dollarsm it is well worth the cost.  It's a good addition to any game collection and a great conversation piece for you and your gamer friends.Keep in mind though that this game is violent.  If you are concernad at all about younger kids playing this game, then you shouldin't get it.  Honestly, this is a violent game.  The whole thing about heinous acts of brutality is 100% true.  There is a reason why some world governments tried to snuff out this game upon its release.  The MATURE rating is there for a reason.  Violence, partial nudity, and prostitution do take place in the game...it is a piece for a mature audience.  If you think that you yourself or your kid can handle the content, then get the game, but be warned that this is a considerably violent game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2005"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GX88","description":"","reviewerName":"Mike","summary":"Awesome Gameplay","reviewText":"Got his for $19.99 with Prime. The gameplay, story, and graphics are sound overall. The gameplay gives you free range of a city, similar to a grand theft auto or Batman style game where you can climb buildings. The map is pretty large, and because you use power lines to travel, it really doesn't need to be much bigger. The game itself has a pretty solid story line with it. There are a ton of side missions, as well as user generated missions that were created for more gameplay. Not many games offer free extra content. Once connected to the internet, you can get a ton of extra side missions, which helps you level up and gain experience, and it makes game play longer. It has a nice mix when you fight creatures or humans, and you have a ton of cool different powers to use. I found myself playing for 3 to 4 hours at a shot without losing focus or boredom which happens to me often with other games. The graphics are pretty good, and the game never glitches or freezes up on me. Overall, because of the gameplay, and the fact that there is so much content out there for this game for free, I highly recommend this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2013"}

What brothers in arms brings that other games dont is its unit-command function. You place the command icon on a location, and the team you selected will move to that location. If you place it on an enemy, your order is to attack him. This really gives you controll of your squad.The graphics in the game are good, maybe even great. True, the textures are kinda blah but what makes this game impressive looking is the grass. The grass sways in the wind and reacts to explosions (not on the ps2, not enough processing power on the ps2 to do that) The character models are also incredibly detailed. They in no way look cartoony like in Call of Duty, instead it will remind you Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers.The sound is great. The guns sound great. To increase the realisim, there is no music during the game, only during the menues. When the music is there, it is good. The actual dialog spoken during the game can be kinda bad. The voicees during the battles are good, but in the beginning of the maps, they seem kinda flat. But overall its good.This game would be nothing without its unique gameplay. The FPS elements are done well, but the squad controll is the best part.Overall, Brothers in Arms, in my opinion, is the best WWII shooter to appear on the X-box. Get it before the war is over.Concept- Make the difinitve WWII FPS on the X-box and succedPresintation- 9.6 Box art is good, menues are good. It really takes you back to 1944.Graphics- 9.0- The textures could be better, but the foliage and character models look great. Some slowdown and skipped frames hurt a little, but not much.Sound- 9.2- Battle sounds and battle voicovers are good, actual dialog is hit or miss.Gameplay- 9.7- Great, Hits the ocasional hiccup, but is generally perfect.Entertainment- 9.6- Verry entertaining, only bad thing is it gets hard. Even on the easy difficulty. Even if you are a veteren FPS player like me, you will die alot.Replay Value- 9.4- Multiplayer only supports 4 players, but the battles seem bigger due to the fact that each person can controll 3 man AI squads.

{"product_name":"B0001ADAME","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyableReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"KT","summary":"Solid Western","reviewText":"First off, I think a lot of people are expecting Rockstar to keep putting out Grand Theft Auto every single time they release a game.  Not exactly fair, but that shows you just how good those games are.If you are looking for a solid western &quot;shoot em up&quot; game, then you should enjoy Red Dead Revolver.  You play (mainly) as Red, a quiet yet lethal gunfighter whose family was slaughtered in front of him.  Basically his father had married an Indian girl, and the rest of the white folk didn't like this too much.  So, Red sets out to avenge the deaths of his parents (sound familiar).You make your way through different &quot;scenes&quot; and encounter different characters, although none of them really stand out.  There is a lot of gunfighting, at times it seems even the most trivial little thing will lead to a battle.  The fights are strung together by little movie scenes that progress the storyline of the game.  As the game wore on, I found myself hitting the &quot;X&quot; button everytime a scene started to play out.  In other words, the story failed to keep my attention.The controls are somewhat awkward, as are the camera views/perspective.  You control which way Red is facing with the right analog stick and make him run in that direction with the left stick.  This can be tricky and sluggish; at times an enemy will be blowing you away from just a couple feet off, but you can't change Red's direction and position fast enough to kill him.  So you end up almost dying.  Also, gunfighting can be a pain due to the odd control scheme; this takes time to get wired and even then you will find yourself getting crazy since the controls are not intuitive.  That type of thing is frustrating but overall the game has more strong points than problems.  The graphics are pretty good, lots of gritty western backdrops, tumbleweeds, saloons, etc. The whole thing moves along pretty quickly as far as load times go.  You can buy different weapons and supplies throughout the game as well.Overall I would recommend this game.  50 bucks is too much but hey just my opinion.  The fact that there aren't any other western cowboy games on the market makes this one that much more appealing anyway.  If they worked on the storyline a little more and tightened up the controls this game would be significantly better.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000W5Y49G","description":"The Wii Zapper is a gun peripheral that allows the user to insert a Wii Remote and Nunchuk, both sold separately, into either end and play a compatible game. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. The Zapper comes withLink's Crossbow Training, which helps to familiarize the player with the Zapper in a shooting gallery style game.Link's Crossbow Trainingcontains three game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger.Features:Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are sold separately","reviewerName":"Not My Name \"M.L.\"","summary":"Pros and Cons of the Zapper...","reviewText":"I had been looking forward to getting this since i saw it at the Nintendo conference and it was everything i was hopeing for. Was even better when i found it comes with a game. Links Crossbow.Game: I enjoy the game, a lot people are saying they don't. It has multiple \"rounds\" where you do 3 shooting sessions. There are about 8 rounds i believe and some of the sessions include shooting targets that are moving down a waterfall, targets being carried and also enemy targets. Some sessions involve the joystick so you can move around while also looking around with the Zapper. That was a bit more confusing to me at first but after the first few tries it got easier.Pros of the Game:Multiple Levels and never doing anything the sameIncorperate towns from the actual Zelda GameYou can shoot the pots and barrels for extra pointsCons of the Game:I can't actually think of any. You can do multiple player mode, and single. There are tons of different games to go through. I would like to be able to just pick 1 session sometimes, but you have to do all 3 in each round. You win medals which opens up the following round.Zapper: I love this. I love that it comes with a game so even if you haven't found your shooting game just yet (MOH2 or Resident Evil are about the only ones right now) you can still shoot things and practice. Also test out your skills.Pros:Light weight and easy to put wiimote and nunchuck inHelps with aimMakes the game more realisticAll around fun extra to haveCons:There was a con to the zapper and it wasn't the fact that the trigger is NOT spring loaded. Though that would be cool, i find that it doesn't get stuck down so i can still fire very fast.The con i found is merely because i now have the rechargeable battery station and the new back cover they give you will not allow you to put the Wiimote in the top portion of the Zapper with that back on. You also can not leave the battery pack in and put the old cover back on. So if you just feel like you don't have the 30 seconds to trade them out i'd take this into consideration. You'd have to keep trading back and forth if you wish to keep using the battery charge station and the zapper.Another con i have come across recently is the backing that covers up the wrapped up nunchuck cord seems flimsy, sometimes it's just hard to get on and feels cheapy. The rest of the gun feels pretty solid to me, especially after you put the controls in place.Over all i gave this 4 stars because i would have liked to see it adapt to the battery charge station, but once again the station is not nintendo brand so they do not make their extras mold to \"off brand\" items. Also a spring loaded trigger would have been cool, but not needed.It's a fun extra to have and the game is fun too. I would definetly say get this when you can find it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2007"}

They overhauled it due to complaints (Flying swallow returns and weapons) but it's still more in the style of Dynasty Warriors. There is a bit of strategic element but it's pretty much out the window. Forget about what skills you built on previous games, this game simply sends hordes of endless enemies to be chopped to bits by you. Dull and repetitive and doesn't require much skill in my opinion.Graphics are a C:The visuals are dull and boring but Ryu looks just as great as previous titles if not better.Sounds and Music F:The worst. I can't think of any game that lacks completely in music or lame \"action\" music to try and get you pumped up. Sorely lacking.Controls A:Controls are just about perfect and why? Because half the time you can get away with button mashing especially on easier difficulties. Still the controls are pretty accurate and its fun lopping heads off and firing bows and casting Ninpo.Overall C-:I really don't need to explain much as I reviewed this game when it was called Ninja Gaiden 3. It's awful compared to the first two games and it really shows that the new Team Ninja are just not in the same league as the guys who did the first two.Razors Edge is an improvement over 3 in various ways but the game play is still repetitive and stagnant. The levels are quite linear and the storyline is hardly worth remembering.Veterans of this series should stick with the original games Ninja Gaiden (Black) and Ninja Gaiden 2 and skip this.

There is a mission you can either accomplish it driving a Porshe Cayenne or a Motorcycle, even better beat twice, once with each one. The missions are short, but it takes you a while to beat them, since they are challenging. Up until this moment my favorite Bond Moment is when you destroy a chopper with your missiles either with the Porshe or the Motorcycle, because it is followed by a great FMV, and then you resume your mission. Graphics and Locations are great. Another great thing is the voice acting and character models based on Hollywood stars, including 007 himself Pierce Brosnan, Willem Dafoe, Heidi Klum, Shannon Elizabeth, and another great element, Bond's Nemesis and one of his most memorable foes JAWS, Richard Kiel. The voices of M and Q are also included, Judy Dench and John Cleese.This is an amazing game. I was never interested in playing Bond games, specially because I don't like FPS. This game always look great but when I knew it was going to be using Bond as a third person it was a no brainer to get it.

The characters are great, the protagonist, Marsden, is a great leading man, the story is great - it's...great. From a storytelling standpoint, R* is unparalleled (Bioware is a close second). The voice acting is top notch and these are the best character models R* has ever done, making the story that much more believable.Red Dead Redemption is a \"typical' Rockstar game. If you hate the GTA series or sandbox games, RDR isn't going to win you over. RDR exceeds anything Rockstar has done in terms of graphics, minigames, details and creating an authentic feeling environment. It also has some great RPG elements that carry throughout the game in the form of your fame and honor meters. My son (High School age) played as a villian top to bottom. I played as a good guy as much as possible. I was able to get better weapons in the shops and had a completely different series of events open up to me in the random encounters.That alone seperates RDR from GTA. Where GTA plays more like an action game, RDR feels a bit more like an RPG. When I compare it to Dragon Age, Borderlands, FFXIII or other recent RPG's, it's an amazing game. If I compare it to action games like Uncharted 2 or God of War III, it simply doesn't hold up, as both of those games are better in every single facet (except size). I also cannot give RDR a pass in terms of graphics and general glitches. FFXIII is larger and absolutely crushes RDR in terms of graphics and presentation. I'd also like to see something in the form of bosses as opposed to set pieces, but R* will have to clean up their controls, which compared to say Mass Efeect are good, but any AAA action game, suck.My personal opinion, RDR is the best R* game ever. It does everything GTA does, except better. It still is just not as tight as it should be. I would love to see R* take a shot at a persistant online community versus the current multiplayer (which is better than average, but no threat to MW, Halo or Battlefield).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2010"}

All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

{"product_name":"B00D96BJSO","description":"","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Lerch","summary":"Compared to XP Seven, SteelSeries H Wireless, and other TBs","reviewText":"For a short review, if all you want is XBox One capability, with the mild added benefit of mobile device compatibility, then the XO Seven should be on your short list of headsets. The sound from the Xbox One is as high quality as the XP Sevens I have for $120 less (MSRP).If you are looking for true 5.1 or 7.1 support, move on. This set is NOT for you. It uses the same tech as the MS wireless stereo headset, and is hindered by the same requirements as that set - so stereo only audio out.If you are looking for Xbox One and other console support, move on. This set is NOT for you. These are the only reasons these are 4 stars and not 5 - many other headsets, for a few dollars more (XP Sevens excluded, though they are more than a few dollars more!) can offer multiplatform capability and can do 5.1. I wanted to give these a 3 because of these short falls, but the audio quality really is quite high and saved it from the fate of a 3.Longer review:Unboxing Turtle Beach headsets is pretty much all the same, though that being said, they do a good job making you feel like the headset is quality. The box has a cardboard wrapper on it, held on with 2 pieces of tape. Pull this tape off, and the headset is enclosed in a nice box, held shut with a magnet. Inside, the headset is held in place with custom formed plastic, with the Xbox One headset adapter (yes, the SAME adapter you can buy separately for $25 MSRP) is held in the center of the set. Under the plastic you will find the manuals and a box with all of the accessories. Overall, it's a nice experience unboxing any TB headset, and the XO Seven is no exception.Actually using the XO Seven is painfully simple. Well, as long as your Xbox One has the March 04, 2014 update and your controller's firmware has been updated. If not, it's still pretty simple.To update your firmware on the Xbox One, simply connect it to the Internet and it should pull the update down. Once downloaded, plug the chat adapter into a powered off controller, plug the small end of a microUSB cable into the controller, and pull out the batteries. Plug the controller into the system's USB port. Power up the Xbox One. In some instances, the Xbox One will automatically update the controller. If it doesn't update automatically, power on and go toSettings -> System -> Update controller and then follow the onscreen instructions. Once completed, you are ready to rock and don't need to do this process again unless you purchase a new controller.After you have your controller updated, simply plug the included adapter into the headset, plug in the mic if you want game chat, then plug the headset into the controller. You should now hear stereo audio from the XO Seven in game.One thing you will notice is that I say it is stereo audio. That's because... it's stereo audio only. Despite other headsets using the 5.1 signals of other consoles, notably the XP Seven, the XP 500, the PSX4 and the SteelSeries H, the XO Seven uses the same technology as Microsoft's stereo wireless headset, meaning it is stereo capable ONLY. If you want 5.1 support, you will need to use optical out, another model headset with 5.1 capability and purchase a Chat Adapter for the XBox One. Chat would be stereo but sound should come out in 5.1 (or 7.1) as long as you change the audio option in the Xbox One's configuration.The thing is, the audio quality, even if \"only\" stereo, is quite nice. I believe the 50mm speakers are the same as the ones in the XP Seven, and I love the quality from those. The XP Seven is more expensive because it can do multiplatform and has a programmable DSP which the \"watered down\" XO Seven does not offer. If you want 5.1 and a nicely programmable DSP, pony up the extra cash for the XP Sevens and the Xbox One Chat Adapter.Comparing these to the XP Sevens, the only differences are the programmable DSP, Xbox One chat capability out of the box, and the 5.1 capability. Be aware the XP Sevens are fully wired as they are aimed at the pro gaming circuit. The audio quality seems to be on par other than the stereo vs 5.1 part of the equation. You can get Xbox One chat compatibility with the Xbox One Chat Adapter. Be aware, because the XP Sevens use optical output, you can get 5.1 audio to the XP Sevens, unlike the XO Sevens.Comparing these to the SteelSeries H Wireless, well, the audio quality on the H is simply astounding. It's wireless, it costs more and isn't directly compatible with the Xbox One chat without the adapter, but if you have the money to spend, and want what I consider the highest audio quality available in gaming audio, then you want the H with the Xbox One Chat Adapter. The H series is wireless, therefore it needs to be charged, which is something the XO Seven doesn't need to worry about. It is powered by the controller and chat adapter.Comparing these to the X41s, the XO Seven sound quality is better by a fair margin. This is to be expected given the 5 years span since the X41s were released. And the X41s have to deal with a LOT of interference. They are NOT recommend by me any longer, so if you want Xbox One capability, the XO Seven wins hands down compared to them.Comparing these to the PX 51s, the price is much better for the XO Sevens, but that's because the XO Seven doesn't do multiplatform support. The PX51s are more geared toward Playstation 3 and 4 gaming, but can be used on the 360 and with the Xbox One chat adapter, work with the Xbox One w/ chat, not just audio. They are optical audio based, with a wireless DSP base station to send audio to the headset, so even on launch day you could get game audio from the Xbox One on these. With the new Xbox One Chat Adapter, you can also get Xbox One support on these. The price for the PX 51s is high compared to the XO Seven, but sound quality seems to be the same to my ears, minus the 5.1 capability of the PX 51s.The last comparison I have is to the PX4 headset. Again, the 50mm driver seems to be the same as the XO Seven here, so the speakers are all the same across the TB line if they are 50mm. So if you own the PX4, just buy the Xbox One Chat Adapter and you'll essentially have the same capability as the XO Sevens... with 5.1 capability. The price point is where I would say the PX 4 is the better choice here, unless you know you will only ever own an Xbox One and don't care about any other platform.One thing to note, another way I've compared the headsets is by connecting them to my PC. I've listened to all sorts of music to compare each headset to the other using optical out where needed, or in the case of the wired XO Sevens, plugged them directly into my headphone amp. I've listened to Moody Blues, Cannibal Corpse, Napalm Death, Deicide, Primus, Urusen, The Beatles, various J-Pop bands, Pink Floyd and other music, listening to each track on each headset one after the other. I can't honestly hear a difference between the headsets from TB, but truly love the SteelSeries H and would recommend them over all others... IF price is not a factor!Final thoughts:The XO Sevens are great headphones, offering Xbox One capability out of the box. This is a blessing and a curse, as it literally only supports the Xbox One. There is no way to get multiplatform support with these. At all. And that's disappointing to me, given the price compared to the PX4 that does offer mutliplatform support and seems to have the same speakers. I believe the PX4s are giving the same 5.1 sound as my Xbox 360 and PS3 on the One as well, so there's another down side.Plus:Xbox One supportGreat sound qualityCons:Stereo ONLYOnly supports Xbox OneWith Xbox One Chat Adapter, the PX4 becomes a much more viable option and offers multiplatform support","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2014"}

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"I wanted a new game!","reviewText":"This review may go against the grain and many readers will hate me, but here goes....I REALLY wanted to love Silent Hill 2, as I thought the first game was fantastic, but when I got it and started playing it, it soon struck me that what I had was a high-res, polished-up retread of the first game, only less frightening. The game does indeed look gorgeous, and the characters and locations are superbly rendered, but it just isn't different enough. Instead of the spooky school, amusement park, motel and hospital, this time you get an apartment block, prison, hotel and, err, hospital...What again? Yes, blood stained beds, grimy basements, zombie nurses, its all a repeat of the first version, which seriously disappointed me. Whats more, the monsters are all real pushovers, and can easily be avoided, theres no threat like the leaping dogs or flying creatures from before. And the bosses may look the business, but they too are disappointingly easy, even the final one.Bottom line is, all the scary innovations from SH1 are merely repeated here, to less effect. The game is short and uninvolving, you can run around for hours without getting a scratch on you, as theres far too much ammo and health to pick up ( and I played on the normal setting), so you'll never feel in any danger. Another thing is that the heightened sense of realism means that some of the restrictions put upon what you can do are nonsensical. If James comes to street that is blocked off by just a lousy piece of police tape, he is unable to pass through!! Search a room in the hotel, but access to certain areas is denied because of strategically placed pieces of furniture, like a small chair that could be kicked aside by a child... What a shame that the series could not go any further than this, for although it will impress newcomers to the genre, it is nowhere near as impressive as the first game was when it hit the shelves those few years ago.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2001"}

{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"Disintegration","summary":"The GTA climax has been reached, it's a downward spiral now","reviewText":"After reading a plethora of reviews stating this game is the greatest GTA game yet, and considering I was a huge fan of Vice City, I just had to dish out 50 bucks for this game. Was it worth it? Well, overall I would say it definitely was worth it, just because of the sheer amount of things this game allows the player to do. You can swim, go to the gym, gain stats, date girls, do drive-bys, and a whole array of other things. However, despite the amount of things you can do, these abilities and sidequests are purely negatives. This game has a lot of problems, a lot.Graphics- 9/10 I have heard a lot of negative things about the graphics. However, I must disagree. I think the graphics are actually pretty well crafted. Sure, the cars look a bit boxy and the overall look is reminiscent of GTA 3, but the amount of detail is amazing. The environments are perfect, especially in the country. There are hills, cliffs, mountains, rivers, bridges...there's basically everything imaginable. I especially like the blur effect. When you hit a certain speed in your vehicle, the graphics blur, and it gives you the feeling of attaining extremely high speeds, making chases fun, or just making boring, long road trips that much better. Although Vice City has better graphics, San Andreas has so much more detail to the environments and the city, so I give it props here.Music- 5/10 Overall, Vice City's soundtrack is superior in every matter. The relatively gangster-oriented soundtrack is fitting for the setting of the game, but there are other choices ( rock and country). However, the choices are rushed/thrown in, awkward...and just plain tasteless often times. It doesn't make much sense to have an old-school country station in a game set in San Andreas, in a very ghetto area. I feel as though this was put in to add to the comedy aspect of the game, but I think it just took away from the whole feeling.  The only highlights are: Depeche Mode, STP, Soundgarden, Rod Stewart, and perhaps Danzig. There are a few other decent songs but they weren't good enough to strongly remember. Every song in Vice City was practically great, especially the Wave 103 and VRock stations. Vice city had nice, tasteful 80s songs, while San Andreas just has a relatively crappy selection.Sound- 9/10 Not a whole lot to say here, other than the fact that the voiceovers are great. Many of the characters are quite memorable...especially the ones you encounter later on in the game. No complaints here...Gameplay- 4/10 This is where the other shoe falls off the shelf, literally. This game is a blast in some aspects...flying in the jets, bolting across hills and flying through the air etc, but there are way too many negatives here. For starters, the map is tremendously large...this sounds like it would be great, but it is not. When you go through missions, you are almost always required to endure painstaking trips, many of which are 10 minutes long. There is a lame \"trip-skip\" feature, but this rarely helps due to the fact that it isn't offered on all the missions, and it doesn't bring you all the way back to where you were, just partially. Basically, when you die during a long mission, the game lets you return to where you died, to save some time on the trip. While this helps somewhat, it is rarely offered and therefore worthless. Also, you barely use any of the map for the missions. Many of the missions are \"clustered\" in certain areas, leaving much of the map unused. I can think of several large areas of the map which are COMPLETELY left out of the missions, which is a let-down considering these places offer some of the greatest scenery of the entire game and would have been great for missions. Furthermore, many of the side-quests are rushed and tremendously boring (who actually wants to sit through numerous gangfights, collect 100 items for a lame reward, or waste hours of their lives going on dates with girls which are extremely uneventful and not very fun...?). Some of the additions are fun, namely the driving and flying schools, the street races also, but what about the missions where you are required to fly through rings with a helicopter? Disaster, absolute disaster. Nothing is more annoying than having to restart over and over and over and over (okay you get the idea) again to complete some boring helicopter mission for less than wonderful rewards. But like I said, the environments are the only upside here .Story- 3/10 The storyline is not only lame and stereotypical, but it is extremely juvinile and standard. Vice city had a nice 80s storyline, but was not too far from San Andreas. However, Vice City's brilliance didnt lie within its storyline, it was in the gameplay. Take a pathetic gang-banger storyline with atrocious and wretched dialougue/plot text, and add to that boring and go-nowhere gameplay and you get San Andreas. The GTA series is running out of ideas, which is understandable considering they are purely all the same. However, even so SA is a huge let-down, despite its location/year it is set in.Overall 5/10 I actually completed this game, and I had fun in the process. I was captivated, whether it was to just finish it or I was actually having a blast. However, it is only after you beat SA that you realize how half-assed and lame the sidequests are, not to mention the gameplay. You will realize how little value this games plot has, and that you just wasted about 50 hours of your life on a pile of grubble. I would recommend to wait till the price drops to 20 bucks, since it will take too long to beat to rent it. If you REALLY can't wait (or think you can't, that is), then buy it, but beware it may be an action which you will regret. It is definitely worth playing through, I suppose, but don't expect a lot of replay value( I would rate the RV as 2/10) like Vice City. Vice City still remains the climax of the GTA series, and considering the GTA series is an almost impossible series to innovate, that probably won't change soon. Everything has been tried and tested, and Rock Star is running dry on ideas, but that is just my opinion...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2005"}
{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Annihilatrix1138","summary":"Logical Progression","reviewText":"With a game like this, there are going to be no shortage of opinions, and some of those are way more detailed and on-the-mark than I'll ever be able to manage. So, I'll just list my own personal pros/cons and hope that they'll suffice. But before that! I should probably point out that while I haven't been playing MMOs as long as others, I've been at it for a while, bouncing around between EVERQUEST, WORLD OF WARCRAFT and a few others here and there (RIFT, SWTOR, STO, and so on). That leap between EQ and WoW was the most important one for me, since the genre became much more refined in a lot of different ways (and just more fun), and there has never really been another MMO that has come close to doing what WoW did for the genre at the time.Personally, I think GUILD WARS 2 represents that next big leap in a lot of really important ways. It still has some tweaks to work out, but, hey, what MMO at launch doesn't? This is just a magnificent game, taking some of the lowered expectations we've come to expect out of an MMORPG and shattering them. If there's one thing I really love about GW2, is that it doesn't just strive to be a good MMO, it tries to be a good game, period.PROS:EXPLORATION - This is a HUGE factor for me. MMOs, by their very definition, are timesinks. If you want to get anywhere, you typically have to be SOMEplace and do SOMEthing for a long time. If an MMO doesn't offer a world I can get lost in, or even find tolerable, then I might not stick around. GW2, without hyperbole, offers up a world that rivals SKYRIM at its best. ArenaNet put their all into creating zones that not only look gorgeous, but demand to be explored. There is always something around every corner, be it unique event or rare crafting materials or a vista that provides an amazing view of the world.And the game absolutely encourages you to explore it, and rewards you for doing so! You might climb to the top of a waterfall, thinking that you're beating your own trail, only to find a diving board sitting there, waiting for you to take the plunge off a sheer cliff into the ocean. The entire game world is brimming with little things like this for players to track down. This is a world that seems lived in, beautiful on so many levels, and is just downright fun to explore.WORLDBUILDING - There are hundreds of micro-stories being told in GUILD WARS 2, with several different races and factions constantly butting heads as the war against the dragons reaches a boiling point. ArenaNet have done quite a bit to ensure that every hamlet, capital city, and conflict is there for a reason. There is marvelously detailed lore here if you keep an eye on the quests and strike up some conversation with NPCs. With a lot of games, lore is typically barebones, being employed just to provide marginal justification for a player to bounce from one quest to another. Here, the writers (some of whom are late of WARCRAFT and DRAGONLANCE) do a fantastic job of maintaining consistency, drawing unique stories out of the lore, and the worst/best out of each race during each conflict. There's a history for everything here. Heck, there's a history for THAT history. The story of how Lion's Arch came to be is a prime example.QUESTING - In games like WoW, you can be expected to be fitted with hundreds of quests of similar variations, with any other method of accumulating XP being a bit lacking. You HAVE to quest. In GW2, questing is a bit more versatile. Each zone has a series of nodes that provide a \"task\" for you to accomplish. Sounds just like a quest, but you're allowed a bit more freedom with regard to tasks. Instead of killing ten rats, you might be given a task to kill rats, chop down trees, clear the beach of the undead, mark excavation sites, wake up lazy workers... all in the same task. Tasks are basically quests that allow you to approach them how you see fit. You don't always have to take the combat-oriented route; you're often provided with passive options.Not only that, but it's absolutely viable to level by doing any number of other things, since the game rewards you very well for nearly everything. You can gain levels through crafting, exploring, tasks, events/group events, gathering materials, completing achievements, discovering \"points of interest\", PvP, and dailies. There is no shortage of things to do.PVP - I absolutely LOVED world PvP in WORLD OF WARCRAFT when it was still viable. LOVED it! I was a bit concerned when I heard that GW2 doesn't really have factions and, therefore, wouldn't have World PvP. Disappointed is more like it. But this is another one of those instances where ArenaNet was looking to the future instead of copying WoW; as time passes and a game grows, World PvP becomes more difficult to encourage. So, instead of factions dueling it out at random, ArenaNet created a set of four zones (three are identical) that are massive in scope, and their sole purpose is to house outrageously huge battles and small skirmishes alike.Instead of different factions battling it out, three different servers are pitted against each other in zones that support up to 500 players. The main goal is for your server to take control of as many keeps, outposts, and guard posts as possible, adding to your overall score. After a certain amount of time, your server will be bumped up or down in the rankings, and you'll be matched with different servers. The great thing about this is that the game is perpetual. There's no time limit and the battle never really ends. And like in the main game, you have the freedom to contribute however you'd like. You can join the main battlegroups and storm keeps with the ability to build siege weapons of all kinds, or you can group with friends and capture smaller control points or fight other groups, or you can go it alone and wander the maps, looking for stragglers to pick off.There are also tasks available at every turn, so you can show up just to gain XP and explore the map. Your contribution is really up to you.JUMPING PUZZLES - I freaking LOVE the jumping puzzles in this game. They're exactly what they sound like, but I can't properly describe how fun they can be in a group, and how much of a challenge they typically are. Even finding them is nearly impossible unless you stumble upon them on accident or track down an online guide, and when you do find them, the game does NOT hold your hand. The game almost come across as spiteful that you tracked down its puzzles. These puzzles will make you cross rickety beams in the dark with nothing but a small torch, when falling means your death. These puzzles will sometimes take an hour to properly solve, and then turn around and tell you if you can beat it in two minutes, you can have whatever's in that massive chest over there. And there is at least one lengthy and difficult puzzle in the PvP zone that gives you and your opponents the ability to set traps - in short, it gives you the power to ruin an hour of progression for the other server's players JUST BECAUSE.I freaking LOVE these puzzles. They were made by one without a soul, and demand that you stoop to their level to come away victorious.GROUP UP - The way the game constantly encourages cooperation between players, in or out of groups, is just plain brilliant. If you and another player are tackling the same task, you can briefly align your goals and you'll both come out of it with the same XP and similar loot, regardless of who gets the first hit on a mob. In fact, sometimes forming temporary alliances can work in your favor, since some tasks adapt to large groups by either changing up the difficulty, the content of the tasks, or dishing out a boss that will mean even MORE XP and loot. It's in your best interests to help out other players, since even picking up a downed player off the ground will reward you with XP. The game has a pat on the back ready for charitable folks.SOUNDTRACK - If you thought Jeremy Soule's work on SKYRIM, OBLIVION, MORROWIND, or STAR WARS: KOToR was impressive, just wait until you hear what he's created here. The music is just arresting and beautiful and a perfect complement to ArenaNet's world.NO SUBSCRIPTION FEE - Times have changed. Games have changed. In a world where LEAGUE OF LEGENDS can not only operate on a Free 2 Play model, but thrive, certain things in the MMO scene should likewise change as well. Millions of people have already played WORLD OF WARCRAFT, and another MMO with the same gameplay and business model isn't necessary. This is one of the larger mistakes SWTOR made. So to get a game that offers up so much, changes so much, and does so WITHOUT having to pay a monthly fee? That's really something special. A game like GW2 can be profitable with an in-game store and eventual expansions, and it's a great feeling knowing that, regardless of my waxing and waning interest, I can ALWAYS revisit the game I paid for. I'm actually waiting for ArenaNet to add more things to the store so I can throw some more support their way!CONS:BUGS - This is one of the most massive games with regards to scope that I've ever played. I'm no stranger to MMOs of this size or even single player games with an eye for grandeur (FALLOUT: NEW VEGAS,DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS, SKYRIM, etc.), so I know bugs are going to happen. It's just as simple as that. Especially within a few months after launching. So, know going into GUILD WARS 2 that you are very likely going to run into your share of bugs before you reach level 80. None of them are game breaking in the least bit, but you might fight through an event and discover that it won't progress or even end. It's annoying, but you can come back to them later.TRADING - There's no real trading system in the game yet, which is totally weird, but I imagine it has something to do with gold farming. If you and your friend want to send each other items, you can access the mail system from anywhere in the world and send the items that way. It's instant, but other than that, you're kind of out of luck unless you really, really trust the player you're trading with.LEVEL SCALING - This is something that can be a very positive part of the game at the right times, but a little annoying at the wrong times. For instance, if I start a new character, my level 80 friends can group up with me and we can all knock out tasks and events, and it'll still be a challenge for everyone (not to mention loot often scales, so they can possibly come away with a few upgrades for their troubles). But if I want to get 100% in a certain zone that's a couple dozen levels below me, it's a bit of a chore to do so, since your level is scaled down to match the zone. While this means there are always more challenges out there, it also kind of made me feel like my level didn't really matter. This was a problem for me in games like OBLIVION and DEAD ISLAND.When you reach level 80, you want SOMETHING actionable in the game to suitably make you feel like you've progressed, that you're as powerful as your stats say you are. There's very little of that in GUILD WARS 2 at this point, and this might be a major annoyance for some players.ARMOR - I don't know if it's just because my thief can only wear medium armor, but there just never seems to be an armor upgrade waiting for me at the right times, either visually or stat-wise. My character has looked about the same for at least the last 10-20 levels, and more upgrades seem hard to come by. There doesn't seem to be a shortage of armor, judging by all of my loot, but there just never seems to be an upgrade for ME!SKILLS - It's probably a little silly to complain about skills when there's a new set for virtually every combination of weapons in the game. I can get new skills by switching to dual daggers, dual pistols, or having a dagger and pistol in each hand (and even new skills depending on which weapon is in my off-hand!). But now that I'm set in my ways, it doesn't feel like there's enough versatility, since I can only really change out six of my skills on demand (out of combat). Maybe if there was a way to switch out skill sets like you can with your weapons, I'd feel a bit better about it, but I've just never been over satisfied with the skills available for my thief. Going on level 80, I've had more than enough time to not only unlock all my skills, but hone in on which ones are viable for my style of play, and get a little tired of them.CLOSING NOTES:I could sit here all day and come up with a dozen gripes for this game, but the reality is that they just cannot displace the sheer amount of fun I've had with GUILD WARS 2 so far. If you're a fan of MMORPGs (or even sandbox games like SKYRIM and OBLIVION), you owe it to yourself to check out this game. My friends and I haven't had this much fun and so many laughs since pre-BC WoW. We've spent hours tackling jumping puzzles, exploring every inch of every zone we've come across, fervently discussing the game's main storyline (which we NEVER did with WORLD OF WARCRAFT), setting up small siege weapons near roads in the PvP zone and waiting to ambush enemy players like true highwaymen, dancing on each other's corpses, jumping to the rescue of other players... The list just goes on, and it goes on for a long time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"From Detroit","summary":"A solid performer (From a MMO Veteran)","reviewText":"*******************************************************  EDIT - 9/13/12  ***********************************************************I'm level 20 now, and I still think this is a great game!  Combat seems to be a little more than I'm used to when it comes to an MMO, which is definitely a welcome change.  Combat with mobs is actually closer to what PVP was like in WoW - you need to move around!  Learning how to use a new weapon still happens in a matter of minutes.  You equip it, and within a handful of mobs, you've unlocked all the possible abilities linked with it (hot-keyed 1-5.)  Each type of weapon has it's own style of combat.  With a warrior, I prefer a 2-handed sword and either a bow or gun in my secondary slot.Questing still feels the same, even though I've moved on to the new zone.  It's a bit of a grind at times, but frequently \"events\" will happen nearby.  These tend to involve killing an elite or escorting a NPC, and have a significant reward (XP, Karma and of course, money.)  I actually look forward to these, as they break up the grind a bit, and encourage teamwork.Teamwork brings me to my next thought!  There's no such thing as \"tagging a mob\" in GW2.  Everyone can take a whack, and if you participate in the kill, you're eligible for reward! (XP, drops, etc.)  This actually encourages players to work together, and not compete.  The same thing goes for resource nodes.  You see a copper or iron ore deposit, you get it.  No fighting or stealing!I've played WoW and FFXI fairly extensively, so the idea of MMO's isn't new to me (this is likely the case for most people here.)  Guild Wars 2 is my introduction to the franchise, however.  I have to say, so far, I like it!  I'll have to admit, WoW pretty much sets the standard about how I'd expect an MMO to play.  In some respects, this game surpasses it.  In others, it falls a little short (but in no \"game-breaking\" way, however.)  I also have a feeling that I'll update this review from time to time, as the very nature of this game will demand it.Crafting got a little easier once you get the hang of the \"discovery\" tab.  I chose to make weapons and armor, and I finally figured out that making the components for the weapons or armor pieces of choice, you can combine them with other crafted items and learn new patterns (thanks to YouTube!)  Each discovery gives you 1 of the item that you discovered, the ability to continue making them, AND a ton of XP toward your craft.  This seems like it cuts the resource grind from ridiculous to just very long.  Currently, I'm level a level 46 armorsmith, and have put a significant amount of effort into gathering resources. I need to eventually hit 75 so I can use the materials that I'm gathering in the 15-20+ zone.Leveling seems to happen a bit faster than I was used to in FFXI, or old school (pre-3.0) WoW.  Each time I've sat down, I've gained at least a level.  Heading back to old zones to farm for copper hasn't been a waste of time, either.  You'll level down to an appropriate level and still earn XP while gathering!  You can even participate in the events for more XP, karma and money, and yet you won't have a significant edge over folks that belong in the area (your gear is better, but you're otherwise gimped to their level.)Ultimately, the creators made a very solid MMO.  I haven't quite got hooked on it like I did with WoW, but that's a good thing, as I have other things to do.  I plan to continue playing, and updating as I go along.***************************************************************  ORIGINAL REVIEW  *****************************************************************Currently, I have a level 10 character, which I rolled up after abandoning a level 6 character that I didn't like.**LOGISTICS & TECHNICAL THINGS**First off, this game has no monthly fee!  Which is great!  I've probably dropped a few hundred dollars in subscription fees for the other two MMO's that I used to pay.  Not having one is great!I bought the game from a store, and figured the installation would be faster since I wouldn't have to wait for a download at peak times.  I was rather wrong...  I still had about 3 hours between inserting the discs and finally playing; about 2 of those hours were from downloads!My gaming rig has an AMD FX-4100 CPU, 4GB of DDR3 RAM and an EVGA 550 Ti card, and I'm able to run with the graphics set to pretty high (almost peak) levels.  My GPU hardly notices, though the CPU is running all 4 cores at 50%+ load most of the time.  The RAM is stuck between 3.0 and 3.2GB at any given time.  Not once have I had a dip in frame rates or lag (I set the max frames at 60FPS, just because anything more is completely unnecessary.)  In short, this game seems fairly CPU-intensive, yet not very dependent on the GPU.  (Diablo 3, on the other hand, is the complete opposite.)  My system is by no means cutting edge, yet GW2 runs great on it.The graphics are decent, though I haven't notices much in the way of physics being used.  The weather effects look a bit dated (I think WoW's environments were nicer, actually.)  Sound-wise, I feel the game lacks.  The music is your standard-fare fantasy RPG symphonic music, and the voice acting is OK at best (in fact, I turned voice volume all the way down and just read the subtitles.)  I can't complain too much here, as lowering the graphical intensity will allow for more players.**STORY**The Norn's starting zone is very reminiscent of what you'd expect in WotLK or Skyrim - a winter wonderland filled with things to kill!  The story so far is only OK...  Rather typical fantasy, but fine enough to drive the MMO. The intro has alluded to a menacing dragon and a power struggle.  Again, things seem fairly routine here.**GAMEPLAY**When it comes to combat and exploration, the mechanics are fairly intuitive and things flow pretty freely here.  The map has plenty of icons, so once you figure them out,  you should be able to find anything you want.  Fast Travel is very straight forward and inexpensive.  here are several fast travel points through the starting zone, and once you discover them, you can jump to one from anywhere on the map for a nominal charge (5 or 6 coppers, so far.)  The Norn's hometown is connected in a similar fashion.  One thing I found rather strange were the \"Active Events.\"  From time to time, you'll get an onscreen notice saying \"An event is happening nearby.\"  Said event is usually a raiding party of baddies, or an NPC needing protection.  Anyone is free to join, and participation yields rewards on many levels.  Objectively, watching what's going on is a lot like watching little league ball games - it's just a giant cluster-@!#* of players chasing after mobs!  Regardless, they only take a few minutes, and the rewards are rather nice.Since this game was recently launched, the servers are getting hit.  Instead of making you wait to log on, they've implemented an Overflow Server.  You can jump right into the game, do all your quests, exploration and what-not, and all of that will transfer over to your main server once your queue pops.  From what I understand, only World Events won't transfer over, though I haven't had to deal with that quite yet...  Ultimately, I'm very appreciative of this Overflow Server idea!  It sure beats the 15min+ queue times that I had to deal with when FFXI and WoW were popular.Crafting so far hasn't been as clear.  As a warrior, I picked the very original professions of Armorsmith and Weaponsmith.  It seems like you need a tremendous amount of ore in order to make even the most basic item.  Then again, I'm used to crafting in WoW, where you can get started very quickly with a minimal amount of materials.  In the several hours of play time that I've already invested - a good chunk of that dedicated to gathering ore - I've only been able to make 4 inventory boxes, a sword and 2 pieces of armor.  I must've gathered a couple hundred pieces of copper ore.  I have yet to use the Discovery Tab, but I haven't found enough materials to do so.  Hopefully I can make more sense out of the system before long.  After all, I've just started.Questing is rather silly...  Outside of your \"personal story\" quests, you find a quest giver (empty beige hearts on the map) and do what they say.  You never have to return to them.  Once you complete the objective, you get a message in the mail, which will also include the award.  Speaking of mail, you no longer need to find a mailbox.  It's just a tab at the top of your screen!  Sure, this may lack \"realism,\" but let's face it.  All the realism we had in previous MMO's tended to bog down the game, and just required way more of our time.**Current Verdict**As it stands, I'm quite happy with my purchase.  Guild Wars 2, for the most part, is a very well thought out MMO.  You can tell the people who designed this had the player in mind.  If you're here for great sound and graphics, you'll be disappointed.  The story is a little lack-luster, but the over-all gameplay makes up for it.  The crafting system seems a little complicated at the moment, but hopefully I'll sort those issues out on my own.  (I'm wondering of others feel the same way, however.)  They have greatly simplified questing, but again, I feel that they did this to reduce the amount of backtracking we need to do (player-focused design!)  This isn't a perfect game, but it's a very solid attempt.  Considering the fact that they don't require a monthly fee, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who's looking for an MMO!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2012"}

You can create your own adventures or play other people's premade adventures either solo or with an adventuring party filled with players or NPC's.My main complaint is the level limit. Twentieth level is the maximum you can reach. There was absolutely no reason for this limitation other than using it for future expansion sales. I understand that even the expansion has the same level limit, though! The reason I say there was no reason for it is because on the editor you can raise the monster's levels beyond that, so the game engine knows what to do if you're 23rd or 56th level. This game would have been SO MUCH BETTER if that limitation were not there. For people like myself, who have been playing this game for over 20 years, low level characters just aren't all that fun.Despite this serious drawback, the game has an amazing array of spells, feats, skills, classes, races, magical items, and monsters included. The monsters are so customizeable that you can give them the stats of a completely different monster, in effect changing something like a lizard man into a kua toa (something I actually did in the editor. It worked quite well).Another thing which could have added a lot to the game is enabling spellcasters to use hot keys (such as F1, etc) to cast favorite spells quickly instead of having to go through a series of mouse clicks during a real-time combat.The editor is so flexible and user friendly that within a few days I was copying my old modules, such as Vault of the Drow and Against the Giants into it. They work great! I did find out that you are limited to about 150 creatures per level. Go higher than that and the monsters just stand there and let you pound on them.So if you enjoy the low level game, break out the Doritos and have fun!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2003"}

I think it's a fun, amazing game that anyone any age can appreciate.The game I played most when I was a kid was Super Mario 3 for the Nintendo.  This game more than lives up to the name.  It seems like it takes all the best things from every single Mario game and combines them into a masterpiece.  Countless times you will find yourself smiling remembering something from your past.  Finding secret areas, using all the power-ups, fighting stuff on the map, dungeons, and bosses are just so much fun.  Time comes into play as well, it makes you try to move fast and explore, all while trying to beat the clock.  There are tons of hidden areas and each level has 3 star coins.  The Miiverse plays a role here too where you can leave comments on levels to help each other out or just say that you are happy you beat the level.  For single player the Wii U tablet remote doesn't serve as a real purpose other than mirroring the screen, if you want you can play solely on that and let someone else use the TV.The multiplayer is crazy and exciting.  Some people would complain about other players on the screen because they run into you and mess you up but I find it to be more fun.  You have to not only watch yourself but watch your teammates and work with them to get past obstacles.  It's worth noting that you need a Wii remote for each character playing.  For instance 1 Wii remote + 1 Wii tablet = only 1 person on screen while the tablet player has a different function.  For 2 player you need 2 Wii remotes.  This game can be played by 5 people, 4 players on the screen using Wii remotes and 1 person using the Wii tablet.  My friend and I have never had a dull moment and have had to stop for a minute because we were laughing so hard.  Playing with friends adds to the complexity and makes you work together to accomplish getting to secret areas.Mario looks amazing in HD and this game is a must have for any Nintendo fan.Update Feb 2013: Nintendo announced that there will be upcoming New Super Luigi Bros. U DLC coming for this game.  Which seems like it will redo every map with a Luigi twist to it.  Also I realized I didn't add that the Wii U Pro controller will NOT work with this game either, so you are stuck with Wii Remotes.Update May 2013: Super Luigi U DLC officially announced as a $20 download on June 20th.  My friend and I have finally beaten all the levels and gotten all the star coins.  The bonus star world has some extremely fun levels.Update June 2013: Super Luigi U is out as DLC to this game, you can also buy a physical copy but it won't be released until Aug 25.  This DLC is not a drastic change from the original game.  You get the same map with all the levels reworked.  They are shorter and you are supposed to complete them in a faster amount of time.  To me it seems a little easier.  The physics (jumping and running) are different too.  I personally don't like it as much.  Also when playing with 4 player, whoever uses Nabbit gets bored since he can't die and it's cheating on all the boss fights.  I wouldn't say this is a must have, but if you like Luigi and have the spare money you might as well.Update July 2013: Thanks to Kyle B. in the comments, I've also been informed with the Luigi U update the game can now use the Pro controller which is a nice addition.  My friend and I have played some more of the Luigi U DLC and it's just not as fun.  We don't find ourselves laughing nearly as much and it seems we are always out of time, even though I know that's the point of the shorter times.  If you play as Nabbit it is still horribly boring.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2012"}

I have been enjoying it thoroughly ever since I got it for my birthday (my wife always makes sure to get me what I want!).  New Super Mario Bros. U was one of three games she gave me with the system.  After playing it for a few hours (I haven't beaten it yet, mind you), I can safely say that this is one of the most enjoyable Mario games ever (although SMB3 still holds a special place in my heart that keeps it from being trumped by modern Mario games).  It feels a lot like the the Wii version, IMO, but everything feels tighter and looks crisper.It's a beautiful game to look at on the TV or on the Gamepad.  Being able to play solely on the Gamepad is a huge plus, so when my wife wants to do an exercise video or watch a movie, I can continue playing with no interruptions.  The multi-player is awesome (although challenging, just like the Wii version), but the inclusion of Boost Mode is a fresh and enjoyable form of multi-player interaction.  In Boost Mode, one player uses the Gamepad to assist the other player(s), who will be using Wii Remotes to play as Mario, Luigi, or Toads.  You can tap the screen to generate temporary platforms for players to jump on, and you can find blocks with 1UP Mushrooms that the other players can't see.  Also, you can stun enemies by tapping them.There also multiple modes to play such as Coin Battle, Challenge Mode, and maybe something else, but I haven't tried any of those yet.  What matters is that this is tried and true Mario platforming goodness.  If you like Mario in his 2D form, then you should like this game.

If you match 4 or more gems, you also get a special gem that can be used to destroy many more gems when matched.  As expected, you get bonus points for strings of consecutive matches, multiple simultaneous matches or destroying large amounts of gems.  Your game ends when you fail to match or destroy mine gems that count down with each rotation.  In most modes time is not a factor.Bejeweled Twist offers 4 different modes of solo play as well as multiplayer.  There are several unlockables, some of which are quite a challenge.  In fact, one of the modes is called 'challenge,' and it happens to be my favorite mode.  Unfortunately, the main mode can grow tiresome as it takes a while to ramp up in difficulty.  However, skilled players will find that they can advance in levels more quickly than novice players.  The challenge levels will add several hours of lasting appeal to the game, but suffer from a repetitive and tedious nature at times.  Too many of the challenges feel like copies of each other and many are part of a series of progressively harder challenges that feel like time-consuming busy-work at the early stages.  Overall, the Main mode offers the most to keep coming back for.  There are plenty of crazy bonus point earning objectives to both keep you occupied and allow you creative freedom in racking up a new high score or level.While most people are familiar with bejeweled from other versions, this was my first experience.  I found the mechanics of playing (only being able to rotate gems clockwise) frustrating at first.  The learning curve was fairly quick though, and it was only matter of an hour or two before I was able to conquer even the hardest challenges.  So while i enjoyed playing Bejeweled thoroughly for the first 10 hours, eventually it lost its appeal.  Considering the budget price of the game, I can still easily recommend Bejeweled Twist.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00004YRQ9","description":"The layout of PlayStation2's Dual Shock 2 controller is nearly identical to that of the original PlayStation's Dual Shock controller, which is good news for most gamers. The main new feature is that, when the buttons are pushed, the controller can register how much pressure is being exerted. This adds a completely new dimension to sports, racing, fighting, and more games. Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience. Two convex analog thumb pads and two force-feedback solenoid rumblers round out the features. This controller is also compatible with all software that supports the original Dual Shock controller.","reviewerName":"EMAN NEP","summary":"THE BEST CONTROLLER JUST GOT BETTER","reviewText":"The way I see it, the best controllers are the NES, SNES, and Playstation controllers. All three of these have one thing in common: ridiculously simple button lay-out. Play with any of these three and you'll notice that you NEVER have to take your eyes off the screen to find the right button.I see a lot of people complaining about the price on this controller, but let's look at what you're getting. First of all, this controller has the vibration function, which makes the controller literally shake around. This is especially fun when you're shooting guns in games like Metal Gear Solid 2. Then there's the two analog controllers. However, just because they're there, doesn't mean that you are forced to use them--like with that dumb N64 controller. Every Playstation 2 game I've played so far still lets you use the D-pad--which an old-school gamer like me prefers. But if you want to use the analog controller, go right ahead, it's just a thumb-flick away.Everything I've mentioned up to here is pretty much common knowledge, but there are a few features on this controller that you weren't aware of: 1) This controller has AN EXTRA FOOT OF CORD when you compare it to the generic Playstation One controller. Now I can relax on the COUCH instead of the FLOOR. 2) The R2 and L2 shoulder buttons are LARGER, making it sooooo much easier to find them in the heat of battle. And 3) I recently saw a magazine advertising a product that lets you use the Playstation 2 controller on the Gamecube because &quot;the Gamecube controller won't be ideal for all games.&quot; See, I told you the Playstation 2 controller was the best.So far I haven't had any problems with buttons sticking, and quite frankly, the only way I can see that happening is if you make a habit of dripping pancake syrup onto your controller, or throwing your controller at the wall. Controll yourself!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2001"}
{"product_name":"B0074LJ3CE","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Engel","summary":"Near-perfect Komplete Kollection port and bonuses","reviewText":"As far as Mortal Kombat--or any fighting game, for that matter--goes, the unbelievable amount of content here is beautiful. Not only does this include everything in the Komplete Kollection for consoles (The original + All DLC for it),  but it adds a massive \"Bonus Challenge Tower\" that includes Vita-specific minigames that are all very well-done, as well as Vita-specific control schemes to be used, not the least of which includes touchscreen-activated fatalities, which do not require any attack commands to perform, hence removing any accidental inputs that could potentially end the match with a jab instead of the fatality intended. There are neat little touches everywhere, and it's easy to see that the developers made sure people were going to like this, and Vita users in particular were going to like it, even if they already have the Komplete Kollection.There are a few minor gripes, but one is not the graphics, which for some reason have gotten a lot of heat for not being PS3-level. First of all, while it does lose detail compared to the console versions, it isn't a catastrophic loss. The developers insisted throughout the development that the game would maintain a 60 fps frame rate, so was it really fair to ask for a flawless conversion onto such different hardware? If it weren't for the gorgeous console versions, no one would be saying a word about the graphics in this, but for comparison's sake, yes, the console versions do have more detail. But it's not worth even one loss of a star over.Some may like it, some may hate it, but for obvious reasons, the lobbies from the console versions of the multiplayer are gone--thank God. Everyone who's been in those totally unmoderated lobbies knows exactly what I'm talking about when I say it's refreshing to *NEVER* have to see them, with all their glorious spamming of insensible trash that is still impossible to disable while you're looking for a match. We now have a simple matchmaking system for ranked and unranked games, private or public, either in teams or not in teams. It's simple and it works.Touchscreen fatalities don't work quite as well as I had hoped, and I find myself reverting back to using the D-pad and attack commands. They're simply unforgiving, and a slightly crooked swipe with the finger can ruin your sequence. It definitely takes some getting used to, but unless you're horrible with those inputs on the D-pad, you probably won't find the feature very useful. It's a neat idea, but it's not implemented particularly well. The fatalities themselves are no different--you don't, for instance, swipe once to taze your opponent as Stryker, and then swipe an arc to blow their head off, which could have been neat. Instead, you just input the commands normally, the only difference being that there is no attack command required. Baraka's second fatality is still F, F, D, D, to perform it. Normally, it would include LK at the end of that. But because the touchscreen is also used to move and attack, it's easy to screw up.Touchscreen movement and attacking is, as you would guess, totally useless for real play, and at the same time, hurts the usability of touchscreen fatalities, because it will cause you to move as you swipe, potentially ruining your distance. If they had simply disabled touchscreen movement and attacks and left it for fatalities and X-rays, this would have been fine, but they tried to do too much, and it doesn't work. Chances are, you'll go back to the regular button inputs to do such things.It should be noted that microphone support is fully supported, so unless your opponent has his disabled, you can both chat by default without any kind of headset, since the Vita has a built-in microphone. Some may not like this, but I find it great. It adds some sociability in the game, and most people are polite when it's their actual voice, unlike online. It definitely adds something to the experience when you're both having fun with the game and you can hear each other's real-life cries every time some major upset happens. It's very cool, to say the least.The bottom line: Even if you own Mortal Kombat for a console, the Vita edition is still worth it for what you get. There are extra costumes not even included in the Komplete Kollection, a whole lot of gameplay tweaks, a massive number of new Vita-specific challenges, better multiplayer support (without that God-awful spam box always present), and for those concerned, you *DO NOT* have to do the story all over again to get Cyber Sub-Zero or Quan Chi--everyone's there ahead of time, which was kind of the developers. Most of us are well past that phase, and it's good that they recognized that.Very highly recommended for anyone who wants MK on their Vita; it's a near-perfect conversion with its own bells and whistles, and is especially worthwhile for people who are either new or who did not spend the cash on the DLC already. But even if you did spend cash on DLC, you still won't have everything this version has, and that makes up for it. Great stuff.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2012"}

I own at least 30 of their titles and regularly pre-order games.  I love the games developed by Sting as well as the in house games like the Persona series.  So it is with a great amount of trepidation that I give this game three stars.  And here is my unbiased review as a long time gamer.I'll end with some good points and a +/- zone to summarize.  But the most glaring negative in my opinion is the gameplay.  This game is reminiscent of Final Fight, TMNT Arcade, King of Dragons, Knights of the Round, etc...  The problem is that those games were actually fun.  This game, sadly, is not.  At least after about 20 minutes.  I really don't know where to begin.Control is lackluster at best.  Movement seems jerky and not at all fluid.  Often I tried to hit the target lock in key but it actually activated the magic bar... even though I tried this several times with the express intent of NOT accidentally hitting the magic button.  Alas... the target only works sometimes, and often doesn't stick well on the monster.  So it's usually better to just go in without targeting.  Blocking is pretty useless also.  So what this means is that you will be mashing the A and B buttons to execute attacks.  Pretty much hitting B B A (weak weak strong) to build a decent combo.  It gets VERY repetitive, even using various new characters.The stages are left to right, like the old brawlers.  But there are three 'elevations' you can attack on.  Basically three lines of play: the main middle area then the foreground and background.  You can hop to these lines.  But I would have MUCH preferred a free roam ability like in the older SNES and NES games like River City Ransom and King of Dragons.  Hell, even Double Dragon seems to have more freedom!  But when you go into the next layer, the monsters follow anyway, so really only changing layers to bash a barrel or something to try for an item is the only reason you would move (typically).Enemies have a good amount of HP, but the drawback is that you spend more time fighting the same batch of enemies rather than facing off against many foes and having the satisfaction of pounding them in three or four hits.  But enemies aren't too tough.  They are pretty predictable.  Even bosses.  And if you get pincer attacked, the strong attack usually results in a front/back attack from most characters.The RPG elements are fun at first, but they wear out their novelty.  You get a couple of stat points per level.  So leveling up isn't really the dramatic RPG element it is in other games.  Gear isn't really fun to collect either.  Sadly.  Not like collecting things in Kid Icarus (which is actually a really great 3DS game).The 3D is among the most lackluster I have seen on a 3DS game.  It basically comes down to some shrubs in the foreground, characters in between the obstructions.  It's a pretty lazy 3D design.  Etrian Odyssey IV should raise the bar quite a bit after this.  And overall the graphics are not much better than a basic DS game.  Even with my 3DS XL I find it hard sometimes to see the characters, especially when the camera starts panning out and doing weird things.So the positive?  It's easy to learn and quick to get into.  The story is pretty cheese-tastic, and I actually found it amusing.  It's pretty vanilla other than the comedy, so without the comedic overtones this would have been a miserable plot to plod along with.  The game has full voice acting, and the voice acting is overall pretty good.The main quest is short, and the extras aren't really appealing.  There is a versus mode, but I just couldn't bring myself to even want to try.  If I want to go head to head in a battle game I would go with a true fighting game.  I recommend checking it out first before buying.  Preferably spend at least an hour or two on the game.  You can actually beat the entire game in just a few hours of steady playing.  On replay you can try and get better times on the stages to reap more rewards and unlock more items, but it's just not exciting.Pros:+ Easy to pick up and play+ Lots of characters to unlock+ Funny storylineCons:- Poor controls- Sub par graphics- Repetitive music- Unexciting RPG elements- Short quest- Repetitive- VERY repetitiveIf you want a game where you mash buttons and don't expect the magic or targeting or blocking systems to work correctly, then this is it.  I love you Atlus, but this game is just poorly executed.  Good idea, poor execution.  Now back to Gungnir...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

The Nintendo Gamecube is often given short shrift when compared to the PS2 and the XBox. It's often seen as a \"kiddy system,\" appealing only to children and preteens. But when stacked up against the other two systems, it is second (barely) to the XBox in overall quality. The Gamecube features excellent graphics (a 485 MHz aluminum processor and an IBM CPU, second only to the XBox's 733 MHz) and smooth, even gameplay thanks to a three linked processors and twin Emotion Engines. This keeps framerates smooth, load times to a minimum, and allows for gorgeous graphics. Its hardware isn't as complex as the XBox's, but it makes better, more efficient use of what it has. Like the XBox, it has four controller ports for mulitplayer use (the PS2 has but two, and requires a separate multi-tap for extra players), and two memory card slots. It does have a couple of drawbacks when compared to the other systems, though: It won't play DVDs (Cube games are minidisc-based, not DVD-based) and currently there's no online play to speak of.In terms of games, the Cube does have a smaller selection of titles than the other two systems. However, this is largely due to the fact that Nintendo keeps most of its gaming licenses in-house, doling out a few to select companies. This means that although there are fewer games, the ones available are of good quality (unlike PS2, which will license anything, no matter how bad). Certainly, there are some bad games for the Cube--just a lot fewer than the other systems. Plus, certain titles and characters are Nintendo exclusives; you won't find Mario, Zelda, Metroid, Starfox, or Donkey Kong anywhere else. They also have exclusive rights to the excellent Star Wars: Rebel Strike. Plus, one can get Madden, Medal of Honor, NBA Street, and other popular titles for the Cube. Also, Nintendo has recently released a nice piece of hardware that expands the number of games available: The Gameboy Player (about fifty dollars) hooks up to the Cube and allows one to play Gameboy games on the television. Nintendo has often been criticized for having few Mature-rated games; this is largely due to their focus on keeping games kid- and family-friendly. Between the quality of games and the first-rate graphics and gameplay, I have to say that this system is an exceptional value, and is highly recommended.Suggested games: Mario Party 4 and 5, Luigi's Mansion, Metroid Prime, Animal Crossing, Mario Sunshine, Super Smash Brothers Melee, Starfox Adventures, Legend of Zelda: Windwaker, F-Zero GX, Soul Calibre, Mario Kart: Double Dash.Suggested accessories (when possible, stick with the Nintendo brand. They're the best quality): Memory card 251 (a must-have, as this is the only way to save games); a second controller (available in blue, black, and spice orange); for wireless play, get the Nintendo Wavebird, an excellent controller at a great price; the Gameboy Player (for playing GB games on the TV); if you have an older TV without RCA A/V jacks (red, yellow and white) that has a cable jack in the back, you'll need an RF adapter (about $15); racing wheel (I recommend the Logitech brand); if travelling with the system, I recommend the Intec gamescreen, which includes everything you need for portability.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2003"}

However, the goodness start slipping right then and there, the controls are patched with different button configurations, but they still do not feel right. The aim is a bit off in this game, but not the usual recoil messing up the aiming, but it's just off enough to be annoying. The movement feels delayed and not in a space and gravity sense, but the slowness followed by having to fight swarms of enemies makes the game not challenging, but frustrating to play on single player campaign. There are no epic moments, either, in the single player campaign.The online mode looks feels like a mess, nothing but powerful weapons and pretty much killing and dying every few seconds. The only nice part is the developers do push out more maps and add-ons, but online gameplay lacks the fun aspect.The game glitches and lags and did not run fluidly for me. This is a very good looking FPS, but it lacks the shine that makes Halo and COD series shine.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2009"}
{"product_name":"B007VFHGZ4","description":"","reviewerName":"GatoRat","summary":"Moments of brilliance surrounded by aggravation","reviewText":"Tomb Raider is a gorgeous game. At times, the game was simply brilliant. Unfortunately, all this was marred by extremely tedious use of Quick Time Events and some very poorly designed sequences. Several times a cut scene starts and you sit back to watch when suddenly you die because an entirely pointless QTE happens, like you needed to pressing the down key. Why? A bigger problem is that many actions all too often require an absurd precision in timing. At that point the game ceases to be about thinking or even reacting fast; it becomes you trying to figure out the precise timing required to mash a button. In more than one scene, you have to hit a key exactly when the QTE prompt pops up. A tenth of a second late and you die. This isn't fun.Based on all that, I'd give it one star. Except, there were enough times in the game where I was simply having a blast to counter the annoying parts.So, if you like Tomb Raider at all and can tolerate third person shooters, wait for this to be on sale and give it a try.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00008G764","description":"Team Rainbow faces the hidden global forces of a new and secretive foe; command Rainbow in a race against time in locations around the world.","reviewerName":"M. S. Hillis","summary":"Solid game but could have been much better","reviewText":"I had hoped Rainbow Six 3 would combine the gameplay of Ghost Recon with the graphics of Splinter Cell. While managing to offer solid fun, it unfortunately fails to replicate the main strenghts of either of those titles.The graphics are far better than Ghost Recon, but despite the much-ballyhooed use of the Splinter Cell engine, come a bit shy of matching that game's visual richness.There is also not as much interactivity with the environment as in Splinter Cell. Most notably, lamps and lights cannot be shot out. You can empty your M16 clip into a camping lantern on the ground to no effect. Many doors simply have no way to pick them or blast through. There is also no way to jump over or move objects. Therefore, an oil drum in front of an open doorway is enough to block your passage. You can crouch, but you can't lie prone.One way the game fails to match Ghost Recon is that you are stuck with the same four guys, and can only directly control the main character. It would have been really great to have a roster of soldiers to choose from, the ability to upgrade their skills, and to be able to switch among them in combat.My last gripe is total lack of split-screen multiplayer. At least a simple co-op mode should have been included.Unfortunately I don't have Xbox Live.Those are the main complaints, but there is still lots of good stuf about the game.First, the game play itself is very smooth and gripping. The controls are well laid-out and the heads-up display and other interfaces are easy to use. The lack of an enemy radar or indicator that shows the position of your foes adds to the realism. It's a pretty alarming experience to be creeping along quietly only to find yourself on the wrong end of a hail of bullets with no clear idea where it is coming from.I also really like the ability to issue a variety of commands to your squad, as opposed to very general aggressiveness stances as in Ghost Recon. Whether it's ordering them to move to the next corner, throw a frag grenade down a flight of stairs, or breach and clear a room on your order, there is a good set of options to make use of your team members.There is also a great selection of weapons, including several varieties of submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles and grenades, opening up more tactical options (for instance, will you just frag a room, or flashbang it in hopes of taking some bad guys alive, or will you toss a smoker and flip on the thermal goggles and pick the baddies off at will?)Overall, I'm glad I have Rainbow Six 3 to offer up some squad shooter thrills, but can't help but feeling frustruated that the game missed several opportunities to be the best in its class.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2004"}

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!!features a total of 13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in thePunch-Out!!series. Each have their own backstory and patterns of attacks to learn and learn to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.","reviewerName":"Kyle Slayzar","summary":"The Mac is Back in Black!!","reviewText":"If you're like me and you grew up with the original Mike Tyson's Punch Out and the Super Punch Out in the subsequent decade, then you probably got either really excited or shook your head when you saw that Nintendo was redoing the classic.  I personally was excited, but hesitant to give the game a shot since Nintendo has really put out some crappers lately and the third-party games were even worse.  It's as though they focus all their efforts into one super game every years (Mario Kart for 2008) and then everything else just gets the scraps.Enter Punch Out.The layout of Punch Out is very simple; try to knock out your (very campy) opponents by blocking, countering, and using the star-power punches leftover from both MT Punch Out and Super Punch Out.  The opponents, in loving tradition with both the NES, Arcade, and SNES versions, are extremely campy.  In fact, their campiness has been amplified.  Glass Joe has a striking French accent (which REALLY makes me wanna lay the punches) while Von Kaiser utters stereotypical German phrases such as \"Auchtung!!\" and so forth.  And, of course, the not-so loveable King Hippo is back to hug you and have his shorts fall off every time you hit him in the stomach.  Oh, and let us not forget a secret character from the Mario Universe that has come to put the bannanas... er, gloves on.While some of the cultural stereotypes are exactly that and may seem offensive, they are in line with the Punch Out tradition... not to mention EVERYONE gets made fun of (including the Canadians) and it's all in good fun.As for the controls.  Some reviewers have already referenced Wii Sports Boxing and immediately breathed a sigh of relief.  I'm in that group as well but I must also compare Punch Out to other existing boxing games for the Wii such as Don King's and Facebreakers; they all SUCK.  Many times you can be pummeling in the air very quickly and the game will fail to realise what you're doing and start initiating random moves making the AI nearly impossible to beat (You hear me Facebreakers?!).I was quickly able to figure out the controls (be advised I'm using the Wii Remote and Nunchuck) and learn to use them to my advantage.  Unlike Wii Sports boxing, where you have to lean the controls left/right to dodge, Punch Out allows you to move by either leaning on the Wii Fit balance board or using the controller on the Nunchuck to dodge and/or duck.  This is a LOT easier.I only have one complaint as to the regular controls; when you want to punch up you have to press up on the Nunchuck controller.  This is true for both hands so you have to press up with the left to punch up with the right.  This can be very odd at first but can be overcome after a while.I tried using the Wii Fit balance board to box (which, like EA Active, ignores the weight limit), but I found it to be too limiting as I felt somewhat clastrophobic, really boxed in and I slipped off several times.  After two bouts I quickly put the balance board away and worked simply with the remote and nunchuck.The AI difficulty seemed difficult at first, but once I discovered that, like real boxing, you have to dodge and take punches as well to counter, playing the game became exceptionally easier.  My only limitation was that my arms got really sore after about 30 minutes to an hour of play.  This means I need more practice.  Fortunately, I have the EA Active to practice boxing, but an advanced workout mode would've been a nice touch to Punch Out.Another few elements I really liked about Punch Out was how they incorporated a LOT of elements from the original games including a loading screen of the NES Mac running, sound effects, and even your overweight trainer... who is also a stereotype.  Like Samuel L. Jackson, I keep subconsciously placing \"motha *insert expletive here*\" at the end of everything he says (Try it, it's fun!).Lastly is multiplayer.  My co-worker and I (who, by the way, do NOT work for Nintendo, EA, or any other video game developer) tried multiplayer last night and found ourselves button mashing (well, punching wildly) at the air not knowing what the crap we're doing.  Then came on giga Mac, the powerful Barry Bond version of Little Mac, and two \"wtf mate\" later we finally figured out just how different multiplayer speeds are from regular mode.I guess my only real beefs are that the new additions really aren't that special such as the re-match mode after you complete the main game.  This does NOT take away from the game experience, however.  My other ones are the cultural stereotypes but, unlike other politically correct forces in the world, I'll get over it.Punch on!!  A worthy purchase!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E6NE","description":"","reviewerName":"546598","summary":"com bat","reviewText":"Bioshock games tend to be extremely ambitious both in storytelling and the choices one can make in the game; whether those choices involve the plot or the gameplay itself. Is Bioshock Infinite any good though? Especially compared to the excellent first Bioshock? The answer is a resounding yes. Let us detail the ways:Narrative: I've always considered the first Bioshock's story to be rather light other than the massive twist in the middle of the game, but Bioshock Infinite does not suffer from this. The main character Booker and the damsel-in-distress he must save are both fascinating characters. The ending is phenomenal and the game is worth playing just for that. The only downside to the story is the lack of clarity when it comes to the consequences of one's choices. And this paragraph is merely a light description of how grand the narrative really is.Gameplay: The gameplay in Bioshock Infinite is quite enjoyable. The gunplay is never too fast to disorient you and I found the guns easy to use and fun to experiment with. The only downside to the weaponry is that you can only carry two guns at one time. I missed Bioshock's weapon wheel and the ability to choose any of my guns at any time. The vigors are quite interesting (especially Murder of Crows and the Bucking Bronco) but I found that I used them rarely, if at all, and mostly just to supplement my lack of ammo for the guns. The most remarkable aspect of combat is your ally Elizabeth who supplies you with ammo and salts and can open up tears which can greatly aid one in combat. The sky lines are also a great way to open up combat as you can easily flank your opponents.Graphics: The city of Columbia is highly detailed and extravagant. While many could say the beginning is a bit slow, I found it exhilarating as one could explore Columbia and see all the interesting buildings that litter the landscape. While the graphics are not completely realistic, I found them quite amazing.Audio: The tv I own is not the greatest, so I am not going to properly judge the sound of Bioshock Infinite, but I do have a slight annoyance with it. I found it frustrating that I had to be looking at a person head on to hear anything they say, despite the fact that I could be standing shoulder to shoulder to them. That was a bit frustrating.All in all, Bioshock Infinite is a grand game. There are countless other things I could have gone more in depth about, but there is simply too much to cover. I will be honest, I beat the game in about nine hours which was perfect since I was pressed for time at that moment, but regardless there is plenty of replay value to be had with this game, an absolute must-buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXFKE","description":"","reviewerName":"the gamer","summary":"I think ubi soft assassinated the team responsible for making the last game to make this one","reviewText":"Well I got this game during the gold box deal for around 30 dollars when it was still going for about 60 dollars before.This is a long review so if you don't want a long read just head to the conclusion I make it quite brief but for detailed explanations of problems go ahead and read.I am pretty glad I didn't pay full price for it. I knew it was going to have problems right when I heard the premise of the game back when they were still working on it and how it was going to take place during the American revolution. The though of hardly any buildings to free run on or up went into my mind and made me think &#34;this wont feel to much like the previous games&#34; and I was right. Don't get me wrong I wasn't getting this expecting it to be just like the previous games only to be put off by a new design in a way. I kinda knew what I was getting my hands on after seeing some reviews of it.Unfortunately the main character (not Desmond the other guy) Connor (or whatever his Native American name that I can't remember cause it was difficult just to pronounce and they didn't even really use it much at all in the game) is quite forgettable. He feels almost just like Desmond in a way about begin forgettable.I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't played but the beginning part of the game is different then the rest. I actually heard about this from reviews and such and even when I started playing I was surprised by what they did. Idk if it was in a good way or not just surprised. The plot twist near the end of the first part of the game was something I was actually thinking about recently wondering if they would do something like that or not and when I saw it happen in game I was like &#34;no way!&#34; that in a way was a good surprise to me.Anyways getting back to the main character Connor it was interesting they had actual native American language in the game but at times I kinda felt annoyed by it. I thought it was cool but for some reason that language sounds annoying to me no offense to any native Americans out there. I liked that they put it in there but at the same time I was like &#34;this sounds annoying&#34; maybe cause its like different in a way such as the old joke of Germans saying words like &#34;I love you&#34; in German and it sounds like they are mad at you or something. :PConnors story though is forgettable and im not apparently the only one who through so from all the reviews iv seen around. Its been said he feels like a one sided character or something like that or has no emotional connection. I felt this way during the game not really carrying to much for Connor.The fact you spend most of your time running or ridding a horse to get from destination to destination becomes tedious after a while. Its worse when you have to run through the snow but is realistic since I live in ND and have actually been in those situations of being annoyed I can't get to a destination very fast cause im up to my knees in thick snow having to walk/run there.To add to this the fact the horse was so bugy in this game was also annoying. I found myself getting so frustrated at the horse and wanting to take my gun and shoot it because of how stupid it would be. I could go up hills and such or jump up rocks but when it came time to run and jump off a rock only so far off the ground or go around a bush that was in the way the horse would just be like &#34;nope im not going to do anything&#34; and then stop and wouldn't budge and sometimes wouldn't allow me to get off unless I backed up something. I found myself abandoning my horse at times in the wild just because it was faster to run then try and get the horse to walk all the way around an area just to get down from a higher spot.The hunting in this game is a fun part but gets old fast at least for me. Maybe cause im not a hunter in real life but well after you kill a bear with the button matching cut scene once you have kinda done it enough, same with wolves. The crafting was interesting at first but then that got really old fast to. The part where you craft a barrel and its like &#34;congratulations you have made a barrel&#34; was really stupid to me and not in a funny way.The map though that you update by finding high spots like old assassins creed games is worse then them. I am actually quite amazed they decided to forget older improvements and make some aspects worse for this game. Even if you update the map with all the sync high spots its still hard to see trails and such on it. I found myself not even wanting to go around much in the wild areas just to update the maps at times.There were a few spots where you had to climb a tree to update the map and the first tree I tried to do that on I spent like a half an hour trying to climb it to get to updating the map and each time I though I was going the right way up the tree it turned out later that I had to turn around and go up a different way. The thought never occurred to me because it was so bland and hard to spot where to go up the tree to get up it made it difficult. I fell off that tree at least 20 times trying to get to the next branch. I did manage to figure it out though and updated the map with all the sync points but even then the map isn't very updated in the wild areas at least.There were a lot of glitches when I played this game (probably cause it was around when it first came out and they hadn't had a chance to fix some of them and send out a patch yet) such as free running glitches where instead of going one way he would turn and go up a building somewhere else. I got stuck and out of sync many times because of that which made me extremely pissed at the game when playing. This is an assassins creed game so I was expecting it from previous games but not to this extent. Other reviewers have also made this remark so I know im not the only one.In some of the assassination missions I was actually amazed at how they wanted me to finish them to get full sync some of them from playing through them a few times made me think &#34;how are you suppose to even do this and still get full perfect sync&#34; cause some were telling you not to be detected at all even though there wasn't many hiding spots and enemies were in patrols in a way where it was extremely hard to take out a guy and get back to hiding before the other guy would notice.I found most of the full sync requirements were made just to piss off players who are completionists. One of the missions that I kinda just described wanted me to not be detected at all and only assassinate one guy as well as not allow one of the other native American's to get killed. I spent a bunch of time just trying to make it up the hill without being spotted. I spent about a half an hour to an hour doing that and then when I got to the point where I was really close I climbed up the back of the house and was going to do an air assassination to finish the mission. Unfortunately for me the games so buggy that it decided to assassinate the guy near the one I wanted to assassinate and made me screw up full sync and made me spend time chasing after the target for 15 minutes before he stood still long enough for me to kill him. At that point I wasn't going to spend another hour or so just replying the whole mission over just to get full sync. I found that to be the case for most of the missions where I missed one little thing.Updating the &#34;homestead&#34; was a fun little side project in a way but does become tedious after a while from having to walk and run from place to place all the time to do things without fast travel options. Then once you get all that done you find out your not really getting any money though it and that the only thing you do get is the ability to craft things (some of which seem to do absolutely nothing). There was an option to make more naval ships or something at one point I figured they would be used to help me during the boating missions and after I crafted the most I could and played the missions I saw no other boats out there to help me. I have absolutely no idea what the point of crafting them was for because the game never told me and I never saw it. Some of you might know and want to comment telling me the purpose for them but the fact I saw no gratification for crafting them at all during the game then it must not have been important for me to even have the option of crafting them.On that note the naval missions was one part I found the most fun out of the game. Getting to sail a ship in waters and slow or speed it up and shoot cannons at enemy vesicles was quite fun. Again it was difficult at times getting full sync when sometimes I didn't have time to pay attention to what the orders were at the time. It wasn't till later after doing most of the naval missions that I found out I could switch to the other ammunition I had already bought. That was kinda a let down not knowing how to use it earlier on.During the actual story missions it was a bit of a pain that you would be required to travel a long ways without using fast travel things only to find that there really was no point other then making the game last longer by having you run from one point to the other for a cut scene anyways.There was also the fact you could recruit assassins which I was excited about because of the previous games but you were limited to only a handful of assassins you could recruit and they were all the same none of them died only become wounded and so you would have to wait 5-20 minutes for them to be able to do stuff again. It is more realistic but it just wasn't as good I felt the previous games had made it. Ontop of that after getting my first assassin and sending him on missions I found for some reason a lot of the missions were extremely difficult for the assassins unless they had 2-3 assassins with them to improve the odds on almost all the missions until later when the assassins were higher up in experience.  Most of the time they would fail them. There is also the fact you could only use them in town based ways. If you ran into some red coats in the wild you had to take them on yourself no assassins to help you. Or if you took on a command post in the wild you had to do the whole thing yourself. They aren't that difficult but the fact they just would not let you use other assassins ever annoyed me.In town areas where your allowed to loosen the control of the red coats in that area is kinda like the previous games but unfortunately I went at it right away without much thought on how much x's I had on me at the time. When I was in new york I helped a guy get the rest of his veggies while I killed red coats and then found myself the most recognized in town and then spent the next hour trying to get to a printing press guy to pay him off so that I could lose all my x's and so that the red coats wouldn't instantly attack me on sight. Unfortunately for me though there was only one on my map and no wanted posters to find so I had to keep going to an area FULL of redcoats and try and get into the building before being seen which was not an easy task. I ended up sacrificing my assassins to get their attention while I finally made it in long enough to pay off the guy to lose all my x's and then be able to walk around and do some stuff without constantly having them try and kill me. It would have been nice the game would have warned me or something at that time after that I spent most of my time looking all over for one or two wanted posters to get myself less recognizable in order to do the liberating missions which would automatically give me x's. So basically it was a rinse and repeat type of style.Iv kinda rambled to much but ill try to finish up this review. The story was okay it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. Some missions were much more difficult then others and there were problems here and there.I know this was kinda a new area for them to try and do because there wasn't many buildings they could use the free running design on. They really should have worked more on fixing up a lot of the bugs and doing some testing. I wont get into the last mission because of the fact there is probably a bunch of players who have already wrote huge reviews on just that alone. I have seen on some popular gaming sites they have devoted entire articles to just how bad that final mission is. As they have put it &#34;its like they didn't even do any testing to see if players could figure it out.&#34; I somehow luckily made it through but not in the way they wanted me to. I kept trying for full sync before finally giving up and just wanting to see the ending of the game I  somehow made it through a route that wasn't the way I was suppose to go in the ship but I still made it without looking it up online so that counts. :PThe Desmond levels were &#34;okay&#34; but well most of the Desmond levels in the previous games were always kinda boring. It was interesting getting a bit more insight into the Desmond character and finally getting a better understanding of whats going on but well for those playing through and seen the ending of the game you will probably be glad or upset they did what they did. They will probably have another assassins creed game but technically they could just end it here if they wanted to.Another thing I want to add is that I had just finished up AC revelations right before playing this game and have to say it seems like they had two separate groups making these games. Even though Revelations was short it had a good story but there was these little things that made it much better that im extremely surprised aren't in this game. One I can think of a good example of is the fact in the previous game when you entered a crowd of people to become incognito you could actually let go of the joystick and all that and Ezio would walk with the group the same speed. Unlike previous games where you had to basically try and keep up either going to fast or to slow. Why this wasn't added to this game is beyond me. I think I saw it happen maybe once or twice the entire time but usually it never used this. This is just one example but there were others I just can't think of them now.One other thing to add is to finding the fast travel points in town you had to go through an underground tunnel system to unlock the doors to allow fast travel between them in town. It was interesting at first but got old fast. They didn't add any secrets really it was just a big maze with many dead ends and then later on in the game near the end you got to blow up some walls to make new passage ways. I would have liked more secret areas that had chests or loot but I guess thats to much to ask for when they have to rush and pump these out once a year.Conclusion:I found this game to be fun in a way. It was a nice story I guess but the main character was forgettable which is a shame cause I bet they will make a few spin offs with Connor in them. Because it was set during the American Revolution there weren't many buildings to free run on in this game which doesn't give it the assassins creed feel like the previous games. I am glad they didn't just stick places in there to allow free running but yeah. There were also way to many bugs and problems that should have been fixed before shipping this game. The only part of the game I found the most fun I would say was the naval missions. They also seemed to employ someone who really wanted to torture people who want to be completionist when it comes to full sync cause some of this missions you would have to have dumb luck in order to get full sync on them.The final mission was also a big problem which most reviewers have dedicated full articles to how bad it was so I wont get into that much. This was a new area for the Ubi Soft team to go and they made some interesting choices but they rushed this game with all the bugs they have in it. I miss the days when game companies couldn't just ship out a game half done and then be able to patch it later. They were forced to make sure it worked fully cause they couldn't patch it later on. Like I said near the beginning of this review I am glad I didn't pay full price for this game but I feel sorry for those who per-ordered it and such. The next game will hopefully be a lot better if they plan to make another one.I think they realized soon after shipping this game out that it wasn't that good so that's why they had deals here and there for only 30 dollars for the game so they could announce &#34;we sold 7 million copies already within the first week of release&#34; cause a week later people would probably get wise to the problems in the game and maybe wait to buy it. I would say wait till this game is down to 20-30 bucks before buying because by then maybe a lot of the problems will be patched.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2013"}

I usually wouldn't write a preemptive review like this, but hey, if the game gets any less awesome by the finale I will be sure to update this review. As it stands, I just don't see that happening at all. If you are a big fan of the original, and I am, I assure you that you will be BLOWN AWAY by this game. Much like the first game, this game starts off with a bang (within maybe 2 minutes the chaos ensues) and keeps your heart pumping throughout. I really can't wait to see where the story goes. Also, very cool that they reveal Issac's character a lot more and so far the game has done a great job with that.Just two things that have thrown me off so far (neither of which are by any means a dealbreaker for me, but worth mentioning). The xbox 360 version comes with 2 discs. So I anticipate that I'll have to switch discs at some point. Whatever, no biggie. Also, I'm a little bummed that they took out the map in DS2. A lot of critics came down on the in-game map that DS1 featured, but frankly I liked it and used it all the time. Doesn't bring my rating of the game down at all, and I can kind of see why they wouldn't put it in this game as it wouldn't fit in quite the same, but I do kinda miss it. Aside from that, they've brought back all the good and improved on all the rest.I have been waiting for this game a long time and it is arguably my most anticipated game for this year.

However, it's a very awesome, intense 3 hours...and despite it's length, I would recommend this to just about anyone who loves a good shooter or military action game.  The story seems realistic, the voice acting is very well done, and the graphics are pretty amazing...especially in certain parts.  There is ground combat on foot and in tanks...all pretty awesome...and there is some air combat from the cockpit of a fighter jet.Though all of it was pretty awesome, my favorite level was probably the air combat level.  Basically you man the weapons system in the cockpit of a fighter jet while one of your comrades pilots it.  During ascention from the carrier and on route to your objective, be sure to take in the sights.  You can look left & right out the window and the scene is simply amazing.  When you get to your ojective, you engage in a dog fight with some terrorist pilots and then bomb a bunch of targets on an enemy air strip.

It also played brilliantly and influenced team work as well as any other game at the time. The sequel takes this and increases the font size to extra-large, decreases recoil to the point where it's unnoticable, and auto-aim so helpful there's no benefit of actually aiming any more. You can tell this game was ported to the PC at the last minute. The original was so rich in detail that here it looks like someone coloured the brushes with the dregs of cheap and nasty potato and leek soup.It's no longer high resolution and looks really inept at the side of the original. The maps have a horrible orange tinge to them but surprisingly aren't very colourful thanks to blurring effects which I can only assume is put in there for anti-aliasing. The gameplay has only changed a bit, but it's the same game but feels more lazy and disjointed. There's an increase in special infected, and a few more special weapons, but I couldn't help but think Valve could have just released DLC for the original. But of course they want us to buy a brand new game for full-price for their efforts.Maps aren't as structured any more, by that the special infected are more frequent which makes the game feel sloppy as none of the new additions are very inspiring. The maps are more open now but as a result don't feel as well put together. Melee weapons make the sequel seem more of a joke, at least the original kept a sense of seriousness. There's a frying pan which makes a comedic \"twang\" when used. The characters in this game are awful, uninspired and not a patch on the original four.A friend bought me this gift for bargain price because if he'd have payed full-whack for this I'd have kindly asked him to get a refund.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWTAQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Alex \"47\"","summary":"More \"Burnout\" than \"Need for Speed\"","reviewText":"Graphics: Most Wanted has plenty of pluses and minuses graphically. When I first saw this game for the first time I thought it looked outstanding. Once I got it, I was underwhelmed. It still looks good, but nothing like the videos. Edges of cars and the environment have a choppy appearance, and the city in the distance really looks like a PS1 or PS2/Xbox game. When it comes down to the races, sense of speed, and the cars themselves though, it looks fairly impressive... especially with how the framerate holds up -- for the most part -- when there are a bunch of cops and/or crashes on-screen. The temporary blindness when looking into the sunset or when coming out of a tunnel is also a nice effect. 4/5Sound: Again, positives and negatives here. First, some positives: The cars sound awesome, especially if you have a pair of headphones for your 360 (Tritton, Turtle Beach, etc.). The way the cars echo in tunnels and in alleyways is great. It's nice to see Criterion add things like that to the game. The soundtrack, I think, is pretty good. It has a nice mix of dubstep and hard rock that only add the experience when in a race. The downside I have with the soundtrack already is that in just about 3 hours of playtime, I have heard some songs 5 times already. I'm not sure how many tracks are in the game, but my assumption is that it isn't many. If you don't like the song list, you can turn it off completely, or use your own playlist. The biggest downfall -- and it's not really a huge one -- with NFS:MW would have to be the police chatter. It's always the same routine ... \"What make and model? What color? We need more cops. These guys aren't messing around. These guys are good.\" It's really rather redundant, and it's a shame, because it could have added a lot to the game. 4/5Fun: My first impression of this game wasn't all that great. I was pretty underwhelmed. The more I explored the city, unlocked cars, completed races, and especially tried out the multiplayer, the more I enjoyed it. While the game only contains 41 cars, there is enough to do with each of them to keep you playing this game -- even on single player -- for quite a decent while. The biggest downfall of this game is probably the single player, surprisingly enough. It's been a lot of fun so far, but after just a few hours of playing the game, I'm almost halfway done with getting all of the Most Wanted cars. I really just wish Criterion/EA added more content to the disc. Thankfully, the multiplayer makes me forgive this lack of single player depth. The challenges in multiplayer are, for the most part, very entertaining. While the online isn't without flaws (They're rather minor things, but you'll pick up on them quite quickly if you decide to hop online), it's definitely entertaining, and playing this game without the Online Pass would take away a LOT of what Most Wanted has to offer. 4.5/5If you have any interest in racing games, you have to get this game. After zipping through the city and thinking I had seen everything, I explored areas I had no idea existed. Fairhaven is a vast, fun city to race around in, and it's only better with friends or even randoms. It may not be without its problems, and it could use a bit more depth, but this exhilarating, essential sequel to Burnout Paradise makes Need for Speed: Most Wanted a must-buy for adrenaline junkies.Pros: Multiplayer, variety of Fairhaven's landscapes, varied car list.Cons: No cops in multiplayer, minor online bugs, 41 cars seems a bit low, short single-player experience.4.25/5EDIT 11/1/12: I've only had the game for two days, and while I'm still having fun with the game, I have a feeling it won't last much longer. Without trying to get all of the Most Wanted cars too quickly, I already have 9 of the 12. Not only is it easy to get the Speed Points to unlock the races, it's easy to unlock the cars as well. The city is pretty nice as I said in the original review, but I feel like it could get stale within just a few weeks because I find myself on the same major roads over and over again. The multiplayer is pretty fun, but only for about a half hour at a time. The upgrading the car thing and unlocking things for all of them the more you use them online and off is fun and all, but I'm really thinking this game ought to be about $35, and not $60. Super frantic races and events, but there just isn't enough depth, particularly in the single player.(If you enjoyed this review, check out some others I've written at 47Reviews.BlogSpot.com)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2012"}

The fire-fights are amazing, with or without bullet time, and the weapons are all unique and fun to use.The plot - so important for a game like this - is only marginal.  All the twists are told through graphic novel-style comic book panels.  While they look perfect and capture a wonderful mood, the story itself is cliched and the plot often jumps all over the place.  The voice acting is great, but lonely college kids pose as models in the panels, and look ridiculous.

E Jackson","summary":"disappointing and unnecessary","reviewText":"The number one biggest problem with Resident Evil: Code Veronica is that it's *completely* unnecessary if you go into it having thoroughly played and completed Resident Evil 1 and 2.Code Veronica basically combines the mansion of the first RE and the atmosphere and puzzles of the second RE and tries to paint a fake picture of being a completely new game with updated graphics and atmosphere, when in fact, that couldn't be further from the truth.  This game is just a huge waste of time compared to the previous games in the series.The biggest problem is that (and this is a HUGE problem) if you've already played the first two Resident Evil games, you will probably feel completely bored with Code Veronica and be left with the impression of \"Been there, done that\".  This game was outdated even when it was brand new because it adds absolutely nothing that we haven't already experienced previously.I *only* recommend playing Code Veronica if you're new to the classic style Resident Evil series (in other words, if you haven't played the mid to late 90's Resident Evil games).If you go into this Code Veronica having played the first three RE games, you will be *severely* disappointed because it does absolutely NOTHING new or innovative.  All this game does is progress the story a little bit, but the gameplay itself is stale and pointless.The enemy variety is also horrible.  Zombies, dogs, more zombies, more dogs... that sums up the majority of the enemies you will discover in this game, with the addition of an overrated new enemy called bandersnatchers.  Oh sure, the way these enemies can elevate themselves to new heights when you reach the second floor is impressive and somewhat unsettling as far as fear is concerned, but other than that, these enemies do absolutely nothing for me, and they definitely aren't in the same league as hunters or lickers.Steve is an annoying character too.  I dislike him a lot.I've seen arguments over which Resident Evil game is better- this one, or Nemesis.  I can *promise* you that Nemesis absolutely smokes this game into a million little pieces.  Nemesis adds progression to the gameplay (such as the ability to make your own ammo) and feels so much better than Code Veronica it's not even funny.Also, Code Veronica suffers from WAY too much needless backtracking.  We're talking about a *serious* moment of wandering back and forth here folks, the likes of which never happened in a Resident Evil game before this one was released.  It's definitely quite tedious and unnecessary.The game removes the \"still frames\" that were dominant in the previous Resident Evil games, but since the majority of time is being spent walking through previously explored empty areas, this isn't exactly some major, exciting leap in gameplay or anything.  In fact, it doesn't matter at all.Overall, probably best to avoid this game and pick up Resident Evil 2 and 3 instead (the two best games in the series IMO).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2010"}

Don't get me wrong, I'm a strong supporter of both Square-Enix and Disney. It was just, at first sight, Kingdom Hearts didn't quite gel with me. So, recently, I go into my local videogame store around payday looking for me a portable RPG to play. Sadly, the Nintendo DS nor the PSP didn't have any games that I hadn't already played so I took a look at the Gameboy Advance section. While there were other games I wanted to play, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories won out in the end. I don't know whether it was outstanding boxart, the fact that the store clerk told me it was an excellent game, or the fact that Donald and Goofy appealed to my inner child...the more I looked at the game, the more I wanted it.Upon booting up the game, I could tell from the opening intro FMV cutscene that production values were definitely high on this game. I was simply amazed that, despite its' technical limitations, the system was able to do it at all....but it was. The game itself, although changed into more of a card-battle type action-RPG, was a deeply challenging one that felt like I was playing the console game. From what I've heard, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is more of a recap of the first game but with a different story. You see, in this story, Sora journeys through Castle Oblivion looking for his friends. As he does, he battles through another version of his memories.  Upon completing the game, you can play through again as Riku with a different storyline as well. So, you get two games in one...basically.  While I've yet to touch the second game, one thing is for sure- Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is one of the best GBA experiences I've had since Golden Sun. If you've read any of my reviews; you'd know, by now, that Golden Sun is one of my all-time favorites. So, to make the comment I made, you know it'd have to be something special.While this game will definitely appeal to Kingdom Hearts fans looking for another Final Fantasy cameo filled fix, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories will also appeal to Casual gamers as well.Be forewarned, though, this game isn't no Yu-Gi-Oh! or Duel Masters and it's a very challenging game..indeed. So, come in looking for a challenge. If I had any gripes about the game, that would be it. There's alot of trial and error before getting the right deck to see you through til the end.Hopefully, Tetsuya-san and the fine folks at Square-Enix will continue the Kingdom Hearts story with more portable games(yet, without the card-battle angle). I hope so, anyways.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2006"}

Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"Robert Evans \"Robert\"","summary":"An N64 Legend","reviewText":"Perfect Dark is a superior and I agree with one of the reviewers...ERRRR...It...Does beat halo..I can't believe I said that.

{"product_name":"B001TD6SK8","reviewerName":"Ben-Oni \"Darkness\"","summary":"Good game  with a Couple of issues.","reviewText":"Alright. Firstoff the graphics in this game are awesome but they don't do a lot with them its do a mission, sit up on the clocktower and eat icecream throughout the whole game. All of the locations are extremely pristine especially for a transfer to a handheld system but despite their stunning accuracy to what we saw in KH one and two there isn't that much to them.Secondly the magic and healing items and weapons  are not as  automatic or iterchangable as they were in the ps2 games. They must be equipped via the touchscreen. I found this to be extremely troublesome because you have to weight your items and abilities by what you think might be more important and install them in panels  instead of always havuing all of them at your disposal this includes your leveling up . Your magic is also very inaccurate. I shot magic at several enemies I was locked onto and it still missed.The last thing that bothered me was the fact that you'll find yourself playing very annoying games of cat and mouse or \"stay out of sight\" often with the person you're trying to track or avoid having a very large field of vision and even turning  all the way around to look behind them.  There aren't a lot of these but they are the most annoying and pointless events I've ever seen in a kh game.Storywise this game is beautiful and  heartbreaking as is much of the KH storyline. Its yet another bridge  between KH one and two and essential to understanding just how sad Roxas's story truly is. Its very good and though the game may be redundant in some respects or annoying its worth playing through just for the full story.A few words of adviceDO NOT use an  action replay card with this game. the cheats suck and though it claimed to be giving me 1000 experience points per mission, I looked at my level before I went to fight the final boss. It was twelve. I couldn't defeat the boss so I had to start the game over again.Secondly DO EVERY MISSION ASSIGNED AND FILL THE GAUGE. a  good deal of the missions are optional and even the ones that aren't often only require you to do so much but if you fill the mission gague completely and do every mission instead of advancing the calendar, you'll level up faster and be at a much better advantage when fighting the  final boss. The only exception to this advice is the mission where you have to defeat at least six heartless bosses. The seventh is  pretty much invincible so stop at six. Overdo your job and it will pay off big.OPEN EVERY CHEST.  You'll get a heartless every now and then but  it allows you to synthesize better weapon panels.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}

Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible.

Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak.

That is VF4 EVO: it has speed of Soul Calibur, simple combos and complicated heavy attacks and it has quest mode, too. Some fighters are Tekken lookalikes and there is sidestepping, but unfortunately there is only one sidestep attack, G+P+K.The thing I like about game is quest mode which gives you different tasks, but when you reach arcade no. 3 or 4, can't remember, tasks become too long. There are lotsa combos, but you have to know BOTH your character in deep and CPU character in arcade mode to win. Game is quicker than, say, Tekken 3 so countering moves is complicated. Heavy attack grapples and strikes require lightning fast fingers and some characters are just too slow in that department...and yeah, Akira's doble flying kick takes out anyone...or I am too old for this :)Buy! 20 dollars is nothing considering satisfaction game gives you!I must add that, after all those months I spend after writing review, Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution has GREAT replay value, better than other games I tested.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2005"}

Berntsen","summary":"With mods, this is hands down the best version.","reviewText":"Many people seem to write off the PC version of Dark Souls because of some flaws that the game launched with due to the developer's inexperience with the PC format. Fortunately, thanks to Nexus Mods, most of these problems are easily remedied. In addition to base mod that lets you run the game at 1080p and 60 FPS (if you have a decent rig), if you do not wish to use an Xbox 360 controller you can download a mouse fix to make the game control as smoothly with a mouse and keyboard as it does with a controller. I also recommend the Silver UI, and the optional keyboard icons file if you are using a keyboard.It is in the nature of Dark Souls to be a bit sadistic and make you work to get what you want, and that applies not only to the gameplay but also setting up the game. Once you've taken the necessary steps to install the mods though, this is without question the ultimate Dark Souls experience. Once you have experienced DS with 1080p graphics and 60 FPS gameplay, you will never want to go back to the console version! This is an excellent RPG that belongs in any genre enthusiast's Steam library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2012"}

Supporting optional 3-D hardware, the game features a free-look movement system, allowing players to pan 360 degrees in any location. There are five new ages to explore, each featuring a unique visual style. The story line focuses on a new character, a villain whose home world was ruined by Sirrus and Achenar (familiar to those who have played the previous games), and has returned to take revenge against Atrus and his family. Explore the environment and solve puzzles to uncover the mystery of this new adversary.","reviewerName":"Marc Ruby&#8482; \"The Noh Hare&#8482;\"","summary":"Best of Its Breed!!","reviewText":"Once again Myst reappears on gameplayer's horizons, as the story is extended into more new worlds.  The Myst series of puzzle games has a well deserved following.  It was with a great deal of anticipation that I booted up the latest Myst adventure.The basic premise of the game is quite straightforward (if you are familiar with Myst).  Atrus has invited you to come over to talk about Releeshahn, the new world he has created.  He has gathered together the surviving D'ni so that they might move to this new world to start their civilization over.  Just as he's about to show you the book that acts as the transfer station to Releeshahn a strange character with a severe case of bad hair appears out of nowhere, snatches the book and vanishes after setting Atrus' study on fire.  All he leaves behind is a transfer book to J'nanin, the training world built for Atrus' two insane sons.  Being a natural hero, you grab the book and hare out after the thief.In short order you discover that Saavedro, the thief, is seeking revenge for the destruction of his world by Sirrus and Achenar, Atrus's sons and the villains of the original \"Myst.\"  A tragic figure who has lost his home, his family and a good bit of his sanity, Saavedro is bent on vengeance.  Unable to track down the sons, he has focused on the father, and turned J'nanin into a huge trap.  Travelling though the worlds of this game, it is up to you to solve the mysteries and find a resolution for this grim tale of horror and revenge.Typical of all the \"Myst\" games, the plot is pretty minimal.  It serves primary to provide the player with continuity while solving the many ingenious puzzles.  As always, the puzzles are of a Rube Goldberg nature, made up of strange contraptions and countless smaller puzzles.  \"The Exile\" exercises some restraint, so most of these challenges can be solved by a great deal of wandering around, careful observation and some good guesses.To make up for what is essential a very calm, non-violent game, the designers have outdone themselves in creating the five worlds of \"Myst 3.\"  The artwork and scale are magnificent.  The animation is equally incredible.  This is the first time that I felt my 19-inch monitor was just too small.  Hopefully they will make some game posters.  I was continually being astonished by the imagination used in creating these worlds and their workings.  This is the best pure puzzle game I've seen in a long time and is well worth purchasing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2001"}

People who only exercise very casually or want some casual exercise to add on the side to their more rigorous routine will do very well with it.  If you're not already highly fit there are definitely aerobic options that will get your heart pumping, balance and yoga options that will leave you wondering how you managed to stand upright before you got more coordinated, and strength options that will have you aching for days.The games are fun, and since it tracks your time and makes charts of the results it can be very motivating for people who have trouble motivating themselves in other ways.  It can also be fun as a way to playfully compete with other people in your household and motivate each other that way.On the other hand, if you're extremely busy and need to pack a really solid workout in the absolute minimum amount of time, Wii Fit is probably not going to be your best choice.  Most of the workout games are fairly short, so a lot of time ends up being spent on getting feedback from the game and on selecting what the next game will be (if you want to maximize your workout though, you can step off the wii fit board during these parts and at least walk in place).  Really, you'll probably be better off with a DVD workout in that situation than you will with this product.I'm sure this is obvious to most people, but also Wii Fit won't make you an athlete of any kind if it's all you use as well.  If you use it very seriously you'll certainly see substantial improvement, but if you become serious about something like the Yoga, at some point you're going to want to move beyond doing one isolated pose at a time into doing full routines that flow from one pose to the next.On the subject of the Yoga, generally the descriptions of poses are very good, though there are some minor errors.  Even some people who are serious about the topic might find it interesting to get more feedback about exactly where they're placing their center of balance in order to fine tune a few positions.It's really a great product overall if you're trying to use it for what it was designed to do.  It's particularly great for giving so much balance training, since that's an area that many people don't otherwise think about much at all (and is an extremely important area of health, especially for older people who become prone to injure themselves in falls due to failing balance).  It really can be good exercise if you pay attention and try to do the activities well (and you're not already extremely fit, since for those people it's probably not strenuous enough).Have fun!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2009"}

I never really perfected the mouse keyboard scheme so I gave up on most shooters I tried back in the day.  Since then I have fallen in love with the genre and particularly the dual stick right trigger setup of most console FPSs,  that said I found myself using the outside of the 360's sticks to move and aim and this was uncomfortable but the only way for me to get any accuracy of shot and movement.  These sticks sit high but I find that I am never using the edges as I did without them and this has made my fingers less sore during and after gaming sessions.  Not exactly a revelation but taking them off makes the controller feel naked and the axises short. They aren't easy to get on and off and you could damage your controller if you really want to remove them a bunch as they really clamp on. These are almost every bit as essential as the REAL TRIGGERS for PS3 are for that system and from what I hear work best on 360s.

Generally, I dislike reboots, and feel that writers should just continue with the foundation already laid down. However, when I began playing this Tomb Raider reboot, I was enthralled right from the get go!Everything that I originally loved about the Tomb Raider series was still intact, except now the Lara Croft character had been fleshed out. You could see how she went from a novice, to a hardened adventurer. It's an all new side of the character that I found delicious.The best thing about this game was not the survival aspect, not the experience point system, and not the epic story of survival. The best part of this game was the length! So many games released these days have so little content, that they become a disappointment. They tend to trade single player campaign for multiplayer. This is not the case with Tomb Raider who gave us a complete package for our money! Not only is there a fantastic and lengthy storyline, that will leave any adventurist on the edge of their seat, but also a comprehensive multiplayer format, with plenty of maps already out for purchase as DLC.The only thing that could make this game perfect, would be some single player tombs sold as DLC, however Square Enix confirmed early on, that there would be no single player DLC released for the game. However, does it need it? No! It has hours of gameplay already in place. Would it be nice? Well, of course! When someone plays a game this good, you don't want it to end.Speaking of endings, I feel that was the only weak part of the game. The ending didn't match the scope of the rest of the game. I expected something bigger, more dramatic and rewarding, and what I got ended up just being a bit of a let down. If it was the ending of a lesser game? Fine, however with something that intense and great, you just expect more.I am looking forward to seeing what lies in store for Lara in the future of this new rebooted series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2013"}

It had great cut-scenes, beautiful graphics, simple puzzles and gameplay with a never-ending sense of fun. This has very much carried over with it's sequel with even more polished features, though the design is starting to feel a bit redundant.Uncharted 2 has even MORE impressive graphics than the first game. I mean seriously this game will blow you away with it's presentation. The story is MUCH more involved, the locations are much more varied (and again: beautiful!) and despite a some dull first few missions you're pretty much hooked until the end. The characters are just as charming in this sequel with a few new names to cast and everyone is voice-acted (and motion captured) to perfection.Unfortunately what the game improved with production, it lacks in the gameplay. The controls are even more polished to make combat, climbing and stealth much smoother but you're pretty much doing the same things you did in the first Uncharted. There's some great level designs, especially in urban environments but when you get to the jungle and outdoor levels (particularly the last level) everything feels a bit too familiar and redundant. Everythign you do in this game are things you did in the first Uncharted game....just more polished. I hate to call that a complaint but despite some eye-catching moments I couldn't help but feel a bit underwhelmed. Even the three puzzles were pretty mindless (though the one with the giant dagger was well designed).Despite my complaining I still like this game a lot. It's fun (to be fair MORE fun than the first Uncharted), funny and has great graphics and cut scenes. I know I'm in the minority here I just wish some more time would've been put into the gameplay innovation.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2009"}

After playing the second one I can say without hesitation that this one surpasses the first in every way. I didn't think that they could outdo the first but they did. The action is non-stop and the story line is very good. I even had a few chuckles from the dialogues that took place. The only thing that I would say that is negative is that the shooting mechanics are not the best. But then I am used to the shooting and cover mechanics of the Call of Duty series. One must realize that this is not primarily an first person shooter. This is mainly a third person action game. The most annoying thing about this game is the grenade throwing mechanics which are quite frustrating. But then again, I am used to the Call of Duty grenade throwing mechanics which allow you to throw grenades in a more natural fashion. These negative attributes, though, do not in any way remove this game from a five star rating as I realize that this game is a third person action game first. Also, if you have played any of the Prince of Persia games, you will feel right at home. The jumping, climbing and pole swinging are very similar. Some of the set pieces really looked like Prince of Persia's. The gears especially reminded me of the ones in Prince of Persia. Be aware, though, that it can get quite challenging if you are a casual gamer. But there is an easy mode for those of us who have a job and family to take care of. This game is for those who enjoy the story as much as the game mechanics. I really felt immersed in the world of Uncharted and often could not stop playing. I was trying to limit myself to one chapter at a time to help make the experience last. I often found myself playing two chapters in one sitting just because I could not stop. If you own a Playstation 3, this is the reason, besides the free online play on Playstation's Network, to own this system. I have the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 and the Xbox 360 is just collecting dust. Why? Because the available games on the Playstation 3 and the fact that you can play most online games for free on Playstation Network.

I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to have a great GH workout. This game is immensely fun on expert level, and therefore I am confident that, depending on your style and level of play, the appropriate difficult would be fun for you. While I was a little sad to see some of the songs put on here (\"No Leaf Clover\", e.g.), it was great to get a large dose of \"Master of Puppets\" (only two tracks are missing!), together with solid offerings from all of \"Kill 'Em All\", \"Ride the Lightning\" (although the title track is missing - for shame!) and \"...And Justice for All\" (I would have liked \"Blackened\" and the title track). In addition, they take my single favorite Metallica cover (the 11:30 \"Mercyful Fate\")...and a lot of other slop. But I was more happy with the selection here than that found on the odious \"GH: Aerosmith\".In addition, there is a large collection of guest acts, many of whom will seem quite esoteric to the non-Metallica fan (Diamondhead, Samhain and Mercyful Fate aren't bands that typically roll off the tongue today). I was incredibly pleased with the offering, but some might be left scratching their heads. One caveat: if you are one that is offended by occult lyrics, you might want to stay away. There is a lot of this to be found here.So, in short, I love the game. Not only is it fun, but it is challenging as well. If I had a complaint, it is that the trophies here are more for advertising online play and other instruments (you have to play EVERY instrument career to get some trophies, and you even have to download a song). None of them are hugely difficult (e.g. there is nothing like the \"Enlightened Guitarist\" achievement X-Box owners might remember from \"GH 3: Legends of Rock\", but they can be annoying to get.

The biggest difference is that there is an extra chapter not available anywhere else. This is why I bought the game - I wanted to play this chapter. While the chapter isn't bad, it isn't really necessary and isn't ever really referenced anywhere else in the games, novels or comics. So while it is canon, it's much like the first TPB of the comic - OK, not great, mostly forgettable and can't hurt canon because it doesn't offer much.Graphically, this version, assuming you have a decent video card, is superior to the 360 version given you can get much higher resolutions and texture quality.I love the ability to create maps, but there aren't a ton of people playing anymore, so this is more an exercise in having fun building than building something a bunch of other people will play.For the used game price of $20, it was worth it for the extra chapter.

In some movies it really stands out, but in most it's a very basic and very slight overall haze that makes the glasses cause the colors to pop more.Also the first content update dropped today - 3 new characters, 4 new stages, some exploits have been fixed, and a new online mode.  That's awesome :D**Title aside, Tekken Tag 2 has great graphics (Probably 3rd best 3d support on the PS3), controls, decent online interface, lots of items to customize your character with, and hard core fans were though of when this game was made.Tekken Tag 2 is a great game and it's geared toward its fans.  If you don't have time to set aside and practice and get great at this game, as you probably did with the previous games, then it's not for you.I've bought every Tekken game since... 3 I think.  I play them a lot and it's pretty simple - I beat arcade with everyone to see the neat little ending videos, I play with friends when they come by (back then more often than now) and that's it.Oh and I played Bowling for Tekken Tag 1 like crazy.As someone who doesn't have time to practice a lot and who just wants to get off work, play the game for an hour, and maybe see a neat video or two... It's the worse game ever made. I've never had such an annoying time with an end boss as the pair that this game ends with.  Like... Go through Arcade lasts me 1 hour annoying. I'm not someone who claims to be a pro gamer or anything, but I've played tons of fighting games in the past and eventually 'figured it out', this one... not so much. Just cheap tactics and it doesn't get any easy for me, at least.To rub it in worse the game doesn't have great loading times.. and you don't have option to 'try again' with the same characters you just played as, so you have to go through the full loading rotation of bringing up the character select screen and re-selecting your characters (which sometimes gives you a good 5 second lag inbetween the first and second because of random loading).But, if you're some all star Tekken hotshot who has memorized a character or two, that won't even bother you. So really consider your ability before you buy this game planning to earn a Platinum or go through the Arcade a bunch. You'll hope Jun is never in another Tekken game by the 4-5 run through.And so I won't take points off for that, the 1 star was lost because of -Loading Times - especially restarting a fight in arcade - you're looking at about 45 seconds before you're able to play again.Loading times also really suck in the shop where you customize your characters.  Yeah I got a bathing suit for every character.. but it would literally take me 2 hours to 'add' a costume for each character that has the bathing suit equipped.They took out Handicap or any way to control how much HP you have. Since Tekken is such a high-damage game (this one particularly) my buddies and I used to use this to make the rounds last longer than 2 hits by Paul... This game has absolutely no version of the option anywhere.And my Pros again -Controls - Very fluid, and they did a great job making the Tag system and moves related to it easy to use.Graphics - Beautiful and great 3d if you have a TV that supports it.Character selection - there is space for more and I hope I still have the game once they come out :POnline - I've yet to feel any lag and the practice mode while waiting is... cute.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2012"}

You'll need to be good: the stunts will get harder, and you must accumulate skills to progress from low-budget productions to multimillion-dollar Hollywood blockbusters. Each stunt consists of a series of clearly defined objectives, which can range from 180-degree spins to perfectly timed jumps, dramatic barrel rolls, and T-bone smashes. To succeed, the player must achieve all or some of each scene's set objectives. Stunts take place on movie sets in six different countries around the world; completing each stunt rewards you with bonus items for use in the Stunt Arena, which you create yourself.Stuntmanwas developed with the help of one of the movies' most experienced stuntmen, Vic Armstrong.","reviewerName":"jschristian44","summary":"Great fun and addictive","reviewText":"In this game, you are a driver of many different vehicles from Monster Trucks, Cars, Jeeps, Motorcycles, Snowmobiles, and Vans.  You go through many segments that make up a movie which you watch once your done with the segments.  The game can get very difficult in some scenes.  I have tried some scenes at least 50 times before I completed it, that is how hard it is.  There isn't a difficulty setting either.  Practice makes perfect when your playing this game.  They should have made it easier so you wouldn't be stuck on one level for 3 days, but I guess that is why the game is so short.  It has a very fun stunt constructor mode, where you set up ramps, cars, and fire rings for your car to demolish.  It is very fun.  The whole game in itself can get pretty addicting, but once you figure you can't complete a level after trying it 40 times, you pretty much just give up because it is so annoying.  I am not sure if I wanted to get the second one or not because of this, but overall, it is a cool game and deserves at least 4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2010"}

I've wanted this game since i saw it released over seas (called Forever Blue over there). I love the ocean and sea creatures, except sharks but the great part about this game is you can't die. I like this game for it's pure enjoyment, no other reason than that. Though it would be a great learning tool.Plot:Though you can not lose, die, or make mistakes in this game there is a goal. The goal of the game is to find a certain creature in the ocean, which you're boat mate tells you about as you progress in the game. The plot also thickens as you venture further and further out into the ocean. I don't want to give it away but it does have to do with your boat mate and she kind of gives you the story as to why she is out in the ocean and her background and asks for your help to find the creature.Controls:They are easy as pie. Press B and point and it gets you everywhere you want to go. You can take pictures with your camera, save them in an album, draw underwater with your underwater pen, feed the animals, pet the animals, train dolphins, and swim hands free all with ease.Pros:-Learn about sea life and creatures-It's like a hunt for treasure sometimes-How interactive it is-You can have online play with other friends who own the game-There is no loseing, dieing or time limit-You can stop at any point and save-You can put in your own SD card and listen to your own music while you swim-Being a diving instructor-Being the camera \"guy\" for a magazine-You get to fill the aquarium with fish of your choice-The video is awesome when you find some new underwater holeCons:There is only one thing that i would have liked to see more of and that is special requests. Diving requests, you take people around the ocean and try and find a certain fish/creature they wanted to see. Or picture reuquests, you get small and big fish requests for a magazine.Overall i think it's a great game. Sometimes i can sit there for so long i lose track of time. I think it's great for any age range, though it isn't packed full of action it does have it's perks.Other games i enjoy if you want to see if you relate to my likes and dislikes:-The Sims-Mario Kart-CSI-Metroid-Resident Evil-Guitar Hero-And of course Endless Ocean","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2008"}

Just becuase someone gave it a bad review doesn't mean you have to go into the game looking for promblems. You'll set yourself up for disappointment. I chose to completely ignore the reviews and judge the game by my own standards. Let me start by saying that I own all the Suikodens and the IV plays like a Suikoden should. The game has its flaws {the main character looks and moves stupid} but it isn't to the degree that people make it out to be. Someone said the graphics suck. I take it that person didn't really pay attention to the first three. If he had, he'd of realized that these graphics {though not stunning} are better than any Suikoden's ever had. Not saying this is the best Suikoden, but if you truely consider yourself a fan, then you shouldn't be dissapointed. I've seen reviews as low as 1 star.  ..... C'mon people, just cause it didn't knock your socks off doesn't mean you have to hate like that. Don't call the game BAD because it didn't meet YOUR expectations. I'm not far enough to say where this game fits in compared to the other three. But I am far enough to defend it against 1 star rating HATERS. If you call yourself a fan, you can get the game {which is $39 instead of $49} and judge it for yourself. You owe Konami that.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2005"}

New special moves and attacks, including the groundbreaking Final Smash. New items and assist trophies.","reviewerName":"Charles H.","summary":"This is one remarkable game!","reviewText":"When I was a youngster, Super Smash Bros. for N64 came out. I still recall the commercial where Mario, Yoshi, and Donkey Kong are dancing through a field, and then proceed to fight each other. The game's premise (Nintendo characters fighting each other) sounded like a great idea for a game, and it was. The original Super Smash Bros. was fun, but it had one small problem: not enough content. I don't recall how long it took me to unlock everything in that game, but it didn't take very long. After doing all of the 1-player stuff, SSB was only good for the occasional battle with friends who'd rather fight on an N64 wrestling game! :P I remember thinking to myself, \"This game is great, but they should make another one with about twenty times as much content!\"Fast forward gods know how many years: The game I dreamed of as a child has been made. I haven't finished unlocking all of the content in this game, and I don't know if I will. Completing all of the challenges would take true dedication and a good bit of Super Smash Bros. skills.The final unlockable in the original game was the Sound Test menu. In Brawl, they give you that menu from the word go, but you're constantly unlocking and/or trying to unlock new songs. The massive soundtrack in this game rocks. It's a hard rock affair. As one might expect, it's chock full of memorable melodies related to game's many Nintendo characters.Speaking of characters, there are plenty to go around. Along with the obligatory \"charter\" characters like Link, Samus, and Mario, you've got obscure and interesting characters like R.O.B. the Robot and Ice Climbers. Also, there are some non-Nintendo characters in this game like Sonic the Hedgehog and Solid Snake.The stages are interesting. There's a Donkey Kong Country style level, a pirate ship, a falling glacier, a Mario Kart track, the Bridge of Eldin from Twilight Princess, and many other fun places. Brawl also has some of the stages from Super Smash Bros.: Melee. I rather like the Donkey Kong themed level out of those. They're all pretty great though.This game also has a Stage Builder for making your own Super Smash Bros. levels. Its potential is limited by the scant variety of building blocks they give you, but with a little creativity, you can actually make convincing versions of stages from a lot of video games. It's really good for making Atari and NES games, as those games tended to use simple square shapes like those within the SSBB Stage Builder. Seriously, this feature alone is hours upon hours of fun.As far as I'm concerned, the only real problem with Super Smash Bros. is its online mode. Lag is far too frequent for a game that only allows four players to play in a given match. Also, this is one of those Wii titles that use friend codes. So, if you don't know anyone else with this game, or if you don't feel like joining a Super Smash Bros. Brawl related forum, you'll have to play anonymously against other people. But having said all of that, it's good to own a Super Smash Bros. game that you can play online.So, Super Smash Bros. brawl is an excellent offline game, but the online mode might as well not even be there. The end result is something that feels like one really awesome Nintendo 64 game. That is exactly what I wanted. Bravo, Nintendo! Bravo!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2013"}

The backgrounds are amazingly realistic and exotic. The enemies are collosal. And with the new addition of voice actors, FFX is easily one of the most dramatic Final Fantasy games.Also, the new experience system is one of the most entertaining parts of the game. Players can assign their own abilities to the characters by following a grid system. Parts of the grid are conveniently sectioned off with locks, so that they can't get the super-powerful Ultima spell until nearly the end of the game. However, the best part of FFX is the new opportunity for players to customize their characters.Some parts of FFX are a little frustrating, to say the least. The battle system is a rather bland turn-based strategy system, in which players can trade off certain characters to defeat certain characters. This system tends to keep some of the weaker characters, such as the summoner Yuna, from earning the experience they need for more crucial abilities.Also, there isn't a humongous world map in FFX. Since this game is realistic down to the bone, we get to experience every part of the entire party's road trip, moving across calm plains and thunderstorm-drenching valleys. And they even spend large amounts of time socializing on boats and ferries. It's almost too exhausting to sit through so many cutscenes of spoken dialogue, with the occasional awkward translation problem.However, this is the beauty of Final Fantasy X--it offers players the fully engaging experience of traveling everywhere and anywhere with their characters, killing the most fearsome beasts, and rejecting the awful fate that lies ahead of them.And the story is one of the very best in Final Fantasy history. The main characters is Tidus, the Zanarkand blitzball player who warped 1,000 years ahead in time to a world where Zanarkand is now devastated. He is faced with the daunting task of facing the father who deserted him a long time ago and helping his friend, Yuna, defeat Sin. More importantly, people are left wondering how Tidus managed to survive the devastating encounter with Sin 1,000 years ago.In spite of its flaws, \"Final Fantasy X\" is a visual masterpiece for the new millenium, a game that encompasses the defiance of a pre-determined fate of annihilation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2009"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E5OE","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Another year, another average Madden","reviewText":"First, a disclaimer:  For those that have played Madden since the PS2 generation, I think the best two are...PS2:  Madden 2005 (and indeed, I think this is the best one period)PS3:  Madden 2010 (play 2012 and go back to 2010, the presentation is so much better)Which brings me to Madden NFL 2012.  I hestiated to buy this until my wife made the suggestions, who am I to argue?  I had heard things about the \"Dynamic Player Performance\" and all the other improvements, so I said what the heck?First, the good:- The game is looking great graphically.  They've nailed the stadiums (and indeed, a lot of the intros), the menus are sharp and easy to read, and overall it's more polished then other PS3 Maddens.- GameFlow returns but for someone like me who has played with the Steelers for many years, and knows their best plays, it's nice the conventional option was left.  I was up and running in no time even though it had been many months since I played Madden.- The online community/matchmaking process has been significantly improved and the trolls/cheaters that have plagued this game online for years is likely to be all but eliminated, so kudos for EA for finally getting this fixed.Now, the not-so-good:- I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this game, and let me tell you that they nailed one thing:  The announcing is HORRIBLE in this game.  A few examples:*I'm up 35-0 and they go \"The Ravens better do something on this drive because if they don't, man it's going to be a long day\".  You think?*TWO times I know i heard Gus Johnson refer to my offense as the DEFENSE...how in the WORLD does that get in a final product?You would think in 2011 they could get this right...but no.  It still sucks.- While the graphics are good, the actual game performance leaves somethings to be desired.  Clipping is rampant (not the football penalty), a couple times in my first game the crowd (cardboard and pixelated as it was) got in front of the players on a cutscene, they play the SAME cutscenes after a guy scores a TD, I mean I could go on and on but this stuff should be fixed by the 2012 game now.- The difficulty has some seriously wild swings that are either way too easy or ludiciously difficult.  Is it too much to ask to have a nice middle ground?- This might be the easiest set of sport game trophies to earn on the PS3.  I got SIX of them in my very first game!  And the only ones I see that are majorly difficult are the ones that require 100 yard returns for TD's.  Past games have had a lot more specific challenges and they had to be played in All Pro...these can be earned on any difficulty level.- It was tremendously easy in Madden 2005 to manage your Franchise (players, etc.) but this interface is way too clunky for its own good, even with all the details they added.  Sometimes simple presentation is MUCH better.- Why Madden went away from what they had in 2010 (i.e. the halftime show, etc.) is beyond me.  The lame excuse they have in its place (a couple random highlights) is a joke.  Oh, and I guess Gus Johnson couldn't be bothered to say the teams NAMES when he says what the score is at the end of every quarter!  I have NEVER seen that in all the years I've played Madden.And in the end, EA doesn't care.  They know there will be a significant part of the population that will pick it up just because it's the next game in the series.  Games like NHL 11 (and upcoming 12) have advanced and are now far superior to the NFL product, but of course Madden's going to sell like hotcakes so they don't care.So, if you're someone that likes the updated rosters, and can appreciate the few improvements they put in, go ahead and buy it again.  Just know what you'er getting.  I don't see this game drawing any new players into Madden who haven't played it before, and Madden's got a long road to climb back that we probably won't see until the PS4/next Xbox generation.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2011"}
