Square Enix and Jupiter team up once again to showcaseThe World Ends With You, a trendy and vibrant gaming experience developed exclusively for the Nintendo DS. Featuring an intuitive combat system and exciting multiplayer mode,The World Ends With Youis set to immerse gamers into the modern-day culture of Japan.StoryThe story begins as Neku Sakuraba, an unsociable 15-year-old boy, unexpectedly wakes up in the Shibuya shopping district of Tokyo, Japan.

The World Ends With You is one of the quality games that Square Enix has ever made, period (and dare I say better than most of the stuff that Square Enix has given fans for years). This game just moved up on my top ten DS games of all times (DS games) and is ranked very highly in terms of RPG games (its up there with Disgaea and Tales of Symphonia).The story is about an emo teen named Neku Sakuraba who wakes up in the middle of Shibuya with no memory of his past and suddenly being able to hear the minds of people. He's suddenly attacked by a frog monster called a Noise forcing him to retreat to the statue of Hachiko where he makes a pact with a girl named Shiki Misaki. She explains to him that he's involved in a Reaper's Game and how they must work together to survive 7 days to get out of Shibuya. The only problem is Neku is a loner and would rather shun the world than help someone he doesn't even know. Little does he know that while in the Reaper's Game, he'll understand what the power of friendship means.This game was on my list for a long time with comments on everything about the game is better than what Square Enix has made as of late and its true. This game is HARD, has awesome music and believable characters that is easy to relate with. The world of TWEWY is very unique and even though you're playing the game for 3 weeks in game, you feel like you're on a journey.The game is VERY hard. The game WILL punish you if you don't understand how the mechanics work. Yes people play differently with the pins but some pins are needed to win on higher levels. The game is difficult with the partner system where you and your partner shares health (the bosses do too) and you get a game over if one partner is killed in battle. The computer is not that good being an AI sadly (le sigh) so you have to do ALL THE WORK (again) in terms of controlling them. This makes the game even harder though as you have to pay attention to the top AND bottom screen. Neku fights on the bottom with a variety of tactics while the partner is stationary at the top of the screen with limited options. The game ranks you based on how quickly you kill the opponent and how much damage you take. The less damage you take, the higher your score. The goal is usually to get an S rank (star) to get the most out of the BP system where you can level up your pins. And of course the game actually doesn't tell you that the pins can evolve depending on how you level them up (by battle, tin pin (I hate this game!) or turning your game up and evolving via time you stay away from the game).The battle system overall is very fast pace and you can't make any errors on higher levels. Outside of battle, you can equip Neku and his partner with items (and its brought up that if you match the items based on the area they are in Shibuya, the higher the sync rate and damage in said area. To wear an item, you need a high bravery stat (which Shiki starts with a high bravery being a girl and all followed by Joshua for obvious reasons) and you can only wear one item per section (so its not as awkward like in Disgaea where you can for some strange reason equip two glasses). Also the character can eat regular food like in the actual game because this game is very realistic in that you can only eat a certain amount each day and then wait 24 hours before you can eat a bigger meal. Each character has their likes and dislikes and its based on their personality. Beat loves fast food but hates sweet while Shiki is the exact opposite. Joshua clearly states he's a ramen person etc.)The partners themselves are all useful in their own way. Shiki is your first partner in the game. As the only female partner she has the advantage of being able to equip most of the items given at the beginning of the game and is easy to get a combo with given her special ability on the top screen is just her matching up the card symbols. Alas, her biggest weakest is the fact you lose her after the first week and while she has the items when she joins in near the end the game her attack becomes pathetic in comparison to the other characters. Beat has the advantage of being the last partner to pair up with. He's fast and has a high defense of his defense is terrible and he's rather wavy when he attacks given he rides on a skateboard. Plus, his ability requires you to get pairs and sets on the card game of hearts, clovers, diamonds and spades (in honesty, I'm not going to pretend like I know how to play Beat and I just attack the way I attack). Joshua is the hardest partner of the 3 to master especially given how he starts out in week 2 as pathetically week and I don't know if it was just me but HE JUST STOOD THERE during the week 2 day 1 boss. I mean I was having a hard time on the bottom but he did no damage whatsoever on the top and its like \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\" Yes Joshua gets better near the end of his week when he decides to start levitating but come on! You make a hard game even harder! Alas, mastering Joshua is crucial for beating bosses on higher difficulties especially the bonus boss as not only is it easy to spam attacks while levitating but levitating works better in terms of dodging.The characters are still the best. All of them have their strong personalities and flaws. The flaws are why they're in the game to begin with but without spoiling their backstory, I'll just say that each character turns out better by the end of the week. Neku is the main character who gets better so while its easy to hate his personality at the beginning, by the end of the game, he's a very likable protagonist and because he becomes more like a hero is important to the end of the game for a certain character.The music is the best and its even better when you realize Neku is the one listening to the music in battle. The music changes constantly so you're never stuck with the same BGM and on the menu option, you can basically change it to how you see fit after you buy the CD. Personally, Calling is my favorite version (and I can see why people complained when it was changed in KH:DDD) and Give Me All Your Love is so...heh heh. And I still want to know what the song Twister is talking about.If you find this game anywhere, get it. It's a must have, must play and if all goes well, we'll have a sequel eventually especially with all of this foreshadowing and hype.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2013"}

That was really a surprise for Nintendo fanatics with the release of their latest video game creation, the Nintendo DS handheld system. As well as creating new games, they glanced into their vaults, and revived a classic. Super Mario 64, was a ground-breaking and exciting video game for the N64 video game system in 1996, and it was just a masterpiece for all gamers alike. However, that game was truly amazing, remastering a triumph is just anything but intense to all.Super Mario 64 DS, for Nintendo's DS system, has a lot of the same fatures and stories from the previous N64 game, but there are just so many twists here. The game also has a lot of twists, as you play not just Mario, you also control Yoshi, Luigi, and Wario as well. The game also has new extras including new bosses, and mini-games for all. The graphics and the game revised is just amazing. Yet, there are a few downsides with this version. One of those happens to be control. It is a lot harder to control all the characters here with the touchpad, instead of the easy to use analog controller from the N64 version. Another problem is the music and the graphics weren't remastered as well as the classic version, but that is alright because most of the original music and gameplay is really there.All in all, Super Mario 64 DS fairs quite well for anybody who has the desire to own the new Nintendo DS system. However, for some, they'll just consider going back to the classic N64 version, because it is a little easier to play.

Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics.

The plot unfolds more like an episode of 24 than a plodding Tom Clancy novel. Twists abound, and people aren't always who they seem to be. The plot also gives some very interesting insight into Sam Fisher's character, as the silent badass becomes more human. You really get a sense of who, and what he's fighting for, and it's a real treat toward the end-game when his philosophies on revenge, duty, and trust really come to the surface.The campaign is short - five hours short - but it's very fun, and even finds some strength in it's brevity. After a brief introductory sequence in Malta, Sam spends the rest of his time lurking around Washington, D.C., visiting various locations to unravel a treasonous conspiracy.Perhaps \"lurking\" isn't the right word, though. Stealth elements in Conviction have been stripped down to the essentials, crouching in shadows, and watching enemy patrols for the right time. Beyond that, Splinter Cell plays more like an action game with an emphasis on keeping to the shadows. Players can swiftly take down enemies with the push of a button, and if things get out of hand, they're armed to the teeth, or if they're a bit more sneaky, they can make a quick getaway with one of the new gadgets.Thankfully, even with the absence of some of the older features, Ubisoft has added in quite a few awesome new gameplay mechanics. The first, and most important is Mark and Execute. The player can pick out a number of enemies, and with the tap of a button, quickly dispatch them all, making it easy to get passed overwhelming patrols. But, it's not like it's a win button either, you have to get a melee kill to charge up your Mark and Execute meter, which pretty much perfectly balances out the new mechanic. The second notable new feature is Last Known Position. Upon being spotted, a silhouette of Sam will appear so you can tell where the guards thought you were last. This makes it easier to escape, or even set up an ambush.There are some spots that change up the formula, and they can be quite entertaining. Chasing a conspirator around the Washington Monument, and, in a throwback to the old style of Splinter Cells, a sequence where you have to maneuver around an environment completely undetected. There are some pretty superb moments beyond that which I won't spoil, but there are some moments which don't work as well. Interrogations are brutally satisfying, but they serve to slow things down quite a bit, and are little more than slightly interactive cut-scenes.The campaign is quite good as long as you're not expecting a lengthy adventure. The game has changed, Sam Fisher has changed, and in most part, it's for the better.A Co-Op campaign was disappointingly absent from Splinter Cell: Double Agent, a letdown indeed after its memorable debut in Chaos Theory. Co-Op is back in full force in Conviction, however, in the form of The Prologue, which might just be the best of Splinter Cell: Conviction's three main pillars of game modes.The Prologue doesn't have as much of an emphasis on story, but it does rather well in leading up to Sam's rampage as seen in the Campaign, and the character development is actually pretty great. Archer, a Third Echelon agent, and Kestrel, a Russian agent working for Voron (an international Third Echelon equivalent) must form an alliance to track down some stolen weaponry. Oh, and there's an awesome twist ending.In terms of the gameplay, things remain pretty much the same as in the Campaign, however, working together on coordinated strikes against guards is a lot of fun, and, as mentioned before, co-op Mark and Executes are pretty insane, allowing you to clear out quite a few guards with a little bit of team work.The Co-Op in Conviction is tons of fun, and in my opinion, the best mode the game has to offer. The story is well told, if simple, and the gameplay really lends itself to a co-op experience.Deniable Ops is the last piece of the Conviction equation, and it doesn't totally stack up to the rest of the game's offerings. It's essentially a quick-play mode for one or two players in which an objective must be completed on one of the maps from the Prologue (as well as one additional one exclusive to Deniable Ops). There's Hunter, in which players must take down a certain number of enemies, Last Stand, where they must defend an EMP against waves of attackers, Infiltration, which requires players to take down guards without being detected, and Stand Off, Conviction's only adversarial multiplayer mode.Of these, Hunter is the only one that really works, since the core gameplay (as in guard-killing fun) holds up just fine. Last Stand and Infiltration don't work as well because they require either all-out gunplay, or total stealth respectively, which goes against the game's natural balance of the two. Stand Off is a simple spy vs. spy deathwatch, the twist being that A.I. guards litter the map. For the most part, it works pretty well, but it's nothing outstanding.While it's disappointing that there's no Spies vs. Mercenaries mode, Deniable Ops does the trick when it comes to quick, pick-up-and-play Splinter Cell action, just don't expect anything deep.Campaign, Prologue, and Deniable Ops are held together by PEC Challenges, which can be completed across any of the game modes. The challenges range from simply escaping from a heated situation, to more whacky stuff like killing a guard by throwing another guard at him. These challenges award points which can be used for upgrading weapons and gadgets (for use across all game modes), and uniforms (only usable in Deniable Ops). These challenges actually offer a decent incentive for replay value, and outfitting your gear quickly becomes addicting.Conviction's production values aren't stellar, but they get the job done. The graphics run on the now-dated Unreal 2 engine, although it does well all things considered. Lighting effects continue to impress, and the art-style is quite good, however, close inspection of pretty much anything in the game will reveal how low-tech it is. The sound department is decent, too. Voice acting is hit or miss, with Michael Ironside's gravelly Sam Fisher being a highlight, as always. The music is quite good, and really sets the tone for sneaking, or all-out confrontations. Sound effects can get repetitive, but for the most part the game does its job in looking, and sounding fine, but there's nothing amazing here.From Conviction's Campaign, and Co-Op Campaign offerings, you're play time will probably clock in at around 12 hours, but Deniable Ops, and PEC Challenges can chew up a lot of time as well. The individual pieces of the package won't provide a whole lot of mileage, but combined, this game definitely has the replay value to justify a purchase.Splinter Cell: Conviction is a very hit or miss game when it comes to everything from gameplay mechanics, to production values. The game is certainly not without its flaws, but the good ultimately outweighs the bad making Conviction a game worth checking out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2010"}

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the widerWhite Knight Chroniclescommunity on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale. The game also offers an online interface known as GeoNet that allows players to communicate with others via blogs, forums, quest logs and voice chat functionality, as well as post snapshots from their journeys using the Crystal Camera in-game tool.Key Game FeaturesWhite Knight Transformation- During single player combat players can transform into the giant White Knight, gaining the ability to challenge large enemies as well as troops of soldiers throughout the adventure.The Customizable Avatar Character- Using a wide array of sliders and customization options, players are able to create a unique character that can join the adventure in single player mode as well as online.Combo Battle System- Engage in an accessible, active turn-based battle system that caters to players of all levels allowing both default attack settings and a system for for maximum damage.JRPG (Japanese RPG) Action for PS3- Experience true JRPG action on PS3 that incorporates a variety of online gameplay elements.Beautiful Environments- Players traverse through 13 stages, as well as visit up to six towns/villages to visit and purchase items at shops or interact with NPCs.

It looked like a great fantasy story, similar to what you'd see in the older Final Fantasy games.  When it came in, however, I was greatly disappointed...I played this game for about 2 hours, and had to turn it off.  The first 30-40 minutes were character creation.  I spent a fair amount of time to make an avatar only to find out that he's \"the new guy\" and has no role what-so-ever in the story.  Instead, they smack you with an angsty teenage boy as a main character!  Absolutely nothing after the character creation grabbed me.  The graphics and sound are OK.  The smidge of story that was presented seemed quite lame, and the characters introduced were completely uninteresting.  I made it as far as the second save point (somewhere in the plains right outside the first town.)  The combat system seemed like a variation of what was in FFXII.  Combat was to frequent and boring.  I turned the game off and now I'm trying to sell it used on Amazon.  Hopefully I won't take too big of a monetary hit.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2010"}

So, after playing for 1 hour..I felt this is so repetitive and boring.  Here are what I found to be negative1) LinearityIt's just one mission after another w/ lots of left-click, left-click, and occational right-click.  In many places, there's a little dungeon you can go but u can easily explore that in 1 minute and move on.  Just after Act 2.. I didn't really have any inspiration to move on2) Too much items / stupid coin chaseAfter playing just 1 hour..and I had to sell bunch a crap to clear out the inventory.  Just seemed more annoying.  Also, coin chase is so dumb.. is this a Mario game? just give me gold after a kill or something.  Destroying a barrel or rock and getting a gold seems really stupid.  Really? Also, after selling 50 items..you can only afford 1 weapon items.. yeah.. something isn't right here.  I never had to buy anything from shop as I'll find something better in next 10 minute of playing.3) GraphicsMany say better graphic than Diablo 2.  First, it's sad to compare graphics with a game that's older then 10 years... Do you really want to compare graphics between SNES and PS3? really? Let's face it.. graphic is just ok~ nothing great.4) Musichm... all is forgettable5) cut sceneIt was definitely different and possibly best part of the game.Anyways... I'll eventually finish the game w/ at least one class since I already paid for this boring game.....","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2012"}

You look at the negative reviews and nearly every one has the exact same complaint, DRM sucks, DRM fail, DRM this, DRM that. DRM is a way of life now people, and you're going to have to learn to deal with it. Start up your own gaming company from scratch and risk millions of your own dollars developing a game.Regardless, this is a very good game from Blizzard. Very polished, good aesthetics, great music and effects, and most importantly fun gameplay. I will say that the linearity is a bit disappointing, but it's workable given the otherwise high quality nature of the game.Overall, I like the game.

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Yossarian","summary":"$60 access kit","reviewText":"Diablo III is not a game.  It is merely an access kit to a game, which is stored somewhere on Blizzard's server farms.  To play the game, you must have and maintain a highspeed internet connection.  Everything in \"your game\" -- your data, your gear, your characters -- is actually Blizzard's, parked on one of their servers.  While the rationale for doing this varies and includes everything from stopping piracy to blocking mods/hacking and making money off the \"auction house\", the outcome is the same:  you don't own this game or even any substantial part of it.  All you own is a key that lets you in to visit the game, so long as Blizzard feels like keeping its servers up and maintaining \"your\" characters and data during your prescribed visiting hours.  As many have already discovered, they don't feel like doing that particularly well.This situation has been a long time coming.  Years ago, in what is now obviously a faded golden age of gaming, you actually owned the game you bought.  Subject to at most perhaps an annoying CD security key, you still at least had a physical object that you could carry around and load into other physical objects whenever you felt like, enjoying the game for as many years as you want and anywhere you want without requiring pre-approval from the company's massive cloud computing Death Star.  Somehow, us gamers let that time get away from us.  Starcraft II was the most recent warning, when people discovered that much of the functionality of Starcraft had actually disappeared and live internet was required even for single player campaigns (which also were initially missing 2 of the 3 playable races included in Starcraft 1 by default).  People got upset, but not upset enough to make a difference.  Perhaps things have changed now.The simple fact is that we are going backwards in game design even as technology improves.  Diablo III is a pathetic shell compared to Diablo II.  Like a divorced parent, you have to count the moments until you can visit your characters for a little while, and then get kicked back out the door the moment your visitation window ends.  Whether the series will continue to devolve into nothing more than a series of lame DLCs hidden on Blizzard servers and locked by $60-100 paygates depends as much on us as it does on them.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000G6SPHI","description":"Sony God of War 2 PS2 God of War 2 PS2","reviewerName":"DRocK","summary":"Too Bad I Can't Finish It...","reviewText":"The game itself is awesome. I do think the first one is better, but anyone who enjoyed the first God of War will love this one just the same. It is a great game and is improved in several areas from the first God of War. Although I will agree with some other reviewers in that some of the puzzles get to be a bit much. I reluctantly had to check out a walkthrough for a couple of the puzzles after frustratingly going at it for an hour or more.Ok, so why the 3 stars? Well, this game has a fatal glitch that has prevented me from completing it. Too bad too, because it is one of the titles I was most excited about playing on the PS2. I bought a new Slim PS2 from Amazon approx. 1 year ago and it doesn't struggle with any other games at all. So it's very unlikely that it's the console at fault. I bought God of War II at Wal-Mart brand new. The game runs fine without any problems, but about two-thirds of the way through it just freezes and doesn't go anymore. It happens at the Palace of the Fates, after the Auditorium of Lahkesis and just before you make it to the Garden of the Gods (I checked the walkthrough so I know that's what comes next). I enter the room which has spiked walls on either side which begin to close in and Kratos has to take out the huge mass of enemies in order to get the walls to retract and continue. Well, I can take out all the baddies and get the walls to retract and start to move on. But just as soon as I go into the exit door, the little Loading... screen pops up in the bottom-right corner and that's it. It just stays there for eternity. I've played through the whole game twice and that's as far as I get. Bummer.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00149ILCK","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A final opus from Pandemic","reviewText":"The Good: Nice art style, superb voice acting, story, and memorable characters, lots of weaponsThe Bad: Stealth mechanics are broken, climbing buildings isn't all that fun, not many side missionsGrand Theft Auto has inspired a lot games and The Saboteur is one. Think of this as Grand Theft Paris in which you play as Sean Devlin an Irish man trying to help the French Resistance against the Nazi war machine. Yes this is another WWII, but its different. Just read along and you'll see.The first thing you will notice is the game's atmosphere. It's set in a replica of 1940's Paris and feels just like it. The graphics are technically looking good, but artistically is where its at. When you liberate and area of the city it turns from black and white to color. So as you travel through the city the color will change in real time. What's great about it artistically is that in the B&W; areas only the red of the Nazi flags stand out. On resistance soldiers and leaders certain things on them are in color such as the eyes, and parts of clothing and it makes things look really unique. While this all looks great the novelty wears off pretty quick and you end up forgetting about it.The game has stealth game play and shooting mechanics. When you get a mission you can jack a car or get one from your garage (you can store new ones there too) and follow a yellow route line on your mini-map to your destination. While the game is called The Saboteur this is actually the hardest thing in the game to pull off. Some missions have you trying to sneak into an enemy camp. This is marked by barbed wire on the map and if you enter it you will sound the alarm almost immediately if you are seen. Your goal is to knock out a soldier and take his disguise. This isn't always as easy as it sounds because you have to make sure other soldiers aren't looking. If someone sees the dead body a yellow \"suspicious zone\" will appear and even if you are in disguise you can trigger an alarm. Doing things such as running, climbing buildings, and walking fast will make soldiers who can see you suspicious.The stealth element is kind of flawed because they all work against you. Trying to plant dynamite in an area to draw soldiers away doesn't work at all since they just stand there staring around. There are a lot of times where you will be forced to just gun it out because the stealth elements are so flawed that you can't get away with sneaking. Some missions will go flawlessly and others won't. This doesn't make the game unplayable, it just has you wasting your time trying to figure out a stealthy way when it turns out, after so much effort, there just isn't one.Gun play is simple enough with cover mechanics and there are a ton of true-to-the-era weapons as well. You can find ammo crates all over the place, but you can only carry two weapons at a time. Between missions you can visit black markets and use contraband to buy upgrades for resistance fighters, car upgrades, ammo etc. It's all pretty basic with nothing special in the store, but there's nothing crucial that you will need to buy to get past a part of the game.The missions are pretty diverse so this isn't the issue with the game. The issue is how you have to execute the missions and nothing ever really turns out the way you planned. All of this needs to be trimmed up and fixed for the sequel. During missions if you raise an alarm you can run (like in GTA4) or find a hiding spot. Most are located on top of buildings and climbing isn't very fun. This isn't Assassin's Creed so climbing is sluggish and a bit unresponsive. Thankfully you only climb buildings about 40% of the game.Other than that the game is worth a purchase if you like sandbox games. There aren't many side missions or free play missions, but the game is long enough to get your money's worth. The story is the best part of the game with memorable characters and a gripping ending. Watching these people struggle for survival against Nazi Germany is movie quality. The writing is witty and Sean has a lovable personality. You quickly grow to love these characters and they are all fleshed out nicely. The game also has lots of boobs, but this sticks to true 1940's Paris because nudity wasn't as sinful as it is today. Of course you have to buy the game new or buy the unlock DLC for the nudity and four cinematic stripper scenes.Overall the game is solid in some areas and not in others. With broken stealth mechanics you can't always be the saboteur the game claims, but certain missions are satisfying enough to play out the way you want. The game is looking good for a sequel and I'll definitely be by Sean's side when that time comes.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

I said that this would be the one game that I would go out and buy when it came out and it was.  The original Fable is one of my all time favorite games, it was just so unique, and Fable 2 is...good.Pros:-The graphics set a new standard for environments that just grab the player.  Beautiful scenery and shadowing.-Weapons are good, about the same as far as Fable 1 goes.-Clothing is also about the same as Fable 1 with a few new options.  However, 2 doesn't have armor ratings and I can't remember if Fable 1 did.-Magic is also about the same as Fable 1 but now with power level selecting.-Lots a properties to purchase and lots of people to interact with-Great music and sounds.-They fixed the whole good/evil points system in this one where killing a bandit while not in a quest doesn't count as evil any longer.  If they attack you you get good points for killing them now.-They cleaned up the expressions options by providing an easy to use expressions wheel.-Combat movements are a little more fluent now-Demon doors are still a great addition, but it seems like there are less of them...-You don't need to continuously play to game to accrue rent...awesome!-The horrendous aging methods from the original game have now been adjusted and are supposedly a lot better.Cons:-With added functions comes added difficulty in controls.  I've still not figured out how to consistently execute a roll or how to use the different magic levels feature.  I just push the buttons and hope they work.  It seems as though nearly every button has 3 or 4 possible actions.-People interaction is again a little difficult.  You can focus on one person but you can't make everyone else go away so they aren't affected by your expressions.-The jobs are interesting but very monotonous.-The dog idea to me is useless.  Takes the fun out of hunting and discovering hidden treasures.  I don't mind if it wants to help me find buried treasure and growl when enemies are near.  But it finds everything which completely takes the fun out of finding hidden things.  And he's supposed to attack enemies, but all I've seen mine do is stand there and get hurt.  Maybe mine's broken XD.-My biggest problem with this game is that it's so much like Fable 1.  It's pretty much the original game with lots of added features and expanded levels.  The storyline is even almost identical with different characters.  Don't get me wrong it's still a great game, just a little disappointing for the nerd that I am who has been waiting for months for it to finally be released.  I guess I just expected too much from the game.-What happened to the alignment picture of the character when you go in to the menu to see how good or evil you are?  They totally ditched this concept.  I loved to see my character standing there either looking all holy with white lights flashing behind him or evil with red all over and flies all around him.All in all I still like the game I'm just somewhat disappointed.  I think this game could have been so much better if they mixed it up a little instead of taking Fable 1 and building off of that amazing platform.  Maybe take a small page from the Diablo series and add some armor ratings and random drops or something.  I don't know, something seems to be missing and I gave 4 stars for that reason and for the fact that it's just too much like the original game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2008"}

Stathoulopoulos \"nick9155\"","summary":"Play a movie","reviewText":"EA finally made a game worthy of Bond and they've blurred the line between the games and the films at this point.  Gone is the old standard FPS format.  Bond is now in third person, and it's Pierce Brosnan giving the voice and face.  The rest of the filmic cast is here as well.  The game looks like the films.Easily one of the better PS2 games this year.  Since Medal of Honor appeared to have the same engine as the Bond games, perhaps they'll update that series with the Bond game third person.  You feel like you're acting out an action sequence from the film, and it blows away the feel of Nightfire and its predecessor.  The violence is top notch, the gadgets are great, and the game is tough on Platinum level.The game is also long, not one of those eight mission shooters you finish in a day.  The weapons look and sound great, and of course they shamelessly plug new cars like the Porsche Cayenne and the Aston Martin Vanquish of the last film.  Plain fun, even if you're not a Bond fan.  It's a shame they have to stick to Teen ratings for the franchise, but blood might push the game higher.I don't remember the story, and it doesn't matter.  The same people who write the films are now writing the games.  Even the guy who writes the Bond novels now was a video games designer.  It's all the same.  Willem Defoe joins the ranks of video game actors, as does Heidi Klum and even John Cleese.  There is now little difference between the films and the games, effectively.  The game even has little MI6 interludes, like the films, and there is a the requisite visit to Q Branch to get your new gadgets and heavily armed cars.  There are also bonus combat simulators thrown in.  There's good variety in the missions, too.  Some heavily rely on stealth, some on driving, or flying, and others on plain combat.  The hand-to-hand combat is a lot of fun, too.  No more cheesy flying fists.  Bond (as Brosnan) can now break out killer moves, even while clad in his Brioni tuxedo.Highly recommended shooter, a lot of fun.  Justice to the Bond name.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2004"}

Things go bad at the signing when Mexican rebels led by a Carlos Oniveros storm the place, killing the Canadian president & forcing the US & Mexican presidents to run for their lives basically. Anyway, its your job to rescue said presidents and stop Ontiveros..sounds easy until you find out Ontiveros has the US President's \"football\" (Which is a brief case that has codes to nuclear ICBMs).This game has it all. You run, climb, slide, dive, go prone, heal fallen teammates, take cover and lean against any flat surface, press select and you have a full 360 degrees rotatable map of the area, select a HUGE array of weapons (both with and without scopes), pick up enemy weapons, command not only fellow Ghost ground pounders but M1 Abrams tanks, Apache & Black Hawk helicopters, and many more. Ontop of that, your enemies are outlined in red (and once spotted are noted on that 360 degreed map for future planning), friendlies in green, and you also get night vision goggles.I never thought I would be saying this about a Tom Clancy game, but Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter is one of the most action packed, combat heavy, intense tactical games I have played. You will constantly be swarmed by wave after wave of enemy rebels and tanks... take this one stage where the US Embassy gets bombed - you have to protect the Mexican president from seriously an army of rebels with just you and the three Ghost members. It's a very hard game, but extremley fun. One thing thats boo though is the fact that you really only get hit like three times until you die.. meh.Graphics....are quite possibly some of the best I have ever seen; they easily blow Halo 2 out of the water and rank way up there with games like Perfect Dark Zero (blarff). The lighting is magnificent and enchanting, windows actually reflect the scenery, the cities look so real, and the characters look life like - in fact they even move as fluid as a real human being. Simply put, you'll be breathless and G.R.A.W. really flexes X-Box 360's video muscles.The music is a blend between real bands such as Ill Nino, and Ubisoft's own symphony/rock ballads. Both really help set the atmosphere and fit in perfectly. Take, for instance, when Ontiveros shoots this guy in a Black Hawk that has been helping you the entire game - the music gets REALLY sad and depressing and actually fills you with rage and determination to take Carlos down. Amazing once again.There is indeed an online and split screen mutliplayer. Both are pretty fun - you can play against people in a free for all or teams, or play co-op in a made up campaign or play against bots. Its pretty sweet and really helps you get the feel of the controls (though you can't command a team in multiplayer like you do in the solo game) and shows you how the game is going to basically be. One thing I didn't like about multiplayer is the fact that it's not in a third person view like the entire game is, but rather takes a first person approach. Im a fan for FPS, but I liked this game as a third person.. oh, the little things.The ending was typical Tom Clancy, and was rather short to get to (11 missions) - Mitchell retrieves the football and kills Ontiveros thus securing the safety of the world from a nuclear strike. Ontop of that the FBI or something arrests some retired high ranking official in the US for conspiring with Ontiveros...eventually it starts getting all complicated with conspiracies so I didn't understand it.Lets finish this review by saying this - if you own an X-Box 360, you better own this game. So far, it's the best game for the system, and is one of the best games I have played.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2006"}

The battles have very little value other than collecting coins and maybe some valuable stickers. Not enough of an incentive and I find myself avoiding the battles because they can be super annoying and deplete your stickers.If it wasn't for the fact that the battles don't give you enough rewards in the way of building your character then I wouldn't mind the battles at all. They are enjoyable and the stickers are a interesting way to battle.Boss battles are a chore as well and thing stickers are shoe horned in the gameplay. The very few times i've been truly stuck I looked at a guide and avoided hours of trail and error. Made the game much more enjoyable and I only looked at a solution about 2 times in my 20 hours so far.Now to the positive. The graphics are great and really gives you the idea of paper and cardboard.The music is also great with good remixes of old classics.Gameplay even with flaws is addicting and has the collecting aspect with the secret doors and the sticker museum which challenges you to collect all the stickers in the game and even achievements.Characters and dialog have that great Paper Mario charm as well.I like this game a lot better than the Wii Paper Mario and just below the great N64/GC games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2013"}

By now you've read probably hundreds of reviews, but I'll add something anyway.The problem with Halo these days it that it's too generic. When the original Halo came out for the original XBOX way back in 2001, nobody had played anything quite like it on the consoles, and it rightfully earned its place in gaming history.But this is 2010, getting on for 2011, and not a whole lot has changed. Yes, the experience has been refined, but the weapons are still too generic, the baddies too generic, the story not interesting enough, and the multiplayer also - too generic. Even your main character, clad in armor and big helmet - screams cookie-cutter!For those that love Halo, and still love playing, Reach is for you.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Omnes","summary":"Deep into that darkness peering...","reviewText":"Originally meant for the Nintendo 64, Eternal Darkness was redesigned for a release on the Nintendo Gamecube. Personnally I think this was a great idea because the game would offer better visuals, which means a better grasp of this story's scary atmosphere.As Alexandra Roivas (voiced by Jennifer Hale of Mass Effect, Darkwatch, Marvel vs Capcom 3), you search your grandfather's mansion, trying to find clues that would explain his mysterious murder. As you uncover the tome of Eternal Darkness, you get to play other characters whose stories, combined together, reveal a battle against an evil force that has invaded the planet for millenias and is ready to strike again.Visually, Eternal Darkness's animations and combat tactics may seem outdated today compared to the XBox 360, Playstation 3 and Wii's technologies. However this game's real strengths are its excellent storytelling, voice acting and multiple replay values. This last aspect is important for after a few replays, the story's final twist is revealed to the player, a twist whose cliffhanger awaits a sequel that still hasn't been produced unfortunately. In its gameplay, one of its awesome points happens to be the character's sanity meter. This means that every time you witness a strange creature in any levels, your character's sanity depletes. So unless you try to refill it, you (character/player) will have to endure several mind-twisted pranks that the game developpers will put along the game.It is very sad that this game still hasn't had the sequel it deserves, but it is more sad to see that this game (along with the Nintendo Gamecube) lacks the technology to make it playable on an HD television. Now yes, you can play your Nintendo Gamecube on an HD television. But instead of having a good image and well-adjusted television colors, the HD set makes the Nintendo GameCube games come out blurry and appear into a very small image size. One hopes that Nintendo will release an adjusted version of this game very soon for under those technological constraints, those who want to purchase this game better still have their old television set (non-High Definition).If not, one may never get to grasp the true horror of the Eternal Darkness the way it should be.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004NRN5DU","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"SB","summary":"I realize many, many people love this game...but here's an alternate take...","reviewText":"I'm sure that there are countless fascinating and exciting aspects to this game.  I can see that.  And I'm the target audience for it.  I've played a lot of RPGs before on the highest difficulty settings, and I'm an old-school gamer of the Baldur's Gate era, so I understand slow, sloggy, complicated RPGs.  I love complex, stat-based RPGs with thousands of customization elements for character creation and progression.  I want to like this game.  I read a lot about it, I've followed the positive reviews and press, and I see that it has a legion of fans.From all the hype, I was prepared for a difficult game.  I was *hoping* for a strategically and tactically difficult game.  I can see that the RPG elements of this game are actually amazing-- deep, detailed-- so much to sink your teeth into.  But mostly I experienced a game that is far too often difficult because of the screwy controls, clunky mechanics and bad physics-- an RPG whose action elements are not nearly as well-designed as the RPG elements, rendering it, for me, almost unplayable.This game would not be nearly as difficult if the controls weren't laggy, badly designed, and just plain hard to use.  Things frequently and literally just don't happen when you press the buttons.  The control scheme and combat mechanics are poorly conceived and shoddily executed.  You are clearly centered on a target, but your arrow hits a wall.  YOUR arrow hits a wall, but of course your enemie's arrow hits you.  The combat is primitive (yet the game consists almost entirely of combat)-- your enemies aren't smart-- they barely react to you.  They don't do anything except mindlessly execute their attacks in repeating patterns-- and you don't have to use tactics to defeat them-- you just have to memorize the patterns, and then negotiate the impossibly laggy and glitchy controls long enough to hit them.  Or, in the case of boss fights, you can use some cheap exploits in combination with the pattern memorization.The physics of the game are a mess-- worse than Skyrim.  Nothing has any weight, and the characters don't interact with the environment except in the most crude manner.  This would be fine if the game didn't actually expect you to execute movements and moves with timing and precision.  You walk right off a cliff to a cheap death by pressing RT to swing a sword, or your feet get caught up in one of the dead bodies you leave in your wake, causing you to stumble into an enemy or slip off an ledge.  This isn't a platforming game, so you shouldn't be slipping off a stinking ledge!  It is virtually impossible to look down, you can't jump- except while running, and then half the time the unresponsive controls don't register your button press, so expecting you to execute a perfectly timed jump-- or you die-- is ridiculous.  The challenge just consists of managing the bad controls!  When you walk off a ledge, there's no physics at all, you just drop like a wet stick-- if you are lucky, you might land on the platform below, unlucky, and you will fall to your death-- so why is the game filled with environments that require you to walk or jump off ledges?  There are frequently opportunities for you to jump down on top of your enemies and attack them while falling, so why is it so difficult to LOOK DOWN?  Why can you not *jump* at all?  You literally just walk off of ledges-- but the animation and physics is more like a combination of flopping and floating...You. Can't. Jump.  Except while running.  Or backwards-- you can jump backwards from a standstill.  You just can't jump forwards from a standstill.  You can only jump while running at full speed.  Sometimes.  Sometimes, you press the buttons, but nothing happens.  Why can you jump backwards, but not forwards?  That makes no sense whatsoever.Every time you interact with the world, like picking up an item, or doing something to your inventory, the game opens up dialog boxes.  If you don't properly close the dialog boxes by hitting the right button, you can't defend or attack.  But enemies CAN attack you.  You can run around, but you can't DO anything except get hacked to bits by enemies, until you figure out that you forgot to press the A button to close the little dialog in the corner.  Meanwhile, you die.When you are aiming a bow, you can click to activate zoom/targeting.  When you stop aiming, so that you can, you know, run away from an oncoming enemy, the zoom/targeting stays up, hindering your movement and making it impossible to see.  You have to click a separate button to drop the zoom.  But your bow isn't up anymore-- so why is the targeting screen still up? You've dropped your bow, but the screen is still locked in aim/zoom mode.  But you can't shoot another arrow, because you've dropped your bow.  Now your enemies are hacking you to bits and you die.What I'm saying is, this game has too many elements that require precise action and physics, but the game is so sloppily designed that such action is much, much more difficult than it should be.  Thus, you die.  I want to die because the game's enemies outsmart me.  I want to die because I don't plan ahead, or allocate my skills and resources properly, or because I don't determine the weaknesses of my enemies.  I don't want to die because I when swing a sword, poor animation and dumb game mechanics cause me to fall off a cliff.I want a game that challenges me intellectually-- how to defeat my enemies or the environment through planning and execution, not a game that challenges me to negotiate its laggy and poorly laid out controls, absurd physics, and lazy design decisions.There are quite a few other issues with the game, but one that merits special mention is the hideous graphic design.  Not the \"graphics\"-- those are decent.  I mean the absurdly clunky, slow, ugly (doo-doo brown and cement grey is never a good design choice), and barely functional system of menus, heads-up displays and other parts of the GUI.  They are just HORRIBLE-- lethargic and excrementally ugly.  The menu/graphic design is circa 1996-- same look, perhaps even less responsive....I'm sure it's possible that I'm just a sissy-- that I'm not up to the challenge that so many other players appreciate.  But I'm also sure that plenty of other players will feel the same as I do about this game-- that whatever wonders it holds are just not worth fighting through the mess to discover.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2013"}

The controls are easy to learn and get used to.  That being said.  There are times when you will accidently roll when you want to just walk and you will roll off a cliff and have to start over.  But, it's alright because you collect hearts through the levels and they give you lives.  I have 99 hearts which means 99 times I can start over.  If you can't find hearts you can buy them from the show they have.  You can also buy other things.  Like something that makes you walk into enemies and not get hurt.  There are different parts of the map you go to.  Once you beat the levels on one, you go to the next.  When you collect all the KONG letters in a part of the island your on, a new level in that part  will unlock.I just started and second part of the island.  That being said, the level that unlocked in the first part was called Platform Panic.  I played for hours a day for about a week.  I FINALLY got it.  So, while the games levels are easy for most to play, it may take time to figure out how to beat a level.  It seems that you almost have to remember every part of some levels to get through.  There are parts that get very hard.  Especially when your doing the part that times you.  SO hard on that first unlocked level.  But, that being said, it made the game even more fun.  I don't think I have ever had to work so hard to get through one level in a game.

{"product_name":"B0001ADAMO","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyable multiplayerReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"\"thereaper104@yahoo.com\"","summary":"Well thought out but...why buy a game you'll never beat?","reviewText":"I'll admit, Red*Dead Revolver is one of the first good western games (Besides the Wild Arms series, but thats more RPG based).

It has great gameplay, good action and some really nice music but overall the game is just average.  The Suffering has some really awesome game elements and some really creepy atmosphere.  The games story is simple.  You're sent to death row for a crime may have or may have not done and do not remember any of it except that you're heading to death row.  Soon the character \"makes some friends\" but sadly they all get slaughterd by these unknown beings.  To make matters worse once you are free from your cell cops, prison mates are getting slaughterd and torn apart by these things that you still have no clear are.  Now the tables have turned and you must escape this prison and find the truth of what happend to your wife and kids.  The game is great and has a great storyline too.The game features some really cool weapons that you get through advancing in the game on your journey to find out what really happend to your wife and kids, you meet up with some prison gaurds and inmates. This is what is really cool about it.  You have the choice on helping them out, leaving them there to die, OR killing them which will trigger what ending in the game you get.  There are 3 endings in the game what the choices you make are the consiquences you get which triggers what ending you get.  The game is chuck full of monsters and cool bosses which will give you hints on about you and your past.  The game also features a meter inwhich all the things you inflict will cause the meter to go up and you can trigger a sequence in which you transform into a demon monster and you can slash and tear anything that gets in your way in a limited amount of time.  It really doesn't do much for you I just killed anything that got in my way with my shotgun.The Suffering has something that I really loved about this game...Creepy atmosphere.  The game had some really awesome game atmosphere and the very first level in the prison is a perfect example.  The game has a perfect creepy atmosphere and a really great music score.  The game is really great on that.  The game is also very, very, very Mature.  It has extreame profanity and lot and lots of extreame gory violence.  One part in which you see a man whith nothing but his stomach left but the rest of his body is torn off and his just sqealing like dead fishes..it's really disturbing and if you shoot him and put him out of his misery you acctually earn a good Deed point!..Very disturbing sequence also..Good-Great Visuals-superb atmosphere-good storyline-Very creepy score..Bad-the game is too short-some levels look too identical which really ruins the mood of the game-the game doesn't have much of a side story and that is pretty lame-It seemed kind of like a SH rip off but still is a great game..The Ugly-get the good ending....Poor TorqueOverall this game is one of Midways Finest yet but it fails at all of things that midway could have attempted to fix but didn't.  Other then that the game has a great story, Fine Controlls, Great gameplay with lots of fast paced action and some cool atmospheric gameplay with lots of monsters....Overall with all of its pros and cons I gotta give this a3.9 out of 5 stars....Good Game overall..Lates","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2004"}

The religions themselves do not really mean anything.  In fact when you qualify to found a religion you can pick any religion and even rename one to make your own.  The real impact here is the political aspect.  Religon can really influence how other players treat you.

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

{"product_name":"B000AB603U","description":"It's the dawn of a new age in real-time strategy (RTS) games. A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"Age of Mythology without the Mythology","reviewText":"Personally I was heavily bored and disillusioned by Age of Mythology.  It had very little replay value for me, especially when human infantry are basically useless against Myth units.Age of Empires III, rather than acting as a sequel to Age of Empires II, acts as a sequel to Age of Mythology.  The engine is pretty much exactly the same.  Perhaps thinking the ancients too stupid to build big buildings, all the buildings here are maybe 3 or 4 times the size of buildings in Age of Mythology, making the map seem very small and difficult to navigate as you seem to run out of space quickly.  Even ships look cartoonish simply by how massive they are in comparison to the puddle-sized river you've just built them into.About the best improvements made from Age of Mythology is the population... you can have more than a 50 man army at one time here.There is nothing else revolutionary here... it's the same old s-word with regards to real time strategy---civilians dig gold, hunt animals or farm, cut wood, build houses, build barracks, build church or mosque or temple, build infantry, mass them, attack, upgrade, build another base somewhere else, repeat.  The graphics look great, but they are highly unimpressive in battle... gunfire, cannon shots, explosions, are all unremarkable.  The only positive aspect I can say here is that the buildings actually look like they're taking damage when under fire---losing roof tiles, chunks of concrete and masonry crumbling off.Everything else is just ordinary.  The sort of generic, unremarkable RTS of the next 3D generation, improving where Age of Mythology fumbled (that is, army battles), but breaking no new ground.(Native Americans) Indians: They have some settlements littered around.  You build a trading post next to them and you can train some of their soldiers.  Mercenaries.  The good thing is they don't count towards your population.  Also you get a few upgrades that only give you a minor edge in battle.In-depth Cities: Useless.  It does nothing.  You can't do anything with the cities.  Instead you get bonus cards, which give you little tiny gifts that don't turn the tide of the battle massively unless you've got nothing left.Everything else is about the same old s-word you'd find in Age of Empires II, Age of Mythology, and Rise of Nations.

And of course when the makers of Sims say something like that, it's very believable and appealing. But the game just didn't live up to the hype.The main goals in this game are eating, growing and evolving.

{"product_name":"B0002A2S26","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Very good game, but not as good as original; way too short.","reviewText":"I had this game on preorder for nearly a year, and when it came out I purchased the HALO 2 special edition box that came with, the tin case and two CD's one with the game on it, and one with a DVD showing the making of Halo 2. I was also told that there would be a CD with the Halo 2 soundtrack. When I first opened the tin case, I expected a separate place to store each CD, however, the two CD's were stored in the same place on top of each other. Not a big deal, but its kind of cheap that they would do that. Also there is no soundtrack in the special edition case.Overall Halo 2 is a very good game, but not as good as the original in my opinion.  I originally thought this game was painfully boring, but the later levels in this game were in fact very fun and involving.  I just wish it could have been a little longer and also the middle levels to be as fun as the last ones.Graphics: The best part of this game is the graphics. The graphics in Halo 2 are much clearer and crisper than the original, and is the best of my XBOX collection. If you don't look hard enough, you will think that you are watching a movie. The characters and textures in this game are rendered near perfectly and also the lighting effects were done very well.  The scenery looks almost lifelike especially when you are outside.  These are the best graphics I have seen in a game ever in my opinion.  Graphics get a perfect 10.Sound: The sound in this game is also very well done; the biggest disappointment here however is that the sounds of the guns do not have the \"punch\" as the weapons from the original game. Everything sounds like a BB gun, the only gun that sounds pretty good is the sniper rifle. The voiceovers are a nice touch and I like them fairly well. Even though some of the Covenant voiceovers are cheesy. The music is also pretty well done, but falls a bit short of the original game.Gameplay: This is what hurts the game the most.  Bungie did not do a good job of getting you involved in the game on the first and middle levels. I mean you are there, but you don't feel like you are there. The game does not really have any distinct mission goals and is basically a shoot everything that moves game. There is no shortage of enemies you will often find you run out of bullets and have to run around picking up guns off the ground. The annoying flood is back and they are still very annoying, they even made those flood \"bugs\" stronger, and they will kill you if you don't shoot them. In the first Halo, you could just let them pop off of you and your shield will only be damaged a little. Now if you do that, you shield will go down fast and you will die fast. Another annoying thing about the game play is that you have no idea how much energy you have left once you loose your shield, expect a lot of \"random\" deaths because you just don't expect something just brushing up against you to kill you. The middle levels are looooong, repetitive and boring. Good thing you can save at anytime your last checkpoint so you don't have to sit at the TV for an hour just to complete one level.  However, like I mentioned earlier, the later levels are very fun to play and once I got past the last boring level in the game, I played Halo all the time.Another thing I must mention about the game is that I really don't like how the game switches control between the Master Chief and a Covenant arbiter. It sucks and makes the game a bit confusing.  The corniest part of the game is that every character can drive every vehicle, yep, Covenant can ride in Scorpions in the human warthog. If you think that is bad then please let me finish, the flood too can ride in human and covenant vehicles. They can't walk straight or barely shoot, but they have enough dexterity to operate a tank or jeep? Please!! Get the hell out of here!!! When I first saw a warthog driving towards me shooting at me, I thought it was the covenant, but when it got closer, I saw it was the flood riding 3 deep in the warthog! One in the driver's seat, one in the passenger seat and one in operating the turret!! When I first saw that I nearly burst out laughing, it had to be funniest thing I seen in a video game in a long time.I pushed through the boring levels, and was very impressed with the final ones.  However the ending was very disappointing.  I could not believe it was over that quick.  In fact, when I first beat the game, for some reason my XBOX did not play the credits, and I was returned the to main menu after a final cut scene, so I played the final part of the game again, and this time I did get the credits.  I just stared at the screen in disbelief, as I could not believe that this game was over so quickly.  On top of that, it leaves you hanging, I guess that was Microsoft's idea, in order to get even more anticipation for Halo 3, which almost certainly will come out based on Halo 2's ending!I am pretty satisfied with the game overall, does it live up to the hype?  Not in my opinion, but it still is a great game.  I originally said I hated it, but I am glad I did give it a chance.I don't plan to play on XBOX live because it is saturated with immature kids who act stupid and mess up the game.  Not to mention all the lame cheaters on XBOX Live.  In fact I am going to cancel my subscription before it renews next year!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2004"}
{"product_name":"B003O6FV8S","description":"","reviewerName":"Denise","summary":"Will You Just Dance?","reviewText":"Just Dance 2 is better than any regular 'dance mat' game, because you are actually dancing!The amount of songs is 50+ when you include the downloadable songs(need Internet connection and Wii Points). I won't list them, because some people already have, but some of my favorites are \"Move Your Feet\" by Junior Senior, \"Sway(Quien Sera)\" by The Marine Band, \"Soul Bossa Nova\" by Quincy Jones and Orchestra, and \"Katti Kalandal\" by Bollywood. The variety is great! Lyrics are shown when they are available, but they can be turned off. I have gotten 10,000+ points on at least 8-10 of the songs.NOTE: THE 1st AND 3rd WIIMOTES ARE REPRESENTED BY THE WOMAN DANCERS WHEN PLAYING A \"Duet\" SONG, JUST AN FYI FOR GUYS!Choreography is good, and the dancers know their stuff! If a dance drags on too much for you, there is a shorter version of EACH song. In the right hand corner of the Song Screen( Just Dance mode, maybe Just Sweat mode too), there is a timer that displays the song's time. You can switch between short and long versions with the Wiimote's 'minus' button. It isn't terribly hard to follow along to the dances, and you get the hang of it pretty easily. The pictogram man at the bottom lets you know what is coming next, and it is fairly clear.Downloading songs is a good option. That adds about 10-12 more songs to the already large selection list. These include \"Pump Up the Volume\", \"Come On Eileen\", and \"American Boy\". The songs cost 300 Wii Points each, about $3. It also includes a free download song, Katy Perry's \"Firework\".The different dance modes aren't superb, but I do like Dance Battle. 4-8 players sign in and you choose teams. Instead of picking a song, it randomizes it for you. You can choose the \"Joker\" button, but only once per round. Otherwise, gameplay is the same. At the end of each round, the scores are tallied. The rounds can go at least over 5. Just Sweat is the same as the Just Dance mode, but only one person plays, and a meter on the right shows you how much \"sweat\" you are working up. This helps you earn Sweat Points, to keep track of on a graph. There are three programs: Easy(1 song), Tough(3 songs), and Intense(6 songs).Overall, Just Dance 2 is awesome! Now, what songs should be on Just Dance 3...???UPDATE: Another new FREE download song is out, \"Here Comes the Hotsteppers\" by The Hit Crew!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2011"}

If you must play it, do yourself a favor and wait until the game is on the discount rack......which by my estimation shouldn't be too long from now. Had this game had to stand on it's on merits, I have no doubt it would be a complete and utter failure. Why? The storyline......what little there was extremely lame and weak. There is only one thing truly genius  about it, they were able to take a 5 hour story and stretch it into 40 some grueling hours of bored anticipation. Bored anticipation?!!!? Whatever do I mean. I'll explain. They kept showing movie clips of things going on with the characters and things around you, but not a single one played out. For instance, it showed me a short clip of someone making contacting with Carth, but Carth played absolutely no role in the game and no information adding to game was given in the clip......so your setting there bored to tears playing the game, but the clips lead you to believe more is just about to happen, that the plot will thicken, that finally all the hours of torture you've endured playing this stupid game will pay off, but then....well, just when you can't believe the game could get any worse you come to the ending and the game plummets to lows no video game I have ever played has reached. Your only sense of satisfaction is knowing you will never have to endure another minute of torture playing this game, hoping praying and having the faith to believe it will get better.I could write plenty more about my disappointments in this game from its annoying plotless no personality characters, to the mundane get you nowhere fast tasks, to the add no real value to the game conversations, to the who thought being a jedi could suck fights, but hopefully I convinced you to save yourself a little money by waiting to purchase this game. This game isn't just a poor sequel it's a poor game overall. But if you choose to waste your money on this game......well don't say you weren't warned.Oh, sorry but one more thing that really adds to the cons of this game......all the time spent waiting for scenes to load....I turned on my computer and surfed the web while I waited, trust me you'll need something to do because you won't get wrapped up in the plot (or lack thereof) of this game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2005"}

I have always loved FF7, it has been a good ride. I loved the original game, and I loved Advent Children. I can't say I liked Dirge of Cerberus, it just felt like they made a game just for the sake of making a game.And then there's Crisis Core...As soon as I started playing the game, I felt it was going to be just... OK. And sadly, my calculations were true. This is just as bad, if not even worse than Dirge of Cerberus. Sure, the graphics are good but that's about it. Need proof? I'll give it to ya:-Watch out for invisible walls! There are a few places in the game where you're trying to go to other places but you can't. The other games had this, but only in reasonable places. Here, they're EVERYWHERE.-The battles are so easy and predictable, you can do them while in a deep sleep. All you need to do is just hit the X button several times. It looks like Squeenix didn't put any thought into it.-The gameplay is VERY repetitive. You can care less halfway through, which brings me to my next reason...-The game is WAY TOO SHORT! About a couple hour in, I was already on Chapter 4. Just a matter of time later, I had finished the game. Again, this game is very rushed, as if they were on a deadline to finish the game. The creators were on a deadline to make the other ones, but you couldn't tell it because they were so flawlessly produced. Meanwhile here the game is so rushed and you could tell all the flaws.-The music. It sounds like leftovers from Halo 2. The music doesn't fit and at times they repeat the same song over and over, it's like hearing a guy's cell phone ring for 2 hours.-As usual, the voice acting...-The ending. Enough said. The depressing and melancholy feeling is good before being ruined by the \"OMG I'M GOING TO HEAVEN PLEASE DO THESE THINGS FOR ME WHILE I'M IN HEAVEN\" thing. It should have just ended after Cloud lets out his big scream.This game had so much potential, but wasted it. I really am sad to say this, as I used to LOVE FF7 to death. Overall, skip it. FF7 the original and AC were great, but with the way things have been going since DOC, the creators have been rushing as fast as they can to make a video game.

It follows Sora a year after the events of Kingdom Hearts one and Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories which he has been sleeping the entire time. Everything just starts fitting into place as you progress through the story and it has a ton of meaning playing through it again after the spinoffs.By far this game has the best tutorial I have played in any game. You control Roxas at the start of the game at Twilight Town and while you are progressing through the days you are getting a recap of what happened during KH1 and CoM. All the characters that are introduced along the way are pretty awesome, and we get a ton more Final Fantasy characters in this segment (Which is always cool, ya know?).Once we play as Sora we are revisiting a bunch of worlds we went to during the first game and a bunch of crazy stuff is happening with Organization 13. We even get to visit some new worlds, including a really cool one called Space Paranoids. Everything just flows really nice and we get a more time on the Disney world's than what Kingdom Hearts 1 had, with a really awesome story to make sense why.Gameplay:Fighting:They have updated the fighting in this game so much over the first game. Not only do normal attacks, rolls, and blocks feel more fluid, they feel much more fast pace and powerful. On top of that, they learned from their mistake with the first game and set the camera to the right analogue stick.Magic gets a little revamp as well, and it's more of an mp bar (like the HP bar) and not MP segments. When enemies get killed they drop little bubbles that restore your MP. Magic also seems more powerful in this game to me, and I noticed Donald Duck not dying a ton like he did in Kingdom Hearts 1 and killing enemies more often as well. Summons is based on your MP now (Since the Drive Gauge is for different forms).While killing enemies you are building up your Drive gauge. Once it is full Sora is able to transform into different Keyblade style forms (Like a magic one, a physical one, etc). This makes killing enemies a ton of fun, while making you more powerful at the same time. Some of the forms even end up transforming again, making you even more powerful for boss fights. This can backfire at times and an end up turning you into the Anti-Form, which is resembles something from the first game.While visiting worlds they sometimes add some fun little gameplay additions to the game. For example, in the Mulan world you have to make sure your Morale Gauge is full or its game over. Or in Space Paranoids you can do a Light Cycle Mini-game. They really add to the levels and make them unique in their own way so nothing gets to grindy over time.Gummi Ship:The best mini game of Kingdom Hearts makes a return in this game and its better than ever. Now they have set up missions in-between worlds, so you can replay them any time you want, and make it easier to travel between worlds. When you select one of them you have the option of starting the mission or editing your ship.At the editing menu you choose from the blueprints you have collected or create a ship from scratch like the first game. At the editing menu is where things really change. You have options of placing Gummi parts, copying some parts and placing them on the ship, rotating pieces, editing the color of all or one piece of the ship, editing already created ships, adding ability units, undo/redo, how the blocks will show up while your editing the ship, changing the mode (Which is the same as this, but instead of normal parts your placing weapons and exhaust systems), saving and exiting.From there editing the ships is the same idea of placing the blocks where you want them, within the cost (CPU) that you have available. Cost upgrades later will allow you to place more pieces. Once you progress a little through the story you unlock Teeny Gummi ships which fly with you and shoot projectiles out just like you do, but sometime blocks attacks from enemies or use their own special abilities.Levels are quite different than the first games ones, and you are fighting nobody ships this time around. During the level you may need to turn right/left/behind of the area you are in to flank and beat some ships, which leads to more strategy and ships to kill during the levels themselves. The music changes up as well, and really make the levels feel unique and if this wasn't just a mini game, but an actual on rails shooter title game.You can also choose to have full auto fire or semi auto fire of the weapons to your liking. During the levels you can defeat special ships that unlock parts and other ships and each mission has its own treasure list of things you can collect. At the end of the mission you get a briefing on how you did, the points you earned, amount of enemies you destroyed, items you unlocked and if it was your first time through you get an additional prize.Soundtrack:The amazing Kingdom Hearts soundtrack is still great in this game. All the worlds have recognizable and memorable themes to them, which never really get old when you're exploring the worlds (even after playing multiple Kingdom Hearts games). The main theme and song return in this game and they mean so much more after playing the Kingdom Hearts games. Atlantica's Under the Sea was really awesome, and hearing Sora sing it is priceless.Speaking of voice actors they did a really good job again with finding the right voice actors to represent the characters. Like the voice of Mushu wasn't Eddie Murphy, but I couldn't tell the difference at all and only knew that when I looked up the voice actors. All the characters sound right (Even the Final Fantasy ones without voice acting in their original games) so even if they couldn't get the original voice actors for the characters in the games, Square knows how to pick people who sound just like them.Graphics:I really think these graphics have aged well. The main characters mouths move to the words, they look detailed for a PS2 game and mixed with the Disney look to the levels I think they did a good job making sure everything looks nice.This is another PS2 game that looks fine when stretched out on my TV, all the text is readable and the CGI cutsceens still look amazing to this day. Seeing all the worlds again in upgraded graphics is really awesome and all the world based characters look great. Speaking of the worlds, they all have their unique look based on the Disney movie they are about. Especially Space Paranoids, that place looks amazing and it's my favorite Kingdom Hearts world.Verdict:With this being my first Kingdom Heart game, I really love this game and the epic tale it takes you through. With a really fun battle system, great update to the Gummi system and tons more to do on the worlds, I say this is a worthy addition to the Kingdom Hearts franchise. Along with that, those who played 358/2 days will have so much more value to the story. I will stick to my thinking that they have planned this epic, multi game tale since everything is just fitting into place perfectly.~ Written: 05-12Positive:* Story is awesome and has even more meaning if you played the spin offs* Best tutorial in any game that's also a recap* Fighting feels more fluid over the first game* Tons of Mini-Games* Graphics aged well* Soundtrack is still amazing and voice acting is top notch* Gummi ship battles are still a ton of fun to play and is upgraded a bit from Kingdom Hearts 1* Gummi ship levels are really thought out and have multiple techno-ish songs with themNegative:* Saving is still slow","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2012"}

If you are a God of War (GoW) fan, then this is a no brainer.After 3 years, we get to see how Kratos attempts to break his oath with Ares and how he fights with the Furies at the beginning of the game. We also as always get to see a tortured side of Kratos as he tries to come to grips with the loss of his family and perhaps his humanity. Story-wise, it's what you can expect from a GoW game.Control-wise it's basically the same mechanics we have come to know and love from any GoW game as the more destruction you cause the higher combo points you can rack up.  You still have to collect red orbs to power your weapons and still have basic combos to get you through the game. One addition is now the Rage Meter as once it's filled up your combos becomes more deadly and potent so again, if you ever played this before, you will have no problem with this.Speaking of collecting, you still have to fill up not just the red orbs but also gorgon eyes, and phoenix feathers as well. My one small complaint on my first playthru is so far, I have found more gorgon eyes and I am wondering if there may be a possible balance issue as other GoW titles it seems like I found both in nearly equal measures of exploring but it's still not taking away from gameplay.One other great addition that some may not even notice is that the game automatically saves and saves a LOT which is a bit better than trying to find that elusive save point as done in earlier iterations which for me makes it harder to stop playing because usually the visible save point sometimes was my cue to step back but last night I found myself playing a lot longer than intended because I ignored the autosaves.A new addition is the world weapons: swords, spear clubs and more as well as the new chain grabbing move at Kratos' command.  Grab an enemy with your chains and beat the others around until you are ready to get rid of him.So far one thing I see that is a waste in the game is that there are chests that are decayed and can't be open and I don't know if they can be restored yet but I really don't see a need for them in the game.Graphically speaking, it's as always a gorgeous game with crazy environments from haunted prisons to snowy mountaintops and the enemies and bosses are very well defined. Keep in mind also that this is definitely not a game for children as early on there are some very graphic sexual scenes that kind of surprised even me but what good Greek action game like this would go without?So with all this in mind again, no GoW fan should pass on this especially since it looks like this gaming gen is coming to a close. Also, I would say if you want some GoW on the go and you have a PS Vita, now may be a good time to check out both God of War entries that was originally released for the PSP. They have aged pretty well and still play well even when upscaled.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2013"}

Nonetheless, I found the game to be enjoyable. It is a 3rd person shooter/RPG similar to Mass Effect. There are mini-games to crack safes, hack computers, and bypass doors.The inventory system is very easy to use, although it suffers many of the same problems as Mass Effect 1 where there are a bunch of different weapons in each family and you don't really know if they're good or not without quickly glancing at the specs. Many of these weapons are given fake names to avoid licensing issues with the real manufacturers. I saw the Remington/Bushmaster ACR, AK, FN SCAR among the assault rifles, and a few pistols. The weapon mods are plentiful and you can apply 4 different categories of mods.The same goes for the battle armor, and you can carry up to 8 different gadgets depending on the capacity of the armor.There are quite a few bugs and quirks in the PC game. When switching weapons, the zoom doesn't always work the first time so you have to push it repeatedly to get it to work. I chose to use my Xbox 360 controller to play the game on the PC, so it made the game easier to control except for aiming. The grenades aren't always tossed according to the dotted line, sometimes it hits invisible barriers and bounces back. This reminded me of Gears of War 2, except GoW had a better cover system.The bypass, lock pick, and hacking mini-games got tiresome the first 300 times I had to use them. I later learned that having EMP grenades allows you to bypass the games but you can carry a finite number of EMP grenades on you at one time. The checkpoint saving is also very frustrating. To sum up this game, it is like a mix of Mass Effect and Gears of War.Overall: 4/5 stars, very fun, short singleplayer playthrough, 4 romance options in 1 playthrough","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2011"}

You&rsquo;ll get a competitive advantage by hearing sound cues that youcan&rsquo;thear with speakers, such as the soft footsteps of an enemy sneaking up behind you, or the loading of a weapon far in the distance, regardless of the direction. By hearing sounds others can&rsquo;t - and by knowing where they&rsquo;re coming from - you&rsquo;ll react faster and take them out before they takeyouout.If you&rsquo;re serious about XBOX 360 gaming, get serious about the sound. Invest in an Ear Force X41 and experience the game the way it was meant to be heard. It will help you to become a better player and you&rsquo;ll have a lot more fun enjoying your XBOX 360.&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround Sound Technology!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Take your gaming to the next level by experiencing how your Xbox 360 was meant to be heard!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Enjoy late night gaming without disturbing others!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround SoundThe Ear Force X41 transmitter uses a 150MPS Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to deliver genuine Dolby Digital sound, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, and Dolby Headphone surround sound processing technologies - the industry-standard formats for encoding multi-channel sound in XBOX 360 games and DVD movies. The X41 uses the latest version of Dolby technology to create realistic game sound in 7.1 channels for improved surround sound accuracy.Dolby Pro Logic IIx and Stereo EnhancerThe X41 transmitter incorporates the latest Dolby Pro Logic IIx decoding system for surround sound realism from Dolby Pro Logic II encoded audio. When used with stereo sources, the Dolby Pro Logic Decoder also enhances the sound by spreading the stereo signal to provide a &ldquo;wider&rdquo; effect. This results in a richer, fuller sound than normal stereo - almost as if it originates from outside of the headphones.2.4GHz Wireless Digital RF TechnologyThe Ear Force X41 transmits game audio to the headset with an uncompressed wireless digital radio frequency (RF) signal to deliver CD-quality sound that rivals professional-grade wired headphones. Best of all, the wireless RF signal does not require &quot;line of sight&quot; to operate. That means you can stand anywhere near your XBOX 360 and hear a clear, noise-free signal.Chat Boost&nbsp;Dynamic Talkback&nbsp;ExpanderIf you&rsquo;ve ever had trouble hearing teammates on XBOX LIVE when the game action heats up, then you know how frustrating it can be when you have to keep adjusting the chat volume. Chat Boost fixes this problem by automatically adjusting the XBOX Live chat level when the game gets louder, so chat from teammates isn't lost in the exciting parts of your game. As the game sound gets louder, Chat Boost turns up the chat volume automatically so you can still hear what everyone is saying.It's a simple solution to an annoying problem, and it all happens automatically - so you don't have to adjust anything!Microphone MonitoringIt's hard to hear yourself speak when a headset is covering your ears. The X41 corrects this annoyance with its microphone monitoring feature. The X41 adds a portion of the microphone signal into the headset signal, so you can hear a portion of your voice along with incoming chat and game audio. Microphone monitoring not only prevents you from talking too loud or accidentally yelling into the mic, it also eliminates that annoying &quot;clogged ears&quot; feeling when talking while the headset is covering your ears.Bass BoostThe X41 headset DSP also lets you turn on a Bass Boost feature that produces deep, rich bass tones by increasing the volume of low frequency sounds - just like turning up the volume on the sub-woofer on your home theater system. Bass Boost improves your gaming experience by kicking-up the sound level of explosions, gun shots and other deep-bass sound effects, making them even more dramatic.Wired Headphone ConnectionThe X41 transmitter includes a headphone output jack with volume control to connect an optional pair of wired headphones in addition to the wireless X41 headset. This jack outputs the same high-quality Dolby Headphone 7.1 surround sound that&rsquo;s being transmitted to the wireless X41 headset, which allows two people to hear the game sound at the same time.Independent Chat/Game VolumesSeparate volume controls let you adjust the game and chat levels individually, so you can easily balance them and never have to worry about missing a cue from your teammates.Advanced Battery Booster CircuitryThe X41 has a &ldquo;battery booster&rdquo; circuit that squeezes every last bit of power from the batteries and assures high quality sound until they&rsquo;re completely dead. This allows a pair of AAA Alkaline batteries to last for as long as 25 straight hours of game play. You can also buy standard rechargeable batteries in place of Alkaline batteries.Powered By USBThe transmitter is powered by a single USB port on your XBOX, or from a nearby PC or laptop. So there is no need to fuss with a separate AC power adapter.","reviewerName":"TechGeek","summary":"Good Headphones","reviewText":"The headphones work great but the microphone crapped out on me and its impossible to fix without destroying the headphones.

Now it freezes or gets stuck on saving several times each level.  It's very frustrating.  I can deal with games freezing if the save function always works, but when a game freezes while saving, it's maddening.The crashes also reveal the futility of the game.  For instance, the last time I played, it froze while I was saving and forced me to start over at an old save. I had been doing well, but when I started over with the old save and did everything the same, the game played much differently.  My people who were happy, revolted and I was thrown out of office.  This makes me think that the game is more random in terms of a player's success than it appears.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2011"}

I decided to try the Demo first, and it was a day one purchase for me. The controls like anything take a little getting used to. Sometimes it's hard to understand what direction they want you to move the controller. Other than that, the Story is GREAT!They don't tell the story in a traditional way, it kind of jumps around a lot. I just played the first few chapters, but liked it so much decided to write a review now. It's more action oriented unlike Heavy Rain. The game keeps you wondering who Aiden is, and if he's a friend or foe. There are MULTIPLE ways you can play the game. If you mess up a &#34;sequence&#34;, it can change the game drastically. So the replay value is high.For you who thinks this looks like Ellie, don't worry. You won't ever think it's her when you start playing it. The game draws you in so much that you won't want to put it down. If you not sure about this, download the demo. Also, if you do like the game, please support the game by buying it new. This most likely won't get the sales like the big Triple A games. So if your a fan Support it! You won't be disappointed if you love a great story.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2013"}

That's where I have a problem. Whether I use the stylus or the strap with the plastic button, I just can't seem to get the hang of this game, which is a real shame since using the duel-buttons control method is not as precision-accurate. I like the online play too. I'm not sure there really is a voice chat option in the game as some sources had promised, but it's fun anyway, if you can stand getting blasted away multiple times by more experience players than yourself for the first twenty-or-so rounds. It's almost like Halo 2 when you're at a wi-fi hot spot as opposed to being in front of the television. I guess that's not much of a compensation unless you have a wireless router or like playing video games at designated McDonalds retsaurants (which may not be operational anymore).The single-player mode is okay, but the rarity of save points hurts the gameplay, especially if you've gotten far and suddenly get sick of the current control set-up. I thought the checkpoints were save points, but they're not, so I had to start all over again.I hope Nintendo didn't get discouraged from putting online multi-play in the following Metroid Prime games on GameCube and Wii, because the online was almost perfect. It was the controls that suffered in this game.So that's it. I'm not crazy about the game. If you're one of the people who can easily play first-person shooters on a DS though, this comes highly recommended. This and Insecticide.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2006"}

Rhodes","summary":"An Interesting Story Saves it From Some Repetitive Gameplay","reviewText":"After several years of more or less neglecting Assassin's Creed for what can best be described as no good reason whatsover, I finally decided to go ahead and jump into the series. After hearing so much about it there was a wonder as to why I never really jumped into it before.  In the long run I'm a bit disappointed I waited all the way until the third release to start, but I suppose it's better late than never.  On the other hand, for as much fun as Assassin's Creed is, I'm not sure how strong the first entry is.  From a story standpoint it's a damn amazing game with some great twists and turns and a great plot.  Likewise, from a production stand point it's also pretty awesome.  Which is why it's so sad that the spot where Assassin's Creed hits a snag is, of all things, the gameplay.By now most of you are probably familiar with the story, but it never hurts to have a refresher of sorts.  Desmond is kidnapped by Abstergo.  He's subject 17 and he is hooked up to a machine called the Animus.  This allows him to experience the memories of a man named Altair.  This was a man who was part of the Assassin's in the third crusade.  After failing a mission, Altair is stripped of his rank and his weapons taken away.  The only way for him to work his way back up is to go off and assassinate nine templars to prove himself again.  As the plot moves on it becomes a pretty engrossing tale.  In particular, because so much of it is so well presented.  The plot can be a little thick at times (and take some time to get to the point) but it's overall strong.  It's also a plus that the voice acting is also incredibly strong too--really drawing you into this fictional world.Unfortunately, this is part of where Assassin's Creed can also hit a snag.  The world may be a bit too big at times.  Not so much the incredibly populated locales... but rather that so many of the missions are repetitive.  You generally go on smaller missions to find people and interrogate them or something, before moving on to your mark.  There's not much variety at all.  While the cities themselves are fun to explore the missions make the world seem smaller than it actually is.  There's a lot to explore and some collecting to do, but for the most part this is no Grand Theft Auto.  There's a much deeper story here, but don't expect to be able to explore a city wrecking havoc wherever you go for some time.  Assassin's Creed takes itself pretty seriously in some respects.  And this is something to love.  The cities are detailed, with you also being able to look across the landscape to map the data for yourself.  On the other hand, it's quite surprising just how little it feels like you can do after a while.  Particularly because of the way you have to go about it.  Often times you'll have to blend in.  Run around and push people about too much and you'll alert enemies to your presence and have to fight them off.  And this is perhaps where Assassin's Creed stumbles the most.  The combat is, for the most part, boring.Don't get me wrong... the combat can be fun, but after a while it becomes even more repetitive than the missions themselves.  This is because combat is relatively easy.  The guards often times will stand by and let you take them on one by one and most times all it takes is just a simple counter and they'll go down easy.  And you'll go through this again and again and again.  The challenge is merely non-existent.  This rears its head even more so when you take into account that most of the bad guys... are surprisingly stupid.  As Altair you can blend in with crowds.  Sometimes this works a little too well as Altair may as well just be invisible.  You can sneak up behind a guard, kill him and watch him drop to the ground while another guard looks on.  So long as you \"blend\" they'll never suspect it's you.  At first it's hilarious to see a guard watch you stab someone and then say five seconds later, \"Who did this?\"  After a while, however, the novelty of such a thing wears off.  And this is something that can also be exploited all the time.  When you're spotted and run away there are times when things will be a little tough, but stand and fight and you'll easily emerge victorious.  On the other hand, running and hiding works just as well.  Sometimes, so long as you get far enough away, you can hide in bails of hay and the guards won't detect you.  On the other hand, when you run far enough away and just sit on a bench and they can't find you it can break your immersion.Assassin's Creed is still fun, it's just that it's easy to take advantage of.  One of the best things about it, however, is how one can seamlessly run across rooftops, scale walls and jump from one protruding ledge to another.  It's pretty seamless and isn't complicated at all.  Not to mention if you DO manage to screw up it's not big deal.  It's also not very sluggish at all or nearly as meticulous as say... Uncharted.  There's room for error here and there are often many different places to explore.  Guards will often attempt to follow you or hurl rocks at you to knock you down (and some will try to follow) but they'll still rarely be a match for you.The game is a wonder on the eyes.  By far a one of the better looking games in 2007.  It was a looker, for sure.  Particularly the locations.  There's definitely a pulse in the cities.  Areas are populated with people going about their business and their day.  You really get the sense that the denizens have lives.  You'll even hear them speaking a few times or mumbling to themselves.  And the way Altair interacts with them is quite fascinating as well.  As you run, for instance, he'll push people out of the way.  If you're walking he'll gently brush past them.  The animations are smooth much of the time, even when scaling walls.  There's a lot of meticulous detail here.  It's just a shame that from time to time the game buckles under its own weight.  There will be times when the frame rate will dip and there will be some performance issues.  There were also moments of clipping, although in my experience they were few and far between.What save Assassin's Creed from many of it's faults is that the narrative and story is very good.  Despite how repetitive it can be, you'll often find yourself wanting to go further down the rabbit hole to unravel more of the plot because that actually is pretty interesting in and of itself.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2012"}

Rhodes","summary":"Not to be left in the Dusk","reviewText":"The great thing about the Nintendo DS is that there is so much innovation to it.  Hotel Dusk: Room 215 is a game that has been done time and time again, but on the DS they can take it to a new level, and strangely it works really well.  For any gamer looking for a sophisticated, engaging story, Hotel Dusk: Room 215 is right up your alley.  It's engaging, simple, but still manages to be a complex game full of heart.  Those who really enjoy Film Noir will also really get a kick out of this.Kyle Hyde is a former NYPD detective.  His partner was Brian Bradley.  Under circumstances unknown Kyle ended up having to shoot Brian and his body fell into the Hudson River.  The body was never recovered, but Kyle still believes that Brian is alive.  Three years later, in 1979, Kyle is working as a Private Investigator for those unwilling to go to the police for help.  A client has asked him to locate certain items left at the Hotel Dusk.  Kyle, of course, accepts.  As the mystery unfolds, Kyle begins to learn what really happened to his former partner.Part of makes Hotel Dusk work is that it is very stylistic.  Kyle is a likeable guy, despite that he's stereotyped into being the alcoholic ex-cop.  His character really comes alive.  And it isn't just his character that comes to life, it's all the characters that you talk to throughout the game.  Each and every one of them is unique and distinct.  Along those lines the dialog is really crafty and humanistic, to a point where you feel less like you're playing a game, and more like you're reading an engrossing detective novel.To compliment the game even more, the visual art style is nothing short of fantastic.  The character designs are hand-drawn, but they're uniquely done.  Each character is drawn in a way that it says something about them.  You'll be captivated by it.  The environments themselves also look pretty good.  The 3D models are pretty good looking.  There aren't that many DS games out there that actually have a lot of 3D animation, so any time you get to see some it's a good thing.The most interesting aspect about the game is the style which it is played in.  You hold the DS sideways, as if it were a book.  The primary control of the game comes from the stylus.  You'll use it to navigate Kyle through the Hotel Dusk, and you'll use it to observe items and talk to people.  It's simple, and it feels very much like some PC games of the past where you used the mouse to point and click.  You'll find items you need to use all over the place.  Of course this brings about one of the games few shortcomings.  It's fairly linear, and you'll often find items well before you need to use them.  At least most of the puzzles aren't hard, and they're not presented in a \"Resident Evil\" style fashion.  So you won't be asking yourself questions like, \"Why do I have to do THIS to get THAT?\"  The puzzles are completely logical and grounded in reality.The good news is Hotel Dusk isn't about the puzzle solving and item collecting nearly as much as it's about the characters that play into the overall storyline.  This is a very heavily story driven game, much more so than even most mainstream RPGs.  You'll meet characters who will lie to you, and those who don't want to tell you things or give you little snippets.  When you engage in conversation you'll often be given the chance to ask questions.  You are, after all, a PI.  Be careful, though.  As a PI you need to ask the RIGHT questions.  Asking the wrong questions can cause the game to end.  So ask the right questions and get the right information.This brings about another of the games few shortcomings, except this is a rather big one.  The game is EXTREMELY dialog heavy.  When I say that I'm not kidding.  Some conversations can last for very long stretches of time.  Not all of them are necessary, and it's even worse when you figure out what's going on, yet you've still got to sit through all the dialog anyway.  To put it more simple it's like when a novel drags on for pages upon pages and a lot of what you read is irrelevant to the plot.  Hotel Dusk doesn't veer away from the plot often, but it does ramble on and on about basic plot elements quite often.  It can be frustrating, especially when you just want to play the game.  Likewise, there's not a snippet of voice acting.  I'm not saying the entire game has to have it, but it seems like at some points they should have had some.Another thing that may turn a few people away.  The story, while fantastic, is also pretty slow, and as much as I love games like this, you have to admit that those who love fast paced action adventure games will have a hard time getting into this, especially because the \"point and click\" formula is pretty dated.  To a point, those used to fast paced action might be bored through this.  If, however, you enjoy reading (as I do) then this is quite a relaxing experience.Hotel Dusk is a fascinating game.  Showing that some old school elements will never die.  It's engaging, captivating, and is a well told story, complete with all the elements of a good story.  It's a little slow at times, and it can also ramble, but if you're patient and stick with it, you'll be well rewarded in the end.On the Positive Side:+Unique storyline that's well told and engaging+Fantastic character development throughout the entire game+Simple to play, yet hard to master+A good soundtrack to get the mood straight+The Puzzles are not over the top, but instead are pretty simple to grasp+Crafty dialog makes the game perfect for those who love to readOn the Negative Side:-It gets off to a slow start-No voice acting to speak of-Some of the games moments are very dialog heavy, which can be very frustrating if you figure things out faster than Kyle does, and can be especially frustrating when it rambles","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2007"}

Urban \"U2fan4ever76\"","summary":"Not Your Typical Movie-Licensed Game!","reviewText":"Most come to fear movie licensed games as quickly put together tie-ins that ultimately end up being terrible. \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" is such a breath of fresh air in the movie licensed games arena. Though not perfect, it manages to capture the feel of the movie, the comic, and expand on both, giving you a full experience playing as Wolverine.The locations are highly detailed, particularly the jungle and New Orleans segments. The character model of Wolverine is very detailed and the way you take damage shows on the model in the form of clothing and skin being torn away and then the skin grows back over. Really cool visuals. The cutscenes vary from on the fly rendering to typical CGI scenes and all look very nice and move the story along. (One note, not all characters look like the actors from the movie. Most do, but not all.)The sounds and music are all solid and help with the mood of the game. Voice acting is rather good as well.The enemy AI is very tough at times as a lot of enemies are thrown at you at one time. The fast/strong attack and combos, mixed with special powers/attacks makes dispatching them fun and visually interesting. There is plenty of blood and limbs flying in this game, so definately not for the young.The controls are good and it is fairly easy to perform the combos, though many times you will find yourself just hitting the main attack buttons. As for enemy variety, there are many types and the mini-boss encounters are tough, mainly because sometimes the fights aren't fair as you have to leap on their backs at the right time and hope you don't leap into their hands.When you come to save points or checkpoints, the game sometimes acts like it is freezing which can be disorienting, but it doesn't really detract from the game. As far as other glitches, there are some typical collision detection ones.Overall, if you want to play a third person action game that is solid and based on a beloved character, this is the one to try, hands down.4/5 starsPros:*15+ hrs. of gameplay.*Nice selection of attacks and great animations for each.*Compelling story, expanding the movie, making you want to keep playing level after level.*Controls are solid and intuitive*Enemy AI is good.*Sound and music are good.Cons:*Levels can become redundant. It's a tradeoff between length of game and repeating exploration of some of the same areas.*The main bosses are either really easy or really hard. There is no consistency.*Not much replayability, except for some bonus training levels.*The last section seems rushed compared to the flow of the rest of the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2009"}

{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"Gordon \"PS3/PC Gamer!\"","summary":"Deep, intricate story that isn't for me.","reviewText":"The Witcher 2 is a massive game. While it only contains 3 chapters to complete, the world is so full of lore that its overwhelming. I went through most of the game not knowing who was who or what the difference was between Redania and Kaedwen. It doesn't help that you never actually visit these places either. For those who hope to get lost in a deep, politically charged journey into the world of a Witcher, I advise you read this review before thinking you're getting the second coming of Mass Effect (in terms of being immersed in a game world of course).I'll start with the good.The world is beautifully crafted on the Xbox. While its obviously not running on a powerful rig, it can hold its own against PS3 exclusives almost reaching Uncharted's graphical status (not quite there, but almost). The lighting is some of the best on console and I believe the art direction is probably the best in any game I've ever seen. Visually this game is a remarkable achievement and puts to rest those \"graphics don't matter\" arguments. I felt like I was actually in a forbidden dungeon or a monster's lair. The ghostly battlefield is one of the best, most immersive sequences I've ever had as a gamer.The dialogue is extremely believable and characters don't always explicitly state things. This is a game for the thinkers amongst us. The game gives you bits and pieces but you are expected to put everything together. You are involved in figuring things out as much as Geralt, and I really find that to be creative.I've never seen sorceresses handled in the way that the Witcher 2 does. I can't say anything without spoiling, but CD Projekt Red takes a rather creative spin on what a sorcerer's role is in a fantasy story.Thats really it for the pros. Other than that I'll tell you why the Witcher was not for me.The game world was dropped on me like a ton of bricks. I don't know if I was expected to play the Witcher 1 or what, but early on there were references to places, people, and creatures that I'd never heard of, but was expected to care about and know. What puts me off this game the most is the dry story and characters. Including Geralt, there is not one character that I really cared about, besides Iorveth and the Scoiatel. There is characterization and plenty of dialogue, and twists, but it's so dry to me. Everyone else finds it amazing and \"mature,\" but I find it quite dull at times. Most of the time you're talking about the state of the kingdoms and who did this or that. I purchased this game on how \"amazing\" the story is, and while its amazingly complex and unpredictable, I found it to be a little off-putting because something is always happening around Geralt, not to him. I want HIS story, not the kingdom's. For Geralt I just get cutscenes.Also, if this is your first ever encounter with the Witcher, be prepared to read A LOT. There was so much to read in order to grasp the story, that I had to pause and read Geralt's journal after every event. As mentioned, Geralt and the other characters bring up tons of wars, races, and other things that I have NEVER heard of so I was lost most of the time. I still am in some aspects.Unbelievably, while I found the story boring, the gameplay is what brought it down for me. It is not at all what I expected and took away any fun I could have had with the Witcher 2. This game is sluggish and the swordplay is downright awkward. Most of the time I choose the path of the mage, but even when the powers are leveled up to their max, they do little more than stun the challenging enemies. The Quen sign is the only one that felt like it had any real effect. Geralt doesn't feel like a Witcher. He feels like a human who rolls around doing stun attacks swinging a woefully underpowered sword. Can I swing a baton, or a magical whip? How about some electric fist carnage or more diverse special attacks! My point is that the swords get old fast and there isn't a whole lot of variety in the combat because of this. More creative boss fights and less general monster encounters would have negated this, but you're sure to have to slog through the same enemies with the same sword over and over.Even though I played on normal, it was no easy feat. This game can be TOUGH. It doesn't help that it has a terrible checkpoint system either. Depending on what you're doing, if you don't manually save, you may have to replay up to an hour's worth of gameplay.In conclusion I didn't have as much fun as I wanted with the Witcher 2. It was quite an impressive journey at times, but playing it was a chore at times and the story didn't pull me in because I had no ideas what was going on until I read afterward. I can't help but feel like Letho, Iorveth, or even a sorceress should have been the main character. Nothing happens to Geralt really. He almost feels out of place. Like I said, something is always happening in the distance somewhere, but never really to Geralt. For this reason, the immersion factor is not quite there story wise. There are WAY too many characters and things seem a little unfocused.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2012"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

The company's strategy has shifted away from state-of-the-art power and graphics like its competitors to more gimmicky attractors of differentiation. The 3d works OK. The difference between on and off really doesn't 'wow' me too much. When looking at the price compared to its competitor, the Vita hardware is a considerably better deal.The system really is not that comfortable in the hands like the DS was. The joystick does work fluidly, but at this stage, it should probably have dual analogs. In what has become a Nintendo expectation, they release a highly superior model not long after the system's launch for only a marginal cost, which is slightly frustrating.The 3DS does have a notable library, but it consists of the same song-and-dance of franchises we've seen through every iteration of Nintendo handhelds. You're going to get Mario, Donkey Kong, remade N64 games, etc. There are a few nice surprises, but the ideas, which have their own spin-offs of spin-offs, are overused and the Nintendo characters are becoming lifeless quite honestly.

Seriously.  Occasionally amusing, but sometimes it gets so cliche it is stupid.Conclusion:  this is an average RPG game with funny English accents and whimsical character design.  The interface is disappointing and easily doubles the game's length.  The story is nothing new.  Not as good an Final Fantasy anything, and not as fun for me as earlier Dragon Quest games that played faster.  If you can get it cheap though, it's probably worth it.

{"product_name":"B000KLNLV4","reviewerName":"Too Old for Games \"casualgamer\"","summary":"Decent game","reviewText":"Finally finished it.  The game does get repetitious towards the end and I cannot tell you remotely what the story is about.  You keep gaining new powers as the levels progress to keep things interesting, but there just isn't enough to make it more entertaining. Biggest compaint I have is that the environments all look the same and aren't too interactive, e.g., you have these powerful weapons but cannot destroy cardboard boxes.  A better mix of levels would have helped tremendously.  More weapons would have been great too, but you can't accumulate enough money to buy more than 2-3 guns.  And all the enemies look pretty much the same and the puzzles get old quick.  There are a couple of good boss battles that I'd replay, but that's it.  I'd change my rating to 3.5 stars.  A definite rental, but then again, it is priced correctly now so you could add to your library and not feel ripped off.I'm halfway through the game and here are my impressions:For $20, this is not a bad game to pick up.  It plays a lot like Gears but less refined.  The graphics are pretty good; the only thing is that the environments and levels are pretty blase--hopefully they get better as most of the levels look very similar.  The controls aren't too bad, only thing is that melee stinks and sometimes when you want to go into cover you wind up diving instead, but I had the same problem with Gears at times.  Nothing more to add about the glaive or the guns as that's been covered by others.This game is really under-rated due to it's lack of creativity and being a copycat of other games.  That's fine--so give it a 1 for creativity; but that doesn't affect the fun you'd have playing it.  If you like slicing and dicing people and don't mind the 3rd person shooter too much, then this is a great pickup at the price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2008"}

Wario, Mario's jealous rival, plays the hero--well, kind of--in his first console adventure.Money TroubleIn the depths of Wario's castle lies the plunder of his many adventures on the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance and elsewhere.While Wario kicks back in his crib, enjoying the videogame equivalent of bling-bling, a mysterious black jewel in his trove transforms gems into monsters. His wealth, which was once a source of pride, becomes his greatest foe. Now, Wario must scramble to recover his riches.Cranky CapitalistStep into an alternate world filled with quirky puzzles, swarming enemies and lots and lots of loot. You'll learn a multitude of cool moves as Wario progresses in the game. You can punch, kick, jump, grab monsters and objects and inhale surrounding coins like a two-legged vacuum cleaner. The game even has a wrestling game-ish feel, as you can string together combo attacks that The Rock would give his eyebrow for.Early on, you will learn the significance of special sticky balls that dot the landscape. Wario can cling to these balls to navigate tough spots, reach new areas, and even fight bosses.You can freely bash and manipulate your surroundings to discover secrets. For instance, you can pick up a stone pillar and swing it at your foes or spin a fallen monster to activate a switch that raises a gate.Perplexing PuzzlesThe side-scrolling action remains true to the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games that made Wario famous, but Wario's incredible range of motion gives him newfound freedom.Finding treasure often calls for flipping a colored switch, then searching high and low for the activated chest. Considering the size of the worlds and the plethora of hiding places, this can be quite a feat. When it comes to moolah, though, no task is too tough for Wario.Trap doors transport you to hidden worlds that offer mind-bending puzzles. Using your noggin' will yield some important items. A colorful band of fairies offers game info and advice throughout your adventure.GraphicsThe development team at Treasure have stamped Wario's Nintendo GameCube debut with colorful and vibrant graphics. Wario's signature look comes to life like never before. From his arrogant waddle to his purple trousers, Wario is immediately recognizable. Charles Martinet, the actor famous as the voice of Mario, brings a special zest to Wario's growls, chortles and guffaws.From gleaming castle walls to gloomy gravestones,Wario Worldis crammed with beautifully realized details. The action is relentless but the frame rate never falters, even when the screen is packed with dozens of enemies that explode into showers of coins when defeated.Wario Worldwill test both your brains and your button-mashing skills.","reviewerName":"D-Boy Wheeler","summary":"I'm-a Numbah One!","reviewText":"I need to play this some more (real life got in the way), but it is a great game once you start playing it.

{"product_name":"B00AKIPBNS","description":"","reviewerName":"ahw","summary":"Pretty Good Game, Some Flaws","reviewText":"Pretty good game.  Others have amply described the good bits.  Two things I didn't like:The plot is pretty good, but, without giving away any spoilers, the punch from the dramatic scenes throughout the story is sapped by future developments.  It happens on many occasions.  I found it to be rather cowardly and it would have been a better story overall if they didn't do this.  Also, several times during the story, you are asked to make an important choice, but a lot of the times the choice you make has no appreciable impact on the development of the story.I also found one aspect of the gameplay somewhat annoying.  When a defending unit kills an attacking unit with a counterattack, the tile that the attacking unit was occupying is vacated, allowing subsequent attacking units to move into the same space.  Thus, sometimes counterattack kills can be a disadvantage, because the defending unit is vulnerable to being killed by subsequent attackers.  It seems anomalous to me to actually hope that your defending unit does not kill an attacking unit in a counter attack.  Sometimes, if you are in a situation where you are finishing off an enemy unit, it's actually advantageous to equip your weakest weapon so that you have enough power to finish off the unit you are attacking, but not enough power to counter attack kill units that attack you in the next turn.  Final Fantasy: Tactics sidestepped this gameplay anomaly by having a downed unit leave a corpse in their tile, preventing subsequent units from occupying the same tile, which I prefer.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"D. VASQUEZ","summary":"This game is seriously OVERRATED, disregard magazine reviews","reviewText":"I've been a huge fan of some of the other games that have made Bioware shine in the gaming business, most notably KOTOR and to a lesser extent also Jade Empire and Mass Effect. Having clarified this i must say this game is incredibly overrated, and gaming magazines, online ones (like IGN and Gamespot) or offline have been complicit in this regard. It's disappointing you can't trust magazine articles that much anymore, they get influenced by advertising money, take the IGN review for example, game is criticized hugely in the review itself, but when it's score time, it is given a huge score of 9.0.Let me get into the details as to why this game really ends up being an underwhelming experience, with some really cool moments, but generally few and far between.PERFORMANCE / GRAPHICS-This is the most prone to crashing game that Bioware has ever released, and i'm pretty sure it can compete with other games as well in this regard, having played it for many hours at a time i can bear witness that it can crash as much as every 10 to 15 mins, and it doesn't really matter what you are doing, you can be in the middle of a fight or in the middle of a random video, it will crash anytime and anyplace, so keep that quicksave handy, it is specially fond of crashing right after you beat a boss, so you have to fight him all over again.-Game is filled with bugs, starting with looting bugs (monsters / soldiers disintegrate before you actually get a chance to loot them), AI bugs (party members sometimes just stand there and watch you die), etc.-Graphics are good, but nowhere near the level of expectation set by what the recommended requirements for the game are, among them a quad core processor, in the end the game looks good, but i'm sure many thought they would be playing under revolutionary graphics, much like Elder Scrolls Oblivion was when it was first released (4 years later this game still looks amazing, better than dragon age even).GAMEPLAY-Game has some great moments in it, usually the ones that bioware is good at, like political and power struggles, were you end up being involved, the problem with this is they are far between, most of the game will be spent from dungeon to dungeon fighting random monsters, and while this in itself is not bad, as its present in every bioware game or other games for that matter, the level in which they do it here is saturating to the point were you just want it to end, the game is made extremely long at the expense of playability. You'll often be given a particular task to achieve one objective, but this task always ends up complicating itself making you go through levels upon endless levels of generic monsters, and this can be fun for a time but again, it was saturating here, they just made the dungeons too long for their own sake, you'll find yourself trying to breeze through this, tired of the endless generic monster fights.-Class abilities are a mish mash, there are some that are cool, there are some that are completely useless and are there for the sake of being there, take shape shifting for example, which is a route that can be taken by mages, one of my mages was fairly advanced in this, and using it served little to no purpose, it was never better than just casting strong spells in any situation, and even the AI itself never used it. I see a lot of elements that felt \"borrowed\" from World of Warcraft, but not as well executed, they should have made it simpler.I think this mostly sums it up, i would've given them game another star, or maybe two, if it wasn't so buggy and crashy, but this added to the other shortcomings i mentioned, really didn't help it's case.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004X56OU8","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Van Wagenen","summary":"Great levels, gameplay, and 3D-capable feature is AWESOME","reviewText":"This game has the excellent 2D gameplay of the classic games, and Sonic the Hedgehog 4, but also the very fun 3D gameplay of Sonic Unleashed (which I actually thought was a great game). For how cheap this game is, I would say it's one of the best values you can find as far as Xbox 360 games. You can probably get better games at the forty to sixty dollar mark, but for so much less you can get this excellent homage to all the previous Sonic games.The music is so awesome too. When you're in the overworld area to select a level, as you pass by the levels you hear an amazing arrangement of the level's theme song redone as a Lindsey Sitrling-esque violin rendition. I would love to have the soundtrack with the full versions of these songs on them.I won't spoil anything, but the very last boss is kind of dumb. But the other bosses and other levels are all pretty great. There's plenty of replayability with mini-games/challenges and red stars & other collectables. You can even unlock a Genesis original version of the first Sonic the Hedgehog game.Finally, if you have a 3D TV, the 3D mode on this game is FREAKIN' SWEET. If nothing else, it was worth the purchase just to show off what gaming in 3D is like. Most games do not support this, and many that do are boring and barely worth playing, so it was a welcome addition to be able to use my TV's 3D feature on more than just Disney Blu-rays.

{"product_name":"B004X56OU8","description":"","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"Finally, a modern Sonic game done right!","reviewText":"This is easily the best Sonic game in ten years! (Though that's not saying much since the last good one was \"Sonic Adventure 2\" from 2001) It combines the classic 2D platformer Sonic the Hedgehog games of the 90's with the modern Sonic of today, most notably, the speed gameplay from the \"Sonic Unleashed\" daytime levels.The game is good overall, but there are two things that suck. One, they force you to play through the same levels multiple times in order to advance. While I get they did it to stretch the game experience out a bit, it gets tedious and repetitive having to replay the same levels over and over, with only a slight goal variation. I'd much rather we got two remade levels from each of the nine canonical Sonic games, instead of just the one from each that we get, thus only having nine total levels in the game. And two, Sonic really can't jump in this game, whatsoever. I don't get why he jumps so low, even as modern Sonic. It's a little annoying. The physics are a bit off compared to the original game, in terms of classic Sonics sprinting (much slower than before) and both Sonic's extremely low jump.Either way, it's a good game and any Sonic fan simply must check it out! I don't know if I'd call it \"perfect\" though, which is why I only gave it four stars. The minimal levels and minor physics problems keep it from being perfect. Definitely worth a playthrough, as any Sonic fan, but only worth a rental, instead of a buy. After about two weeks or less, you'll be done with it. But the game itself is awesome.Sonic The Hedgehog 1 & 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, Sonic Adventure 1 & 2, Sonic Heroes, Sonic 2006 (unfortunately, as I was hoping that game wouldn't count as canon), Sonic Unleashed, and Sonic Colors (which is weird, cause it was only on the Wii, and so, few people got to play it) are all represented here, and every stage, even the two bad-Sonic games, are awesome!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2012"}

I personally did not find it short and here is why. This is one of those games that you can replay over and over and over again and never get bored. Why? It's because there are multiple ways to do each mission. The decision on how to carry out each mission is entirely up to you. For example, some buildings may have 5+ entrances. You can choose to enter the building any way you wish. Maybe on your first play through you'll want to enter the sewer first in order to get up into the building. Then maybe on your second play through you'll change it up by entering the front door. Then on the third play through you may decide to enter through one of the windows up top.There are multiple ways to kill people too. You can keep it simple by killing them with a sword or other simple weapons. Or, you can get creative with your powers (these powers get upgraded by you as you make your way through the game) and do something such as create a swarm of rats to kill your target. You can get even more creative by having your target shoot themselves. This involves freezing/slowing time just as they shoot off their gun, giving you just enough time to then possess them so you can walk their body right in front of the bullet and then toss them into it, thus killing them.As for things such as safes, which require you to figure out the combination, the game automatically changes it with each new mission. So if you think you'll just memorize it from your first play through, guess again. You'll have to figure out the code a second time because they will change it on you.Anyway, I think you get my point on why the replay ability is amazing. I could go on and on, but I'm sure you have the point by now. As for other pros for this game the graphics are fantastic, the game itself is a ton of fun (challenging at times, but fun). One thing you should also be aware of is chaos levels. If you want the bad ending, you're free to kill as many people as you want (the bad ending is much easier to achieve). If you want the good ending, you'll have to be more careful by doing your best to be stealthy and not kill anyone or to kill as few people as you possibly can. This can be done by choking your victims or putting them to sleep with a sleep dart. When you do, you have to put them in a safe place so this way other guards won't see them and rats won't reach them and kill them.Overall, it's an amazing game. Get it if you enjoy stealth games!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2013"}

While pretty much the same as any of the other House Of The Dead games the one thing that really puts this game apart from the other is the dialogue and characters, while almost all the HOTD dialogue is cheesy this game realizes that and actually turns it around to give the game a retros type humor that makes it greatly enjoyable as you level to level. I already had the game for the Wii but after hearing about the enhances graphics as well as added levels and for the price I figured why not and after playing don't regret that choice.  While most of the levels almost the same there are some differences mainly in the highly detailed HD graphics which obviously surpass the Wii version and the added bonus of being able to play the female protagonist Varla and a few levels makes this a nice added feature as well.  You can almost tell that the actors and actresses they got to voice these characters were having a great time hamming it up in standard retro 60's attitude, while most times actors are usually told not to ham it up like this where but in this game are they paid and encouraged to do so.

After having played through couple of chapters while mastering the art of profanity, I finally lost the will to play and gave up.CD Projekt, to my pleasant surprise, eradicated as much  mistakes they've made as possibly can without creating the game from ground up by this rare impressive CRPG collector's set exclusively for PC gamers in reminiscent of old school CRPG box sets like 'The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall', 'Ultima IX: The Dragon Edition', and 'Neverwinter Nights: The Limited Collector's Edition'.Contents of the game are indeed outstanding, not seen in the present days.  It contains the enhanced edition of the game that includes new translation and voice-over, better graphic and more animation, better in-game menu and inventory management, and extra missions and quests.  It also comes with D'jinni Adventure Editor, the very construction set used to create the game by the development team.  It also comes with 'Making-of' documentary, soundtrack, and music.  They are spreaded over 5 discs.  It goes even further by including full-fledged game guide, stand-alone story book, and maps along with manual.  All of these for price of $40.  Amongst all the overpriced ripoffs labeled as so-called collector's edition to make up for the higher-than-ever development cost released these days, this one actually is really worth it, even if you already purchased the original.  Best of all, if you already purchased the previous version of the game, the new contents can be downloaded from the official website for absolutely free.  If you are a fan though, this one is really worth re-purchasing.Gone are the painfully long loading time, frame issue, and ugly bugs that marred the gameplay.  I can't believe it's the same game.  They really really cleaned up the game that wasn't really terrible to begin with.  However the few flaws of the 'Aurora Engine' still come intact.I hate Bioware Software for selling out to EA, but I hate them even more for 'Aurora Engine' and their similar counterparts used in such game as 'Neverwinter Nights', 'KOTOR', 'Jade Empire', and 'Mass Effect'.  Back in the old days, Bioware's own classic 'Infinity Engine' used to create many CRPG classic such as 'Baldur's Gate' series and 'Planescape: Torment' was quite impressive and charming considering the technological limitation in the days when the art of video game was in its infancy.  But to use isometric camera angle these days outside TBS / RTS / RTT games and Diablo-esque clickfast action RPG is just beyond obtuse.  Although you get two more camera angles beside the isometric one, none of them are quite right in context of its combat mechanics.  Refined and more responsive free-camera would have been much better than the one we have in the game.Speaking of combat mechanics, if you click it once it, not only it doesn't do any damage but you are left vulnerable to the counter attack.  You have to constantly chain combo.  And the combo system is timing-based so instead of you putting the input directly at will to execute the combo, you solely have to rely on the signal on the screen to click the mouse.  Very fresh idea to innovate CRPG combat, bad execution in my opinion.But the biggest of all, as in all 'Bioware' games, you just don't feel like you are in the huge open world due to the modular nature of the engine.  Well, the game world is actually quite huge but it is made up by all these small areas that are connected by the loading screens.  The confined area that only have couple of exit points all connected by the loading screens, even if the loading time is very fast, isn't just immersive.  Granted, even free-formed CRPG like 'Oblivion', 'Two Worlds', and 'Gothic' series all have hidden loading time but in those games you are not environmentally restricted except unclimbable high cliffs, and you don't see any loading screen.  You can go anywhere anytime.  Well, beside the fact that 'The Witcher' is structured in linearity plotwise, in this game, despite its beautiful graphic, if not overtly impressive, you can't even jump over the shallow fence to go to the area just around the corner.  So you have to go all the way around and go through loading time to go to the same area right around the corner.  Geralt is a master swordsman but he has to go around the stone right in front of him to continue his journey.  You are not even allowed to set a pinky toe in the river, so what does he have to do?  Go through a few loading screens to go right across the river of the same area.  Every move you make feels so restrictive and confined.  Tons of branching dialogue options that directly affect the outcome of your action and complicate plotline are constantly marred by the this shortcoming of the engine.  Hopefully CD Projekt will create their own engine to put their impressive ideas into reality instead of using any Bioware leftovers.But despite these several fatal flaws, this is a very strong and solid CRPG that presents great RPG experience set in morally ambiguous world rarely seen in video game these days with dynamic interaction and quest system within the confinement of linearity of the game.  The game gives you more focused character-driven story than other free-formed CRPG.  Music is excellent, and combat, when it works, is very fast-paced and exciting.  This is very well-polished game and overall production values are very high.  It's been a long long time since CRPG offers intelligent dialogues and this many choices that all have consequences.If you are a long-time CRPG fans who long for the glory days of old-school classic CRPG, this is definitely a must-have game.  After all there are not many good RPG comes to PC any longer.'The Witcher: Enhanced Edition' is an impressive CRPG and an outstanding package.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"Destitute","summary":"Serah! You can't do that! The future will be changed! You'll create a time paradox!","reviewText":"I actually liked Final Fantasy XIII, and this is coming from a guy who's pretty much played and enjoyed all of the essential Final Fantasy games. Yeah, it was as linear as a tunnel for most of the game, but I still enjoyed it for the stunning graphics (it was actually the game that finally made me give in and get an HDTV,) decent story and characters, and its pretty fun fighting system. Despite my satisfaction, when I heard they were making a sequel, I immediately groaned. Square has dabbled in sequels to FF's before, some better than others, but this was one of those games that really didn't need a sequel. I expected either another girly sequel like FFX-2 or something entirely different. But to my surprise, this game was actually done right.GRAPHICS: Is it me, or do the graphics in this game look a little worse than its predecessor? Maybe it was due to time constraints or to keep the Xbox 360 version on one disc, but the graphics do look slightly downgraded. Or perhaps it's been two years and I've been desensitized to the eye candy. However, the game still looks stunning in HD; it's not that much of a blow. I'll gladly trade aesthetics for gameplay any day.SOUND: We all miss Nobuo Uematsu, but to be honest the soundtrack of this game is still much better than the OST's of games today. What I like about the music is the variety. We have tracks from the last game, plenty of J-pop, a number containing some pretty sick violin and percussion work, and even a screamo song about chocobos that is simply hilarious. Many of the tracks have to grow on you, but once they do, you'll love them.Voice-wise, everyone reprises their roles from the first game, so if you enjoyed the voice acting from the first, then you should enjoy the acting in this one as well. The new characters' voices are just as good, too. The moogle sounds just as annoying as I imagined it would be.STORY: The gist of it is that Serah travels through time with a mysterious man named Noel to find her sister, Lightning. It can get very convoluted (what time-travel story doesn't?) and I was confused throughout, but the story started making sense near the end. Kinda. Expect a lot of time travel tropes, including paradoxes and alternate timelines. Also grab a bottle of whiskey, because it can get very depressing at times.GAMEPLAY: Gameplay wise, this game is a LOT more fun than the first, and it's what the first should have been. It's still lacking true JRPG towns and shops (you still have one place where you buy all of your items from, this time in the form of an awkwardly annoying lady dressed as a chocobo,) but it's way less linear. The game is divided into many different areas with different time periods, which are all accessed through the Historia Crux, which is the map. Each area contains a time gate, which will take unlock another area once you find the right item, which is the \"artefact,\" and many different fragments. There are 160 fragments, many of which are acquired by defeating powerful monsters or finding an item for someone. If you want to get every fragment, you'll have to unlock every area in the Crux, which can be quite difficult. There are even alternate \"endings.\" Another feature is Mog the moogle who follows you around. You can use him to find invisible treasures and throw him to find stuff that's out of reach. And half of the fun in this game is finding everything.The battle system is the same paradigm system from FFXIII, with a few new things tacked on. You can have three characters in your party: Serah, Noel, and a monster. You get a monster by defeating it, and can level it up using certain items. Think Pokemon...sort of. Also, it's no longer game over when the party leader dies, and thank goodness for that.One thing I rather don't like is the game's poor platforming at parts. You can now jump, but alas, Kingdom Hearts it isn't. This means some frustrating timed jumps, especially at the final area.Then there's the DLC. FF has finally decided to have downloadable content, for better or worse. You have costumes, which would have been cooler if they were in the game, characters(one involving a lot of gambling with Sazh. I hate gambling in RPG's, especially slot machines,) which should have been hidden in the game also (imagine if you had to pay to unlock Yuffie and Vincent in FFVII,) and even some major story DLC to come, which is supposed to continue where the game left off. DLC is a double-edged sword, and they're using both edges here. On one hand, it's cool to have a reason to pick up the game months later, but on the other, it's kind of lame to throw more money as you play for enhancements. Bah. DLC is here to stay; better deal with it.Overall, if you liked the first game, then check this one out. Even if you didn't like it, give this one a rent at least, as it improves on the things that you probably hated about it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2012"}

It is definitely worth playing through once but after you've done that there really is no need to play it again.Unlike most of the Tales series this one revolves specifically around one floating island. There is one main town which sits at the center of the island but like most tales games there isn't much besides the main storyline in terms of what to do. I did enjoy learning new recipes to bake food (you can use baked food outside of combat for healing) but besides that there wasn't much else.The combat system is the same as with other Tales games where its a side scroller fighting based battle system. This has its own advantages and disadvantages but the system here seems just about the same as the other games. One thing to note though is the bonus you get for the fight is dependent upon if you meet certain criteria while fighting (avoiding the user of skills for example or beating it under a certain period of time). These side little bonuses are fun to strive for but get old fast.I have to admit though that the story began to pick up towards the end of the game. You'll see once you play, not going to spoil anything.Decent RPG but one of the lesser gems in the series. Play it for the story though even if it's just once, it's worth at least trying.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2008"}

The object of the game is to search dungeons the world over to find bits and pieces of your destroyed village. Once you find the pieces, you must rebuild the village. The grid system is similar to Sim City because of the layout, which seemed very familiar to me. I like the whole concept of the game, which makes it a winner in my books.The graphics are great, despite those who say that the graphics are Sub-Par. The environments are well detailed, and the character animation is very well done. The music is the games biggest weakness. It is mainly background music that doesn't stick in your mind like the music in FFX or Maximo. It also would have been nice to have some voice acting, simply because the PS2 can handel it. Some people might complain that the characters and enemies look &quot;cartoony&quot;, but it didn't bother me one bit. Remeber &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;? Everyone loved that game, and Dark Cloud is quite similar to that.The battle system is real-time, similar to Zelda and Maximo. People who don't like the random battles with enjoy the battle system here, and controlling the characters is a breeze. The in-game map is also quite nice, and it avoids the hassel of getting lost all the time. I am not the most attentive gamer, and this is a common problem for me.So who would I recommend Dark Cloud to? Almost everyone I know, since it has RPG elements, but not the lengthy battles and cinematics to put off people who are not RPG fans.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

This truly is one of the most immersive games I've ever played, thanks in no small part to the cinematic cutscenes, voiced dialogue, and well-written storyline. As far as the way the game progresses, it's basically identical to ME1. The dialogue system is the same (with the somewhat misleading options that make you say something almost completely different) but adds a new feature: interrupts. Now during certain sequences an icon will flash on the screen, sometimes for a Paragon action, sometimes for a Renegade action, and if you click the appropriate mouse button in time, Commander Shepard will interrupt the dialogue and perform an action -- just be sure to keep your hand on the mouse and be ready!Where the game differs from ME1, it does so in such a way that really streamlines the entire experience. As you may have already heard, there is no conventional inventory to deal with, rather you can use \"Weapon Lockers\" on the Normandy (and sometimes placed within a mission) to assign weapons to your squad members. In Shepard's private quarters on the Normandy you can change your armor, but there are not many choices of weapon or armor to speak of, so the maintenance is minimal. Squad members can't change armor (except that eventually you can change their appearance, but not in a way that affects their abilities -- it's purely cosmetic). One other nice touch is that all weapons use the same ammunition, so you'll never need to search for specific types of ammo anymore.The way skill points work has also been changed. At the level cap of 30 you will end up with 51 points. You spend these points on 6 (or 7) powers and each power has 4 ranks. The final rank unlocks your choice of one of two possible \"evolved\" versions that are very powerful, such as the choice between a more powerful version of Pull, or Pull Field, which affects a group of enemies. The powers assigned to each class have also changed from the first game, so be sure to review the differences before choosing a class. Even if you import your ME1 save game, you can choose a new class before beginning the game.Now, having said all that, I still have one big complaint about the game, and it's actually similar to the complaint I made about ME1. The way ME2 is structured is thus: after the initial events, you are given two or three recruitment missions during which you pick up new squad members. After doing these missions, the next big step of the main story becomes available. After this part is done, you are given another handful of recruitment missions, which again must be done before the next part of the main mission is available.Don't get me wrong, the individual missions are fun, well-designed, and offer plenty of diversity of gameplay -- but at the same time, they almost felt like filler between the main missions of the story. Just as in ME1, the actual main plot missions of ME2 really are quite short and don't account for the majority of the game. There are recruitment missions for almost every squad member (those who don't join you from the beginning) and then subsequently each squad member has a \"Loyalty Mission\" which is optional but very useful to do (and again, they are wonderfully designed). But if you count up the actual number of missions that deal directly with the main story, there are about four or five, each lasting 1-2 hours.I understand that it is necessary to do missions to recruit your squad members, but I didn't necessarily like that doing them was a prerequisite for advancing the plot. What that amounted to was doing a lot of what felt like side quests while the main quest was being intentionally postponed. Of course I want to do these recruitment missions, but it would have been better if we were allowed to do them *at the same time* as we progressed in the main storyline. In other words, pick up a squad member we want, then do a main mission quest or two, then go back and do another recruitment mission. But as the game is designed, you have to do these other missions first before you are allowed to progress the main story. It has the effect of making the main story seem sparse and spread too thin across the span of the game.But I give ME2 five stars simply because it was superbly designed and massively enjoyable. I can't wait to play ME3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2010"}

If you are a Playstation Plus member, you should have zero trouble hitting this limit, especially if you are a day 1 subscriber like I am.Star Rating:0 for the Price, once this is around $39.99 to $59.99 this will be more reasonable, even if it didn't stop me from paying $99.99.4 for the Storage Capacity, it's a good amount after reviewing how much I can actually fit, I upgraded my rating from 3 stars.Updated: February 13, 2013, all games, movies, patch/dlc data and PlaystationMobile games updated","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2012"}

Daneker","summary":"If you enjoyed Lands of Lore!","reviewText":"Years after discovering Lands of Lore 2 and the somewhat disapointing 3, I find the Elder Scrolls series. I had no idea the games where so simular. Comming more than ten years after Lands of Lore, and not connected in anyway that I know, Oblivion is certainly a far advanced game, but offers a similar experience for those fond of the LOL series.Oblivion can be played in view like a first person shooter (although this is an RPG adventure) or in third person (console game style.) I prefer the first person, it's more engrosing and fits better with the keyboard control. Since this is an X-box and PS3 title as well it would have been nice if you could use a controler rather than a mouse and keyboard (although, my sidewinder sucks so maybe a controller you could assign keyboard keys to would work?)This game is instantly engrossing. You start off with minimal introduction and get right into things. But, no hurry, you many wonder and do what you will when you will and work on the main quest when you feel like it.You can go anywhere in this huge, huge, huge world, anywhere at all, there are no boundries and every door lock can be picked (at risk of arrest and loss of some skill after serving jail time!)The graphics are outstanding, nearly photo quality but even my Dual-core 1.8 AMD 64 bit processor, my NVIDIA Go 7000 256mg graphic card and high-res monitor have a hard time in the complex grass and trees. Fortunately you can tone down just the grass and tree effects so the dungeons and towns (which run much easier) can be seen in higher resolutions.Sound is best with a surround speaker set up or head phones, However, my notebook's Altec Lansing soundstrip (4.1 surround on a notebook!) does quite nicely!This game runs best on a 2.0 gig duel core processor or higher, 1gig of memory (at least! I have 2.)and the best, fasted graphics card you can find. My sytsem has a HDMI conector and I plan on trying this game on my 42\" HDTV soon, should look spectacular.You can't not get lost in this game, it's tremendous and seemingly limitless. Although, again, slower computers will have to sacrifice graphics. Oh, and here's a glitch on this and some other games, if I turn on anit-alias support, my sound card stutters.A must have for RPG fans and far superior to games like DOOM!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2007"}

But I feel it's important to provide feedback that perhaps will be read by the right people.First and foremost, I own a 60gb HDD that came with my XBox 360. That drive is starting to get full so I decided to go ahead and upgrade to the 120gb model. Unbelievably a 120gb HDD from my XBox 360 costs $146.99 from Amazon; more if you decide to purchase the drive from a brick and mortar store.To compare, I recently upgraded my PC's external HDD to a full 1tb Western Digital for $109.99. I also upgraded my PS3's HDD to 500gb for $89.99.So why then does Microsoft see fit to charge $146.99 (or more) for their measly 120gb HDDD? I suppose the answer is pretty apparent: Microsoft has a monopoly on the XBox 360 HDD's. No other manufacturer offers a hard drive for the XBox 360 so Microsoft can see fit to charge whatever they want. It's really nothing more than corporate greed on a company well versed in the practice.Thanks but no thanks Microsoft.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2009"}

It's growling and saying \"NOT FOR BASEBALL NOOOOBIES!!\" Growl!! If you don't know the difference in a sinker and a cutter, you probably shouldn't buy this game. It's a very detailed simulation experience with a breadth of good options. However, these options will overwhelm people who don't grasp the subtleties of the game. The batting alone has a half-dozen important variations. Will you use the analog stick or the buttons to swing? Do you want to use the hot zones, the PCI, etc.Arguably the most important aspect is hitting, which feels largely unchanged (e.g. difficult). I personally like to turn on ONLY Guess Pitch. I don't like the Plate Coverage Indicator at all. I prefer to skip Hot Zones as well, since you have no control over where they are. One nice feature is that you can hit homers with the normal swing button. Power Swing seems to get me into a lot of trouble.Graphically, the game is top notch. Clayton Kershaw looks exactly like Clayton Kershaw. The renderings of the stadiums are brilliant. The audio is sharp as well. The ball comes off the bat and sounds as it should. The one area that disappoints me is the commentary, which is too sullen and dead. I understand that Rex wasn't a beloved figure, but he did most certainly liven up the commentary.I haven't much gotten into the pitching yet, so I'll reserve comment beyond saying that it's very similar to prior versions if you use the button style pitching.Beginners will be frightened by how good the fielding against you is. Mid level Triple A Outfielders can easily range 90 feet, while apparently never looking at the ball, and end up making a great Willie Mays catch. However, you'll realize that players with top-notch speed can beat out throws from deep in the hole many times.RTTS mode is great. You now get rewarded for good at-bats and it feels far more realistic. You need to be patient and be consistent to improve, it does take a while.Part II: The ComparisonThis game is certainly better than the 2009 version, but nothing is drastically different. In my mind, it did NOT need to be. The refinements they made were very much on the money. For example in RTTS, You get rewarded for good at bats, and your goals are not as definitively fixed for every moment either. Moreover, the training is far, far more useful now. It's more varied, by far. You get to engage in more specific activities that are far more targeted than they were before. There are 4 or 5 different training modes just for hitting, as opposed to 1 or 2 before.The graphics are great, as they always have been. The commentary is not really to my liking. It's accurate and realistic but just feels dull. I prefer to turn it off and listen to music from my PC.The largest improvement to me is how much more enjoyable RTTS is. It was so frustrating in 09 that I gave up at various points. You also get the option of buying 6k training points for $5, a nice little investment to skip ahead.If you had previous versions like 09 or 10, yeah, buy it. But I don't think it's enough of a jump from 2011 (which I rented and liked).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0009S4UOA","reviewerName":"I Teach Typing","summary":"An Authentic, Outdated Classic","reviewText":"Coming out all the way back in 2005, Call of Duty 2 is by no means new; the graphics seem almost foreign compared to today's wonders (Last of Us, this is not), but CoD 2 is still a great, great game. Anyone who has played any of the other games in the franchise should already know this game's incredibly easy control layout, giving your soldier the ability to chose from three types of stances, aim down the sights of your rifle, throw grenades, and swap weapons with ease. After playing with Killzone's mess of a control scheme, CoD's control layout is a welcome breath of fresh air.Back before multiplayer was expected to carry an entire franchise, game developers actually had to put a little more effort into their campaigns, and it is truly shown in CoD 2's case. Spanning across three military expeditions, you'll play as a freshly recruited Russian soldier sent to defend his homeland, a British foot soldier, command tanks, and (my favorite) star as an American private sent to fight on D-Day. The story is enjoyable, and the battles are varied enough to keep this action-packed, lengthy campaign exciting. The game also offers a multiplayer, but this is not CoD2's strong point. Seekers of a multiplayer experience should look elsewhere for WW2 action.Anyone looking to see how CoD started to transform the first person shooter should definitely pick up this classic, especially at the current price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00006M3R6","description":"Metroid Fusionis a side-scrolling action game that's more in line with the series' NES origin than its GameCube contemporary, the first-person action gameMetroid Prime. In this one, players take the bounty hunter Samus on an extermination mission through a research facility to kill X parasites--nasty creatures that absorb and assimilate the powers of their host. After she survived an X attack through the use of a vaccine made with X parasite DNA, she can now absorb the parasites to regain health and obtain special powers, like the morph ball, space jump, and wave beam. The problem is that the parasites are quickly making their way through the research lab's many dangerous projects and subsuming their abilities.As a special bonus to GameCube owners,Metroid PrimeandMetroid Fusioncan each unlock special features in the other game via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable. For example, by completingMetroid Fusion, you can unlock the original NES version ofMetroidinMetroid Prime. By completingMetroid Prime, you can unlock Samus's fusion suit for use inMetroid Prime.","reviewerName":"Vicente Drago \"Shaun O'Donnell\"","summary":"Another Reason why GBA is one of the best","reviewText":"THere is no doubt that Metroid Prime has completly redefined the way games are made and played.  Hell the 1st person shooter alone has been altered for good.  However at the same time this little gem has been released and may be overlooked due to the fact that this on GBA.  DOn't overlook this title.Metroid Fusion is the true sequel to Super MEtroid, where as Prime is the sequel to first (NES) but preguel to #2 (Gameboy).  In this Samus has for the most part succesfully wiped out the Metroids after the Larva rescued in #2 sacraficed itself to give Samus the strength needed to destroy Mother BRain.  Meanwhile the planet that the metroids had lived on is under a new threat.  The threat is the X parasite that also lives on the planet Zebes.  Samus first comes across this threat on an expedition there that held almost fatal results.  Only with the help of a serum made of metroid DNA was she able to survive.  Armed with the DNA of the Metroid now she returns to Zebes to take out the X parasite.  Her only weakness is Ice.  Not a problem except that the X parasite replicates what it attacks, and there is now a Samus clone out there that is a bone crunching killing machine, with all of Samus skills and attacks.The game itself is like the other metroids, starts off a little easy be progressivly gets more and more challenging.  WHile the past one difficulty was in the jumps and ackward platforming at times, this one challenge comes in the form of later bosses, and avoiding the SA-X (Samus Clone).  Two bosses that stand out are a Spider that is fast and when it grabs you can eliminate you in a few short hits, and a Phantom like RObot that can control gravity and takes an incredibly long time to beat.  However like the past games the Villian Ridly returns (the Dragon BEast), frozen after Super.  Sadly the need to make him Challenging again was thrown out the window as I beat him fairly quickly (after the Phantom Robot, you can whip any bosses ass belive me).Overall this is another Prime example for why the Game Boy Advance can hold it's own when up against the likes of PS2, Xbox, and the bigger BRother Game Cube.  If you can't aford PRime, than pick this up.  YOu will not be disappionted.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00CX8VY4S","description":"","reviewerName":"Seanna","summary":"Same Ol' Story","reviewText":"First let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of all types of video games. Whether they are open world, first person shooter, rpg etc I will play them all. When I first saw Watchdogs premier at E3 oh so long ago I got so excited and was visually convinced by the beautiful graphics and intriguing story/gaming ideas that this was going to be a truly unique gaming adventure. Fast forward into the future and I must say that Watchdogs is not all it is cracked up to be.I don't agree with Ubisoft's decision to downgrade the graphics on the Xbox One to 960p  when the machine is fully capable of running games at 1080p.  Ubisoft Also released Watchdogs on the Playstation 4 however it's available at the full 1080p.  There are videos only where you can watch the comparison however unless you visually see them in person then you can't truly appreciate the higher aspect ratio and how this is a let down to Xbox One users.Like other reviews have suggested, if you have played previous Grand Theft Auto titles or Infamous titles then you will be very familiar with the gaming format of Watchdogs. It's truly nothing new your character is put in a &#34;dangerous&#34; situation in which he must escape and this is your first mission and introduction to your  basic &#34;hacking powers&#34;.  These include hacking cameras, ATM machines, and cars to name a few.Eventually you will try and evade the authorities (sound familiar) and do so either on foot or in a car that is conveniently provided to you by an associate in a nearby garage (*nudge to GTA).  Oh and it's not that you're a bad driver, the controls in this game aren't a 10 by any means.I shall not give away the rest of the game but essentially you go through missions in a open map world to unravel the story.Taking into account the Story, controls and Graphics I would give Watchdogs a 7.5 out of 10 on the Xbox One. It's an average game, and the controls and graphics really let it down on the Xbox One. If you're going to invest in Watchdogs I would try and not to expect a unique gaming experience rather just another version of a game you've played before.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2014"}

Legions of fans continue to play all of the games even to this very day. Millions of copies were sold worldwide. Every entry in the series had been held in high regard because of the standards it set in the gaming community. Every Nintendo console and handheld system had been graced by a Zelda game. Everyone will tell you....this is where it all started. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986, been re-released a few years later and had been ported over to the Game Boy Advance in 2004 under the \"Classic NES Series\": a series of some of the best NES games.Many reviewers have already broken it down to what you do and what made the game such a blast to play so I'll add in my two cents on it. This is hands down a perfect NES game. Anyone can play it and would want to finish it and you didn't have to be hardcore or casual to see why: two big quests, lots of action, items to be found and bought, enemies and boss monsters to encounter and of course, Princess Zelda waited to be rescued after you defeated Ganon.Nowadays, you could find a used copy if you look hard enough(good luck if you want the gold cartridge that was originally released as I saw the gray copies floating around instead.)So if you loved playing NES games in the '80s and early '90s, then The Legend of Zelda was at the top of your list.

The reason is the ridiculous amount of downtime.If you're expecting another great adventure with the Link from Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, look elsewhere. This new adventure takes place with a &quot;new&quot; Zelda and Link, who (in my opinion) aren't half as likeable as the old ones.Also prepare to be disappointed if you're expecting the beautiful, fully rendered environments of the other games. Here's the deal: The world is a sea with a bunch of tiny islands, and you use a boat to travel between them. An okay idea, but you'll spend more time sailing (which consists of moving over bland, repetitive seas) than playing on the islands, with the exception of a few large islands with lots of activity.The story is seriously underdeveloped. There aren't any twists, turns or surprises. You just move from island to island, over and over.Other bad things: The treasured ocarina has been replaced with a funny baton thing; the end boss battle is a complete joke; and there are only five small dungeons. There are good things, though. The sidequests are great. There are some beautiful environments; the dungeons, although short, are the best part of the game. That's the main reason I'm giving this game three stars instead of two; if your expectations are for a good game, not something that can stand next to Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, then you will get a good time out of this. Which is why they should drop the Legend of Zelda name and just let this game stand alone.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2004"}

I had a coupon for the game and got it for $10. After seeing the reviews and considering the low price I was expecting a nightmare experience. Well it didnt work out that way. Perhaps the PS3 version got patched quicker than the PC version but I find no problems with this game so far and in fact im having a lot of fun with it.One of the reasons I play single player games on console is because I dont have the patients to roll back drivers and figure out work arounds etc. so maybe my reasoning paid off once again, I dont know. And no, im not a paid reviewer, if I were I would give it a 5 and tell you its the best RPG ever, which its not. But it is a good solid game. So as said, if you are considering the PS3 version dont let the bad reviews scare you off. I would add im talking about the single player game.

{"product_name":"B003Q53VZC","description":"","reviewerName":"A Gamer at Heart","summary":"A Major disappointment and rehash of every game that came before it . . .","reviewText":"I had eagerly followed this game for months before its release.  I read all the developer interviews where they stressed the \"battle repetitiveness\" that makes so many shooters boring games of whack-a-mole where you mow down endless waves of enemies with no pacing, atmosphere, or story.  I read how they really admired the story and pacing of Half-Life 2 and how they were influenced by that fantastic, unmatchable game. I even preordered it.  So, what did I end up with? The \"battle repetitiveness\" of a shooter where you mow down endless waves of enemies with no pacing, atmosphere, or story.  I ended up with the same game I have played over and over again in the past but with different game titles.  And while I realize that graphics alone don't make a great game, I at least want one that is pretty. The graphics in this game look like they were developed on an early version of a PS2.  They are that bad.It's a shame, the story idea was great - but 10 minutes into the game I realized the gameplay in the campaign is a poor carbon copy of every shooter that has come before it. Nothing fresh, nothing new, nothing innovative.  In a word, the gameplay is stale.  Unless you have never played a shooter before, you will get bored quickly with the campaign.  Mindless AI, glitchy companions, and a superweapon that you get to deploy that automatically kills all enemies in sight.  I didn't try multiplayer - I was too disheartened by the campaign, and figured not using my MP redemption code would help my resale value.  What's that you say?  Multiplayer redemption code?  That's right - you must redeem the in-box code to play on-line, this developer's sneaky way of jamming the used game market.  Nice - sell me a crappy game and then make whoever else buys it purchase a new code to play on line.  That fact that this tired pile of digital waste has managed to sell over a million copies tells you how desperate FPS fans are for a breath of fresh air and innovation.  Those one million sold copies are not a success story, but more like one million let-down fans.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2011"}

The multiplayer has been mostly fixed.  It's like COD and Battlefield had a baby.....A baby with dedicated servers. That is the sole reason that I bought the game despite all the negative feedback about this game.  I am glad that I did by it as it is actually pretty good.The single player campaign was good although short.  I don't understand the complaining about the graphics.  They are on par with Black Ops.  They aren't great but, they aren't in Black Ops either.  The sound is actually good IMHO.  The game plays like a COD game that doesn't lag like crazy in multiplayer.  The game has vehicles like Battlefield but, I don't feel like I'm driving a tank when I'm running around on foot.  The multiplayer is a lot of fun.  The action is good.DEDICATED servers is a huge thing for me as I cannot stand being killed because of lag. In Black Ops, I watch every replay and over half the time, the replay isn't what I saw.  I also cannot stand knowing that I'm killing people for the same reason (I have well above a 1:1 K/D ratio without camping).  I have a 16 Mbps connection.  My xbox is wired to my router.  Why do I lag so in Black Ops? It's almost like roulette with the lag problems.  I think the slower the connection speed, the less lag one will have.  That isn't so much a problem in this game.  I've seen it some but, not nearly as much as with COD games.PROS: DEDICATED servers, way less camping in MP, vehicles,  encourages teamwork, huge maps, smooth 'COD-like' action.CONS: short campaign; barebones selection of gametypes, maps, and guns; cannot shoot through fences (dumb).OVERALL:  I like the game.  It would've been much better with a bigger budget.  It is a good alternative to the camp/lag fest that is Black Ops.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2011"}

Story mode is really fun, more challenging than your simple run and gun games.  It has some interesting features such as the gadgets you use and I LOVE the run and fire from cover feature (this is something I would like to see in more FPS games)  The online is actually really cool.  Team death match has no overpowered kill streaks, its straight up skill.  You have to buy weapons and attachments like on COD Black Ops, so you actually earn what you get rather than just leveling up.  It also has some neat modes that are unique to the game.  There was just something about the online that really attracted me.  Sure the graphics aren't  5 star, the guns are hard to identify because of the use of false names to avoid copyright problems, and in multi player the characters look like they run around with a stick up their a**, but trust me, it is a fun game all around.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2010"}

Yes, it's not perfect, but no system is. Between the amazing Gamepad, updated graphics, and the novel game mechanics made possible by the screen on the Gamepad, I have been having a blast ever since I got this system.The initial download/update did take a few hours with my DSL internet (the cheapest DSL available by the way).  Once I got past this initial hurdle, the fun took off with no end in sight!  I love the controller, graphics, games, etc.  Any Nintendo fan should get this console.  The Gamepad is more revolutionary than the Wii Remote in many ways.  The opportunity for asymmetrical gameplay in local multiplayer is a huge advantage that Nintendoland, ZombiU, and New Super Mario Bros. U take full advantage of.

As a teenage girl named Heather, players must explore and unravel the mysterious connection between the god-forsaken town and her inner fears. The game features enhanced graphical detail, a more complex storyline, and even more grotesque monsters than the previous games.","reviewerName":"Keith Doyle","summary":"Great Value In Terror","reviewText":"The Silent Hill series has always stood toe-to-toe with the Resident Evil series.  Both do a good job of entertaining players with realistic environments, monstrous adversaries and compelling storylines.  But Silent Hill takes the creepiness factor to a much higher level.  Unless you're an incredibly desensitized individual Silent Hill 3 will certainly freak you out.SH3's storyline has strong ties to the first game; a fact which should thrill fans of the series.  The plot starts out a little sparse but fleshes out toward the end.  Compared to Silent Hill 2's story SH3's is easily understood.  But remember, this is the world of Silent Hill...expect to devote some brain power to comprehend everything.Sound effects and ambiance are where the Silent Hill series shine and this installment is the best yet.  The audio does exactly what it needs to do with eerie effectiveness.  You'll hear things in the distance, unearthly noises will appear unexpectedly, and the sound of inhuman creatures (whether they're killing or being killed) is...gruesome.The only thing I would have preferred, and this might sound strange, is more horror.  With all the sights and sounds encountered throughout SH3 there are precious few occurrences where something actually appears to justify the tension!  I think the developers missed a lot of opportunities to maximize the game's potential and really frighten the wits out of players.  The first two Silent Hills had the same problem so I doubt Konami will improve this factor in future installments.  Oh well, I suppose perfection is too much to ask for.There are many reasons to play through Silent Hill 3 multiple times, such as unlocking more selectable options, equipping alternate outfits for the main character Heather, using fantastic new weapons, and viewing different endings.The game's entire soundtrack is included on a nifty bonus CD totally free!  Some of the music on the disk is really good, adding value to an already worthwhile package.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2003"}
{"product_name":"B000JLIYLC","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"A good racing game, but could have been so much more","reviewText":"Motorstorm is an arcade style racing game that showcases the power of the PS3.  Great graphics, stunning crash sequences, and intense action show just what the console is capable of, and this would be an incredible game were it not for a few significant limitations.THE GOOD STUFF:- Graphics. The graphics in this game are absolutely stunning--very impressive.  The animation is well done, the crashes are spectacular, and the courses are highly detailed and look great (especially the mud on many of the tracks).- Several vehicle types.  Race as a motorcycle, a truck, a big rig, and many vehicle types in between, each with their own way of handling a track and even certain parts of the course they handle better or worse (most courses have a low, muddy route ideal for the rigs, and also a middle and high route for the other vehicles).- Several options to take out the competition, ranging from smashing into them with the bigger vehicles to attacking them from a motorcycle.  This adds an element of depth to the races that goes beyond the typical 'smash' type racing games where all you do is run into each other.- Race online against up to 11 other peopleTHE BAD STUFF:-Very few tracks.  Motorstorm features few tracks, and as you progress through the game you'll find yourself racing the same track over and over.-Insane loading times.  Yes the graphics are great, but the loading times for this game are brutal.  In fact the first time I raced the first race I thought the game had frozen because it took such a spectacularly long time to load.  Not just before races either--expect loading times while choosing a vehicle, choosing your race...just about everything.-No offline multiplayer.  This was the dealbreaker for me.  I've come to expect a head to head mode in games like this, and not having one means I can't play this game with friends unless it's over the internet.  Quite a disappointment in my book.-No customization.  The vehicles (even though there are many of them) stay the same.-lackluster progression.  Win a race, unlock a new one, repeat.  Yawn.  Some bonus objectives, other unlockables--something beyond the same old linear game progression would have been nice.-Control is nothing special.  While I of course expect the larger vehicles to be more difficult to handle I found some of the vehicle classes, especially the rigs and trucks, to be more stiff handling than I'm used to.  It's tough to describe or quantify, really, but I found  racing the smaller vehicles very exciting while racing the larger ones somewhat unexciting.Motorstorm is a pretty good game, but a feeling of unrealized potential permeates throughout.  A couple features, like a head to head mode and maybe some kind of bonus objectives (collecting some item, smashing things, jumps, etc) while racing the same old courses over and over and over again, would have made this a great game.  Instead it's a good game, worth trying before you buy.  In fact, once the initial excitement of being overwhelmed by the spectacular graphics and great crash sequences subsides this game becomes rather mediocre in a hurry, which is a shame considering the concept and design are so good.  That said, if I hear of a sequel I won't hesitate in the least to check it out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2007"}

Even though it is rated M, it is the most violent and fun games you will ever play. This game gives you the most freedom to do anything that you dream of. Kill people, buy weapons, have sex with hookers off the street, steal awesome cars, and kill the police (sorry to any cops reading this!). All of this is possible with Grand Theft Auto 3. This game is so awesome! They curse a lot in this game, so this isn't appropriate for younger gamers. You can listen to the radio in the game, listen to about 10 stations, jack any car you see on the street, even police cars and fire trucks!In this game, you work for the Mafia, and you go around doing missions for money. You can do anything you want. You can drive around Liberty City (modeled after New York City, but was changed after 9/11) doing whatever you please. You can go to different islands doing more things. If you get bored of it, you can do side missions like Vigilante Mode with police cars, taxi jobs with taxi cabs.This game is so much fun, you will not want to pass this up. This game is also available for the unfortunate people without a Playstation2 on the PC. THis game was rated a 9.6 by Gamespot.com, and I rented this, and I was hooked. You are going to want this!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2002"}

{"product_name":"B002I0GX88","description":"","reviewerName":"N E 1 4 Hotdish?","summary":"Infamous 1.5","reviewText":"Infamous was one of my most cherished games for the PS3, therefore I could not wait to continue the adventure with its sequel.  While not an absolute letdown, the game feels like an expansion of the first.  There's a new city, advanced powers, and more blast shards to find.  All enjoyable for a while.  But after several hours, I started to feel as if I was playing the original all over again, with just a slightly altered story that I cared little about.The greatest thing I've found so far is the user generated content.  The game allows anyone to create their own side missions, which are then thrown into everyone's maps via PSN.  You have the choice of whether to play them or not, and can then rate them according to quality.  You can also try your hand at creating your own mission, which is also quite entertaining.  It almost seems like this \"create-a-mission\" feature was forced into the game near completion just to set it apart from the original.Overall I'm just not as impressed with this as I was the first time around.  It honestly feels like an update to Infamous 1, with some updated powers, different enemies, and a new city.  Of course these features were enough to convince me to purchase the game in the first place, but now that I have it, I'm not sure if they're enough to keep me playing.This is every bit as fun as the first installment, but don't expect anything revolutionary.Here's an excerpt from a mission I played this evening:  Cole approaches man in sunglasses.  Man says \"There's a swamp monster hiding out somewhere around here.  You should follow it back to its base and destroy it... that is... if you're man enough\".  While not as repetitive as the first, you will find yourself doing the same things over and over to close enemy-controlled territory.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2011"}

I had never played the other two Fallout games in the series, so this was my first chance to experience this game.The graphics in Fallout 3 are very good. I'd say, combine it to Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, it's around the same in my opinion. But the developers do an amazing job of matching how it would look in post-apocalyptic times. A lot of ruins, dirt, rocks, and damaged cars and buildings etc.The sound in the game is also great. You have some background music that isn't to loud so you can still hear whats going on, but it fits the scene. You also have a cool feature on the device you are given, which allows you listen to radio stations in the area. You can listen to the radio stations 100% of the time while playing, which keeps you from getting to annoyed by silence.The controls in Fallout 3 are very easy to learn. Again, compare them to Oblivion. The controlling of your character, and equipping items etc, are very easy, press \"B\" and do what you need, then exit etc. Simple.Overall, Fallout 3 is a HUGE, VAST game. I was literally shocked at how huge the map was and how much there was to explore. It could easily take you a whole day just to explore everything on the map and finding areas you haven't found yet. One cool thing about this game, is that you level up (the max level is 20) and there are certain areas of the map that have higher level characters. So lets say your a level 1-5, you don't want to go to certain areas that have harder enemies with bigger guns because they hit really hard. Another thing I enjoyed, was the amount of quests. The main story line is a pretty decent length, but if you try to also complete all the side quests, you got a good amount of hours of gameplay to complete! Just like in Oblivion, you can fast travel between locations once you have discovered it. There is also a new form of killing enemies called \"VATS\". Basically what it is, is when you hit the right bumper, the screen pauses, and you can choose what body part of the enemy you want to shoot at. And you have \"AP\", which only allows you to use the ability a couple times before it becomes depleted and needs to recharge up again. It is a very cool method of killing enemies, and if you aim for the head, you can do some really nice damage.Some people have complained about how there is never any ammo, and its impossible to find, or its to expensive to buy from stores/sellers etc. True and not true. The only tip I can give, is to conserve ammo. I didn't have to buy ammo once on my whole play through. Always loot enemies you kill for they're ammo! The developers did a good job of making ammo somewhat scarce because it made it more realistic! Some people have also complained that the game has way to much dialogue and not enough shooting or whatever. This game DOES have a lot of dialogue, but whats wrong with that? It fleshes out the story a lot more in my opinion. If you are a fan of games like Elder Scrolls series, Mass Effect, Indigo Prophecy, Shenmue and games alike, you'll definitely like Fallout 3.To end it, the game has a really cool ending. Overall, Fallout 3 is an amazing game that deserves to be played and recognized as a great game. I was shocked at how thick and deep with development this game was. Check it out!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2009"}

Journey as the prince in an expansive quest uncovering the mysteries surrounding the Sun Rune, the civil unrest and the dark intent of an unknown power in the greatest Suikoden saga yet!","reviewerName":"Marc Ruby&#8482; \"The Noh Hare&#8482;\"","summary":"Castle Building For Fun And Profit","reviewText":"I'm not quite sure what I expected when I started Suikoden 5.  My first meeting with this series was Suikoden 3, which I enjoyed greatly.  Konami had made a definite effort to compete with the Final Fantasy series, and while they are different style games, the result for Konami was a genuinely compelling fantasy odyssey.  I was less thrilled with Suikoden 4, which was a step backward in technology with very flat characters and a plot that lacked the vastness of Suikoden 3.So here comes Suikoden 5 which, strangely enough, has been simplified to the point of almost being a throwback to a PSOne game, lacking event the graphic finesse of its predecessor, but which is every bit as interesting a game as Suikoden 3.  Once you get past the lack of fine detail, you can't help but notice that the artistic design itself is excellent.  The plot is intricate, and the fight system is solid without being overwhelming.  And it's a very big world with plenty to look at and interact with.If you haven't played a Suikoden game before, the underlying structure is political, and a good part of the game involves international and interpersonal relationships.  One of the keys to the games are the 108 stars - characters that must be found, recruited, and used during the fights and battles to come.  They must be trained, armed, and occasionally coddled in order to complete the game successfully.  You not only get to deal with the traditional hack and slash of traditional combat, you have to cope with a real time battle system.  When you're not doing that you can go on trading expeditions to make money.  And you will always need to make money.This otherwise successful game has two flaws from my point of view.  I found the tactical warfare system difficult to work with.  I seemed to be getting the job done, but I was never sure what it was that I was doing right.  Another irritant is the number of random fights encountered in fields and dungeons.  When you are in the middle of trying to figure out a puzzle or a maze, getting interrupted every three steps can get on your nerves.Over all, this was a game that far exceeded my initial impressions.  I contribute this to the complexity of many of the characters.  This kept up the flow of surprises that make a game interesting.  I'd play it again some day.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2006"}

These days, people are into more action-RPGs, turn-based affairs are pretty much a thing of the past. So, it isn't surprising that Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII plays more like an action-RPG. To me, it plays alot like Kingdom Hearts. If you're expecting it to be more epic like Final Fantasy VII, you'll be surprised to know it is more subdued and is more intimate as opposed to the original FF. It follows Zack and his interactions with three others: Angeal, Genesis and Sephiroth. Ultimately leading to Zack's...um, well, I don't want to spoil that for you. Just play the game.

If I hadn't skipped the dialogue so often, My time would have easily been 5-6 hours instead of 3 and a half. There are not a lot of dialogue choices either.As for the changes in the game play - Light melee attacks come off as playful taps while heavy melee attacks seem easily avoidable and yet an enemy will just stand there. The fact that they stripped the gun play down so much is disappointing. Instead of dealing with a gun that simply overheats, You have to constantly reload and find ammo, I am very annoyed they changed it when it was perfectly fine originally.The new characters in the game are not that likable, Then again neither are the reoccurring ones due to poorly written dialogue. The story is painfully unsatisfying as well.Overall, Mass Effect 3 simply changes too much and not in a good way, Thus making it one of the most disappointing games I have ever played.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2014"}

AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends.

Ninja Gaiden Sigma and Sigma II were great (although overly difficult and frustrating at times).  This game has its moments where I think I like it, but then it gets annoying.  There are times when you find yourself fighting what seems like a infinite amount of enemies - they seem to just keep respawning until you are simply bored of fighting them.  In addition to the large number of enemies, some of the types of enemies are also annoying.  Enemies that disappear and reappear, using shields you must break in order to inflict damage, for example.  They are not overly difficult to defeat, rather aggravating to fight.  Aside from that, the game isn't bad.  The difficulty level has absolutely decreased from Sigma and Sigma II, which may turn some people off.  Not me, I enjoy a challenge, but I don't like to get so annoyed at the difficulty of a game that I want to throw the controller through the TV.  The graphics are decent, the controls are fine, the sound is ok (I turn the music down, though, the techno crap is irritating).  Overall, I would say that this is just a decent game.  Not terrible, but not great.  A decent pick up at around a $20.00 price point in my opinion.PROS- Not as demanding as previous Ninja Gaiden games- Nice graphics- Good controls- Pretty fun hack and slashCONS- Annoying enemy design- Enemies are too plentiful at any one time- Voice acting not that great (none of it in the series is)- The story is convoluted...what am I supposed to be doing again??3/5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2013"}

If you're one of the teeming fans who eagerly playedCrazy  Taxiin the arcade at a buck a pop, then this game is a must-buy, if only from a purely economic  standpoint. Even those who don't know the difference betweenCrazy Taxiand the long-running  TV seriesTaxiwill immediately recognize the appeal of this game. In fact, this game is so  impressive and addictive that it should easily convince a whole new wave of buyers to purchase a Sega  Dreamcast.What's so hot aboutCrazy Taxi? For starters, the graphics sport the most impressive re-creation of  a living city ever seen in a video game. The level of detail is astounding and never ceases to surprise the  player as block after unique block speeds by. The city is a distilled version of San Francisco with some  landmarks and neighborhoods left intact. Making it seem all the more real are apparent product placements  of real-world retail locations such as KFC, Tower Records, and Pizza Hut. And just about everything you  see on the screen is interactive: boxes, phone booths, and mailboxes topple when bumped or smashed,  pedestrians leap and tumble out of your path, and the myriad of traffic attempts to avoid your erratic  high-speed antics. While some driving games brag about a lack of boundaries, this one delivers--players  drive on the ocean floor, off the second floor of a parking garage, through parks, and down stairs. A helpful  hovering arrow points drivers in the correct direction, but you can truly drive wherever you want at any  time, making for tons of replay value.While the game is a direct port from the arcade game of the same name, there's plenty more depth in the  home version. In addition to the city that appears in the coin-op version, the Dreamcast version also  includes an entirely new city.Crazy Taxiincludes a trunk-load of mini-games that help to teach  drivers how to perform the special speed boosts and maneuvers in the game.Though this game would be plenty exciting without any sounds at all, it has an adrenaline-pumping  soundtrack supplied by punk crossover bands the Offspring and Bad Religion, as well as some good, if  sometimes monotonous, dialogue between the driver and the passengers.--Jeff YoungPros:Wonderful, realistic graphicsEasy to get into, and full of many long hours of addictive playEven more to offer than the fantastic arcade game upon which this is basedCons:On very few occasions players will encounter some graphic slowdown","reviewerName":"Wu-Tang_Assassin","summary":"Crazy Taxi","reviewText":"This game was good back in the day when I was younger.

You now get small gains for smaller actions (breaking a pick, simply standing in a corner sneaking) and individual actions can improve multiple skills (sneaking and archery, or one handed)To be honest, I didn't realize I wasn't playing the main story when I was running around, slaying dragons and all sorts of things. The dungeons are all different, and I don't get turned around as often as I did in oblivion. Great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2012"}

So this review is from a point of view of someone very familiar with Bioware's previous products.Pros:- Visually the most impressive of Bioware's products. KOTOR was groundbreaking visually and ME kicks it up a notch.- Turn-based combat is replaced with real-time.- Impressive amount of dialog and side quests.- Character design is a significant improvement.Cons:- Combat mechanic is not fully satisfying. Use of biotic powers isn't as satisfying an experience as say Force powers in a Star Wars game.- The Tower's of Hanoi puzzle was in KOTOR and it is again in this game. Please Bioware, stop putting this puzzle in your games. It's terribly boring as a puzzle, especially for computer scientists. Shows real lack of imagination.- Apart from the visuals and the new attempt at a combat scheme, there really isn't much new from KOTOR and Jade Empire.- KOTOR gave you multiple solutions to a problem. E.g. in KOTOR you can either bully your way through everything or solve puzzles. ME seems more limited.- The planetary side quests are not terribly rewarding. The environments are small and after a while you avoid all but the main quests.- Equipment management becomes unwieldy as the amount of upgrades increases. Becomes royal pain to discard your upgrades when you have accumulated a lot of them.- Cannot control individual characters, only your own. So you don't get a sense that your other team members have any real impact. Ie squad-based interactions are very weak. In general you just let them do their default actions.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2008"}

Well, I don't consider running for hours scary. Once in a while there is some kind of monster thing that wonders around. Best thing to do is run right past them or ignore them if you can. Not scary. The scariest part of the game is when the characters interact with each other. Great graphics and great voice acting make them very creepy. The graphics are great but there is a serious problem with the overuse of fog. I know the creators were going for a certain look but it makes the game incredibly difficult to play when you can't see two feet in front of you. Another problem is the camera. It always seems to be in the worst possible place. You have to keep moving it and even then you can't get it right. Aside from the games problems, and the fact that it's not scary, the game is enjoyable to play as a puzzle game and it's worth the rental just to see the cool graphics. The game would be a lot better without the fog. Here's what I give it out of a perfect 5.0Graphics: 4.0 (bad fog)Sound: 5.0 (great sound)Control: 3.5 (bad camera)Fun Factor: 4.0 (fun game)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2002"}

Here are our feelings after two years of playing this unit pretty much daily.The sequel for the GameBoy Advance, the Nintendo DS features two screens of gameplay, and a folding clamshell design to protect those screens from harm.The top screen is a traditional, classic screen. The bottom screen is a PDA-style touch screen that works with a stylus (plastic pen). The D-pad is on the left of the lower screen, the directionals on the right. You get stereo sound, a microphone, and best of all, built in wireless connections!That means that you can play games with up to 15 other people in your area without any cables at all. Everyone on your bus could chat or challenge each other. Study hall and waiting in line becomes an adventure. There's a built in clock and calendar, and you can even choose your name and favorite color.There are now an amazing collection of games available for the DS. I love the Brain Age type games, where you can improve your memory and alertness with fun daily practice games. I also like the Animal Crossing and Zoo Tycoon style games where you care for animals and build up worlds. There are even great RPGs like Trace Memory that let you get involved in long term gameplay.The DS lets you play not only the new games (on a very thin card which you want to take some care in handling) but also the old style cartridges as well. So you can bring your entire game library from your previous systems over to this new game! That gives you easily hundreds of games, many being sold at bargain-basement prices, to play on your new system - with the nice new controls and back-lit screens.The wireless built in PictoChat is SUPER fun. We have two DSs in our household and every time people come over, we get them playing with PictoChat. You immediately launch into games of pictionary, guess-the-shape, silly notes, and much more. You practically don't need a game, if you have someone fun to talk to!We were initially concerned with the durability of the touch screen. They do sell plastic protectors for the screens which I *highly* recommend. If you wear out that touch screen with all the games, you'll be pretty upset as it stops responding quickly in games. With those screens in place, we haven't had any issues at all. We don't hammer the touch screens, but we aren't super gentle with them either. After two years, they still respond as quickly as when we first got them.We do own two PSPs as well. Yes, the graphics on the PSP are MUCH better.  I'm not saying this is bad, it's just something to recognize as a fact of life. It's *meant* to be a simpler game system. It's like comparing the Wii against the PlayStation 3. But just like with the Wii and PSP, it's an entirely different situation. Sure, the PSP gives movies and high quality graphics. However, the DS touch screen and microphone provide really fun gameplay even if the graphics are sometimes pixelly. Does Mario really need pores in his face to be fun? I think not!Rating: 5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2006"}

I grew up slamming the single red button on my Atari 2600 joystick and winning free ships in games that rewarded fast reflexes. This means I'm not too good at doing complex button combos (that means YOU, Heavenly Sword) and I don't have much patience for configuring a racecar with 500 separate components (sorry, Gran Turismo).Pure strikes a good balance between casual simplicity and hardcore complexity. People like me can get started and slam through a few races without much hassle, while gamers who want to tweak every little thing have the ability to do so. I like how it's possible to play without having to earn \"licenses\" or pass skill tests. All too often, driving games force players to go through a lengthy training period which, in my opinion, is a major drag.Additional thoughts:*Good graphics--tracks contain lots of details and areas to explore, all in stunning physical settings.*Online play isn't as fun for the casual player as the offline races because most people online have fully upgraded and tricked out ATV's.*If you have an HD TV, the game runs at 720p resolution (I'm ready for more 1080p games!).*Rumble and SixAxis motion sensing are supported by Pure.All in all, Pure is a decent game.

I never really got into Invisible War for all the same reasons that many other people disliked it, but I've been looking forward to Human Revolution for a while now and so far, it has definitely lived up to my expectations!Initially, the PC version of the game was plagued with a long loading time bug, but it's now fixed!  Just make sure you let Steam update the game to the latest version.WRITING/STORY:If you like gritty, cyber-punk, dystopic, sci-fi settings, you'll like Deus Ex HR.  The main plot feels like a proper science-fiction story that brings up classic sci-fi themes like what it means to be human, and the ethics behind engineering our bodies.During crucial conversations, the game will provide you with a few options for how to approach a conversation, similar to Mass Effect.  Depending on who you're talking to, you might have options such as Placate, Plead, Aggressive, Distant, Empathize, Sympathize, etc.  The dialogue is excellent and pretty nuanced to fit your choices.NPC dialogue is varied and relevant, and scattered across the game are newspapers and eBooks that you can read to learn more about the world around you.  It all helps to create a really cool and believable futuristic setting.GRAPHICS:I'm running the game on my i5 2500K, 8GB RAM, SSD RAID 0, Radeon 5770 system.  The graphics look amazing and the game runs pretty smooothly.  This dystopic future looks satisfyingly dark, gritty, and oppressed.SOUND:The world and your HUD are filled with little bleeps and bloops and the subtle mood music is really great.  As you go through levels, you'll often come across enemies having a conversation, revealing a bit of crucial information or dropping hints on how you might approach the area.  The audio effects like muffled voices and audio positioning are surprisingly convincing, even though I'm just using two speakers.GAMEPLAY:I always play a stealthy character and the game provides plenty of ways to reach objectives.  You can crawl through air ducts, hack turrets and robots, go in guns-a-blazin, snipe, lay traps, do non-lethal take-downs or just stack a bunch of crates until you reach what you want.The augmentation upgrade tree has skills for every type of gameplay.  My only gripe with this is that you get so many Praxis (Upgrade) points that you don't really need to worry about focusing on specific skills.The cities aren't huge, but they're big enough to get lost in.  My biggest complaint about the game is that the cities don't feel like cities.  Streets, back alleys, and crawl spaces all blend together into an indistinct maze of passage ways, and I never actually get a sense that I'm outside.  Instead, when you're outside on the streets, you feel more like you're in a giant warehouse with obstacles everywhere.  I guess the best way to describe it is that the streets feel more like a tightly constructed video game level than an open city like in a sandbox game.The game rewards you for using stealth by giving you extra experience bonuses for quiet, non-lethal takedowns.  Sharpshooters and hackers also get plenty of bonuses.  Basically, if you play this game with any sort of finesse, you'll be rewarded.Boss battles can be a little annoying if you're playing a stealthy character.  You don't really have any choice except to shoot, run, and throw grenades (hint hint).  I was actually surprised when I started my first boss battle, because it felt like such an outdated video game concept in a game that otherwise feels so modern and smart.  The boss battle areas usually have heavy weapons strewn around so stealthy players won't be left completely outgunned.One final thing that I should note is that this game has zero almost replay value for me, but I tend not to replay most RPGs, so it's not a big deal for me.  However, people who like to do multiple play-throughs should know that there really isn't much variation at all.  The game is very story driven, which means that you get a fairly linear story line.  Your decisions may change the options that are available later in the game, but nothing that really alters how the events play out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2011"}

I have played this game for a couple of days now and have come to really appreciate this game for what it is. It is a game that opens up so many possibilities of gameplay it is crazy. Follow the scripted storyline and you will have countless hours of gameplay alone, not to mention just taking the time to see what the cities have to offer. Having said that, this is a long game and it will take a long time to complete it. If you are the type of person who likes to have a game where you are maxed out on abilities within the first few hours, this game is not for you. If you have the patience to put into this game, you will find that the wait is what makes the game.Now, parents, please understand this. This is definitely not for kids. I am a parent, and I would play this in front of my daughter, but I would not carry along the gameline. I would show her how you can drive the different vehicles (she is young) and just to see the different places in the game. The vocal and visual are extremely graphic when you follow along the story line and even when just driving around you will be shot at often. People buy these types of games for their kids without taking the time to read ahead and learn what the game is, and then they end up returning the game to the store and complaining about it when you DIDN'T TAKE THE TIME YOURSELF TO READ IT.This is not a game for rental because it will simply take longer than you may be willing to pay for the rental fees. Buy this game if you enjoyed Vice City, you will love this game for the freedom and the abilities this game will afford you. Now, I am still in the early stages of the game, but so far it has been a extremely great game.Again parents, learn about this game before you buy it for your child. Educate yourselves on the games rating system that is in place to protect our kids. I would never in a million years let my daugther play this game. There are people out there who would love to prevent this type of game from ever reaching our hands, fearing that for some ungodly reason we as mature and reasonable adults can't determine for ourselves what is right and what is wrong. Again, that is mature and reasonable adults.Okay, enjoy this game for its originality, its length of gameplay and gametime, and the freedom it has that other games have tried to emulate, but have failed to capture the essence of the game. Also, this will probably be the last GTA game on the current generation of consoles, until PS3 hits the shelves.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00GV4V8XC","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles H.","summary":"I can't believe it's not Final Fantasy!","reviewText":"Bravely Default is a turn-based RPG about four Warriors of Light doing something with crystals to save the world, but half the calories of your average Final Fantasy game. ... I just wanted to say that. Sorry. :P Even so, if you like old school Final Fantasy, you really need to play this game.There are two really good features in this game. Firstly, there's the game's eponymous battle system. As opposed to picking a single series of attacks like you would in old school Final Fantasy, can pick up to four attacks on a given turn. However, picking more attacks than you have leaves you vulnerable for as many turns. Suppose you're fighting your standard field monster. In that situation, you'd probably want to 'Brave' and launch four repeated attacks to kill it quickly. However, if you're fighting a boss, you may want to be more judicious with how you use your turns.Second, there's Job system. It's a lot like Final Fantasy Tactics, if you've played that game. What I mean by that is that there are a variety of different jobs that you can give to any character you want to. It's different from FFT in that you gain access to new jobs by performing optional subquests. Once your character is in a new job, you get Job Points from winning battles. The Job Points go toward increasing your Job Level, which gives you access to more attacks and abilities. Your characters can also have a \"Second Job,\" which basically gives them a second set of special attacks. There are many different jobs, most of which are staples of the Final Fantasy series such as Knight, Black Mage, White Mage, Summoner, Time Mage, etc. There are also a couple which are unique to this game (as far as I know).As far as the story goes, it basically what I said in the first sentence of this review. The four Crystals which appear to maintain the balance of nature in the world of Luxendarc have gone out of balance. You and your party need to go around fighting monsters to get them back into the balance. There's a bit more to it than that, but I won't spoil the plot for you. It's worth mentioning that there is a HUGE amount of detail about the world of Luxendarc in this game. It's far more than I ever expected to see in a handheld game. One of the characters keeps a journal about the events that are going on in the game people the meet, and it'll tell you more than you ever wanted to know about the world of Luxendarc. Also, the events that culminated in the plot of the game and the characters involved with it become more and more fleshed out by doing the optional subquests. Story and lore-wise, Bravely Default is very impressive.I should warn you that, if you want to do all of the subquests and get the true ending, the game can be very long. You'll be performing some of the same tasks over and over again. You might think of this as shameless filler and a bore. I thought of it as an exciting opportunity to level up some more! I had a great time experimenting with the many different Jobs and abilities in this game, and the fact that I had to fight some of these enemies repeatedly gave me a chance to master a wide variety of Jobs and get new abilities for my characters. It's understandable that some people would dislike the second half, but if you enjoy the underlying RPG mechanics, it probably won't bother you too too much. Also, some of the best parts of the game come in the second half's subquests. Those battles are as intense any Final Fantasy fight I've ever seen, and the game expects your party to be completely trained and ready for anything. The enemies will rain down 9999 damage on your two or three times in a row if you're unprepared. (This is not to say that I didn't think, \"Geez... again!?\" several times in this part of the game.)Some of the music in is this game simply fantastic. My favorite track by plays when you visit a certain snowy village. However, everything's really good. You may well hear the boss theme two hundred times throughout the course of the game, but it doesn't lose much of its catchy-ness at game's end.If I had to find fault with the game, it's simply in the way that the characters will repeat themselves when they encounter the same situation twelve times in a row. They do sometimes say different things, but not as often as they should. After you hear the same lines said so many times, you might yourself thinking, \"Thanks Agnes, but your Crystal is in another castle!\"Even though I think very highly of it (I did just rate it five stars!), I would only recommend Bravely Default to people who like turn based RPGs. The second half the game is redeemed largely by its 'grinding' elements. If you're uncertain as to whether you like these sorts of games, Final Fantasy IV for SNES or maybe VII, VIII, or IX for PSX would be fine places to start.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2014"}

Once upon a time, I had actually had an X-Box 360, but I'm sorry to say, I had way too many issues with mine, so eventually I traded up for a Ps3, and I have since recollected some of the shared games that I most loved for collection, UT3 being one of them.I was never real huge into the story mode to be honest, though I did play a lot of it...I felt that it wasn't evenly mixed between all modes of gameplay and they focused primarily only on one or two game modes once you got into it.  I'm personally a big deathmatch fan, and while I like capture the flag and thought the other new modes were cool too...once you get into it a little ways they seem to primarily stick to a couple of the newer game modes and don't mix in much good old fashion deathmatch & whatnot.However, the game was still fun...and more than anything I actually loved just setting up straight up deathmatch against bots and even against friends and having it out, and a lot of times my buddies and I would even just team up against a bunch of bots.  Ah...good times!  If you're into shooters and you want a good one to just run around and have some fun with, this is a quality title to check out, if you haven't already played it before.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2011"}

I did have some problems finding out what to do in some areas and went to ign's website to get the \"cheats\". They have the answers to what you need to play the game (also in video form too). While at this site, some people complained that they had some problems when using the \"Hats\" on level 6. I just use the stud multipliers and kit finders to help with my game which is working well. It should take you some time to finish this game unless you use all of the cheats to complete it. I only use the cheats when I get stuck in a area.

Designed from the pedals up for PLAYSTATION 3 and Gran Turismo, this racing wheel lets you feel every bump in the road, crash and tire spin with jaw-dropping realism. With true-to-life race car steering, shifting, braking and acceleration, your game gets so real you may want to buckle up.","reviewerName":"Sylo \"Sylo\"","summary":"Now this is what I call pod racing!","reviewText":"After putting my hands on this sweet peripheral I cannot imagine ever playing another racing game with a boring old controller ever again. It looks and feels as close to the real thing as you can get. Pop in Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, set it on the in-car point of view, and you'll swear your really behind the wheel of a sweet ride racing down the Daytona speedway rushing into first place. The feedback is unbelievable. The wheel will turn if you crash and has the range of a real wheel. The vast array of button choices make playing the game your way easier than ever. Don't want to use the knob to change gears? Their are hidden buttons behind the wheel if you wish to use them. Theirs a PS3 controller built in so you won't have to fumble back and forth between a regular controller and the wheel. Its worth every penny and you'll feel the quality that only Logitech can provide. Racing doesn't get any better than this.The break and gas pedals are sturdy and well made. The grips underneath the break pad are strong so it won't be sliding out from underneath your feet at all. The response is 1 to 1 with the in-game action. Its built to play Gran Turismo perfectly but also works with other racing games as well. The wheel is sturdy and has a great rubbery grip to help keep your hands on the wheel. The built-in rumble will jitter when your on rocks or sand and give you a smooth hum when your on smooth concrete. A crash will give you a good jolt or you'll feel the slight bumb of a nearby car trying to push you out of the way.The wheel also come with a nice grip to attach it firmly to a table. Logitech has outdone themselves in creating the definitive driving wheel for all games on the Playstation 3. Your simply not playing the game right if you aren't using this wheel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2008"}

I wonder how nintendo/mario manages to charm me every time. The game plays great and I feel like a kid again because the game is so much fun.The level design is great and the world map is just like super mario world. The baby yoshi's and few new power ups give the player different ways to play through the game. You can do local multi-player which is a little awkward but still fun or go totally solo.The game looks great and is the first Mario in HD. One complaint I must agree with some other reviewers is that it could have been a bit more difficult. I mean it's not very easy but only a few levels really challenge you. The good thing is that the game has replay value with things like collecting all star coins and challenge/boost modes.All and all I had a blast with this game and I am still playing it to collect all the star coins.

{"product_name":"B000038IFX","reviewerName":"w r e c k l e s s","summary":"A superb classic RPG","reviewText":"\"Xenogears\" (1998) is a fantastic old-school RPG about a young guy (Fei Wong Fong) who's unintentionally trust into the middle of a conflict he may already be a part of. If that sounds opaque, that's because it is. The story is very deep and complex, and requires quite a bit of reading and perseverance. This is one of the more text-heavy RPGs I've played, but that shouldn't deter you. Combat is turn-based, has random encounters, and is split between hand-to-hand martial arts and mech (or \"Gear\") battles. Visually, the game is gorgeous. The character models in particular have a certain anime look to them that adds a lot of charm. The environments are 3D and you can rotate the camera 360 degrees to better view your surroundings. It's said that the second disc is almost all text due to budget or time constraints. While that may be true, it doesn't lessen the 60+ hours of the first disc. RPGs of this ilk have a habit of standing the test of time better than most because a good story told well is always worth experiencing, and because the nature of turn-based combat means it doesn't depend on the latest tech to remain successful. \"Xenogears\" is now a somewhat old game that's only getting older, but it doesn't feel it, and deserves to be sought out by all RPG fans.--- 5 STARS ---","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2013"}

Mention of it sends fans and critics in an all out fit.  It's a game that is on everyone's favorite list.  It solely defined the 32 bit era along with the Playstation 1 console, and after one direct squeal and one prequel later we the finally get the last installment of the \"Soild\" games.Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is a fantastic game it is the game of the summer and one of the must own games of the year.  It's easily in contention for game of the year even with the rest of the year to come.MGS4 follows Solid Snake, now old and awaiting death, as he terminates his long running foe Ocelot who is now under the influence of Liquid after graphing his arm on to his own body.The story is much deeper then this and involves all counts of shocking revelations to plot twist after plot twist.  But if you a first time player of the MGS universe you will not be missing anything as everything is explained to you.  The story is what makes this game because sadly, more the running time relies on watching the story unfold in front of you.  At lest they cut down on the Codec message with static pictures of people talking with text and more of it happens in real time now.The game play of the MGS has progressed but not by much.  With newer technology come different gadgets, but for the most part the game plays just the same as any others.  You could not know a thing about swapping items, the OctoCamo, or buying weapons and still get through the game just fine.  It's better off if you knew a thing or two about these new features but for the most part their simple improvements of existing features.  For example, Drebin, is a new person that sells weapons but in actuality he's just a menu.If there's one thing about MGS it's always been the graphics.  All the games in the series have pushed the boundaries of their respectful console, and MGS4 is no different.  Everything is textured nicely to the huge backdrops and detail of models on screen this game blows everything we've seen before it on a console.  Anyone looking to impress their friends with graphics look no further.MGS4 is a great game.  Even if it has a few hiccups in development decisions like the long cut-scene, it's a game that everyone must play and experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2008"}

I found out about it through a review on a gaming site and bought it the next day and played all night. It plays like a choose-your-own-adventure visual horror novel and is a Japanese import. There are multiple endings and some of them are complete opposites. It's 100% worth getting them all, and once you get one, you can skip scenes. They are also all recorded.DISCLAIMERS:*It is a MATURE game - there is blood, violence, twisted humor, and adult themes. That is why it's rated \"M\".*It is NOT a good game for people who don't like to read, or people with very short attention spans. If you hate reading or have the attention span of a 5 year old, you will rate this game a 1 or 2, and should probably stick to hours in front of your TV.*There are puzzles literally around every corner, and they are all different. They range from fitting pieces together, mixing colors, putting things together, and the dreaded pushing and sliding boxes into place. If you completely suck at math like me, you can always google solutions online.The game itself is part visual novel, part decision making, and part puzzle. The premise is very Saw meets Cube. Someone in a gas mask kidnaps you and you wake up in a locked room. Once you escape your room, you realize you are likely on a giant, multi-level cruise ship. You meet 8 others, and you abductor \"Zero\" announces the rules from...somewhere. Everyone has a numbered bracelet on, 1-9. The bracelets are needed to go through numbered locked doors. You cannot escape alone. A mistake in calculation will cause the bracelet to explode and kill you. And there are many deaths along the way. To get through room, you have to solve puzzles, and the doors cause you to have to split up.It is a lot of reading, but it's fascinating. If you hate to read, don't bother.Possibly the most interesting thing about this game, is that it uses paradoxes and real historical events that aren't common knowledge. Some of them are so bizarre, that you will google them, and be surprised to see they exist.The only caution I advise is to have a notebook ready to write down clues and decode clues. They get got exceedingly hard for me as the longest ending got closer, as I am below subpar with math. In the end, I was left hoping for a sequel.Replay value is high and it is easy to get caught up in the story like a great suspenseful book.I also recommend Lux Pain, Time Hollow, and both Touch Detective games...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2012"}

I won't lie though, the controller is a bit bigger that the controller for the Playstation 2, but this does not detract from it. The controller is easily accessible for people who have larger hands and thus the controller fits more comfortably in their hands. I find the controller particularly comfortable but I leave this to personal preference. I think that the two analog sticks are placed in convenient spots allowing the user to rest their left thumb on the upper left analog stick and is perfectly comfortable in my opinion, but again I leave that to personal opinion. The buttons come in handy as do the triggers, the controller may seem overwhelming at first but with a little time, it should feel as natural as can be. I wish I could fill you in more, but the buttons do come in handy and all do have a purpose and are not just thrown on there.

I'm not an avid gamer, maybe just a few hours a week.  Well my controller that was included with the console worked great for about 6 months...then randomly during game play all of a sudden the controller would act as though i'm rotating the analog stick....even though i wouldn't even be touching the controller!  I attempted to get a refund/exhange through Sony but they were no help as i hadn't purchased an extended warranty.  Okay fine, so about 3 weeks ago I bought a brand new controller from Best Buy.  And here I am now...after not even putting 15 hours of use in...the controller is DEAD!  A few days ago I noticed it would not charge.  And when the power finally drained, it just died.  No lights, nothing.  I've tried USB Ports in my computers to try re-charging. Nothing.  Opened it up to inspect the battery connection.  Nope.  And YES i hit the reset button on the back.  I'm very disappointed in the quality.  When I pay a steep price for a controller, i expect it to last for at least a year (even more since i don't even play too often).

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement.

Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch.

I have played games ranging from Ultima and the Bards Tale to Wasteland and Fallout and almost every genre in between. There are many more games coming out daily but with the glut of RPG's (from the US and Japan) it can be hard to find a diamond amongst the layers of coal. Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch developed by Level 5 studios (who have made excellent rpg's / games in the past including the Professor Layton series) is the latest offering which pairs this studio with the masters of Japanese animation.. Studio Ghibli.The first two hours of the game takes place is the real world in a small town somewhere in America called Motorville. You play as Oliver a thirteen year old boy who lives with his mother and after she saves his life in a tragic accident she perishes leaving him all alone. As he goes back home he starts to cry into a doll that his mother gave him and the doll comes to life. The doll introduces himself as Drippy and tells him of another world where there might be a way to resurrect his fallen mother. This starts to grand quest as Oliver is transported to a world of magic and monsters where he learns how to cast spells to defeat monsters as well as move his allies to help him in battle. The allies can act on their own or you can give them suggestions on how to act in battle (whether defensively or offensively)What literally left me stunned when I started playing this game was the visuals. There are many gorgeous games that are out there today but none have the moments that will take your breath away such as this game. Whether you are in the small town in the real world or in the fantasy world the game looks visually stunning and the animated sequences are of studio quality. The game is voiced over in english however, you can switch to japanese and view it with english subtitles (which will satisfy the purists out there).This game is PS3 exclusive and I think for the lovers of JRPG's and even RPG's in general this might be a selling point to get gamers off the fence and buying a PS3. This is one of those games that comes along in a long while that will not just give you a gaming experience but will tug at your heartstrings and give you a journey that you won't soon forget.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

At the end of the chains there are blades. These are called the Blades of Chaos. These blades are fast and cause a lot of damage, that is if you upgrade the swords to max.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2005"}

Wii (the main game, anyway) last year. I must say that Nintendo is really on a roll when it comes to making fun Mario games you can pick up and play easily. The only thing that is disappointing about this game (and not so much about the Wii version) is that it's overall too easy. You breeze through a lot of the levels. Not to mention that most of the levels are relatively short just like in the New Super Mario Bros. series.Now my favorite Mario game of all-time is indisputably Super Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64. That game starts off fairly easy but ante's up to medium difficulty and then beyond. The worlds were also great contrasts from each other and were filled with mysteries. I loved exploring the open worlds and finally having Mario in 3D. If there ever is a real definition of an epic game, that was it! And while this game isn't quite on that level, it does still have a lot of cutesy Mario charm. The graphics are very pleasant, everything is filled with color, the music is hummable and the controls are what you're used to. I also like most (or all) of the new power-ups.All in all, this game is a hit and shouldn't be missed by any Mario lover or people who like adventure games that you can pick up and play anytime.4.5 stars (or a 9 out of 10.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005N7YR","reviewerName":"maninblue \"maninblue\"","summary":"review was inaccurate","reviewText":"I recently purchased this first person shooter expecting more of the same run and gun type of action found in dozens of other games. (I lied. I played the demo to death while waiting for this.)  After playing the playstation 2 version, I didnt expect much.  When I finally played the PC version I was literally blown away.  When I seen the depth of the game I knew I had to buy it.  The demo was the most used program on my computer for months.  Now the full game is in my posession and I love it. The PC version is actually a completely different game.  The missions are different as is the character you play. Obviously the game in general is far better than the console version.True, the game has no blood or gratuitous amounts of fleshy, dripping, guts, but the game has style. You will learn that other games with gallons of bright red liquid gushing from enemies when you shoot them is rediculous anyway. There are other means of telling when youve scored a hit like sound and slick model animations.  Also, the graphics are great.  You can hide out in rubble or lush leafy bushes.  The sound is the best.  You can tell where your enemies are by listening for them (you may need a better sound card to support the enviromental audio, but they arent that pricey).  I swear that in multiplayer, I have hunted my friends down by listening to thier boots jogging on the ground.  You can always tell where stuff in the game is by litening to it. You may have to creep with some stealth sometimes, but it all adds to the game.The review stated that the multiplayer is average at best.  The reviewer clearly has to be talking about another game.  This was a mistake, because in my opinion, MOHAA has the best mutliplayer.  It adds the intelectual factor of Ravenshield with a faster paced game.  All of the maps are wonderfully thought out.  Even the smallest, forgotten nooks and crannies, that seem like developers accidents are purposely put in the level for the advantage of whomever hides in there.  There are little spots under rubble or in bushes.  There are so many places to hide out and yet there is never a break in the action.  The maps can be kind of large, but can be played with few or many people.  The game tpyes are fun and have much variety. You will love the sinlge player Omaha beach invasion and you get to recreate that online. The multiplayer is not sub-standard.  In fact, it has to be the most fun FPS deathmatch or teambased game ive played.  This game is so well done, it make many of the games out today look like garbage.  The funny thing is: I dont even like EA Games after being dissapointed with several of their other titles.Buy this game.  If there is anything you will get out of it for sure, it is a sense of appreciation for the most horroble war of all time.  You will feel the emotion in this game.You will feel like you are part of the raw battles of WWII, making adifference.  After playing this game you will run out and watch Saving Private Ryan.  You may also feel the need to research some history on the war.  It makes you feel.  Check it out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2003"}

I'd heard of the game, knew David Jaffe(from Twisted Metal fame) was involved with the series and knew it was a much beloved series but that was pretty much it. My interest in God of War peaked when I got to play Kratos in Mortal Kombat for the PS3. I thought Kratos was one serious b.a. in that game.  So, recently, when I was at my local videogame shop- I saw the God of War Collection. I asked the person working there to tell me about it and, when she did, I was sold. I purchased the collection right on the spot.What can I tell you about the God of War Collection? Well, like you don't already know but--, it is a remastered port of God of War and God of War II on a single blu-ray disc for the PS3; with trophies, 60fps graphics and everything is in high-definition. God of War tells the story of Kratos(an ex-Spartan warrior) who's hellbent on destroying Ares, the God of War. The story's told as a flashback of three weeks prior to where the opening movie cutscene starts and then sets the stage for the game. You fight through all manner of greek mythological creatures. Whereas in God of War, Kratos set out to kill Ares; in God of War II- Kratos sets out to alter that which no mortal or god has ever changed -- his fate. Along the way, he meets more mythological creatures out to stop him from reaching his goal. Will they stop him? Lol, you'll have to play to find out. I will tell you, it ain't pretty.If you haven't experience God of War before, like me, this is a good place to start. The games are absolutely amazing. Looking forward to finishing these so I can tackle God of War III. Heck, who knows- I might even tackle the God of War:Origins Collection as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2012"}

This was a hard review to do because parts of this game are just as fantastic and sometimes more so than Assassin's Creed II(one of my favorite games of 2009.) Other parts are annoyingly frustrating, difficult and sometimes just plain stupid. Let's look at the positive first shall we?Graphics on this game are stunning. The only annoyance of Assassin's Creed II was the screen tearing that pretty much occurred whenever you moved the damn camera. I know that the XBox version did not suffer from this as much. That being said when Ubisoft said that they would try to make the PS3 version of ACB as close as the Xbox version as possible, I think they succeeded for the most part. Screen tearing still occurs but mainly in cutscenes(I have seen You Tube videos showing the XBox version and guess what? Screen tearing in the damn cutscenes!) Overall the game looks great. The only time I saw a framerate drop was near the end of the game.Gameplay picks up where AC2 left off--that being said, Awesome. Sword fighting is really fun and easy to be good at. A variety of weapons keeps things interesting as well. The Cross Bow and the Poison dart gun were really cool additions. Climbing and jumping all over Rome is just as fun as it was during AC2. I loved being able to upgrade and buy pretty much all of Rome. Burning the Borgia Towers was also a nice gameplay addition.My favorite parts of this game are where I was just wandering around, giving missions to my Assassins(another awesome addition to the AC game), doing side missions and finding treasure and collectibles. If this was the whole game, I would have loved it.Unfortunately, eventually you have to go back to the main storyline which is to say in a word, AWFUL!!. Near the end I had no clue what was happening or why!! Most of the main storyline missions are either timed(which I HATE), over if you are detected by ANYONE(WHich I loathe as there is no real stealth abilities in the game) or plain old ridiculously difficult(the Bomber mission comes to mind which I finally gave up on due to terrible control of the damn plane!!)Not sure how AC2 could be so fun and this one could be so bad(in terms of story missions) There was a point near the end where I almost gave up but I hung tough and did finish the game(you can check my Trophy list to verify) No game should be like that! Especially one which has so many positive features like this one. Oh well, being I paid $40 for this game and spent close to 40 hrs playing, I guess I shouldn't complain too much. It is worth a buy but just be prepared for some parts where you want to throw your $60 Dualshock against the wall! RIP poor Sixaxis controller :(","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004LLRYOY","description":"Square Enix FF IV:The Complete CollectionFinal Fantasy IV:The Complete Collection PSP","reviewerName":"Bryan","summary":"The best version of one of the most important RPGs of all time.","reviewText":"Final Fantasy IV is the game that made me fall in love with RPGs back when it was released on the SNES. I've been playing this game for two decades now, and I'm full of nostalgia for every aspect of the original release: from the music to the pace of the gameplay to the characters. You would think that this would make me and others like me the prime target for a release like this, but the reason this game is getting 5 stars is not because of my nostalgia, it's in spite of it.I have played other releases of this game before. I played the Nintendo DS version in its supposed 3D glory. That's not a 5-star game. It just barely lived up to the name for me. It was serviceable, at best. The sound processor on the DS didn't do the music justice, and the 3D graphics only served to suck the artistry out of the sprites. No, the original sprites weren't beautiful, but people mistake better technology for better appearance. Next-gen consoles of today can do three dimensional polygonal characters that rival the best 2D artistry, but that doesn't mean that all games with 3D look better than 2D games. I'd argue that there's more detail in Final Fantasy VI's 16-bit sprite characters than there is in Final Fantasy VII's polygonal ones, nevermind the pre-rendered backgrounds. The 40-polygon blocky characters were just ugly. It's the same deal with Final Fantasy IV DS versus the PSP version.With that being said, here is why I consider this to be the ultimate version of Final Fantasy IV:-The best looking version of the game. Beautiful sprites, spell effects, and movies bring the game to life better than any other release, utilizing a masterful artist to draw the characters without converting the art to a chunky 3D model.-The additional After Years and Interlude are included in by far their best versions available. Interlude I believe only exists on this release! They're included as separate games, so you can play them if you wish, but don't have to if you don't want to. The original Final Fantasy IV is not affected by them whatsoever. The only other releases were for cell phones or as a Wii download that, in terms of presentation, felt more like fan-made content than a legitimate addition to the series. It now gets its proper due and actually feels like it belongs.-The translation is slightly better than the SNES version and pretty much on par with other English translations. Some people have claimed that the translation done by the fans was the best, but I've read a guy analyzing the various translations of this game on the Legends of Localization website, and it seems clear that the professional translators did an okay job compared to the amateurs. In any case, I'm putting this as a positive because they stayed the general course with the translation. It's good enough to get the point across without having too many liberties taken.-The MUSIC! You have a choice between the original music which ACTUALLY sounds like the masterful SNES music, or the new arranged versions, some of which are shockingly better than the originals. I'm so lame that I actually listen to original SNES FFIV music on my iTunes on occasion. Yes, the original music, as it sounded in the game. For me to even suggest that they redid that music to sound better is pretty incredible for even me to believe. The fact that you can still choose to hear the original music is just gravy.-As with other more recent releases of this game, they have the full skill list for the characters that was taken out of the original SNES version for the US. For example, Edward can \"salve\" the party which lets him use a potion to heal everyone at once. Cecil can use his HP to his all monsters at once as a Dark Knight. These additional skills add a great deal to the early stages of the game, and will be appreciated by RPG fans just playing this for the first time; heck of a lot better than just hitting \"attack\" over and over with no choices.-I know a lot of people have picked this up and trashed how \"easy\" it is compared to the DS remake, but that's mostly just the first third of the game which has slightly easier bosses. They seem to have decided to allow players to cruise through the early parts of the game without any leveling up. Still, if you want the full challenging experience, you can play with the active battle system fully on, and battle speed set to the fastest. The monsters attack more, and you can have your difficulty if you like. I found the ending of the game to be mostly just as hard as usual. Also, even on easier battle speed settings, the additional content of Interlude and After Years ramps up the difficulty a great deal, so those thirsting for something tough now have it in full force. The additional content offers more challenge than the original ever did. Overall I'm going to say that this is a better compromise of difficulty than most releases of this game, even though I would personally rather the first few bosses weren't toned down. A brand new player to the game might be completely baffled about why anyone said the game was easy as many popular RPGs on the market are not any harder than this.-The overall presentation and attention to detail. The main menu even has a lot of options with access to artwork and cinematics without playing the game, and we now have a bestiary.As for negatives, I can think of nothing significant. It is going to annoy some people that you have little control over choosing your party, but I think most RPG fans should be able to accept this given the overall quality of the experience. The main thing new players may find annoying is the random battles, but you can easily run away from most battles if they're bothering you, at very little penalty. There is one thing that needs to be turned on in the settings, which is the option to switch whose turn it is using the triangle button. One reviewer actually has this down as being missing from the game, and it bothered him a lot. It is there, just turn it on and you're all good.All in all, as a massive fan of FFIV, I can think of no game I'd recommend more highly to a RPG fan than this remake. I've played it through in past versions 10 times before, and I would not hesitate to say that this is the version to get. Fans of this game should be relieved that it finally got the treatment it deserved. At $20 or less as of the time I'm writing this, it's a steal! And thankfully it's even available on the Playstation Network so you can download it for your Vita.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2013"}

Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

Together with up to three friends players must battle those transformed beings, and in the process improve their angelic skills and regain the heavenly fruit in order to gain their heavenly reward.CustomizationPlayers can create their own heroes, deciding how they would like their face, hair and clothing to look. As the story unfolds, players become stronger, smarter and more powerful, and can create custom companions to join their group as well. Players will also have fun discovering more than 900 pieces of clothing, armor, weapons and other items that will provide them with a unique appearance and special abilities. Even occupations can be customized and changed at any time. Players can take on one of a dozen different jobs with varying strengths, weaknesses, spells and skills.BattleFast-paced turn-based battles unfold as players decide what to do and then view cinematic action scenes. This format rewards careful thinking and strategy over quick reflexes. The more foes players defeat, the stronger their characters become. In the lead up to conflicts, talking with different characters will unfold the story and point players toward their next mission. All quests come with a reward, which might be anything from a rare item to a new, unlocked occupation.Tag ModeDragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skiesincludes the interactive Tag Mode that allows players to keep the game active even while their Nintendo DS system is stored in their pocket, purse or backpack. When two players come within range of one another, Tag Mode enables them to wirelessly--and automatically--exchange character information, customized greetings and treasure maps. These treasure maps allow players to find otherwise inaccessible dungeons called grottoes featuring special boss monsters and even rare items.Social Play AspectsOne of the most enticing things aboutSentinels of the Starry Skiesare its many social aspects built into its gameplay. First, you need never be alone. Special multiplayer modes let players share their adventure with others, allowing up to four players to team up via a local wireless connection and experience the fun of tackling challenging monsters and dungeons cooperatively with their own characters. Players can even leave the game active in their backpacks, pockets or purses and still interact with other players via an interactive Tag Mode. In addition, information about players' characters can be wirelessly transmitted to others. Also the game contains treasure maps that allow players to find otherwise inaccessible special dungeons called grottoes, which can contain rare items or enemies. In Tag mode, treasure maps and customized greetings can be exchanged automatically by players who come within range of one another. Finally, players with wireless broadband Internet access can visit an online shop to find new items or download additional quests. The selection of items changes daily. Some downloadable quests will continue the main storyline of the game, while others offer standalone missions or quests themed to a particular time of year.Key Game FeaturesHandheld action RPG action where players engage in epic quests in undiscovered lands filled with dangerous monsters and untold storiesConnect locally with up to three friends in cooperative gameplay modesCustomization allowing you to create your own hero, either male or female, changing your hair, face, body style and equipping them from a selection of over 1,000 in-game items including weapons, shields, armor and accessoriesWireless features that allow access to changing exclusive items and questsIn-game treasure maps that reveal otherwise inaccessible special dungeons called grottoes, which can contain rare items or enemiesGameplay with differing stories and missions depending on NPCs encountered","reviewerName":"Stacy \"Amazon Junkie\"","summary":"I want to love this game...","reviewText":"Ah Dragon Quest, the RPG series that predates Final Fantasy, that has staunchly kept its \"classic\" menu and fighting system. Originally released in the United States as Dragon Warrior, this [Square] Enix title garnered a cult following; well-deserved, I might add, and either you like the game or you don't.Dragon Warrior on the NES was the very first video game that I ever beat. Offered as a free title if you subscribed to the fledgling Nintendo Power magazine, I remember spending hours in my mother's living room until I had vanquished the evil Dragonlord as Erdric's heir. The classic menu-driven battle system, the random encounters, the colorful monsters, all of this lead to a love affair with a great gaming series.To this end, Dragon Quest IX follows faithfully in its predecessor's steps, recreating the same monster designs that date back to the very first title on the NES. Characters are designed by Akira Toriyama, the famed anime artist most associated with the Dragonball cartoons. There are random encounters galore, menu-driven battles, and the classic (cliche?) you-are-the-long-lost-hero storyline.All of this is marvelous if you enjoy the mercilous grinding that you must do in order to complete any Dragon Quest title. The classic RPG styling is very loyal to the genre, and fans will not be disappointed. Yet, I find myself unable to love this game, even though the execution is marvelous.GameplayWhere the storyline in Dragon Quest IX shines, the gameplay itself tries to be epic and ends up selling itself as frustrating. This game introduces the jobs system a la Final Fantasy III; you start the game as a minstrel (a jack-of-all trades, if you will), and after completing the necessary story elements, you are able to change your profession into one of the initial six (mage, priest, warrior, minstrel, martial artist, and thief). You are able to unlock other professions by completing quests.It is almost a requirement that you change classes, as the skill point system takes forever to maximize if you remain in one profession. Not to mention that certain skills are only available to a specific class. By using your skill points in the class-specific skill (and subsequently mastering the skill by dumping 100 points into it), you are able to use that class' abilities in another profession. Example: I can use swords as a martial artist, even though they cannot equip that weapon as a natural part of their profession.The quests are where Dragon Quest IX will cause you to scream at your DS. Some are logical; your typical \"fetch\" quests. Others require you to kill a specific number of a certain enemy only after using a certain skill (which, of course, is only available to a certain profession). Quests become unlocked in a variety of ways, as part of the storyline or by completing certain tasks.Yet, it is the quests with insanely ridiculous requirements that will infuriate you. One quest is from a cat and contains only the word \"meow\". I had no idea how in the heck to complete the quest until I looked it up online (turns out I had to wear the \"cat ears\" item and talk to the cat to complete the quest). Another quest requires you to use a warrior ability to scare the enemy, and then to kill them with a \"regular\" critical hit, which is entirely random. You can literally spend hours trying to time your kill so that the warrior is the one executing the killing blow, but only after he has scared the enemy.Obtaining gear in the game is also borderline ridiculous, but balanced in that anyone devoting enough time and resources can create the best items using the Alchemy system within the game. It will take you hours, though, to gather up the resources, not to mention the gold, to make that axe you covet. To be fair, however, it is not a requirement to use the best gear to beat the game; a casual gamer could legitimately just buy the shop items and still get to the finish line. Completionists will spend hours upon hours farming and grinding.The good thing this game introduces, though, is you do not have to grind as much as previous Dragon Quest titles. That is, you do not have to run around killing 100 slimes until you hit a high enough level to take on the boss. The game is more or less scaled to allow you to spend less time killing and more time reading story text.GraphicsNo one picks up a Nintendo DS to be wowed by the graphics. This game is no different. If you ever played the N64, you can get a feel for the graphics. Not a smooth line in sight. I would kill to see fingers instead of block hands.MusicNothing to write home about. Catchy enough, but your standard RPG fare.OverallAs a classic RPG title, Dragon Quest IX fits the bill. Lots of monsters, an epic storyline (if a little predictable), and tons of walking around to get from points A to B, and you have yourself a fun game.If you plan on exploring the rest of the game (and there is a lot of that, between the quests, alchemy, and jobs system), you will waste many hours and go through several battery charges. If you have a friend who is also playing the game, then you can run together, but only in one person's game world or another (if one person hasn't advanced the story further than the other, they are stuck until that person catches up).In short, I recommend this title, but if you are a hard-core RPG fan, the temptation to complete the quests and other achievements may be too much. Be prepared to waste a lot of time chasing for ingredients to alchemize and specific monsters to kill in a new and unusual way (with wooden chopsticks while standing on your head as a martial artist...am I joking or not?).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

That really didn't matter though, as facts from previous Metal Gear games did not need to be known to understand what was going on.  The gameplay is simply this, you are given a mission that you must complete using practically any means necessary.  Your weapons range from a sword to rocket launchers and guided missles.  The story makes sense, but may become confusing near the end as you are not sure what is really happening to your character and what isn't.  Although you don't spend much of the game playing as Solid Snake, he helps you complete your mission and gives you advice.  The action is exxciting (and sometimes hilariously funny) as you guide your character through the mission.  As for the graphics, they aren't cutting edge, but they look good and aren't very blocky (polygonal).  The music changes depending on your location and alert status.  Half the time you won't even realize there is music or background sounds because you will be too tied up in the action, but the music goes well with the situations it is played.  The game isn't overly short, but it isn't excedingly long either.  I finish teh game in roughly 10-11 hours.  The only fault I found to bring it's rating down was the ending was more cinemas than it was gameplay and the plot was stretched too far.

I myself put over 100 hours into the game, but when the sequel came out I wondered how it would compete with the 2008 game of the year. Well lets go with the easy answer and say no it doesn't reach the same level of greatness as Fallout 3, but it does come close.If you've played Fallout 3 then you will be right at home when you play this one. The interface is identical. You even get a Pip Boy to keep track of your items like in the Fallout 3. The story begins with you being shot in the head and the item that you were supposed to be delivering stolen from you. Thankfully you are revived and you start your quest for revenge. The story in my opinion is equally as interesting as Fallout 3's with a lot of twists and turns that keep you involved in the campaign, along with a lot of choices to make. There are many different factions and depending on who you go with drastically changes what you experience in the game. This is something I'm not a fan of because I don't want to play a 50 hour campaign three or four times to get everything out of the game.There was a new mode called Hardcore added to the game. It involves having to eat, drink, and sleep. Also it takes longer for Stimpacks to take effect. It's not really that much more challenging in fact it's just annoying. Your in the middle of something and you have to guy find water so you don't die. It breaks up the action too much to be fun. The graphics have been improved slightly, but are basically left untouched since it uses the same engine as Fallout 3. They added some sun that does create a different atmosphere to the game. New Vegas is fairly untouched from the nuclear war, and it takes a lot of the post nuclear war themes out of the game which was a step backward in my opinion.The glitches are back unfortunately as well. The frame rate drop is as annoying as ever, and full game crashes are pretty common. Also things float into the sky and doors lock from inside leaving you unable to leave. While these glitches were forgiven in Fallout 3 there is no excuse 2 years later. Why Obsidian can't make a smooth running game is beyond me.The exploration in this game is not as extensive as the previous. There are just as many locations in the game, but they don't have as many interiors to explore. Some don't even have buildings just some tents or crates. This doesn't make me want to discover all the locations like in Fallout 3. There are over 50 quests to complete, but they also don't seem as extensive. You can finish them rather quickly and they don't give you as many XP points because of it. A lot of the weapons from the first game appear along with some new weapons like the Varmint Rifle. The added weapons and items are fun to collect and display in whatever home you end up with. The multiple paths however make it unlikely that you will be able to get everything on one save file. Another great add on is the \"follower\" hub. You can tell your follower what to do much more easily now with this easy to access hub.Fallout New Vegas was a great game. It may be overshadowed by its predecessor but it is an engrossing thrill ride with a massive campaign.  There are glitches that do annoy you throughout the campaign, but overall you can't complain for the price tag. Most 60 dollar games only offer 5 to ten hours so when you buy a game and pay a dollar an hour you can't get a better deal. It may sound like I've only talked about the bad, but the game so closely resembles Fallout 3 I don't feel it necessary to highlight the good that Fallout 3 already had. As we learned War War Never Changes why should this series change its formula when it works great. If you're a fan of Fallout 3 then pick this up you will enjoy it. If you want to become a fan of the series just pick up Fallout 3. Either way you won't be disappointed when you play this franchise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

You can craft weapons and build vehicles after you have found blueprints around the city. Game boss battles are hard if you are under level and can get a bit frustrating. Be sure to take you time to upgrade yourself before facing these bosses. Sometimes they have 2 health bars, so after you think you got them defeated, they will get all back. Controls could be better, sometimes on the heat of a battle you push the wrong button and can end up throwing a weapon you really need instead of using it. Rolling to escape makes sense more as one of the X,Y,A,B buttons instead of pushing the left stick for example. Loading times are slow, after you get killed, sometimes is like 15 to 30 seconds until you can start again.It is a great game, but you need patience and time to get a strategy to survive or beat a boss at times.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2014"}

It's for now, the killer app for the Xbox One (and PC) and it's supposed to re-invigorate the stale shooter market, which it does in varying degrees.So rather bore you again with what it is and how it plays, I will just stick to my experience with the game.So, of course you have a tutorial that you have to go through to access the rest of the game and while for some, it may seem like a pain to go through as many of us undoubtedly have played shooters, this one to me was very helpful considering there are small nuances that differentiate this over other shooters.  If done correctly, you can be finished in about 15 to 20 minutes and from there, you can play the campaign.The campaign itself is very forgettable and contrived and to be honest, I really don't remember much of it as I played.  The thing is, the campaign itself makes us the player, more of the background for the main characters and the outcome of your match really doesn't change it one way or the other how you progress in the game. I mean if you lose the campaign, it's not like you have to start all over or suffer some kind of penalty for losing.  I can say this, as a multiplayer campaign, the main thing I was worried about as far as system lag or dropout never affected my gameplay and my online experience was smooth.  If I had any complaints about the campaign mode was how unbalanced the teams were.  Rookies seemingly were always on the Militia side as more experienced players were on the IMT side.  But I really don't think anyone cared.  Not to mention, there wasn't a lot of variety in the matches played during the campaign as you mostly play attrition and 1 or 2 domination matches. But again, I don't think anyone really cared.  Most of us played really just to level up and unlock new items as we played.  The catch is of course once you finish the campaign mode, you get a new titan for your trouble.I would say that this may be one of the draws to the game that in some matches, although teams can be unbalanced, you are only as good as your FPS skills are and even then sometimes t doesn't matter as in this game, death can come from anywhere at anytime.  Furthermore unlike some games like Call of Duty and Battlefield where it may take many, many hours of grinding to level up, I felt that with Titanfall you don't hit that early grind wall.  Also after level 4, you open up challenges and many of these aren't so hard to accomplish and add to your XP as you go.  One of the things I did like with this game is that it borrowed from Battlefield, the idea that your points come from many different sources and not just from how many kills you got. To be honest, in some matches I found myself taking more time to hunt and take down other titans than I did calling my own and man it was a perverse sense of joy me being like a level 6 taking down a level 20 titan!  Of course also, what is a FPS without customization? Once you get enough unlocked you can go crazy with the amount of items that you get.Another point that I did like about the game is that you aren't limited to fighting against players in the matches. In order to make the battlefield feel fully fleshed out and chaotic, there are also AI grunts  added throughout so that way battles aren't just 6 vs 6 humans...it's their AI allies as well.  Some are cannon fodder and some can be just as tough as human players but again, I did like the idea of this addition to the game so that way it didn't feel like you were always fighting against humans.So, do I have any complaints?  Well, of course.  Graphically, it's a mixed bag.  The cut scenes (for the few that there are prior to going into battle) for the forgettable campaign mode are just lousy.  Maybe it's because like every other FPS, you have to give up something in order to have a stable server, but once the battles commence, it becomes a pretty game.  My biggest knock on it however is the lack of multiplayer modes in the game. You only get 5 to choose from:  Attrition (team deathmatch), Hardpoint Domination, Capture the Flag, Pilot Hunter (in which only player kills count), and the round-based Last Titan Standing where you start off in your titan.  Ok so consider us spoiled but when you do look at how many modes there are in other FPS games, it was disappointing to have so few and yet basic options. And while this isn't necessarily a knock on the game, I DO have to say that in some modes, it's best to play as a team especially in domination.  A few times when I played with people I knew, we always stood a better chance of winning matches by coordinating our tactics rather than just run hodge podge all over a map, so on that I could say it's a good game for partying up with friends.So how about Titanfall and sales in the long run?  I do suspect that this will be the game that starts pushing the Xbox One out of stores and really show what it can do.  Microsoft may have knew what it was doing awhile back when they locked the exclusivity rights up early on because if this was a multisystem game, the X-box One would be dead in the water so this is the game that they need to push it out in this crucial first year. As far as longevity of the game itself, I am hoping to see with some of the DLC, maybe we get a few more multiplayer modes and possibly new titans.All in all, it is indeed a fun game. It's a game that many of us have had fun with since probably the MechWarrior days.  While I don't think that it will revolutionize the FPS market, it does add something to it that we haven't seen. The game itself is player friendly, levels up well and of course is very fluid in gameplay. If you have an Xbox One and only casually like playing shooters like myself, this one is worth looking into.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2014"}

The grand designs found within are evocative of the works of great doodle masters such as any of the artists working on South Park or Mrs. Havercamp, my third grade elementery school teacher.-A tchotchke (Diablo's head), which serves as a clever container for the USB memory stick containing the previous Diablo games and (oddly) also possesses a chemical smell much like spray paint. The tchotchke head and USB memory stick were quite obviously held in such high regard by Blizzard, that they were placed within their own container, packed carefully, much as you would expect to find a Rolex watch or perhaps a crown jewel or two.-Several guest key codes on laminated cards, that I can only surmise are collectors keepsakes in and of themselves.-A Music CD and 'Behind the Scenes' Video DVD are included; regrettably the Music CD is packaged in a very thin plastic case, which in turn is encapsulated within a cardboard paper case. I am hesitant to open this as the extraneous cover is likely to become easily worn out.-Of course the game DVD itself comes, as would be expected, in the standard DVD style enclosure that is characteristic of any DVD sold. Included within this caissonThe outer box is not made of real ivory or bone after all, so I am disappointed that the box itself is not an heirloom that I will be able to pass on to my grandchildren. However, it is made of precision manufactured steam compressed wood pulp that seems to be very robust, and I am grateful for that much.Unlike the Diablo II Collectors Edition, which I am also the proud owner of, this collector edition does not seem to have a serial number stamped on the back of the box. My Diablo II box is stamped 43,xxx of 75,000. There is a number stamped on the bottom of the box, but since it is in the 7 million range, it is almost certainly the part number for the box itself.The complete package is most impressive due to its weight, in large part a result of the hard cover artwork book inside. The box is also quite large. I thought the Diablo II box had a bit too much girth, as if Blizzard felt that a typical box size of that era would be unable to do justice to the variety of contents it was comprised of. The voluminous capaciousness of the Diablo III box is an order of magnitude greater. Precisely placed at the bottom of this portmanteau of joys is a finely crafted piece of injected molded plastic, which very deftly holds in place all of the contents. In all, the package is a great achievment, and one can not help but give kudos to the artisans that brought together all of these wonders in one tidy package for the world to enjoy.I would like to review the game, but unfortunately Battle.net doesn't seem to be functioning as intended by the manufacturer of this masterpiece. Perhaps one day in the future this will be possible.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2012"}

Rhodes","summary":"Lighter is Better","reviewText":"People will no doubt find the Nintendo DS Lite to be a way for Nintendo to sucker people out of their money. It can be that way, if you think of yourself as a sucker, but for me the DS lite is a little better. Simply put, if you're content with your original DS, then don't even waste time to buy this one. If you don't have a DS period, the DS Lite is a much better investment than the original bulky one.With the DS Lite, gameplay is made a little simplar. The button placement and brighter screen make the gameplay a little better. For one, the start and select buttons have been moved to resemble where they were on the original Gameboy Advance. This makes handling some of the functions (especially for GBA games) a lot easier. The buttons, sadly, are a still a little small for guys with big hands like myself.The DS Lite also comes with a phony GBA cartridge (called a \"cap\"). If you don't have a GBA game plugged into the system, you can put in the phony cartridge to keep it from collecting dust in there. However, when you do stick in a GBA game, it sticks out by about a centimeter. It just looks weird. The cap does, at least, keep the system looking good.Perhaps the most welcome change to the DS Lite is the screen. The original DS screen was not exactly bright. In fact, it was, in comparison the DS Lite, rather dark. Games like Metroid Prime Hunters were darker than they had to be. On this new screen, the difference in how bright the games appear really shows. Not only that but, you can adjust the brightness if need be. It doesn't really affect the battery life, either. You can play the DS Lite for as long as you played the original. And also like the original, it charges while you play.Another welcome difference is the touch screen itself. These screens last a lot longer than the original DS. Those who have an original DS no doubt experienced a lot of scratches on their screen from their stylus. To the point where it was noticeable. You could still see the screen, but it was apparent that the stylus was doing a number on it. The screen is more protected here. The stylus doesn't scratch the screen quite as easily. In other words, the touch screen lasts a lot longer.The DS Lite also looks better, and fits in your pocket better. It also performs all the tasks of a regular DS. For example, if you're playing a game and you suddenly have to go, just flip it closed and it sleeps. There's also a place to store the stylus, and the stylus is better too. It's a little bigger and thicker, so it's not quite as easy to lose.Some problems with the original DS still plague the DS Lite however. You still can't play Gameboy Color or regular Gameboy games on the DS Lite. Also, you still can't configure the controls to play a GBA game much easier. In other words you can't configure \"X\" and \"Y\" when you play a GBA game. This probably won't bother you in the long run, however. Also, the touch screen still has its sensitivity. Touching the touch screen with your bare hands is more dangerous than the stylus scratching the screen. The oils from your fingers might damage the screen and therefore, it won't respond to the touch of even your stylus.When the original DS launched, owners will note that there were not very many good games availible. About the only good game during its launch in 2004 was Super Mario 64 DS. Now there are plenty of games out there (and not all of them are ports), so if you do want a DS, this is a great time to get one, and the DS Lite is a better investment than the original one by far.The DS may not play movies, or MP3 players, but to be honest, that almost defeats the purpose of a gaming system. Am I looking to buy a portable entertainment center? Of course not, I'm looking to find a system to play some of my games on, and the Nintendo DS delivers. Real gamers know it's about the games, not about the bells and whistles of a system. For the casual gamer, the Nintendo DS delivers, and the DS Lite is a fine improvement.The Good+Vastly superior to the original DS+It fits in your pocket easier+The Screen is much brighter+Touch screen is more durable+The placement of the Start and Select buttons is easier+A better stylus+The battery life is unchangedThe Bad-Those with an original DS, who want a DS Lite will have to spend more money for yet another DS-Some of the cons of the original DS are still here","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2006"}

It's a simple yet effective (and in my case addictive) game. So I started Left 4 Dead 2 with very high hopes. And I haven't been disappointed. Valve have improved almost everything. We have 4 new survivors and the location has been moved to the deep south. The campaigns are considerably longer due to larger maps. More challenging tasks have been introduced and the zombies come thicker and faster than ever. There are several new \"specials\" to deal with, along with some new weapons, including melee weapons ranging from cricket bats to machetes. L4D2 looks even better than the original and there are some great in-game events: the use of weather as a hindrance to your progress in the Heavy Rain campaign is particularly inspired. It's also a good deal more difficult than the original. So, pretty much everything about L4D2 is superior to the L4D1. Except for the survivors. For me they lack the character of the original team, and although Valve have lived up to their deserved reputation for the quality of the dialogue I just don't find them as engaging as the original 4. The chat between the survivors in L4D1 is full of great one-liners which helped build the bond with the player, even though you know they're just bots. Obviously this hardly matters when playing with other people but I wish, nonetheless, that the original characters had been carried over from L4D1. Still, L4D2 is a great game. Play it.

After such a long delay, it would be fair to say that my expectations were high but not too lofty.  I try not to expect a transcendant experience as you are almost always sure to be disappointed.  I was patient, as are all Tomb Raider fans, I'm sure, and quietly counted the days to its' release.  After several hours of game play, I can safely say that this game is a total catastrophe.  From the get go, you can get a feel of the horrid controls and camera movement.  Moving Lara around is more of a chore than second nature and the camera angles are just downright annoying.  For instance, when you want to make just the tiniest of turns, the slightest nudge of the left thumb pad causes her entire body to move in the opposite direction in a 180 degree turn, rendering it difficult to do the most mundane and trival action.  In addition, you end up taking way too much time positioning Lara to do any of her limited actions (when climbing through a window, you have to position her in such a way that the camera doesn't make in the least bit obvious).  It simply ends up being irritating just to get Lara to walk in a straight line.  Which leads me to the awful camera angles.  The camera angles are SO choppy and inexcusable that you most likely will want to quit in the first five minutes.  The right thumb pad allows the player to adjust the angle but as you climb, shimmy, swim or jump, the camera will automatically jump to a different angle, rendering your manual movement completely useless.  An example would be shimmying along a wall, in which you experience another wall in the foreground.  As you manually turn the camera to whatever angle fits you best, the camera system will switch to it's own angle to avoid the wall in the foreground.  It's stupid and as a result, it never gives the player a sense of total control.  Another glaring negative is the game engine.  In a few words; it's awful.  In the beginning of the game, Lara climbs a roof which houses a few crows and shacks littered about.  As it rains, there is much to see and as a result, the game slows down to a mere crawl.  Remember all those old nintendo and playstation games that would freeze when too much was happening at once?  Well, it happens here and with a system such as PS2 and a game with such a high standard as Tomb Raider, it is unacceptable at any length.  Lastly, the graphics just aren't that hot.  They're pretty standard and the cinemas are tired and uninspired.  After hearing the developers rave on and on about how the graphics are going to be groundbreaking, you have to wonder if they are still living in 1996.In the games defense, I had expectations.  Probably higher than I realize.  But this game is crap, pure and simple.  It's shocking to think that, way back in november, they decided they wanted to 'polish' the game and thus begin the months and months of delays.  It's even scarier to think how bad it was back in november to warrant such a delay and to deliver this junk after such a long stall.  Could it be that they wanted to conincide the games release with the launch of the movie?  Me thinks so.I've only had the game for one day and I'm a little bit heart broken.  Hopefully after a few more plays I can be friends with Lara again.  But as of now, this game just sucks.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2003"}

Dr. Cry-Gor is back and he changes things by adding a new gyroscope to Wario's GBA. Now you can control the action by rotating the entire GBA and pressing the A Button. Along with this new motion sensor, the cartridge has a rumble pack for force feedback. Tons of crazy, spin-controlled games are waiting for you!","reviewerName":"Lestor neeker Wong","summary":"A marvelous spin!","reviewText":"The WarioWare series of games may not be the best gamers can find on a GBA, but it's no doubt one of the craziest. And the level of craze heightens with the release of WarioWare: Twisted. The main idea of sending players into mini-games upon mini-games hasn't changed, but the execution has been drastically altered to make this a hell of a spin.One important element of the cartridge is the inclusion of a \"gyro-sensor\", which is able to detect rotary motion. Now, you can see where this is going. Yes, a large amount of action in the game is now tied in to the sensor. While pressing the \"A\" button continues to serve its purposes, turning your GBA around will become of your most common movement when you play this game. Be it climbing up a spiral staircase or attempting to push a toothpick past a set of teeth (!), the tilting and turning is crucial to completing the mini-games. If I'm not wrong, this is an industry first for a handheld console.Apart from the gyro-sensor, the cartridge also houses an internal rumbler. What this does is that it vibrates your GBA under certain circumstances, for example, when hammering a nail into place. This is much like the PS2 Dual-Shock Controller, which may or may not appeal to you. Still, you can fault them for trying to make the gaming experience more interactive. Obviously, this is also an industry first for a handheld console.As good as the new features are, the graphics for the game are as good as usual. They blend in nicely with the various themes of the games, and considering the amount of stages, I think they did a good job in making the graphics look fresh and enjoyable. The audios are also excellent, but at times a little pressurizing. It becomes kind of distracting as the music speed becomes increasingly faster as you progress, but that's just me.Overall, the inclusion of these two features is an amazing leap for the GBA in terms of gameplay, especially in the face of strong challenges from Nintendo's own DS, and Sony's very popular PSP. Most importantly, they make you feel that their presence are more necessary than just being gimmicks. And with a huge library of mini-games (over 200, I think) to select from and tons of \"souvenirs\" (over 100) to unlock, it's not a surprise if you find yourself spending a lot of time on this once you get started. I'd recommend this game for fans of this WarioWario series, but if you're not already one, it could be a good time to get started.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2005"}

(3 & 1/2 - 4 stars).","reviewText":"Like most people interested in this game. I have been a Gears head since the beginning! I anticipated Gears Of War 2yrs before \"Emergence Day\" back in 2006. And so on, with Gears 2 & Gears 3! Judgement however, I had been reluctant to purchase it. A bit skeptical, and a bit curious as to what they would add and subtract from the series? So I have yet to buy this game. However, I am lucky enough to have played it today, @ my job (I'm a caregiver for clients in their 20's, that also love gaming).  Didn't play it long enough to beat Judegment. But I played for 4hrs. So I'm pretty sure I'm pretty close towards the end.  Graphics look the same as previous Gears games. It has it's monments of intensity/action for sure! A few changes that I've experienced in just those 4hrs are:Gameplay:some of the controls have been changed. Switching weapons is not done w/ the D-pad. Instead, you press the Y button. Throwing a frag,incinidary,or smoke gernade, is done w/ the LB button. As far as I can tell you can't see howmany gernade you have. It's not pictured w/ your lancer,ect.. Also, it appears you can only hold 2 weapons. Excluding grabbing Mulchers, One Shot's,and some new weapons they have. Another thing that seems to be the case. Is that at first it appears you can't hold more than a small amount of ammo for whatever gun your holding. And gradually you can. I had a Boomshot, and tried to get ammo @ a ammo box. It said I was full. My Lancer had only like 240 rounds. And my Boomshot had 4. Same when I had a Torque Bow....Just 4. Later though I had a Torqe Bow w/ 12. There is a new feature w/ this Gears. It gives you the option throughout the story to choose \"Declassified\" or \"Classified\". Declassified allows you to level/rank up faster. It makes the stroy more challenging. You can pick which way you wanna roll, depending on how your feeling about the situation. You'll often use the D-pad to look at oncoming locust (yes, they are in the game, unlike what I've heard from others. And read from others). And you use it to make the game save your progress. It will prompt you the option to do so frequently. Horde mode does not appear in this game! THAT SUCKS!!!!! Horde mode is a big deal for many!!!! Wouldn't doubt if they somehow add it in DLC for Judgement at some point. There are other mini games I haven't tried yet.Your level/rank from Gears 3 is not carried over to Judgement.Weapon skins are actually already in this game without DLC. You unlock them as you go through the game and achieve things.Story:Like I said. I didn't beat it yet. But from what I've played so far. It basically is like Baird is telling a long story to someone about what all happened during that period in time. And your playing his memory/reflection of it. You get to see what went down w/ Cole & Baird prior to Gears Of War/Emergence Day.All in all I have enjoyed the game. Its a fun game. It won't be for everyone. There are some changes. But I don't feel it's changed so much as to say it's like a Call Of Duty. Others have said that. Worth checking out atleast!!! Me personally, I wouldn't buy it for $59.99. But I'd pay $25-$30 probably.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2013"}

Is it a million dollar improvement over the 360? Nope. It's actually worse. And here's why. And I don't care what ANYONE ELSE says. I have a 150k gamerscore, but I'm NOT a fanboy and will always give my honest opinion. Always.NOTICEABLE PROS OVER 360:- noneREPORTED IMPROVEMENTS OVER 360 CONTROLLER THAN I CAN'T REALLY TELL:- dpad (but they had already fixed this with the transforming dpad on 360 controllers)- thumbsticks / dead zones - I can't tell a difference. Respawn reportedly asked them to make it LESS sensitive- Lag / latency - I really can't tell a difference yet between this and the 360 controller after playing 6 One games...CONS:- it's bigger/wider. that's dumb. everyone hated the original DUKE controller and loved it when the went with the S controller originally for the Japanese market. The wideness of the controller forces my hands apart which makes this WAY LESS ERGONOMIC for me to hold over time.- I don't like the flatness and straight edge between the 2 handles. the 360 was rounded here and therefore more natural and ergonomic.- similar to the above, the absence of the externality of the battery gives my middle fingers nowhere to rest (previously the rested up against the battery). Now they go nowhere or have to force grip the controller to hold on...- shoulder buttons (bumpers) are CLEARLY UNDENIABLY WORSE! They only press in on 1-side, the outside, not the inside. Anyone used to being able to press the 360 bumpers anywhere you touch it will notice this and raise an eyebrow. I have no idea why they would do this. The bumpers were fine previously- start and back were renamed to random line thingie and square shapey thingies. what in the hell is that about? are the lines supposed to be a bunch of lines on a MENU??? Then why not call it MENU. It's weird- the dpad now only has 4 points are articulation. the original 360 had 8 (which yes would occasionally get mispressed) but now you'll have to press 2 of the points at once to get the same functionality of the 8 (if developers care about such things).- the way the plastic casing is screwed and glued together (yes even this) is worse. it's WEAKER at the seams. The original 360 controller was completely SOLID here. I'm constantly gripping the ONE controller harder because of all the reasons above which often makes the plastic casing collapse in slightly. This sucks. I could end up breaking this thing at some point. It's not as bad as the very plasticy PS3 controller, which I feel like I could break in half, but the build is not as solid as the 360 controller.- the \"wireless\" tech still forces nearly all compatible headsets to be WIRED at least in some fashion. I have no idea why MS thinks users are a fan of having a wireless controller + a wireless headset, but with a big stupid wire connecting the two. It's a problem with the ONE console in general itself, but it should mentioned here...THE SHORT OF IT: The 360 was a flat out better controller. That being said, the ONE controller is a solid controller and will obviously work correctly. There's no reason to flunk it over nitpicks.Review for Titanfall Controller Only:For those of you wondering if the overpriced $64.99 Xbox One Titanfall controller includes an actual rechargable battery, it doesn't. Also, the regular batteries included with mine were DOA. Pretty lame for $65. Otherwise, it is obviously identical to the One controller. The Titanfall skin reminds me quite a bit of Mass Effect's design aesthetic and is quite beautiful.Unrelated but also similarly lame is that the Xbox One Titanfall console bundle doesn't even include this controller or any kind of unique skin of it's own (actually the OUTER box appears to have a Titanfall skin - so your storage closet will be happy to look at it - yippy?) Pretty lame all around...I saw design skins for the console months ago, but they must not have had time to get it done...Whole thing sounds thrown together at the last minute.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2014"}

Yet, with all of those characters to choose from, some of those remain as cult classics. In 1997, Nintendo hit the nail on the head with the revolutionary Star Fox 64. The game was not just groundbreaking in the game, but also for the player it was groundbreaking because you could feel what the game is like. Nintendo has tried it again with a different kind of Star Fox. This one seems more as if Fox has joined the cast of The Legend Of Zelda, rather than made it as a game of his own. No matter for Fox and Company, because they still have made it a great game to undergo.Star Fox Adventures for the Nintendo Gamecube, is a different kind of Star Fox game. The idea of the game is to restore the Dinosaur Planet, Sauria from fatal destruction from the villainous General Scales, and the even more foolish, Andross. The game places Fox, trying to do whatever it takes to save Krystal, a young war fighter from General Scales, with the help of Tricky, and a mighty staff that can do just about anything. The graphics and the sound on the gameplay are just amazing, and gorgeous with every beautiful detail. The storyline also hits a home run as well, with each nook and cranny told beautifully. The control does function quite well as well. It is very simple to operate, and the gameplay is very well put in itself.While some may feel that Star Fox Adventures isn't worth the challenge as it is with Star Fox 64, or the recently released Star Fox Assault for the Nintendo Gamecube, the game is really a well worth one for anybody who wants a challenge for the Gamecube. I suggest this as a add-on for anybody who is into the feel of Fox McCloud.Graphics: A-Sound: B+Control: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: BOverall: B 1/2+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2005"}

What a Surprise","reviewText":"A nice breath of fresh air into a very stale genre - the military shooter. I had been tracking this game, and prior to its release, it looked just like yet another entry in the saturated (and boring) FPS market.  Then, I started reading all the great reviews and decided to give it a try. (this review is for the campaign only).Oddly enough, the story here drives the game. Pretty unusual for a shooter.  Your Delta team (you play with two other soldiers throughout the game) goes to Dubai after an epic sandstorm has destroyed the city. Your team mates have great character, rather than the generic loud mouths most shooters stick you with. The brigade that entered the city first (the 33rd), to evacuate the citizens, has gone missing. Your job is to find out what has happened. The game draws much inspiration from the movie Apocalypse Now, although the game is set in the near future rather than the Vietnam war. Still, the game has a very 60's vibe to it (mainly because of the music), which may not sound all that appealing but really works in the game. The story is great, and the setting of a sand ravaged city with desperate survivors, is highly unique and atmospheric.  The combat itself started off as too familiar to other games, but as the story went forward the combat really seemed to click and I found it pretty satisfying. You play third person, and pop up from cover, but the weapons and combat still felt fresh despite not being revolutionary.  Having played every major shooter in the last 15 years, I was never bored. (which says alot for me) I found myself wanting to keep pushing forward to see what was next in the story.  The voice acting was fantastic. I don't know where they find such great talent for a videogame.I hope this is the start of a new trend in shooters - having a great story that places the shooting in context and gives it some meaning.  (Like HL 2, Metro 2033).  Sure, you are still playing whack-a-mole with a billion enemy soldiers, but overall the game manages to be fresh and enjoyable. If you can pick it up on sale for around the $25 I paid for the PC download here (it activates through Steam) - I don't think you will be disappointed.

His brother Lance, who we see more of in GTA: Vice City, is a coked-up maniac who tends to get Vic in worse and worse situations that Vic has to bail them both out of. Vic himself really doesn't want anything to do with drug smuggling, and some of the other things that take place. But his motivation is to earn enough money to help out his and Lance's sick little brother.Graphically, it is very similar to GTA: San Andreas, with the people and cars having more detail, with the controls being about the same as well. This was touted as a direct port of the PSP version, but you wouldn't really know it judging by the graphics and there is zero lag.There are more missions in this game than I really have time to play, which is awesome for people who want to sink themselves into a game for quite some time, and for less than $20, you really can't go wrong. The music in this game is great, with a ton of hits from 1984, and they did a great job re-creating Vice City.If I was a PSP owner, I'd be a little mad that the PS2 version came out costing less than the PSP version, which at one point was around $50. The PSP version might be portable, but the PS2 version's graphics are better.For those with Ps3's, this is a nice game to tide everyone over until GTA: 4 comes out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2007"}

The graphics are good and the sounds are pure Star Wars as one would expect.  It's so much fun crushing tie fighters and destoying AT-MT's!  Where this game really falls flat is on the length of the game and on the horrible horrible story.  I finished this game in 5-6 hours.  For $60 I expect at least double that playtime.  Without giving anything away the story is boring and does not draw you in one bit.  Super disappointed in the story and the final \"boss\" battle is pretty lame.

However, this is just not the case. They simplified the light saber combos, so now you essentially hit one button over and over (on the PS3 it is the square button). Then, you can toss in the occasional force power by using either lightening or push. Really weak. I enjoyed the different combos you could pull off in the first installment and don't understand why the game designers would reduce the combos instead of expanding on them. Odd choice. Reducing the combat system in a third person hack and slash game is usually a bad idea.Next, the force powers are exactly the same as the first game except they are slightly more \"powerful\". For example, now your force grab can pick up multiple things instead of just one. Yet, this is not always a plus. You loose some control when you are tossing around multiple objects. Or, another example, your force blast can dissolve a pack of the weaker enemies in the game instead of just pushing them back. This isn't any different from the first game, except for an additional graphic twist when you turn a pack of Storm Troopers to dust.The controls and the camera angles aren't great. I actually think the targeting system in the previous installment of the game was intuitive and easy to control. The Force Unleashed II struggles to lock onto desired objects, and I often find myself facing the wrong direction or throwing objects nowhere in particular. I never had this issue with the Force Unleashed, whereas this is constant hassle in this game.The graphics are good. However, the game environments feel redundant and recycled. The first game was spent on a variety of planets and ships that provided a multitude of visuals. In The Force Unleashed II players will spend the bulk of their time running down dull corridors. Also, the game designers seem to have fallen in love with an odd gameplay mechanic. They have you falling rapidly and moving from side to side tossing around force powers trying to avoid a variety of objects from debris to Tie Fighters. These scenes are really obnoxious. A final gripe, other than the constant drizzle of Storm Troopers to kill, most of the enemies are a disappointment. The most annoying and common are the numerous light saber wielding foes who are able to largely ignore your force powers, while using similar powers against you. So, the thing that makes the game interesting are the force powers, right? That's why people buy the game. They want to feel like a powerful Jedi. What do the programmers do? Throw in enemies who ignore all those fancy powers and limit you to smashing your melee button over and over (maybe one of the designers missed their old Atari single button controller????).This game does nothing new for the series and feels like a step back rather than forward. If you loved the first Force Unleashed I would recommend saving your money or just picking up some of the downloadable content for that game. The Force Unleashed II doesn't even give you a compelling story like the first installment. Are you a clone or aren't you? Who cares.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"Outstanding story, decent gameplay, AI is below average","reviewText":"This is easily one of the top 2 or 3 best game-stories of all time and is worth purchasing just for that reason.  I cannot overstate this enough.  It's a heart-gripping story in which you will openly cheer and care about what happens to the protagonists while playing.The game-play itself is simplistic; there really are no puzzles to sweat  Find a ladder or plank of wood and move it to spot 'A' is about as difficult as it will get.  Trying to figure out how one approaches dealing with an area full of human baddies or infected monsters is fun.  Sometimes it's best to try to use stealth and pick them off one-by-one.  Sometimes, if you're really stealthy, you can sneak past the whole group of them.  And sometimes, it's fun to break out the big guns/weapons and lay siege.  There are times where you will have to repeat areas with a trial-and-error approach and that gets a little annoying, but thankfully they are few and far between.  The difficulty on normal mode is a breeze and even the most casual gamer should have no trouble romping through the game.  Even if you're having difficulty in an area, the game recognizes this and tries to help on your subsequent attempts.  However, the combat does get repetitive after a while.  This is especially true if you prefer to stealth your way through the game as opposed to running around like you're playing Call of Duty or Battlefield.Here's the one big negative about this game:  The AI is poor.  The developer couldn't figure it out properly and instead of taking the time/effort to do it right, they just made your allies \"invisible\" to the enemy until your own cover was blown.  This leads to immersion-breaking moments where you'll be huddled behind cover trying to hide from a horde of monsters while your teenage companion will sprint all over, around, and in most cases, in PLAIN SIGHT of them for no apparent reason.  No fear, though, as the infected will be completely oblivious to her mindless jaunt, but swarm you the moment accidentally bump a small glass bottle lying on the ground.  It's not a deal-breaker, but I do laugh out loud when Ellie bolts by a half-dozen monsters while Joel, a grizzled and powerful man, is cowering in a pool of his own fear in a dark corner.Oh, and there's a ton of vulgarity.  I guess it stands to reason in the post-apocalyptic world that the f-bomb and g-d are generously used.  I don't mind it too much, but most of the time the cussing is used just to use it and is obviously forced in there for shock's sake.  The language from the teen protagonist is laughably over-the-top on occasion.Bottom line, though, is this game is still very entertaining and has a surprisingly high replay value.  I found myself replaying the game over and over to beat higher-levels of difficulty, collect all the \"artifacts\", unlock bonus material, and collect all the trophies.  Plus, I still watch the cut-scenes because the story is so phenomenal.  I recommend this if you're a casual gamer who isn't concerned about rather easy difficultly and bad AI, is truly searching for a great story, and doesn't mind a never-ending sea of profanity.Story: 5/5Game-Play:  3/5AI: 1/5Replay Value:  4/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2014"}

For those of you who have played Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo, nothing big has changed, but there are 100s of details which have improved, which most people would never notice, such as the ability to save anywhere (because this is portable), more sound effects like the voices of Mario and Luigi and also hold 999 lives!

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Your PS3 collection's naked without it","reviewText":"In a way I kind of feel sorry for Naughty Dog and their brand new game, \"Uncharted 2: Among Thieves\". Why is that? Well with the amount of hype not only from Sony, the general press but also from fans, you'd think that this game was going to not only be Game of the Year nominee and even possible winner of one of them but that it was one of the best ever, whether in this generation or any. So naturally because of this, people will label the game \"overrated\", \"not worth the hype\" etc etc but it's all quite sad really because Uncharted 2 is a tremendous achievement not only in game design and graphics but in gameplay/cutscene integration which I'll get to later. With a single player that'll last you roughly 10 hours and a multiplayer/co-op addition that'll surely add some legs, Uncharted 2 promises a whole lot of stuff to keep you busy. This is a case where hype and praise is warranted and hope people can look beyond the naysayer cries and see it for what it is: a landmark release in gaming.Story: The story begins with a literal cliffhanger: Nathan Drake, treasure hunter extraordinaire, has woken in a daze on a train that's hanging off the edge of a huge cliff in the snowy mountains. With a small amount of time left, he's got to escape the train before it crashes below but how exactly he got here, why he's got blood on him and what the mysterious dagger he finds in the snow is for is all part of the winding narrative that's in Uncharted 2. Like the first Uncharted, the story isn't exactly new but the way it's told is riveting, the characters are likable with a villain you actually want to hate for once and some really cool scenes. It's also a lot more varied location-wise which makes for a more \"epic\" story.Graphics: Uncharted: Drake's Fortune was a pretty game sure, but play Uncharted 2 than go back and you'll see just how vast the improvements were. Point of fact, Uncharted 2 is jaw-dropping and they'll be so many moments where you'll think \"holy ****\". Details, color, character animation, location variety from the mountains of Nepal (the snow here is the absolute best and I'm Canadian so I should know, heh) to a war-torn city and probably a technological feat: a train level with an actual progression as opposed to just copy-and-paste environments. Another leap forward is in the area Naughty Dog calls \"active cinematic experiences\": essentially huge moments that you can actual control in. Examples being the E3 demo where a hotel is caving in on itself with you inside actually being able to move around as opposed to this being a cutscene or a quick time event. I have a feeling more and more developers are going to try and integrate these own kinds of sequences into their games.Sound/Music: Some of the best voice acting, bar none. A lot of voice acting in games tends to be overdone, lines have to be shouted, sad lines have to be practically bawling tears and laughs have to be huge and evil but what makes Uncharted 2's VA work so well is how realistic it is from voice inflections to tone, there's barely any moments where you think the VA went a bit too far. Music's like the first one with triumphant thematic themes (points for alliteration, yay) that on occasion are a bit overdone but it's still a really great soundtrack. Sound effects are like the same though pistols still have that unsatisfying click to their shots rather than a nice boom.Gameplay: The whole of Uncharted 2 is largely undifferent from the first game with the game separated into 3 elements: platforming, puzzle-solving and shootouts. Platforming is pretty much the same with Nate hanging dangerously over cliffs though on occasion there were some moments where I couldn't figure out what was actually climbable. Sometimes I'd look around trying to find the stepping stones or ledges I'd need to climb up a wall or cliff face and be like \"where the hell?\" only the game will point it out via a hint and I'll be like \"I SO did not see that\". Puzzle-solving is strangely not as abundant as it was though the ones that are here seem a bit more bigger in scope than the first game. Whereas the first game had things like jumping to nearby platforms to turn statues, Uncharted 2 is almost more Tomb Raider or Prince of Persia-like in their more grandiose puzzles. The last part is where the real fun in Uncharted 2 is. The firefights have been drastically improved from grenades being mapped to L2 always as opposed to having to pick them all the time from the menu and a white line will show where you'd like to throw it or blind-throw. Enemy AI is relatively better though there's the occasional oddity like in the first game but the soldier who fired in all directions isn't here. There's also some really cool Hollywood blockbuster-type moments with my fave being a late game sequence involving hopping to truck to truck during a car chase and of course the exploding hotel.Naughty Dog provided 2 betas for Uncharted 2's multiplayer: one in June with vouchers being offered from websites and even purchasing Infamous while the demo was put out a week or so before the game came out, in part because since they've never really done multiplayer, a testing ground was at least set up to figure out whether they can pull it off. And in a way they have though there's some kinks. There's your standard Deathmatch, Plunder (Capture the Flag), Elimation and a cool variation on King of the Hill where they have to take over certain parts of the map in a specific order to win the game but there's also a co-op mode where you and 2 others play in sections reminiscent of the storyline though it's way more action-oriented. The surprisingly funner mode is called Arena where your team survives wave after wave of enemy soldiers which starts out easily but then they introduce enemies with riot shields that can't be melee'd, soldiers that come out of nowhere to incapacitate you from behind to the minigun toting suckers. What makes it addicting is of course the survival and adrenaline nature but also having 3 tries makes it a bit more friendly as opposed to Horde mode which ended the game if everyone was wiped out or the limited shared lives of Halo 3: ODST's Firefight mode. And all the moves from the single player carry over so if you want to do a big dramatic leap of faith to a ledge down below to escape gunfire or to get a speed boost and surprise an enemy is available to you. Nothing cooler than kicking a guy off a ledge who thinks he can just hang there and get pistol kills all day.However, the kinks I mentioned mainly has to do with the matchmaking. I've been in many matches where the teammates were a higher level than you and not only that, they seemed to be strangely relegated over to the other team and not yours so people in the high 30's and 40's were battling 10's and new players. The downside of this is that perks called boosters can be bought when you reach a certain level that can range from better bullet damage or resistance and it feels a bit unfair to have an entire team given access to way more perks than you. Also some might not like the small amount of maps and even though more will be added, you're going to eventually want some new maps and I believe Naughty Dog is going to be doing more maps so there's a plus. Oh and minor nitpick, while there's no mandatory install, an optional install would've benefited the long times since they can be anywhere from 15 to 20 seconds and it almost feels uncomfortable knowing just how long the game's taking to load. That and the trophies are somewhat easy to get with practically the exact same list as the first game though there's 100 (!) treasures to get which some are rather cruelly hidden with some really out-of-the-way ones and Crushing difficulty actually feels a bit more easier to get than the first. I only got the game Tuesday and I only need Hard and Crushing to get Platinum.Game isn't entirely flawless but there's not a lot of games that can be called this close to perfect. A good analogy to make is that this game is like the leap from the first Terminator movie to the 2nd: the story and action in the first is still good but the sequel practically ups the ante by making the action more intense, story better told and the scale a lot more grander. A must-have in any PS3 library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"TheRumblePack.com","summary":"Uncharted 2 arguably offers the most PS3 fun this holiday season","reviewText":"From the treks through steamy jungles to the endless wisecracks, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves has a lot in common with its 2007 predecessor. You're still controlling the rugged everyman Nathan Drake in an Indiana Jones-inspired adventure, and he hasn't learned many moves since his first outing. But while the sequel may sound by-the-books on paper, the actual results are astonishing. While the original was competent and easy on the eyes, Uncharted 2 is a game that should sell consoles. I cannot believe how well the final project came together.Uncharted 2 wastes no time throwing you into the action, as Nathan awakens in a wrecked train dangling from the Himalayan cliff. After a harrowing climb back onto the snowy ground, the game flashes back to a tropical beach. Here, he and new \"friends\" Chloe and Flynn discuss how to steal a lamp that may hold Marco Polo's secret directions to Shangri La. From this initial meeting, you'll be struck by how well-written and delivered the dialogue is. Not that the first game was a dramatic slouch, but because you're more familiar with Nathan and company, their actions have much more resonance.After the beach rendezvous, Uncharted 2 whisks you away to Nepal, where you'll explore temples, a mountain village, a militarized city and a heavily armed train. The level variety puts the original to shame, as if Naughty Dog was trying to address a complaint nobody even had in the first place. And more impressive, every inch of the additional real estate is populated with tons of furniture, fauna and other assorted knickknacks. Though it's hard to stop to look at the rooftops when a missile-launching helicopter is pursuing you, a quick glance at the Nepali skyline will astound with its level of detail.The presentation has received the biggest boost, but there have been subtle improvements to the combat as well. Melee combos are much more forgiving, so that you can mostly get away with mashing the punch button instead of needing split-second timing. Enemies also absorb fewer bullets than before and are now susceptible to stealthy attacks from behind. The sneakier options and smoother controls mean that combat zones suddenly become Nathan's playgrounds, letting you pick and choose how you want to dispose of your enemies.Unfortunately, while Nathan's fighting skills have improved, I do wish there were more footholds when it's time to climb. To go from a sprawling arena to a single, linear path can be frustrating, especially when this path is obscured by plants and debris. The game always gives you hints if you're stuck, but I think giving the player a few more entry points would have been the way to go.The main adventure's 20-plus chapter journey is riveting. It delivers all of the thrills that we had hoped from Indiana Jones last summer, and Nathan's band of sidekicks exudes warmth that other story-driven games lack. But if video game storytelling isn't your thing, the new multiplayer options may hold your attention for a little while. You have standard death match and capture the flag variants, but the real treat is co-op, where up to three players can team up to score some treasure. I don't think the gunplay is going to lure anyone away from holiday biggies like Halo 3: ODST and Modern Warfare 2, but there's some to be had for casual shooter fans.Even if you never go online, Uncharted 2 arguably offers the most PS3 fun this holiday season. The set pieces are exhilarating, the scenery is gorgeous and the characters play off of each other beautifully. Like Marco Polo in his quest for Shangri La, the industry will release an impressive fleet of games this fall, and only a handful will survive on the shelves. Make sure that Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is one of them.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005J536","description":"This vehicular combat game brings the original developers of the popular Twisted Metal series back for a dark, eerie installment for the PS2. This version will have new weapons, veteran and rookie drivers, weather effects, and night driving.","reviewerName":"KlownArt","summary":"Compelling Story Telling","reviewText":"Twisted Metal- BlackAfter a long hiatus afterTwisted Metal 2, the original developers return to the Twisted Metal franchise. Many people claimTwisted Metal 2 and 3were dark spots on the series that are better left alone. Twisted Metal's first outing on the Playstation 2 would lead to the best Twisted Metal game to be produced to date. There is another version of this game known as Twisted Metal- Online. It is the same game, except with online capabilities.Graphics- 8/10When you first bought your Playstation 2, this was one of the games to pick up. It came out early in the cycle, so graphics had not been perfected yet. This is an extreme update from the previous Playstation 1 titles. In-game graphics looks fantastic. There is nothing like watch Sweet Tooth transform into an erect machine of destruction. Cut Scenes are all very well done. The graphics will probably be considered sub-par now, but at the time they were great. The way the cut-scenes are designed is perfect. While many cut-scenes are similar, due to the layout of the story, they work out fantastic.Level Design has improved vastly. Not only are the levels larger, but they are more interactive. One level starts you on a prison boat. The level seems a bit mediocre with not much about it. Than the ship hits land and you can shift in and out of the boat. This uniqueness makes for a very fun play. Other levels include highways, rooftops, and general town areas. Each one plays differently and provides a different feel.Character vehicles are designed well. No vehicle looks similar to another. This game features the return of favorites like Darkside, Axel, Sweet Tooth, Spectre, and others. New characters like Crazy 8 will quickly warm up to you. All the vehicles are assumed to be stolen, other than a few, from the Asylum which most of the characters are from. Therefore, they look run down and trashy. This is goes good with the dark vibe this game presents.Story- 9.5/10Like other Twisted Metal games, Calypso is holding a vehicular-combat tournament. The winner will receive one wish. While many characters carry over in name, they are not the same characters as previous games. This time they are actually better though. You will become attached to each character's story and want to hear their stories. I think the only returning characters are Sweet Tooth and Minion.To better flesh out what you can expect from this game, I want to tell you the beginning of Darkside's story. A young woman (Darkside is a woman in this game by the way) begins working for a mask maker. She is just a secretary. One day while doing paperwork, she spills coffee on everything. Her boss is enraged and decides to make a special mask for his clumsy worker. He makes a full head mask, that looks like a doll face. He than nails it into the worker's head. Yeah, what is wrong with this guy? He than secures it with a one-of-a-kind key. Darkside is put in an asylum due to depression. One day she has a visitor. Calypso. He offers her a chance to participate in the tournament. Her wish is to escape the mask that has trapped her all these years. It only gets better through the rest of the game.Most characters' stories run a similar path. Calypso discovers them and offers a chance to take part in the tournament. Mid-way through the game you are revealed more about their past. Once you have beaten the game you see them making their wish. Most characters have three cut-scenes. They usually play out the exact same way, just with a different story.Sound- 9/10\"Paint it Black\" by the Rolling Stones is the theme song. That almost sums up all my feelings about Black's sound. I will say that without that song, this game would not be the same. The opening menu features this song and sets the dark vibe that makes me love this game. \"Paint it Black\" also plays during the credits and other various parts of Black.The rest of the sound is decent. The level that featured the prison ship features perfects sounds of waves crashing against the boat. There is wind and other assorted sounds that create a fantastic vibe. Buildings crashing, people dying, and guns blazing are just some of the cool sounds you will hear in Black.The music for the rest of the game is solid. Nothing really stands out, but it will match the level. Usually the music is quiet, but that works for this title. Voice Acting is also fantastic. Again, this creates the perfect vibe.Gameplay- 8/10The gameplay is exactly like previous installments in the series. You choose a vehicle and you enter a level. You will have to destroy all other automobiles in the level to advance. This is done by ramming them, shooting them, or pushing them off the level in certain stages. In one player, this is enjoyable. It works as a fun break from other video games. You can either play through the story mode we discussed earlier, or just play a round on a chosen level.Multi-Player is fun as well. You can have up to four players on one game. The objective is the same. You must kill all other players to win the round. You can also play story mode together. Only player one will have his story told, but it is just another fun Multi-Player option.The addition of secret characters and items increases the drive to replay this game. Since the stories are essential in this game, having more characters will quench your thirst. The addition of new levels will increase the fun in multi-player. These secrets are not the complicated to discover, but are fun searching for.Difficulty- 9/10 (Note- This is how much I like the Difficulty)Black is an easy game to pick up and play. Story mode itself is pretty easy. This is how Black needs to be though. You want to hear each character's story so badly; the gameplay should not interfere with that. However, not anyone can pick up and start winning. More experienced players will know the layout of the level better and have the advantage. New players do have a decent chance of winning though.Overall- 8.5/10I recently reviewVigilante 8: 2nd Offense. In the review, I assured every one that Black is a much better choice. This is why. Black has dark stories that are very deep, despite only lasting three cut-scenes each. Black has better levels and graphics. Black is just better. That is not just in comparison to Vigilante 8, but all car-based combat games. If vehicular mayhem is your cup of tea, buy this one right now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00F6YD2AK","description":"","reviewerName":"Hunter D","summary":"Dark Souls +2!!!","reviewText":"Dark Souls 2 is more casual friendly and making game progress early is much easier compared to Demon's Souls and Dark Souls. More frequent random equipment gear and item drops from slaying common enemies. Early bosses are easily conquerable solo with patience. Lots of treasures to be found, areas to explore and bosses to slay. Stationary unique non-invading Red Phantom NPCs make a return from Demon's Souls.Soul Leveling seems to be less soul costly per level compared to previous Souls' games. I'm currently at SL 101 (30+ hrs play time)  and it wasn't too difficult to reach nor very costly up to that point. Soul Level (SL) stats can now be undone from using a rare game item, which means player won't be stuck with bad SL stat decisions for all eternity like in previous Souls' game. My quickest way to gain souls early was by aiding others as a White Phantom by using White Soap Stones. This method also allowed me to experience unexplored areas and boss fights without penalty. (Praise the Sun!)Some merchant items are finite. Can't just buy a bunch of titanite ore and upgrade equipment as desire. I regrettably upgraded my starter class Bandit armor pieces to +3 early in my game progress just to replace them with better merchant armor suited for my play style soon after.Parry and Riposte along with Backstab are slightly more difficult to pull off against improved enemy AI. Most if not all enemies have more than one attack pattern.I can't really speak about PvP much this early in the games release, but I've been summoned as a Grey Phantom 3 times. I've seen a few red soap stone summon signs around SL 85+ and have actually summoned a red phantom to dual. No random invasion yet by red phantoms, but I'm sure that will change soon.Graphically, the game looks nothing like the E3 trailer, not even close. All those early PS3 videos shown were probably from a PC version played with PS3 controllers. Dark Souls &#62; Dark Souls 2 (*2GB HDD mandatory install) in a beauty contest in my opinion. I've put 1000+ hrs into Dark Souls and have been playing it up to Dark Souls 2 release so visually I can tell there's a difference. I'm also playing on a Samsung 55&#34; HDTV and sitting around 6 ft away from my TV I knew right away I was going to be disappointed graphically due to all the new graphics engine hype by FromSoftware. Almost everything seems to have a washed out flat look.For me the jump action being mapped to L3 just didn't feel right so I switched it to O button. I thought FromSoftware should of just mapped sprinting to L3 and jump action to O button which might have felt more natural. I haven't spent much time looking at the control options menu so I'm not sure if it can be changed manually. The jump animation is stiff feeling and looking.As for combat target lock is unreliable against mobs. It doesn't always lock on to the closest target. No improvement with camera when using target lock compared to previous Souls game. Target lock against Godzilla size bosses means a lot of camera blind spots and deaths. Camera gets lost easily against those humongous size bosses. Camera setting can be changed manually I believe. Switching between hand equipments aren't instantaneous like Dark Souls.Some boss fights just seemed cheap and next to impossible alone a la Dark Souls Four Kings (NG+ onward) with a melee build. It's not just contending with those bosses with almost unblockable and difficult to dodge potential one-hit kill attacks, but a mob as well. Two boss fights all in the rat covenant area doesn't seem to allow White Phantom summoning as far as I can tell, because my White Soap Stones couldn't be used. I wonder if it's a bug that needs patching or a part of the game design.Dark Souls 2 is a fantastic game experience and I recommend it for gamers that enjoy challenging combat heavy adventure type games that don't mind some grind.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2014"}

{"product_name":"B004ML7WOK","description":"","reviewerName":"Nishi","summary":"Short game, but a ton of fun","reviewText":"Jackie Estacado is the leading star again, this time two years after the events that happened in the first Darkness. The graphics in this game distinctively its own brand of Cell Shaded style. Along with a single play campaign, they provide you with a four person CO-OP Campaign and about 8 kill X target random missions. Even though both the campaigns are fun to play, they are really short to compete, even on hard.Story:Jackie is now the head of his mafia now, and with some crazy events at the start of the game he regains his darkness powers, which sets in motion a really epic story that rivals the first game. The Darkness still yells at you at random times, and really makes you feel that the Darkness is just pure evil incarnate. I enjoyed playing the first game, so this story was so cool to play through after knowing what happened, and I encourage other players to beat the first game to get the full experience from this game.I recommend doing the co-op missions after you have beaten the game, due to the fact they mention what happens during the game in the cut-scenes. You get to play as four other people who have their own version of the darkness, but the story only goes as far as \"do this for Jackie\" and a few things they say at the start and end of each mission. I did find it fun to play as them though, and with friends you can have a ton of fun destroying waves of enemies.Gameplay:The darkness powers are what make this game so much fun to play. You eventually unlock moves that allow you to execute enemies in crazy, over the top kills. One of them has you throwing a guy up into the air, ripping out his spine, and creating a shield out of it. This is the most violent game I have ever played, and it was so much fun creating so much mayhem and destruction throughout the course of the game.Soundtrack:The soundtrack is a mixture of orchestrated pieces and actual songs from real bands (e.g. Offspring). At one part you go to a bar with Wild Thing is playing in the background while you are ripping enemies apart, and this just makes you feel so bad-ass. The rest of the soundtrack isn't that memorable, but it's not bad either.Graphics:They did an incredible job with the Cell Shaded in this game. The details on everything is top notch, I was amazed how cool the guns looked with the drawing effect on them. You can spot a ton of detail people as well, and even though they have the drawing look to them, they appear realistic. When you are in the heat of battle it blends in wonderfully with the dismembering of the enemies and the blood effects.Verdict:It only took me like six hours to beat the game, so even though it's awesome, I wouldn't recommend the full 60 dollar purchase. The co-op missions are only 2-3 hours long as well, and if you dedicated a weekend to this game, you could easily 100% it. I say this is a definite rental for those who love to play different types of first person shooters, enjoy Cell Shaded graphics, or who are fans of the first game.~Written: Feb, 2012Positives:* Awesome executions* Great Cell-Shaded graphics* Crazy story* Four person co-op* Fun songs to kill things toNegatives:* Really short single, and co-op campaign* Four co-op missions that have a \"press this button with two people\" barrierAchievements/Trophies:This game is really easy to obtain a platinum/100% on. You can replay the game on New Game+ for the Don difficulty, which makes it a joke to beat and not hard at all. Along with that, since you eat hearts for health, you can breeze right through it. Only hard on is getting one other person for four hit man missions (won't allow you to solo it due to having a door on each of them that requires two people hitting a button).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2012"}

Excercise more and diet properly.  That is always easier to say and to actually do it.  Our lives are full of committements.  Usually exercise is the last thing we want to commit to because we neither have the time (3 kids) nor the expense (no gym).So we stumbled upon this game at Microsoft Store and it was on sale for cheap.  We snapped it up with some hesitation because it is Kinect after all.  We were thinking of how good this going to be.We tried a few sessions and a few games and surprisingly loving it.  It is divided into several sections and you can tailor to how intense you want to work out.  If you are new and never actually been active working out, starting from beginning is best.  The core exercise provides some basics and some tutorials on what to expect.  I've seen a review that negatively think there are no tutorials, which I adamantly disagree.  Before the session starts, the trainer provides a brief step of the routine.  Any adults with proper mobility will have no trouble following it.Once you have all the basics on the targetted areas, go for the intense boot camp or the \"own it\" boxing.  After a few sessions you can feel your heart pumping and your sweat starts pouring.  Finally end your session either with some hip-hop or Yoga.  After you done all the routines, go back to each one and try to nail 100% achievement.I intend to do a video of the game on my YouTube channel soon.  Keep an evey for user name: EasyLife8888.This is the best Kinect game I've every bought.  For the price of the game console and the game, you can have your own personal trainer right in your own living room.Finally, if my wife gives the stamp of approval, you know it is good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXVK8","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Lethal","summary":"very impressive HD update","reviewText":"I don't own a PSP, so this was my chance to finally see these two titles.  I played them on my 65\" Sharp Aquos LCD HDTV, and both games look like they were made for PS3.  In fact both look superior to the God of War Collection despite those having been PS2 games.  The sound is also nearly as good as GOW3.I have now played every game in the series, and these titles stack up well.  They are lacking in truly epic boss battles, which is understandable since the main story was saved for the console releases.  Still, what's here is solid, and also very familiar.  You have the obligatory moment of Kratos on a ship, treasure chests hidden in the foreground, an occasional cheap death via some trap that only seems to exist to aggravate you, unwelcome beam walking (thankfully held to a minimum), and of course the absence of all your previously earned weapons and life/magic meter extensions to start every game.  In the case of Ghost of Sparta, they don't even contrive a way to power you down.  You are a god, yet weak enough to be killed by standard enemies.  I just find it absurd that in the entire series I never felt like I wielded the power of the god of war.  Remember when Ares wiped out an entire barbarian army at will?  Why can't Kratos do that?  At least Ghost of Sparta offers the option to use the Arms of Sparta, a spear and shield that I enjoyed using as Kratos' main weapons to break up the monotony of his chain blades, which have never felt powerful to me.In conclusion, this series has gotten quite stale over the course of five games, but this release is well worth your time if you enjoyed the others.  When you play GOW you know what you're going to get, and in that sense this delivers completely.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2012"}

StoryTheGod of Warfranchise tells the tragic and violent story of the warrior Kratos and his dealings with the gods. The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt. Olympus.God of War'sEpic Gameplay Comes to the PSPPlayStation Portable has always been head and shoulders above its competitors in the handheld market when it comes to processing power, and inGod of War: Chains of Olympusthe PSP platform may just have reached its highest level to date. Packed with features like dramatic camera angles, epic set pieces, cinematic cut scenes, stirring audio and seamless fast action gameplay, formerly only available on console platformsChains of Olympusbinds players to the game?s epic adventure, regardless where they are when they join in the action.Combat Moves, Both Old and NewNearly as defining as the name of Kratos itself, the trademark sweeping attack moves of the ?Ghost of Sparta? using his weapon of choice the ?Blades of Chaos,? epitomizes allGod of Wargames andChains of Olympusis no exception.Although overall the PSP has fewer buttons than the PlayStation 2 controller, developer Ready at Dawn Studios has managed to incorporate nearly all of the attack moves and combination moves from previous games in the series into this new project. This continuity in gameplay not only provides a seamless intro into the game for veteran players, but a gentle learning curve for players new to the series. Add to this new brutal combat moves and an additional upgradable weapon and you have a combat system that will engage players at all levels.Exploration and Puzzle SolvingFrom the bright gates of Attica to the darkest dungeons of Tartarus, Kratos? journey and your own will take you through the dark and brutal world of Greek mythology. Here not only will your skill with the Blades of Chaos be tested, but your wits as well.As you explore the dangers of the ancient world, players must be prepared to use their navigational skills as they press on through labyrinths of challenging puzzles. Some may be simple tests at manipulating the game?s environment to your advantage, while others much more difficult also requiring precision timing of moves, but each will be different and test you in new ways.An Evolution in Franchise HistoryMore than just a missing piece in the history of theGod of Warfranchise,Chains of Olympusalso serves as an evolutionary link between the origins of theGod of Warfranchise and its future. Originally developed for PlayStation 2, the future of the franchise is slated to make its arrival on PlayStation 3 in the form of the highly anticipatedGod of War IIIin the not too distant future. Not only is PlayStation Portable designed to work in unison with PlayStation 3 in many ways, but both long-time fans and newcomers to the series who choose to watch and playChains of Olympuscarefully may very well pick up clues as to the direction the franchise will be heading in withGod of War III.Regardless, whether you find yourself playing for the current chapter in Kratos? saga or preparing yourself for the battles to come on the PlayStation 3,God of War: Chains of Olympusis a must have title for any current owner of a PSP or those considering getting in the handheld game with one.","reviewerName":"Greg Sword \"DETfaninATL\"","summary":"A Stripped-Down Version Of GOD OF WAR, But Fun All The Same","reviewText":"I don't often play games on my PSP as I just don't have the time or need to do so, however, every now and then, the need and time will arise, and it's always nice to have a great game to play when they do. This game however, `GOD OF WAR : Chains Of Olympus', is the very reason I sought out a PSP in the first place. As anyone who has seen my profile,  games  list, or read my reviews on the console GOW games knows, I am an absolutely rabid GOW fan. With that in mind, let's talk about .....THE GOOD : There's plenty of it. Everything that there is to like about Kratos and his venomous rage on the Playstation consoles is here to like on the PSP, albeit in a smaller and shorter format. The developers, in adding some new elements to Kratos' story, didn't tamper much with the tried and true formula of the previous games. The same buttons still execute the same moves and combos, there's still magic to use, the bosses are either large or present a formidable challenge or both, the monsters (and buttons) are fun to mash, the puzzles still exist, the treasures and challenges of the Gods are back, the scenery is still captivating as are the graphics, there's still plenty to explore and discover, the same methods exist to level up, and yes, even the sex mini game makes it to the PSP. But while this sounds like a straight rehash of the console games (and to be fair, it is to an extent), what keeps it fresh are the new settings, villains & creatures and some new magic and weapons. Of these new weapons, and keeping in mind that this game came out well before GOW 3, Zeus' Gauntlet is a fun precursor to the Nemean Cestus in GOW 3 and helps translate some of that fun to the PSP, in arrears if you haven't played this prior to GOW 3. Because let's face it - there's nothing quite like brutally pounding and smashing an enemy to a pulp with what equates to a brass knuckle for your entire fist and forearm! Some of the new magic in your arsenal is also fun to play with too, though it plays like a variation of some of the other magic you've seen before or will again. Regardless, it doesn't take away from the fun.  While this isn't a `playable' aspect of the game some of the fun is had in what the narrative fills in with regards to Kratos' overall story arc. Not meaning to keep referencing GOW 3, but after playing GOW : COO, it becomes clearer why Hades hates Kratos so much and why Cronos feels the same. After all, we all saw Cronos in the first GOW and he was indifferent if anything to Kratos in that installment. I've never been one to pay much attention to the story in a videogame, because, let's face it, I'm not playing for the narrative, but this is one of the few examples that I can think of that I found that enhanced the overall experience. Speaking of enhancements, this game seems to set the bar on graphics for the PSP. It's undoubtedly one of the best looking overall games I've seen on the PSP. Though, admittedly, I don't play a ton of PSP-based games, I do look at a lot of screenshots, and check out the video reviews whenever possible. So taking all of what I've just mentioned into consideration, the GOW experience translates very well to the PSP. For the most part....THE BAD :  Not a whole heck of a lot to be honest.  But while GOW : COO is one of the best action adventure games for the PSP (if not THE best), it's not without its' flaws (nothing really is, is it?).  For starters, the game is pretty short. The average player should be able to get through this in about 5-6 hours. The levels are also simple, linear and can be pretty straightforward. To someone who craves a full-on GOW experience, this can be a little disappointing. And unfortunately, some of what makes this game so successful, also works against it. That being that, since much of the same gameplay, methodology, mechanics and abilities holdover from the console games, it can feel a little like a bite-sized version of the same sweet candy bar you're used to eating when you have a craving for it : it has the same flavor and hits the spot, but doesn't totally fill the hole. Think of it as GOW : Lite. To an extent, this is understandable, as you can't expect everything and then some going from a console game to a handheld, but at the same time, I did expect a little more. Or at least more that was different.  It was nice to have a new weapon to use and a new magic or two, but why not more than one new weapon or the limited number of new magics they gave you?  It would seem to me that this was a great opportunity to branch out a little on the series without going too far, but at the same time, add more new elements to it to really make this a `new title' instead of just a `new chapter'.  All in all though, my complaints are minimal and few, because this is really a fantastic game when you get right down to it.THE BOTTOM LINE : Having played this game about 2-3 times now, I can honestly say that in retrospect, I guess the majority of criticisms I have with the game are because of what it naturally compares to - the console versions of the series. On its' own, this is a near-flawless game for the platform it's on. It really is. If you want a great, top-of-the-line game for your PSP, you'd be hard pressed to find a better on than this. `GOD OF WAR : Chains Of Olympus' sets the bar pretty high for Action / Adventure on the PSP. Will `GOD OF WAR : Ghost Of Sparta' be able to top it?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2010"}

The culprit? Mega Man's brother, Proto Man. But why has he turned evil? Actually, you soon find out that it's an elaborate [plan] to frame the horribly underrated \"older\" brother of the blue bomber, and so here begins my review of Mega Man's fifth adventure on the NES.THE GOODThe storyline is actually among the best in the series and it allows a refreshing change to the normal \"Dr. Wily's at it again, let's get him!\" storyline. Proto Man actually has a substantial role in the plot and I believe him to be a very underused character (Capcom, MAKE HIM HIS OWN GAME.). Beat is also introduced in this game and he's quite useful. This game is the only game that allows him to attack bosses (and makes Wily at the end seem like a walk in the park!). The game is thankfully a bit more difficult than 2,3, and 4 with the evil \"Darkman\" stages. The graphics are also better and the backgrounds even have parallax to them.THE BADThis game has a more powerful \"Mega Buster,\" but every time you get hit, you have to start the charge over again. This wasn't that huge of a deal, but I wish they would've kept it more like MM4's Mega Buster. Also, the music is mostly mediocre with only a handful of tunes that are really memorable.OVERALLWhile not a bad game, I find it hard to rank it above the first four games. It doesn't -quite- touch the first four in terms of charm and the good, old fashioned \"Mega Man feel.\" I really can't explain it, and perhaps if it had better music, it would've been better. The game doesn't connect well with the others at all, which is quite a shame. My feelings on this game are very mixed, but I still recommend at least playing it through. It is, after all, essential to your Mega Man library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2003"}

I had not used it since the update which added dolly cams to the the mode, and all I can say about that is...WOW.  Theater mode is absolutely amazing.  It is a complete blast to work with and can provide hours of entertainment creating epic movie quality clips.  The only downside is that exporting the videos to a PC for storage (as only 6 slots are provided online) is nearly impossible.  However, I give great credit to Treyarch for this inclusion and I hope it finds its way into MW3.I am also quite glad (even though I predicted it before even the first map pack came out) that Treyarch has decided to cash in by offering the original World at War zombies maps as DLC for players who did not purchase the Hardened or Prestige editions of the game.  I had been planning to pay the price of a NEW GAME to buy the redeem code on eBay, where people were shamelessly selling it for a highly elevated price, but now I can get all of the maps AND a brand new one for a mere $15.I admit it, this is the only FPS that I ever play these days.  I love multiplayer and I love the zombies mode.  I don't love the frequent glitches and sketchy issues with hit detection, stab connection, longshot accuracy, and lag, but I do enjoy the experience as a whole.  However, the single player campaign is still BAD.  Please, Treyarch, fix this in the next installment in which you participate.ORIGINAL REVIEW:My experience with the CoD franchise began with Modern Warfare.  I have neither played nor heavily researched the older titles, so I can't really say what the original \"premise\" of CoD was.  Regardless, I believe that with new consoles and technology available, game franchises should evolve over time and include new features.  On the one hand, a complete shift in focus is not ideal (to use the example of a racing game, if Need for Speed, an arcade racer, suddenly released a full-blown simulator like Gran Turismo, that would be misguided and ill-received), but development to generate new interest and take advantage of new technologies should be a given.Call of Duty:  Black Ops has made some improvements over its predecessors, but not enough, and has even regressed in a few areas.  Rather than releasing a new game every year, perhaps Activision should \"slow their roll,\" so to speak, and develop a title free of bugs and horrible features that anger people and inspire ranting reviews such as several here at Amazon.com.  In addition, those who say \"there was nothing wrong with the original [insert game title here]\" can feel free to go play the original title.  Why limit the development of new games just because a dated title for an older console was good when it came out?Now, the game.Treyarch really made some great advances in the area of \"sharing the experience.\"  The biggest thing I can point to right away is the ability to play split-screen online.  My roommate and I enjoyed this opportunity to hit up the multiplayer portion of the game as a team.  Additionally, the new \"Combat Training\" mode offers either a crazy challenge on \"Veteran\" or a laughably easy Chuck Norris style massacre on \"Recruit,\" which again can be done split-screen.  Being able to play split-screen in private online matches is additionally a big plus because I can enjoy 2v2 deathmatches with my friend and his wife in another state.  I recently forgot that this was new to Black Ops and suggested we play the tiny MW2 map \"Rust\" in this fashion, only to realize that we could not.Multiplayer also has some great new features.  I'm a little divided on the \"purchase system\" which involves buying weapons and attachments with points earned during gameplay, rather than progressively unlocking these items, but I think it is a good working system.  Additions such as \"Second Chance Pro,\" which allows your teammates to revive you when you are downed, unique killstreak rewards (with no more annoying Tactical Nuke), and some enjoyable maps and environments make the experience fun and refreshed from prior installments.However, once you get past these good things, the game starts to fall apart.  First off, multiplayer is riddled with problems.  I won't say a word about the playing style of any gamer, because that is not a game flaw.  One of the biggest problems, though, is a sort of delay that affects one team or the other.  I often get instantly mowed down by someone after they pop out of cover, only to watch a killcam in which they take their sweet time aiming and shooting at me after moving from cover...as though I was offered a 1 second delay on my end of things.  I'm sure the same often happens to my opponents as well, explaining why they fail to shoot at me during games in which I am doing well.Another multiplayer problem is hit detection.  I have, on a number of occasions, unloaded on someone at point blank range, only to see the killcam (after they seem to drop me in one shot) indicating no hits on them.  These are fundamental problems that really need to be addressed by the game developers.Some people may claim that CoD IS multiplayer, and that single player modes are not even necessary.  I disagree.  The storyline in Modern Warfare was amazing, and a true joy to play through.  MW2 was a little less enjoyable, but still a good play.  I don't remember WaW very well because I played the other two again more recently, but it seemed pretty good as I recall.  Black Ops, however, has a terrible campaign.  Cut scenes and voice acting are good, as other reviewers have said, but first off the premise of the campaign is a terrible plot concept (a supposedly highly skilled soldier imagines the perpetual existence of a deceased Russian to the extent that this phantom man actually accomplishes tasks and kills enemies for him?).Second, realism completely failed.  Prior installments of CoD made references to \"careful development with soldiers and historians\" to ensure an accurate, period-correct experience.  Not the case with BO...about 50% of the available weapons in the game had not even been developed by the year in which the game is set.  A classic example is the SPAS-12 shotgun, which debuted in 1979.  The player is given one to use in the game's 1969.  A 10 year continuity error is not a \"minor discrepancy.\"Third, the AI is complete garbage.  Several other reviews address this issue, but the campaign eventually becomes boring and frustrating because your scripted teammates are worthless, the enemies are unreasonably good, single you out, and spawn infinitely on veteran, and there is really only ONE way to progress through the level, with extensive use of the \"trip-wire\" effect which basically involves plot advancing or enemies spawning when you reach a certain, invisible \"magic spot\" on the map.An unexpected boon to the game, however, is the revamped zombies mode.  I loved Nazi Zombies in World at War, and the fact that zombies returned in Black Ops was about 50% of my reason for buying the game (several months after its release, however...I am not THAT obsessed).  The first new map, Kino der Toten, is a brilliant design which, despite the recent DLC, is still the best map in my opinion.  New weapons (including an M1911 that actually sounds like a .45 pistol and not a pea shooter), new dialogue (though still annoyingly repetitive), and features such as useful Quick Revive on solo mode make the new zombies fresh and enjoyable.  However, even this unique game mode is not free of flaws.  Double-hitting zombies, ridiculous zombie strength in higher rounds, and various glitches make the mode sometimes infuriating.  In addition, the new DLC is frustrating and proves even more difficult, while hardly offering any bonuses to compensate for that fact.  Regardless of these annoyances, I still love playing zombies online with my friends, and at the time of this writing I have high hopes for the fourth and final DLC map.In summary, Black Ops debuted some new and enjoyable features but unfortunately was a letdown with a lousy campaign and some glitches that really should be ironed out by now.  I would recommend the game if you are a big fan of the CoD multiplayer experience and/or Zombies game mode, but if you are looking for a great single player storyline, don't even bother.  The weird story, interrupted constantly by dozens of cutscenes and riddled with historical flaws and atrocious AI, is not worth $60.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2011"}
