I bought this game several Days ago. I saw it on the shelf and it sorta jumped out. I picked it up and read the blurbs, and decided to give it a try, based on two things: Bioware and Atari. After having played through Neverwinter Nights several times, I got kinda excited and as it turns out, for good reason. I am happily trucking along and having a blast playing this. You can really lose yourself in this. Yes, the load times are a little agravating when leaving a building or cave, as you want to get on with it. I quickly learned to just tolerate it. The graphics are really good, lots of detail. Unfortunately, this game has either gotten very little notice or I have missed it. As i said, I just accidentally ran across it on the shelf at the store, and I wasn't even looking to buy any games. I gave it 4 stars for fun based on the agravating load times, otherwise it would have been 5 stars across the board. Charlie S. Richmond Va.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2007"}

I have read some reviews complaining about some of the same stuff, including the storage space needed, the glitches, the problems in multiplayer, and a poor campaign. I have to disagree about the campaign, at least for the beginning of it. It starts off really well and has a good plot, but the ending is a bit of a disappointment. I was upset by how short it was; only took about 5 hours on the hardest level. Guns in this game are very realistic, and that is a big plus for battlefield. While there is some war in the sea, there is none in the air. I was hoping to drive a helicopter or jet, but no missions had it. The big problem with the campaign were all these glitches. Your character can stay in stealth if you are hiding in certain areas, but your squad will go out in the middle of everything talking like they are at a concert without getting detected. The graphics will also get a little glitchy, probably because the game is optimized for Xbox One and PS4. The multiplayer on the other hand is SUPERB! Graphics, sound, maps, FUN!!! I have been playing online for quite a while now (about 7 hours) and I think it is even better than BF3, and definitely better than MW3 (Notice I did not say Call of Duty Ghosts considering I have not played it yet). Driving the vehicles takes a little getting use to, but after a few hours you will get used it just like any game. There are new game modes and also an option to be commander of the team which gives you cool abilities like assigning jobs to players and sending in airstrikes. The multiplayer has really gotten improved. Everything is destructible, except for rocks, which makes the game very action packed. Overall, the multiplayer is addictive just how BF3 was.Should you buy this game? Make sure you have at least 5GB free space (Just to be on the safe side), and you got to love big warfare with vehicles and realistic shooting (makes it harder than COD). Don't blatantly buy this game not knowing what you are getting and then trash talking it in a review. Hope you take this review into consideration, enjoy playing BF4!!!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2013"}

I was a force to be reckoned with...at least for the first level. I made my way through all those bogeys with ease, and then I was given the order to land. Beads of sweat rolled down my face, a lump grew in my throat...and you can bet a steak dinner I nose dived my multi-million dollar F-14 into the carrier, again and again. Sure it may be a fossil of a game by now but I always had to applaud it for adding that extra depth of realism by requiring landings, even though I sucked at it.I must admit I never got a chance to try the very popular Ace Combat 2; I instead tried the obsolete Air Combat that was bad enough to make me hold back from trying other flight games for Playstation. So when Ace Combat 3 made its way into a used CD store, it didn't take long to find its way it Jobe's sticky fingers. After playing through it now, three times, trying out all of the ships and other modes I can say without a doubt in my mind, this is the best dog fighting game I've ever played. Playing this one makes all others seem like toys in a discount rack, Ace combat 4 is like a dream, this game can't be real.Instead of shoving \"no chance in hell levels\" and monstrous mechanical enemies like Air Force Delta, down players throats to try and make an electrifying game during every second. Ace Combat 4 sticks to what it's really about, dog fighting. Sure there are multiple air-to-ground levels, but when you're not putting towers or satellite dishes in your sights, you're probably cranking your plane as sharp as it can turn to avoid one of a missile on your six.Flight combat here is, no joke, just as it should be. You take two hits, maybe even one perfect one and its curtains. Just like in real-life piloting, half of your time is going to be dodging missiles from bogeys, who will stick on you like a bum on a bologna sandwich. No enemy can be deemed irrelevant here, it's when you pass that missed SAM site that you'll have immediate missile lock, so kiss targeting any other enemies goodbye, because  you're times going to be spent pulling G-Force blackouts to avoid missiles. Over the course of 18 missions you'll also encounter an elite group of fighters called \"Yellow Squadron\", and going up against these pilots manages to create a tense heat as you fight for a perfect missile lock while avoiding a Yellow already on your tail.Another point I have to bring into view is the storyline, granted there are no CGI's or movie clips between missions. Instead the story is told through still hand drawn pictures, and is so well written that it makes even some of the RPG's stories look like Creative Writing in Kindergarten. Ace Combat 4's story isn't a crazed general hell-bent on world domination, but in fact a superbly written narrative about the recollections of a young boy during a war who befriends an enigmatic pilot \"Yellow 13\" who strives during the war to find a worthy opponent, and you are that opponent he speaks of during the storyboards. The war is between the Eursian's and the Allies who fight over a devious weapon originally designed to shoot down meteors falling to earth called \"Stone Hedge\"The story not only is a huge and creative departure from your everyday gaming stories, but also adds in a smart commentary on trials and tribulations of those involved in war as well. It also doesn't hurt that the opening moments of the final level is one of the greatest cinema scenes in gaming history, I won't spoil it, but coming from a movie reviewer for over 5 years I can say it even rivals the silver screens moments.Ace Combat 4 is one by far this year's biggest sleeper hit. I had no idea of what to expect when I purchased it, and what I found was a dog fighting paradise. Flight simulator fan or not, I still recommend this one highly to all PS2 owners, after playing through it 5 times and already on my sixth I still can't find anything bad about this game, and believe me that truly means that this game is something special. One of 2001's 10 best games, another must have title, right alongside Metal Gear Solid 2 and Grand Theft Auto 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2002"}

The &quot;Director&quot; has chosen you to be the star of his very own movie, and you are tossed into Carcer City, a run down, abandoned town, populated by gangs the &quot;Director&quot; has assigned to hunt you down.  Think of it as a reality televison show where you are the only target of a number of gangs who will stop at nothing to kill you, and you must either kill them, or die.Your only weapons in the beginnig of the game are small weapons that can only be used in arm's distnace from the enemy.  Plastic bags, shards of glass, baseball bats, etc.  To kill an enemy it  is best to perform a 'stealth kill' - that is, to sneak up behind one without alerting them of your presence, and holding down the attack button with a desired weapon selected.  There are three leveles of stealth kills, and the longer you hold down the attack button, the more gruesome the murder.  But of course, waiting longer is riskier, as an enemy could turn around without warning, or you could accidentally tread over a noisy surface in the process.  Anyway, when the stealth kill is performed, the player is 'rewarded' with a short cinematic of the kill, taken from various cameras the &quot;Director&quot; has set up around the city.  And these cinematics feature some of the most violent, bloody, and disturbing images ever to be seen in a videogame.Still, as a stealth action title, Manhunt is great.  The atmosphere is ridiculously intense.  The game looks very similar to Grand Theft Auto, and plays a bit similarly too, but the visuals are ulra-realistic, compared to the cartoony worlds of the GTA series.  Hiding from gangs who truly look and speak like they want to tear you apart is actually almost frightening.  Hiding in the shadows, the enemies won't see you, but they will search for you, and they might just walk by you, missing you by inches.  When they get frustrated gang members will scream at you into the shadows, taunting you, and telling you to get out into the open.  They'll search for you in groups, and finding a good hiding spot will get difficult.And when the guns finally show up, Cash learns some new moves, like the ability to jump out from behind cover to fire off a few shots, and then duck back down to safety.All in all, the game looks good, controls terrifically, and offers one of the most intense videogame experiences ever.  I recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2004"}

He wakes up on an island after found by the inhabitants, and immediately sets out to find the phantom ship and save Tetra. The story has some memorable new characters in it, such as the fairy Ciela (who serves mainly as your cursor) and the cowardly but boastful ship's captain, Linebeck.The gameplay on this system is dependent entirely on the touch screen and, occasionally, the microphone. The directional pad and buttons have no effect whatsoever; everything from running (tap or hold where you want to go) to fighting (slash the stylus in the direction you want to go) to using items is done with the stylus. This undoes one of the main problems of the stylus in other games, namely switching from using buttons to using the touch screen. The microphone also comes into play at some points - either by blowing on it to put out a candle or by yelling into it to call out to someone on the other side of a door.Like Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass involves sea exploration, but since the new ship in this is a paddle ship (as opposed to the sailing ship from Wind Waker) all that is required is to draw a line on your sea chart to your destination. Speaking of maps, it is possible to write down notes on your map (normally relegated to the top screen, but can be \"pulled\" down to the touch screen); this is necessary in some points to get through areas by copying down safe routes through a trap-laden area or to mark where a particular treasure is. The options are diverse but simple, and an average player should be able to get the hang of the system pretty quickly. The only problem I had with control was that rolling (by making small circles on the edge of your screen) was difficult and got confused with regular movement.The graphics are a pretty good rendering of Wind Waker's graphical style, with only a slight decrease in smoothness to accommodate the DS's graphical limitations. The cel-shaded style remains intact and it is a pretty good job overall. The sound is about the same as it was in Wind Waker, with limited voice acting (Link's cries, specifically).As a whole, this game is a good sequel to Wind Waker. I admit that I was wary of the stylus' potential after playing previous DS games with clunkier interfaces, but the gameplay is both smooth and innovative. As a whole, it's a remarkably good product.9/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}

While the 3D graphics look horrendous, it's interesting to see how it worked back in the 16-bit era. In some ways I like the level designs better than Starfox 64's because they feel more creative and more interesting. For example, one part of the game is like a space version of the ocean with whales, stingrays, and more sea creatures in this interesting environment. I like how the villain Andross is designed as well, in fact it's kinda creepy(And he's a fighter in the upcoming Super Smash Brothers Brawl). The missions are still exciting and wierd to this day and it is a very rewarding experience. Though time has done some damage to this game it doesn't feel very worn.

This is unfortunate because the game has a lot to offer in that one-time through, and I would have enjoyed playing with a new class. Alas, it was intolerable the second time.

Ever since Grand Theft Auto 3, open world crime games have become very popular with games like Saints Row and, the other side of the law, LA Noire. Sleeping Dogs seems very similar on the surface but there is a lot more going on here than just a crime game set in China. The game was originally supposed to be the third installment to the True Crime series and was going to be under the title True Crime: Hong Kong but after going over budget, Activision dropped the game. However, it was picked up by Square Enix and released under the name Sleeping Dogs. Now I personally had heard nothing about this game till the day before it came out and people were already singing praise for this game so I thought I'd check it out. After playing it, Sleeping Dogs is sure to be considered a sleeper hit of 2012.STORY (No-Spoilers):  You play as Wei Shen, a Chinese-American undercover cop assigned with the massive task of infiltrating the Sun On Yee, gaining their thrust, and taking down major members of the Triad (blanket term for Chinese mafia). Wei starts out as a foot soldier for one of the smaller crimes bosses but gradually gets noticed for his work in the gang and moves up throughout the game. However, Wei walks a fine line between being a cop and the life of a gangster and the conflicting loyalties do take a toll on him mentally and physically. This leads to some really intense cut scenes, missions, and plot points. The shit hits the fan multiple times throughout the main campaign and will have you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. An excellent story that had me engrossed throughout and the last 30 minutes of the game are epic. In addition to the main story, there are police cases you help out with and tons of side missions, street races, and other activities to do between major missions. There are also some pretty funny missions in the game like one where you break into a very superstitious crime boss's house, break and rearrange some of his things to make him think his place is haunted. Another mission includes driving around your boss's fianc&eacute; to prepare for her wedding with some silly mishaps happening along the way and ends with you sneaking into a Buddhist temple dressed as a monk to steal a rare flower. Another important aspect of the game that helps engross you in the story is the setting. The city of Hong Kong genuinely feels alive and bustling with traffic and people out and about 24/7. Walking around in markets having venders yelling to you to buy their black market goods adds to the immersive feeling of this game and plays greatly into the gameplay.GAMEPLAY: The biggest gameplay elements that set this game apart from games like Grand Thief Auto and Saints Row is the combat system. Rarely will you find yourself running around town carrying a gun, most of the gun play parts happen during major missions. You instead use your martial art skills to handle Triad thugs most of the time. Not only do you kick their asses with marital art moves, you also can use various objects in the environment to take out your enemies such as grabbing them and throwing them head first into a first into a fan, throwing them into the engine block of a car and then dropping the hoisted engine on top of them, and my personal favorite, impaling someone on a pallet of sword-fish heads. You can also counter similar to the Batman Arkham games. You learn more moves throughout the game as you find Jade Statues for your martial arts instructor. Return them to him to unlock new moves. The combat system does take some getting used to and awhile to master, there will be fights that are easy to lose if you are not on the ball. One issue I had was when an enemy blinks red to indicate they are about to strike and you should counter; there is no way to really stop them unless you counter. If you hit them before they strike, it will not hurt them and they will harm you. It would make more sense for them to react to the strikes. There are also sometimes QTEs during some of these fights and most of the time I messed them up because I wasn't expecting them they are fairly rare though and don't bog down the combat in anyway.Driving is a huge aspect in these types of games and there will be plenty of driving with various types of cars, motorcycles, and boats. The vehicles generally handle well but I still find myself crashing into things all the time. This isn't exactly the games fault; I have this exact same problem with similar games. I just suck at driving in these games. Car chases can be fun as you can ram enemy vehicles, sometimes shoot at them, and jump onto another car and hi-jack them. The car chases can be very easy to mess up, however, and I had to restart several because the enemy car got away for one reason or another. The biggest issue was trying to find them when you don't have line of sight on them. The GPS interface doesn't do much help in these cases and the GPS can be an issue in other cases. The route it gives you is not exactly the shortest and can take a moment to give you a new route if you miss a turn or something, requiring you to back up which leads to another problem: the camera while backing up. When you are backing up the camera turns to show what is behind the car, completely making it impossible to see what is in front of you. The only way to turn the camera around is to blindly drive forward. Turning the camera manually is not very responsive and moves too slowly. It can be very frustrating; especially in situations where time is a factor. But once again, these are similar problems that I have in similar types of games though so there isn't much improvement at all in this game.Another aspect that makes Sleeping Dogs more unique in these types of crime games is the RPG like experience system. You get Police, Triad, and Face XP for completing missions and how well you complete them determines how much XP you get. You gain police XP for performing police skills well during a mission and avoiding damaging public property and keeping innocents from being harmed. You gain Triad XP for how well you do in fights and in shoot outs. As you level up your police and Triad skills, you will be able to unlock new moves, skills, and abilities. Face XP comes from doing various side missions. Face is like your reputation. The more Face you have, the more you can wear fancy clothes; intimidate lower thugs, and how fast you regain health. Your health bar is something you'll want to keep your eye on obviously. You can regain some health automatically in fights but that's only if you keep your face bar up by mixing up your fighting styles. Eating food also regains health and can give you temporary health boosts and attack boosts so there is more reason to eat other than just heal. There are a lot of clothing stores you can find to buy clothes and street vendors you can find who can help you pimp out the apartments you have around the city. You can also buy your own cars and store them in parking garages around the city as well. Another gameplay element is hacking and surveillance. You can hack cameras around the city and view them from your apartments. You use these to make drug busts and gain more police XP.(Protip: Start off hacks by entering 0123 first and go from there.) Planting and calibrating surveillance bugs are fun while not introduced in the best away. The first time you have to do this, you have a time limit and it's not really explained well how you calibrated. Worst is following that is picking a lock which is not well explained and you have a short time limit on top of that. While not perfect, the gameplay of Sleeping Dogs helps it stand out from other games in the genre while keeping intact some staples of the genre that could use improvement.GRAPHICS: Visually Sleeping Dogs is very sleek but gritty at the same time. The game looks the best during the night time with all the neon lights of Hong Kong shining. The graphics, naturally, look amazing on PC and if you play this on PC, you will be in for a visual treat. There is a lot of detail to characters to their facial features, tattoos, clothes, and hair. One thing I noticed is that the many businesses that line the streets of Hong Kong are there just to look at and not interact with. Some of them literally look like a picture of the inside of a store hung behind glass. It made me laugh actually but it would have been nice to see more interaction with these buildings. Another missed opportunity is in the character's facial expressions. They are not the worst I've ever seen but come off a little stiff at times. This game could have benefited a lot from the facial animation technology used in games like LA Noire and Black Ops. But overall, it looks really good and is fitting for the setting of the game.SOUND: This game has some amazing voice acting that adds to the drama of the story. There are a lot of Chinese-American actors who make up much of the cast from Will Yun Lee as Wei to Lucy Liu, Tom Wilkinson,  James Hong, Emma Stone, Kelly Hu, Edison Chen to name a few. You might want to turn on the Cantonese subtitles on at the beginning of the game as there is quite a bit of Chinese thrown into the dialogue throughout the game.  Most of the music you will hear comes from car radios as you drive around and there is a very good variety to listen to from traditional Chinese music, Chinese and American hip-hop, rock, pop, and metal as well as radio commercials in both English and Chinese. This game really pleased in the auditory department.Overall if you like open world GTA like games, I highly recommend checking this game out. If you're a fan of crime drams, it's still a lot of fun to play and explore with an excellent story to play through. It does have its moments that are frustrating and at times unbalanced but nothing that is impossible to overcome. I love the immersive feel and culture of the game.  Remember to eat lots of pork buns.OVERALL: 7/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}

Splinter Cell 1, and 3 were the best games in the series (story wise), with this coming in at 3rd best in my opinion.  The co-op story is also a nice addition to the game.Graphics:  5/5  Just what you'd come to expect from a Splinter Cell game.  I actually like that it goes black and white while you are hidden from the enemies, but this eliminates the need for night vision, which might put fans of the series off a bit.Gameplay:  4/5  This is where the game hugely differs from previous games.  The gameplay is a lot more action based, with the ability to \"mark and excecute\" enemies.  This only happens once you've done a close up kill.  So you can't just run in and mark and excecute everyone.  You have to earn it.  Other mechanics that have been changed are how you interact with everything.  There are little texts by each object you can interact with, which probably is to make it easier for people new to the series to know what they can and cannot interact with.  Veterans know that pipes can be climbed, walls can be ran up, ect.  Some people may hate the changes.  Others, mainly new to the series, may welcome it.Game modes:  5/5 While the single player is fun, the co-op is where you are going to spend most of your time.  There are many different co-op modes including a story, a \"horde\" type mode where you have to defend an object for wave after wave.  As well as a hunter mode where you go though a level, eliminating enemies, and cannot be seen at all.Overall I would recommend this game to any Splinter Cell fan, or action game fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005BW7Q","reviewerName":"josak","summary":"|2.5| It has an interesting story, but that's basically it","reviewText":"Xenosaga is not a true RPG, nor is pretty much any console game out there. Saga to me, however, doesn't really even qualify as a game, considering you do roughly half as much watching as you do playing, which is extrememly ridiculous. Believe me, I have patience, but when it comes to watching dozens of 30-45 minute cutscenes, you can count me out.If Xenosaga is to get credit, it is for it's plotline. While it is interesting and thought provoking, it also doesn't bother to explain ANYTHING. Yes, this is Episode 1 of a 6 part series, but who cares; this is a game, it has a 50 dollar price tag, and I damn sure don't want to pay that much for a game that pretty much rips you off.On one hand, the cutscenes are well made, almost on the lines of MGS2. On the other hand, the first half of the game features mostly extrememly tedious and boring cutscenes. It is only in the next half of the game where things get interesting, but a lot of people will stop forcing themselves to play by then. Yes I said 'forcing', because the gameplay is utterly BORINGG.If theres one word that I would use to describe Saga's gameplay, its LINEARITY. Stick with me here: you watch a 45 minute cutscene, you run down a hall, take a few turns, fight some random battles, watch another cutscene, run down a hall, fight some battles, watch another cutscene, play through a long, tedious dungeon, watch another cutscene. You get the picture now? You see, the problem here is, the gameplay and story feel completely seperate. Its almost as if your watching an anime movie, except there are a few playable parts. The big problem is that the few playable parts are extrememly boring. Sure, the battle system isn't that bad by any means, but by the 20th battle, you'll be wondering why the hell your even playing.And that's what I asked myself while playing the game: why the hell am I forcing myself to go on? Just so I can watch another 45 minute cutscene? From what I remember, games are suppost to be 'played', and are suppost to be 'fun'. Xenosaga is not an RPG. You want a 'real' rpg? Play Morrowind or Neverwinter Nights on multiplayer. Don't get me wrong here, Saga isn't a failure, it's just that the gameplay feels like a poor excuse to keep watching more cut scenes. I sure as hell am never going to play this game again. I am a huge Xenogears fanatic, and I really hope that Episode 2 doesn't turn out like this one. Xenosaga Ep1 is easily the biggest dissapointment for me in a long, long time, considering I have waited for this game for years. Thumbs down.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2003"}

Eventually, I found myself buying both that and this first addition to the BC spin-off. Both of them are simply put, FANTASTIC!This first addition to the BC spin-ff of BF came out in 2008, and now nearly six years later, seems quaint compared to BF3, and BF4. Despite that, BFBC 1 remains a game that even with age, I find myself frequently return especially for the multiplayer. Of all the video games I currently having on Xbox 360, this is one of the few games where the campaign and multiplayer shine with roughly equal strength.The campaign mode, while pretty much predictable in theme, finds a squad of four miscreants in the middle of a war between the forces of the United States and the Russian Federation's armies in a fictional kingdom called Sederistan and are sent on a suicide mission to retrieve a stash of stolen gold to bring to the U.S. The four are a squadron of soldiers who were deemed unfit for regular army units and form a team called 'Bad Company' and are believed to have only a single-digit chance of surviving their mission.'Bad Company' is comprised of four soldiers, all of them having near incompatible and/or conflicting personalities and they all dislike each other but share a common goal. They are Sergeant Redford, the leader and brains of the squad who is African-American, Terrence Sweetwater who is very intelligent but somewhat nervous, and George Gordon Haggard, a classic roughneck, trailer-trash pyromaniac and finally the protagonist, Preston Marlowe. All four of them hate each other's guts but must work together in order to survive their mission while serving as cannon-fodder against the Russian Army and Spetznaz agents.The campaign mode features big environments, and destructability that is unprecedented in the BF series. This works especially when destroying enemy hideous and smoking out enemy sniper units. The charachters, unlike BF3 or BF4, are simply entertaining to follow and their dialogue, particularly Haggard's reckless comic relief are greatly written and well-acted.The multiplayer mode of BFBC 1 is limited to only Gold Rush but even then, it is still a fun multiplayer game to play, even all of these years later. What makes this even more entertaining is when you're on the non-American side, you actually can listen to your faction's respective language, whether it's Russian or Arabic. It might be confusing for some but for me, it gives the multiplayer game a more real and natural feel especially when going after or defending the gold crates.The lag and awkwardness of the game engine does weigh the multiplayer a bit in my opinion but overall, after adjusting, it is still a game to have a great time with. The other drawback, although minor is that some of the awards for the multiplayer are impossible to get except through boosting.Overall though, &#34;Battlefield: Bad Company&#34; remains a staple in the Battlefield series and even with three entries in the franchise, this remains one of my favorite entries in the franchise and one I still play periodically.

In fact, this was the main reason that many people (including myself) ran out and bought a Super Nintendo. Because it was nearly arcade-perfect and only available for the SNES, it spelled the beginning of the end of Sega's console dominance (the Genesis was on top at the time). The eight fighters come from different parts of the world and have their own distinctive look and fighting style. Each has their own animated background stages and reamarkably good theme music. The basic gameplay and control scheme became a fighting game standard, copied by many other titles including Mortal Kombat. Harder kicks and punches do more damage, but are more difficult to land. With special attacks and the ability to block, the gameplay is remarkably deep. The game provides the ability to customize the control scheme, and it always annoyed me how each of my friends always had modify the settings before each bout. Some say this game is somewhat slow, but that was remedied in the sequels. Street Fighter 2 is one of the all-time classics, right up there with Pac-man and Space Invaders. It led to many sequels, each of which offered minor enhancements but no significant changes to the gameplay itself. You owe it to your self to buy this game if you have an SNES, you'll be glad you did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2003"}

In this seemingly utopian paradise, a crime has been committed and now you are being hunted. You are a Runner called Faith - and this innovative first-person action-adventure is your story.

With a never before seen sense of movement and perspective, you will be drawn into Faith&#x2019;s world. A world that is visceral, immediate, and very dangerous. Live or die? Soar or plummet? One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"A striking, original game let down by dull and inappropriate gunplay","reviewText":"In the future there is almost no crime. The City, a beautiful landscape of towering white buildings, is well-policed and life is pleasant. But this is only possible through a government which is totalitarian and repressive. There are those opposed to the way the City operates, from reformers working within the system (usually to no avail) to the Runners, free-running messengers and couriers working to unseat the regime. When an innocent cop is framed for the murder of a key reformer and the police declare war on the Runners, it falls to Faith Connors to fight the system and expose the truth.Mirror's Edge is an interesting game developed by DICE, the creators of the perennially popular Battlefield series. After many years of making manly games about guns and explosions, DICE decided to change tack with a game that mixes puzzles and parkour (though there are still a few guns and the occasional explosion). The game can be summed up as Portal by way of Prince of Persia, mixing the environmental puzzles of the former with the athleticism of the latter.The game's striking art aesthetic is the first thing that hits the player: the game strongly emphasises the colours white and red, sometimes glaringly so but mostly in a way that gives a feeling of high-tech isolation. The simple use of colour (the skies of the game are a particularly strong blue colour) gives the game a different feel to many other first-person games, which tend towards brown and grey. The high-tech feeling of the game also contrasts the dingy, gritty and dystopian feel of many other games. Playing Mirror's Edge is often a pleasure down to the sheer beauty of the art style.Faith is fairly athletic and can run, jump, wall-run and cling onto ledges. She can also do a reverse-jump off surfaces to reach more inaccessible areas. Though played from the first person, Faith's arms and legs can be seen at all times, giving the player a strong sense of physical presence in the game. There is also a vivid sense of momentum and speed, with Faith needing to build up a fairly strong head of steam if she wants to clear a particularly large jump. The rooftop sequences are great, if occasionally a little too hamstrung by there being just one or sometimes two routes to your destination rather than being fully-open playgrounds. Combat is also satisfyingly physical: Faith can do flying kicks, punches and disarming manoeuvres (which also work as takedowns).Gunplay is much more insipid. The developers seem to have included it very reluctantly out of a sense of realism: if Faith can disarm someone, why can't she just pick up the gun and use it? The problem is that gunplay, shooting at people across the large levels, feels like it goes against the ethos of the game. Some sort of character or plot-based reason why Faith refuses/cannot use firearms could have been introduced and led to be a more interesting game. As it stands, those moments when the game screeches to a halt as Faith has to shoot her way out of a lobby packed with bad guys feel like admissions of failure.The game is at its best when Faith is running across rooftoops, jumping gaps, shimmying up the side of drainpipes, crashing through offices and out of the other side. These moments are frequent, but intercut by frustrating moments of the game screeching to a halt for some more tiresome combat, or lengthy sequences in railway tunnels where you have to move cautiously to avoid getting run over by trains.The story is slight, but told well through some wonderfully-animated minimalist cut scenes. Superbly, the game isn't a 'bring down the system' story but something more realistic, with much more achievable objectives (expect the sequels - if there are any, as Mirror's Edge 2 sounds like it'll be a prequel instead - to go down more the path of overthrowing the government). The length - about six hours - is more of an issue, though there are also a number of time challenge maps which extend interest. Fortunately, the game is five years old now so it can be found pretty cheap.Mirror's Edge (***) is a small, curious game which packs in a huge amount of atmosphere. It often feels like the prototype for a much bigger and more interesting game (another comparison to the original Portal), but is certainly playable and fun in its own right. The game is let down by some compromised design decisions regarding combat, but its ambition elsewhere is laudable. The game is well worth a look, though its slightness means you shouldn't think of paying full price for it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2013"}

Oh, and you also get to decide the fate of Albion's people too. I didn't think I would like the Sanctuary, but it has grown on me. Now on to the bad, Fable III is very glitchy. I've been having some framerate issues, especially during combat, which makes it very aggravating. I've also noticed some lag when walking, like my character will freeze for a fraction of a second.

(no spoilers)","reviewText":"I had not played the first Dead to Rights, so this is my review of this game as it stands by itself and not the franchise as a whole. This is a review of the game from the playability aspect and not of the story. You can safely read my whole review and not have the story ruined at all. As I write this I have played it a couple of hours and will update this after I finish the whole game.Overview:You play as vice cop Jack Slate. Your job is to clean up Grant City. This game is mostly its a shooter with a different twist where your pet is a vicious fighting machine.Game mechanics:(+)If you ever played World Of Warcraft and played a hunter class you will be familiar with playing through your pet, (Shadow). This game takes that mechanic and builds on it by allowing you to control your pet with more \"nuance\", the end result is that its not just about going in guns blazing. Instead you must anticipate how Shadow will respond to the environment and also the threats. Its a pretty cool mix of the ideas of combat. Of course as Jack you can do your own special moves .Shadow's forms: (+)The cool thing is as Shadow you can play three different modes; one being a rogue like class where Shadow actually hunkers down and walks like a ninja dog, you know, if ninja dogs existed that is. Another one of his forms is a neutral fighter mode which is like a standard fighter class. The last form is the berserker form which is like all other berserker archetypal character. You do much more damage but are significantly weaker as far as armor.Graphics: (+)On the PS3 this looks fantastic. The textures are really sharp and detailed. At times there are alot of shadows and it can be difficult to see certain areas, but thats where Shadow comes in. Jack is kinda clunky appearing at times, but overall the look and appearance of the game as a whole is really crisp.Lighting: (+)The shadows look great! Usually in PS3 games there are jaggy shadows. In this I see them but not nearly as bad as say AC2. All in all they are crisp and flow over the objects in the game very well.Motion Capture: (+)The motion capture in this game is REALLY smooth. Especially with regards to Shadow, the dog animation looks very lifelike. During the fight sequences there are times Jack looks a bit like a puppet, but overall the motion is smooth.Fighting (+/-)'Hand to hand: (+)The hand to hand fighting in this is spot on and a real fun part of the game. At times the moves are easy to execute because the built in character AI anticipates the moves you are trying to do, just enough to not be annoying.Shooting: (-)I didnt like the shooting in this game. It at times seemed off and a bit difficult to aim. I am not sure if it was the lack of aim assist or too much of it. Either way it was kind of hard to shoot at times.Shadow: (+)He tears this game up. I almost think that I would enjoy playing solely as Shadow for the whole game and just assume he could talk to people. It really is fun playing him as a pet and also as his own character. Very cool moves and vicious attacks.Environments: (-)The environments are standard post-apocalyptic fare. The mobs you are fighting are eh... ok. The ai is fine but the weird thing is the story has some glaring holes in it. I wont cover them here as to keep the no spoilers aspect of my reviews correct. Suffice to say you may be wondering what or where things are coming from, from time to time.Replayability: (-)I have not finished this yet but I do not see me being all that interested in replaying this just for trophies like I would for Assassins Creed II or Uncharted 1/2. It looks like I may play it one more time but after that I wouldn't be interested in playing it again.Summary: (+)This game sofar has been a blast to play and I look forward to finishing it. While its not perfect, it does offer some great story telling and the animations for Shadow are fantastic. It looks like they used motion capture for his animation. Jack is fun to play and its overall a really enjoyable game to play. I may change my story once I finish it.Thank you for reading my review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"L. Sun \"Sun_Jot\"","summary":"Too much cutscene, but terrific Gran Pulse","reviewText":"This is the first final fantasy game that I've played. Like all people say, the story is a little weak and the characters are maybe a little annoying at times.. I didn't like this game at all when I first started playing. but after a few hours getting used to the new battle system, I began to appreciate how delicate and different the gameplay was from all other games in current market.Let me put my biggest complaint here first: there are just too many cut scenes and you feel you are watching a final fantasy movie and maybe that's why everybody saying it's too linear because there is no multi-ending or free roam in a movie (well actually when you reach chapter 11, it becomes a free roam game). The techniques behind all the cut scenes must have been really good, I know that/ Considering how much work they have done for the game. I just wished the story turned out much better and if the characters, the dialogues, the story could suck me in, then the cut scenes wouldn't seem so redundant.The Gran Pulse (where the real reflection of an wild ancient earth planet) is AWESOME. It's exactly what I have been picturing for a world that I would like to live in. I even felt this was done better than Avatar the movie (allow me to exaggerate but I can not control the Navis in the movie, can I?). I love everything I see on this land and I really enjoy doing the missions in chapter 11 (when the story is taken place in the Gran Pulse)The battle system is fun and I like it a lot. It's much better than traditional turn based strategy games. I think this is the one of the best/most fun battle system there out of all games in the market.The game could have been much better. Many things could have been done 'right' , like the story and the characters. However, this is a game for players who enjoy sitting there, relaxing with a fun game (there are hundred hours for you to kill). And especially, if you are into JRPG, you will probably like (or say won't dislike even a bit) this piece of hard work created by Square Enix.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2010"}

I was surprised to see there wasn't a ton of back-story in the game. Usually with games like this, you have to sit through 10 minutes of game story screens before you even start to play. So I was happy to jump right in and get started.Graphics: 7 out of 10The graphics were good, but by no means spectacular. What made them good was the items in the game itself were interesting to look at. Menacing Tall-Boys, abandoned buildings, artwork and such gave the game a colonial dark-age feel, but the actual detail of the final thing was a little less than mind blowing. The graphics of the city itself could have been better than it was. What was supposed to appear as a large, wide open city, instead it felt more like an enclosed island, with no other outside world.Story: 8 out of 10Protector turns assassin, when the empress he's charged with protecting is killed and the murder is blamed on him. After escaping jail on the eve of your execution, you begin to help a group of loyalists find the missing heir to the throne, the empresses daughter. She was taken by the same men who killed her mother, and framed you for her murder. You're charged with tasks, each one different than the others. Some involve finding documents, some finding people. The game plays out much like the game inFamous, where you chose either an evil path or a good one. Depending on how many people you kill during your missions, the city and story line changes accordingly. The game actually had a fairly predictable ending, which can change depending on how you reach to it.Violence: 7 of 10Not as much as many of the games out there. And not nearly as much as I thought there would be. The game previews made it look like the main goal was to go around killing everyone, but in actuality it's the opposite. You are rewarded with points at the end of each mission, and extra points are given for not killing people. While the story-line of the game makes you think you're an assassin out for revenge, the goal is actually to hurt as few people as possible along the way. You are rewarded more greatly for doing so. It's also much harder to complete the missions with out hurting anyone. Your enemies are out to kill you, and if they see you, come out in large numbers and attack. To complete each mission without violence takes a lot of work, but it's encouraged through out the whole game.Game length: Medium-LongThe game took several days to complete and that was playing many hours each day, on the average difficulty level. It would have even taken longer had I spent the time to explore the game thoroughly, and tried to complete it without killing anyone. At one point I felt like the game was even getting a little too long, and I was ready to be at the end. I believe that was because at one point in the game, you are lead to believe you have completed it, when actually you are only about 2/3 of the way through.Gameplay: 8 of 10While the game starts out a bit slow, it picks up as you go along. Gaining magical powers and finding ways to use them really increases the fun in the gameplay. The more you use the powers, the better you get at using them. Physical weapons are minimal, but fun. They work well for the time frame this game is supposed to be set in. Pistols, swords and crossbows are your main weapons. You can also stealthily sneak up on enemies, and knock them out, so that you're not killing them, but disabling them as a threat so you can continue with your mission. One of the two most ominous foes in the game are the Tall-Boys, a soldier in a mean looking mechanical suite, with a powerful cannon attached that he shoots people with. You know when they're coming for you, since each step they take shakes the ground around you as they get closer. The second enemy is one you don't suspect, the rats in the streets. They come out of nowhere and attack at random times. They move in on a subject in a large swarm, and actually eat the person they attack, if they aren't able to get away first. The game does a good job of focusing on a main goal, and not jumping around so much that it makes following the story-line difficult.Hidden items and how they work:There are important items stashed all over the city for you to find. Some of these items give you new, much needed magical powers, some are just coins to buy things with, or extra supplies of health of magic power refills. There are books and papers everywhere, and reading them can give you even more back-story to the game, not included in the regular scenes. They offer clues on where to find hidden things, passwords to locked safes hidden throughout the game, and lots of background as to who people are you meet in the game. You are given a heart as a tool, and when you equip it, it will direct you to where many of these hidden items are. It can also tell you what the a game character is really thinking, or information on deeds from their past.Conclusion:While the game started out a little slow, and first impressions made me think it was too similar to the gameplay of inFamous, the rest of the game proved to me it was one of a kind. I liked that the game was set in the era of the black plague, and that much of the story line was based off the repercussions of the illness affecting the whole city. Game load times were acceptable, and glitches and lagging were pretty much non-existent, which was a relief, since Bethesda games have had issues with them in the past. While the previews make the game out to be all about getting revenge and killing as many people as you can, there's actually a lot more to it. The game actually encourages you to try and take the more difficult rout, a non-lethal approach. Plenty of hours of gameplay, and lots of hidden things to find along the way. The graphics were acceptable, but had they been better, it could have made Dishonored even better. It's a sold 4 star game, has replay-ability, since you'll likely want to do a play-though seeing the story line for both the good and the evil choices you can make.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2012"}

But as time went by and I found out more about the game, I got more and more intrigued, and now that it's at a very reasonable price, I took a chance and bought the game. It was a chance I'm glad I took. It's quite difficult to classify the type of game that Dishonored is because the gameplay is basically a combination of several different genres. It has first-person shooter elements, yet it's not a first-person shooter. It has stealth elements, yet it's not purely a stealth game. It even has some free-roaming elements with multiple routes you can take to reach your goal, yet (you guessed it) it's not a free-roaming game. All these elements were basically put into a blender and mixed together to form what is truly a unique gaming experience. You play as Corvo Attano, the Royal Protector of an empress who rules over the city of Dunwall which resembles a mid-1800s England. In Dunwall, whaling is a national past-time and the oil extracted from the whales is used as a power source for things such as vehicles, weaponry, and utilities, making for a booming industrial age for the city and the surrounding lands. Unfortunately, a deadly rat plague is decimating the city and causing lots of civil unrest.After returning from a special assignment to seek aid against the plague from neighboring countries, Corvo meets with his empress, but their reunion is short-lived when the empress is assassinated by mysterious assailants as a result of a plot concocted by members of her own cabinet, and poor Corvo is framed for the murder and thrown in prison to be executed. An unknown party eventually offers a helping hand to Corvo and he is able to escape from the prison. Afterwards, his new benefactors recruit the former Royal Protector as their assassin and give him the task of doing away with those who framed him and murdered the empress, all in the hopes of putting the late empress's daughter on her rightful throne. While the story for Dishonored is a bit light from a narrative standpoint, it provides a very intriguing and attention grabbing tale through lots of notes, journals, and audiographs (audio recordings) that you find throughout missions, not to mention plenty of moments where you can listen in on conversations that not only provide mission clues, but also provide further insight on the in-game world and its lore. The most noticeable characteristic about this game is its emphasis on making choices. Pretty much everything you do or don't do in this game will have a measurable impact on how you succeed on your missions, on which missions you will or will not be able to undertake, and even how the story ends. For every action you take there WILL be some form of reaction.Corvo has a nice collection of weapons and magic abilities that will aid him on his missions, which you can access through a weapon wheel or hot key them to the directional buttons. He always wields a blade in his right hand, and with his left hand he can use other projectile weapons such as a pistol, a crossbow (with standard, explosive, or sedative bolts), grenades, or a special mine that shoots out metal shards when an enemy makes contact with it. These weapons can be upgraded between missions at Corvo's hideout with a particular inventor named Piero, and bringing him special blueprints that can be found during missions provides Corvo with other upgrades (use the lenses on his mask to zoom in on distant enemies or points of interest, have his boots make less noise when he moves around, or increase the durability of his armor). More ammunition and restorative items can also be purchased from Piero, or found during missions in different locations or looted from downed enemies. Aside from his projectile weapons, Corvo can use his left hand to wield different magic abilities he gains from the mysterious, supernatural being known as the Outsider.A couple of his most important abilities which let him sneak around much more easily are Blink, which lets him teleport to distant spots with pinpoint precision, and Dark Vision, which lets him see nearby enemies and special objects through walls and other obstructions. Other magic abilities he gains include being able to summon a swarm of rats to attack enemies, use possession to temporarily take control of animals or people, slow down/stop time to further assist in either stealth or combat, use a windblast to push back or kill enemies, and have the bodies of slain enemies disintegrate into ash to avoid having them discovered by other enemies. You don't automatically gain these powers or their respective upgrades as the story goes on though, instead you have to buy them by collecting runes which are scattered throughout the levels. Bone charms can also be found in each level and equipping them offers little bonuses such as being able to move more quickly while sneaking, swinging your sword more quickly, gaining more health when using a health potion, etc. The exact locations of runes and bone charms can be pointed out to you with the item known as the Heart, but actually getting to them can be tricky at times, especially when they're surrounded by many enemies or locked in safes. Even though collecting these things are optional, it's normally worth the time to get a hold of as many of them as you can, especially the runes.Each mission you go on will put you in a rather expansive level where the goal is normally to get into a well guarded building or hideout, eliminate a target, and then make your way out in one piece. The environments themselves aren't all that different from each other (normally lots of buildings, mansions, and occasionally some sewers), but they're very well laid out and give you lots of options with regards to completing your missions. While you're pretty much always going from point A to point B and your goal is pointed out to you by an on-screen cursor, there are normally multiple routes you can take to get to where you need to go. For example, if you need to get past a security gate with an electrical field that will incinerate anyone but a city guard, you can do one of several things: cut the power to the electrical field and stroll right through the gate, go around the gate by using a nearby alley or a rooftop, possess a city guard and walk through the electrical field, etc. Or if you need to get into a well defended building you can teleport and jump your way up to get in through a second floor window or possess a rat and get in the building through a ventilation duct. You normally have many routes to take to your goal, it's just up to you to find them. Another aspect in which you have options is in dealing with your enemies. When sneaking up behind an enemy or other characters you can choose to kill them with a quick stab in the neck or grab them in a chokehold to knock them out, after which you can move the body and hide it somewhere so it doesn't get discovered. If you don't want to take out the enemy and simply need a key they're carrying to get past a locked door, you can pickpocket them and then leave the enemy alone.Choosing whether or not to kill someone does more than just affect the way you play the game, it also affects how civilians and friendly NPCs view you, which in the long run dictates whether you get the more favorable ending or the darker ending. In this regard, the game's Chaos system works very much like a more realistic rendition of your classic video game karma system. Dealing with your enemies in a non-lethal manner and helping other characters keeps Chaos at a low level, whereas ruthlessly slaying all those in front of you will raise your Chaos level. Even if you only kill enemies and spare innocents, being too bloodthirsty has an impact on your overall image; society tends to look down on ruthless killers in spite of how righteous their goals may be. That's not to say that you can't kill anyone if you want the good ending. Killing a handful of enemies or targets here and there won't affect the Chaos level all that much, but a high body count (about 10 or more per mission) will create some negative vibes and raise the Chaos levels. A high Chaos level will result in the presence of more enemies and dangers to stand in your way. As I assume most gamers did when they played this game, I rarely killed enemies, no more than 5 per mission, and beat the game with a low Chaos level. It's actually possible to beat this game without taking a single life; even your main assassination targets can be dealt with through non-lethal (and very clever) means, although in several cases they normally involve going off the beaten path and completing optional side missions for other characters.Speaking of enemies, there's not a huge variety to them, but they do keep things interesting. The city guards, thugs, and assassins of Dunwall can all be dealt with in the same manner whether it's through stealth or direct combat, and while most use guns and swords, others have special weapons or abilities of their own like using whiskey bottles to blow fire breath at you or their own teleportation abilities. Weepers are somewhat different; they're people who have succumbed to the later stages of the rat plague with blood \"weeping\" from their eyes (and they vomit out a lot of blood too). Similarly to zombies, they shamble around aimlessly and automatically attack anyone else within reach by biting them, but they can be incapacitated or killed just as easily as any regular human enemy. The most unique enemies are the Tallboys, which are heavily armored city guards on mechanical stilts armed with explosive arrow launchers. Not only are they the most physically imposing enemies, but they cannot be knocked unconscious (under normal circumstances), so if you're going for a no-kill playthrough, then they basically have to be avoided completely.Other enemies include swarms of rats, guard dogs, large water mollusks that spit acid, and even hostile fish who will attack you if you swim too close to them (killing these enemies has no impact on your Chaos level). I have only one complaint with Dishonored: the combat isn't the best. While it is fun to cut into your enemies with your blade, shoot them with your weapons, or fling them away with a blast of wind, the first-person perspective doesn't make physical combat all that graceful, although I will say that the way Corvo kills certain important targets is quite awesome. One other thing I should mention is that it's very easy to make a mistake in this game that will cause you to fail a mission. One very memorable screw up was when I knocked out a group of thugs while sneaking into their hideout, then when I returned later to talk to their leader, he attacked me and the mission failed because he found the knocked out thugs in his hideout (I was unaware that I didn't actually have to knock out the thugs when I first entered their hideout).Thankfully, the game has one of the best save systems I've ever encountered, so if you happen to do something stupid like unintentionally kill someone you didn't mean to kill, then you can easily load a previous save and undo the mistake. The game autosaves pretty regularly and you can manually save your game at any time when outside of combat. Each time the game saves, instead of overwriting previous saves, it stores it in the game's save file so you can have multiple saves even in one mission. You can even replay completed missions from the main menu, but loading an older mission will have you lose your progress on later missions. In the end, Dishonored is more of a thinking man's (or woman's) game and rewards the patient gamer who takes the time to explore and think his way past obstacles and challenges. I like how this game actually encourages you to plan everything out and makes you consider whether to take a life or to spare one. That being said, you still have the option to go in guns blazing and go for your standard video game \"killfest\", but again, this will result in more enemies to deal with and a less favorable ending (although I imagine some gamers won't care one way or the other). While Dishonored isn't everyone's cup of tea and doesn't have the best combat, it is definitely one of the most interesting of all the games I've played and it has lots of replay value for those who like to see all the different ways they can complete different tasks.**UPDATE**This part will cover the two DLCs for Dishonored: The Knife of Dunwall and its sequel The Brigmore Witches. These two DLCs let you take up the blade of Daud, the assassin who murdered the empress and kick started Corvo's adventure in the main game. The story actually begins with the player experiencing the opening scene of the main game with the empress's murder from Daud's point of view. After the deed is done, Daud is contacted by the Outsider and is sent on his final mission before he meets his fated end. Controlling Daud is, as expected, very similar to controlling Corvo and he'll be making use of a lot of the same weapons and abilities, although there are a few differences with Daud's gameplay. Like Corvo, he wields a blade in his right hand and with his left hand he can use his ranged weapons and magic abilities. Starting with The Knife of Dunwall, Daud's weapons include a wristbow (that shoots the usual normal, explosive, and sedative bolts), a pistol, grenades, and new weapons such as arc mines (which vaporizes enemies), stun mines (which knocks out enemies), and choke dust (which momentarily disorients enemies so you can attack or escape from them).In The Brigmore Witches, the choke dust can be upgraded to baffle dust, which will have disoriented enemies forget you are there and they will go back to their regular patrols. It actually would have been nice if these new weapons had been available for Corvo in the main game since they're all quite useful when using a stealthy approach. Daud has the same Bend Time and Shadow Kill abilities as Corvo, although he lacks the Rat Swarm and Windblast abilities. Fortunately, his other abilities are improvements over Corvo's. Daud's version of Blink allows him to teleport to distant spots, but with the added benefit of freezing time as long as the player doesn't move Daud with the left stick. This allows the player to aim and time teleportations with much greater precision, even in the middle of a jump. His Void Gaze works like a combination of Corvo's Dark Vision and Heart item: it lets him see enemies and important items through walls, and also points out the locations of runes and bone charms (although it lacks the range of the Heart). Daud can also summon one of his assassins to fight alongside him for a time. In The Brigmore Witches, Daud gains the Pull ability, which lets him telekinetically pull items and even enemies towards him. This ability can be very handy in pick pocketing enemies or grabbing other important items from a safe vantage point.Between missions, Daud can buy more ammunition and recovery items, as well as upgrades to his weapons and gadgets. He can even purchase favors from his assassins and paid contacts that have certain effects on his missions. These favors include runes being left in easier to find locations, safe combinations being etched on walls, and alternate entry points being opened up. Another addition in The Brigmore Witches are corrupted bone charms, which offer both advantages and disadvantages to Daud's performance. One lets Daud do more damage to his enemies with his blade, but also has him swing his blade more slowly, and another one has Daud lose mana instead of health when suffering damage from enemy attacks, but it also keeps him from regenerating his mana. Just like in the main game, Chaos plays a role in changing up the gameplay and the story's ending, but to a somewhat lesser degree than the main game. The player can make Daud carve his way past all his enemies, knock them all out for a no-kill playthrough, or anything in between (although Daud going the fully non-lethal route doesn't make that much sense to me from a story perspective since, unlike the silent protagonist Corvo, Daud has already been established as a ruthless assassin in the main game).Most of the enemies are basically the same as the ones in the main game, except for three new enemies: the tough butchers who wield powered buzz saws that can kill you quickly if you're not careful, witches with deadly supernatural powers, and gravehounds that relentlessly attack you until they're completely pulverized. The stories for the DLCs are also quite interesting and add a further layer of depth to the tale of Dishonored, all from a very interesting perspective. These DLCs are worth a purchase if you loved the main game of Dishonored and they add a hefty amount of extra gameplay for those who like to take their time and explore their surroundings. Aside from the great gameplay, just finding out about Daud's previously unknown role in the main game's story and seeing how his tale ties in with Corvo's makes getting these DLCs a worthy investment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2013"}

End result - a lot of dead people that are up and walking around. How did this happen? Well, it looks like everyone is blaming you and some of the survivors and, amongst your critics, the military. Solution - hang around and figure this out while staying alive and handing out some much need lovin'.I'm not going to pick a system or try to turn this into one being better than the other. I love my 360 and that is that. I'm sure PS3 owners feel the same way about their stuff. I'm glad we can all experience the game. This is a lot like the last one in some ways, too, only there are some beautiful little things that have come a long, long way since the inception. First, you have that same safety area. You get calls and you run missions and you field a lot fo traffic. The GREAT thing is that the AI isn't stupid this time. In the first DRing, they stood and let themselve be gobbled up without you. Now, they run and you run, and that makes things good. I'm not saying that this is a perfect world - far from it - but it is a great thing that has gone well beyond what I expected.You level up just like before, and you get some of the same stuff. Streength, speed, health blocks, item bnlocks; you name all that stuff and it appears. The difference now is that it is a lot more interesting in the way you level. You get your player points all sorts of ways: you can kill, complete missions, play little games, and dabble in mall materials. There's a lot to do in a Casino with malls literally glued everywhere.The place is HUGE.One difference is the combo weapons, where you make somethingf rom two or more items. The first thing I got was a spiked bat, which is a nail and bat creation. Then I got a drill bucket - and I don't want to ruin it or the others that came after. Basically the game just added a new element and that is pretty. Player likes.Another thing I like is the ability to aim. When I find something and want to hit someone with it, I can. Arrows, lawn darts, bullets; it isn't like the last go. you can actually put the projectile in the face of that lovely shambling mess and think \"i AM good at this.\" You can also utilize your moves and getyyourself out of jams, making even button mashers have a chance to get out alive. It takes and makes something that all expereince levels can exjoy while rewarding you for getting better or trying harder.Tjhose bosses - some of them are jsut plain evil.There is a lot in this game and it is easy to keep on keeping on. you are a different person, you know that right aweay, and have different needs. I dso have to say that not having the camera was weird at first, but the mall and the amazing size of this establishment just boggled our minds. We got an early release so this has been a week of playing, too, and thwere are only minor glitches as well. I've had tweo that had zombies take me out after they were gone and one stick me in a wall. Still, with all the hours I've logged, its a fair shake.Gore - yes. Fun - yes. What I expected - a lot more. i know some people might find a fault here or there, but judging it fairly will show just how beautiful this game is. The snozberries taste like snozberries! It is a great, great thing and I hope you pikc it up regardless of what you thought of the first. It will keep giving and has more story than before.for the multiplayer reviewing, I am not the person to say if this is great and admit it. So, that is one thing I have to say that I cannot provide much detail on. Still, I'm sure an ocean of reviews will come out and you can find out as much as you want. Turn to the editorial piece if you need more on what is what there and take a look at those zombies and note how good they are depicted. In my wildest dreams, I didn't think I would see thousands of beautifully rendered teeth chomping that chomp and yet I did. It is well in the 5/5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2010"}

There are only a few complaints I have about it. First, the storyline is awful. I don't just mean bad, I mean terrible. The good news is that while the single player story is bad, playing it is actually a lot of fun. My second complaint is the controls. For some reason, they feel really odd. If you have ever played Rainbow Six 3 on the xbox, then you have sort of an idea of what I mean. It took me a while to finally get the controls down decently so I could actually hit what I was aiming at. Everything else about the game is great though. The graphics are extremely good and the audio is just as good. The weapons feel good to shoot and each gun is tricked out with secondary fire and sometimes a third function. The single player campaign offers a pretty good level of challenge and the AI does its job well enough. One of the big reasons most people will be buying this is for xbox live. From what I have played (maybe about 3 to 4 hours on live), its extremely fun. The levels can range in size from real small to insanely huge which is good. The game supports a ton of players (way more then halo 2, I think 32 players) and games with that many players are extremely crazy and intense.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Jeffrey S. Stanley \"Viper_29\"","summary":"Not what I was expecting....","reviewText":"Okay, I have played Halo 2 and beaten it twice on Easy and Normal, and am now playing it on Legendary (mucho mucho harder). I have to say that I don't understand what the delay was for this game. I will tell you right now, if you don't have Xbox Live, this game will be a let down for you. It has what has got to be one of the worst endings of a game I have EVER played. I would love to see more missions in the single player campaign as content download, but I have read that this is very unlikely to happen.I also have a gripe with the graphics of this game. I too have noticed the draw in delay time of this game when aliens pop into view and are \"drawn\" a split second later. Not too long, but it is still noticeable nontheless. With us paying 50 bucks (I bought the limited version) and I really expect more from this graphic engine. Now, if you have xbox live, this game is all about multiplayer. The ONLY bad thing, and I still can't understand why Bungie didn't include this, is that there is no COOP live playability. You can play coop thru a mission via splitscreen, but not through Live. This is a pity, since I enjoy coop play more so than the other multiplayer methods, but hate the split screen pain. I will say that I read the early reviews from the gaming mags about this game and was forwarned about the lousy ending, but it still caught me by surprise.Yes, it is hard to understand the vocals of certain aliens, and once I played through it the second time I was able to catch a lot of what I missed the first time. The only negative I have about the vocals is it seems so much is being said while you are in the thick of battle and can't really focus (or hear over gunshots) the sounds of the actors as they talk.This game could have been SO much more than it is, and that is why I give it only 4 stars. For as long as this game was in development, there should have been more than what it is. I only hope to god that they don't pull a Sony and release another Halo version later that has more in it (I am referring to Sony and GT4 with a non-online version being offered first, only to be followed by a online version next year. What better way to milk the fans out of money than that.)Again, if you buy this make the effort and get live, it is the only way you will get your money's worth out of this game.Decent graphic performance (After the characters are drawn in they look gorgeous, although I have had a fair amount of framerate slowdown that I have observed). The sounds are probably the best of any game out there right now (With the exception of some Alien dialogue). Single player campaign can be finished in as early as 5-6 hours on easy. They try to mix the single player campaign up with a plot twist early in the game, and I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't played it yet, needless to say you will play as more than one character. The second disk in the limited version was nice with a pretty long making of the game movie (too bad the gameplay doesn't reflect the amount of time they devoted).And finally, this has got to be hands down the best assortment of music to ever hit a video game. It is like every sceen in the game is followed by it's own musical score that really delivers the gut wrenching moments hard and fast.  If you buy this game, be forwarned that the single player is ridiculously short, and you will be left wanting much, much more to justify your 50 or 60 bucks you put down on this game. And Bungie, incase you are reading this, give us more single player campaign missions via Content download.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2004"}

{"product_name":"B007TYC8MI","description":"","reviewerName":"Simmer \"itsme0209\"","summary":"6 games later...same story + same gameplay + same everything = Boring","reviewText":"Is it just me, or does this series seem to be getting worse as it goes.I'll start off saying I have been a huge God of War fan since the first title and I have played them all (including the PSP versions).Here's what I liked...The graphics were amazing (except for the laughable rendered birds halfway through the game. What were they thinking?)The music was superbThe storyline was somewhat (standalone perspective)Seemless game save states (although...it was niceto choose different save states like in other GOW titles)Now the bad....The story line of these games are jumping all over the place. I felt like the pre story to god of war was told well in the Chains of Olympus when it led right up to the part where he jumped off the cliff. How much more to this story do they have to dig in. Its getting old and boring. Move on to bigger and better things instead of squeezing more story lines in between. It's 6 titles later. We 'GET IT'.Also, Ascension was plagued with bugs. I was so worried that with all the glitches I was experience that I was going to make it to the end and it was going to freeze up....and you know what....it did just that. Took me about an hour to get it working again (restarting the game and system a few times), but I honestly thought it was done for.The camera angles were horrible throughout the game. It would zoom out so far sometimes I couldn't even see where I was. This happened a lot during battles making them unnecessarily hard and frustrating.The surroundings were very graphically beautiful....however, unlike other GOW titles where you could easily distinguish what was usable or climbable, this was not the case at all in this game. I spent a lot of time running around just trying to figure out where I could go and where I could not, what was usable, what was not usable....Another thing to mention is....dont let this game fool you. Its actually much shorter than it appears. I played this game on normal and beat it in 8 hours. However, I could have easily beat it in 5 (or less) if it was not for the frustrating battles throughout the entire game coupled with the issues I mentioned above. Even the lowest level of enemies were taking forever to kill. And the attacks were over the top plentiful throughout the entire game, being pitted against huge packs of enemies that dont seem to be thwarted by your attacks, yet, you are stunned by their attacks. I found the only way I could stand a fighting chance was to constantly keep throwing enemies at other each other to get them off of me. I am all about challeneges, but this didnt even classify as being fun. It was just frustrating.The puzzle solving parts were few, far between, and lame. I almost want to just say they were non existent, but there were a few. Also, very frustrating because it was hard to distinguish what could be used and what could not, etc.Finally and most of all,....there is nothing new that God of War Ascension has to offer. Its the same old story,same old game play, hack this, slash that (to the extreme), puzzle lacking that has nothing new to bring to the table as far as game play. I loved the memory of the original game and I still continued to play the newer GOW titles to date based off that memory, but nothing has felt like the first 2 titles since their release years ago, and at this point, it actually bores me to play these titles.  Ascension was just the reassurance that I felt to be true after playing the previous releases.I feel like they really strayed from what made this game great, and made the game more simplified to appeal to new comers instead of staying true to what made God of War 1 and 2 such great games.It's sad to say that I believe this will be my last God of War game I purchase and play. Even if I received it free, I am just bored of the same old thing 6 titles later.The work on the game was wonderfully done as a standalone title without looking at the entire scope of this 8 year saga of games, and I really hate giving it a bad rating considering how much effort each individual group / person may have put into this title and my love for the earlier of the franchise.If you're listening Santa Monica,...take notes from great games lines like Dead Space, Grand Theft Auto, etc. They add to their game play as they progress. And if you're not planning to move forward with game play aspect (such as Uncharted), at least make up for it with an over the top, amazing, fresh story line (such as Uncharted).I'd say if you feel compelled to play, then rent it. But you really wont be missing out on much if you played the other and passed this one up.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00897Z218","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"buriedatlantis\"","summary":"My First Assassin's Experience","reviewText":"Looking at a lot of reviews, this installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise really seems to have divided gamers.  For me, it is the first in the series I've had the pleasure to play and I enjoyed the heck out of it.I'm a Nintendo guy, having grown up with their consoles and just really enjoy their games.  So for the Wii U, I've finally been able to get a taste of other franchises I've always kind of wanted to play but have never had the chance.First off, I love the setting of the game.  It does a fantastic job of tying in the history of the American Revolution with the Assassin's timeline.  I'll admit that I'm probably not up on my history in the years since I've been out of school, but I got a kick out of seeing Benjamin Franklin and George Washington interact with my character and the fun Connor-led missions that tied into important parts in the war.I love the game play, it's very simple and satisfying.  The combat with your combination of attacks and counters made fighting a pleasure and stealth and assassin kills satisfying to pull off.  I can't compare the freerunning mechanic from this game with the previous games and their majestic skylines, having never played them, but I had a lot of fun running through the forests and scaling old school churches and synchronizing my views.When the world opens up after the first few hours, it's easy to get lost hunting and collecting feathers at your own leisure.  I spent a lot of time ignoring missions and just doing my own thing until I got tired of it and got back on point.  I probably had more fun than I should have crafting and selling items, trying to get the greatest profit I could.  I'm not big on simulator games, but I have to imagine this portion of the game is rewarding to the type of person who digs those tycoon type of games.Of course in addition to all of that is the absolutely stunning naval battles.  Just like everyone else, I enjoyed every chance I could get to board my ship and start sinking the heck out of Redcoats.  And the quest for Captain Kidd's treasure just sweetened the naval deal.  Lots of fun to be had here, and it just makes the pirate based Assassin's Creed: Black Flag look that much more appealing.Graphics wise, I thought the game looked great.  I can't compare it to the other big boy consoles as I've never owned them, but for a Nintendo boy like myself, they were more than fine and better than we're used to.  I know there's been a bit of problem with glitches and whatnot, but what little weird glitches I ran into really didn't bother me too much. There was a floating bear here, a disappearing deer there, but nothing that really took away from my experience playing the game.A couple of things that may bug some people:  I don't know, maybe I'm not the expert gamer that some people are, but some of the stealthier missions come across as a little difficult because the bad guys seem to notice you no mater what you do.  That could just be player caused, but it seemed to happen a lot.  I ended up getting into huge group fights more often than not.Also, the beginning of the game rewards the patient.  It is several hours (or at least seems like it) before the game opens up.  Thankfully, this portion of the game is fun to play and it gets you used to the style of play the Assassin's games seem to be known for.  You also get to play as the swarthy Haytham, who is a much more fun character than Connor to spend time with.Of course I have to make a mention of off screen play with the Wii U Gamepad.  It seems some people find the Gamepad to be a useless add on, but I'm digging it for the simple things it does.  Having the map on the gamepad is a simple yet effective use of the controller.  And the off screen play is very cool for a guy like me with wife and kids.  Thanks to that one feature, it took me half the time completing the game being able to still play while the TV screen itself is dominated by Curious George and the X-Factor.All in all, a very pleasing experience.  It's a big game with a lot of stuff to do and keep you occupied.  I wish the rewards for some of these tasks were a little more hefty, but it was still fun to do.  The story is cool and the gameplay is simple enough for non-hardcore gamer and satisfying enough for everyone.  I really dug the game and if a lot of people are right and it's not as good as the second game in the series, I can't wait to play that one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2014"}

Don't get me wrong, there's several difficult moment in X5 and X6, and Mega Man 5 isn't exactly a walk through the colorful cherry orchard park either, but overall MM4 might take the cake for the most consistently difficult Mega Man game I've ever put inside one of my video game consoles.  I remember my mother renting this game for me at the video game store uptown back in 1990-1991, and of course, I was the foolish one who picked it out assuming it'd be loads of fun and... well yeah, the game *is* loads of fun, but the constant relentless assault from the many enemies you encounter in nearly every single stage is nearly enough to make me wish I hadn't asked for this game so many times during my childhood.The music is REALLY good though.  Who knows, the music itself may be the biggest reason I used to rent this game so many times back then.  Skull Man in particular has a theme that's really melodic.  On the negative, the first Wily stage has terrible music.  This game moreso than all the other Mega Man games reminds me of that robot movie from the mid 80's called Short Circuit.  That movie used to excite me like no other.  The levels are all packed with several obstacles.  You have spikes which we've pretty much grown accustomed to in the Mega Man series by this point, moving block platforms that can be an absolutely *nightmare* if you don't handle your jumping patterns correctly (and when I was a kid- surprise surprise, missing and falling these particular platforms is how I ended up losing the most lives).At least Mega Man has a sliding move that's really effective when the situation ever gets TOO intense.  Quite often you can simply slide beyond the danger and make it to a temporary safe area.  Thank goodness for this feature!  Where the difficulty REALLY increases in during the Wily stages.  Trust me, you don't even want to know how hard some of these stages are.  The one stage with spikes on the block platforms that actually *rotate* to a different spot... MY goodness!!  You're in for more than a rude awakening, that's for sure!  This is the one Mega Man game I'm always reluctant to play due to the high challenge it brings time and time again.  It does get easier with practice, but let's be honest here- if you wake up on the wrong side of the bed and experience an off day, your timing will be off too.  You cannot have one of those days and expect to blow through a game like this without any trouble.  You've been warned.The boss fights are hard too mainly because if you happen to come unprepared such as say, your weapon meter is nearly empty when you arrive to the fight or you simply don't have the right weapon in your possession, the bosses will make you pay for that, and the regular arm cannon might not be good enough to get the job done either.  Another benefit is that Rush the dog makes an appearance and he helps with some of the harder to reach areas by climbing on top of him and sailing across (or up) the screen.Overall, Mega Man's fourth adventure offers a significantly increased challenge in comparison to the previous three, so please PLEASE keep this in mind if you so much as dare to play this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2012"}

It was fine but there wasn't a lot to suggest it can beat any other FPS games that I've played but upon second playing I grew to love it and consider it even better than the revered Super Metroid. However, Prime's sequel Echoes left me completely cold with its slightly alienating atmosphere, high difficulty and vague-for-the-sake-of-vague puzzles. Corruption, Samus' first foray on the Wii, doesn't really top the first Prime but it also corrects a lot that the others suffered from. It may not be the top Metroid title but it's certainly one of the most impressive.Story: Surprisingly, there's more depth to this one. Well as deep as a Metroid title can be I guess. Samus is called into action when several Aurora units, which are organic super computers, have been malfunctioning. Of course those pesky Space Pirates are to blame so Samus has to travel from planet to planet and restore the Aurora Units while dealing with an old foe as well as the substance known as Phazon which is having a curious effect on Samus.Graphics: The Wii has often been criticized for being the least advanced of the next-gen consoles as far as graphics are concerned. Well Metroid might not outdo Halo 3 or Assassin's Creed, it's definately one of the Wii's prettier titles. From more sharper textures and detail to the small things like fog and rain on your visor to particles, Metroid hasn't been given a overhaul but rather a nice upgrade visually. However, where the game slightly...and I mean slightly falters is in its artistic design since the guys at Retro Studios had environments that were quite simply beautiful or really great aesthetically. I mean Phendrana Drifts or Sanctuary Fortress had great architecture but aside from the oddball style of Bryyo, the planets here just look...simple. Skytown is basically just big pillars in the sky and Bryyo's fire section just looks...bland.Sound/Music: The music in Metroid has always been a bit more atmospheric and ambient rather than going for all-out orchestrated music in the epic sense a la Shadow of the Colossus. But now it's gotten a bit more action-oriented and makes the pace a little bit more pace while also supplying some fan-favorite remixes such as a Phendrana Drifts-type piece when you enter a snow area. Also new is voice acting and while dialogue-wise it's kinda cheesy, the voices aren't distracting although some might feel it takes away from the \"Samus against the elements\" vibe the series always had.Gameplay: When Resident Evil 4 was re-released onto the Wii, some felt the control scheme made the game more easier and took away from the challenge while others felt that it made the game more funner and enjoyable. Similar is the case with Corruption where it feels similar to a dual-analog setup where the nunchuk controls Samus' movements while the Wii-mote is used for aiming and turning. Some might have to get used to it since you have to have steady hands for some parts and lock-ons sometimes don't always lock-on but you quickly get used to it. Changing visors is always easy this time since you just press the - Button and a menu pops up; point to the visor you want and voila, you can scan or call on your ship among other things. Newly added thanks to Samus' exposure to Phazon is Hypermode where holding the + Button makes Samus go into overdrive and her firepower packs a wallop. It doesn't last long and takes away an energy tank but it's effective for killing monsters quicker.Like I mentioned, Samus has always been alone with the occasional meeting of a creature or trooper. Now instead of a more exploration-type setting where Samus travels across environments on her own, she can now traverse several, do missions, get out and on to the next own while meeting several Federation troopers and commanders. This gives it a more epic feel and a weird Halo feel so it's up to you whether you like this new approach. I'm sort of torn by it since the Prime series moreso than Fusion or Super Metroid really drove the idea home that it's just you against anything and everything the Space Pirates can launch at you and now it feels slightly...fractured with Samus able to jet off to a planet anytime she wants.Echoes drove me nuts since it seemed to think that fun meant replaying bosses over and over and a Dark World where you can die easily if you went away from safe areas. Either the aiming system made it better or the game's just easier by design but it's more accessible now. Of course it comes with a hard difficulty as well so if you think you could beat it, just pick the hard one instead. My one complaint is that bosses, while still fun and impressive, seem to suffer from that insane defense rating RPG bosses sometimes have where your attacks just don't seem to be powerful enough, making you fight for longer-than-usual times just to bring the guy down and the bosses are more exhausting than challenging since they just take awhile. However, with the ability to strafe and the accuracy of the Wii-mote, it's a bit more forgiveable.A lot of Nintendo systems tend to have a lot of average titles with a surprise now and then until the big guns arrive. Corruption is the same way: with most Wii games just using the controller in oddball, quirky ways, along come titles like Corruption and Mario Galaxy that show Nintendo can still deliver solid gameplay.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00003E4EB","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"zeb alford","summary":"Old system, but still fun.","reviewText":"The Nintendo 64 is a old, but still fun system to play.

You&rsquo;ll get a competitive advantage by hearing sound cues that youcan&rsquo;thear with speakers, such as the soft footsteps of an enemy sneaking up behind you, or the loading of a weapon far in the distance, regardless of the direction. By hearing sounds others can&rsquo;t - and by knowing where they&rsquo;re coming from - you&rsquo;ll react faster and take them out before they takeyouout.If you&rsquo;re serious about XBOX 360 gaming, get serious about the sound. Invest in an Ear Force X41 and experience the game the way it was meant to be heard. It will help you to become a better player and you&rsquo;ll have a lot more fun enjoying your XBOX 360.&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround Sound Technology!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Take your gaming to the next level by experiencing how your Xbox 360 was meant to be heard!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Enjoy late night gaming without disturbing others!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround SoundThe Ear Force X41 transmitter uses a 150MPS Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to deliver genuine Dolby Digital sound, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, and Dolby Headphone surround sound processing technologies - the industry-standard formats for encoding multi-channel sound in XBOX 360 games and DVD movies. The X41 uses the latest version of Dolby technology to create realistic game sound in 7.1 channels for improved surround sound accuracy.Dolby Pro Logic IIx and Stereo EnhancerThe X41 transmitter incorporates the latest Dolby Pro Logic IIx decoding system for surround sound realism from Dolby Pro Logic II encoded audio. When used with stereo sources, the Dolby Pro Logic Decoder also enhances the sound by spreading the stereo signal to provide a &ldquo;wider&rdquo; effect. This results in a richer, fuller sound than normal stereo - almost as if it originates from outside of the headphones.2.4GHz Wireless Digital RF TechnologyThe Ear Force X41 transmits game audio to the headset with an uncompressed wireless digital radio frequency (RF) signal to deliver CD-quality sound that rivals professional-grade wired headphones. Best of all, the wireless RF signal does not require &quot;line of sight&quot; to operate. That means you can stand anywhere near your XBOX 360 and hear a clear, noise-free signal.Chat Boost&nbsp;Dynamic Talkback&nbsp;ExpanderIf you&rsquo;ve ever had trouble hearing teammates on XBOX LIVE when the game action heats up, then you know how frustrating it can be when you have to keep adjusting the chat volume. Chat Boost fixes this problem by automatically adjusting the XBOX Live chat level when the game gets louder, so chat from teammates isn't lost in the exciting parts of your game. As the game sound gets louder, Chat Boost turns up the chat volume automatically so you can still hear what everyone is saying.It's a simple solution to an annoying problem, and it all happens automatically - so you don't have to adjust anything!Microphone MonitoringIt's hard to hear yourself speak when a headset is covering your ears. The X41 corrects this annoyance with its microphone monitoring feature. The X41 adds a portion of the microphone signal into the headset signal, so you can hear a portion of your voice along with incoming chat and game audio. Microphone monitoring not only prevents you from talking too loud or accidentally yelling into the mic, it also eliminates that annoying &quot;clogged ears&quot; feeling when talking while the headset is covering your ears.Bass BoostThe X41 headset DSP also lets you turn on a Bass Boost feature that produces deep, rich bass tones by increasing the volume of low frequency sounds - just like turning up the volume on the sub-woofer on your home theater system. Bass Boost improves your gaming experience by kicking-up the sound level of explosions, gun shots and other deep-bass sound effects, making them even more dramatic.Wired Headphone ConnectionThe X41 transmitter includes a headphone output jack with volume control to connect an optional pair of wired headphones in addition to the wireless X41 headset. This jack outputs the same high-quality Dolby Headphone 7.1 surround sound that&rsquo;s being transmitted to the wireless X41 headset, which allows two people to hear the game sound at the same time.Independent Chat/Game VolumesSeparate volume controls let you adjust the game and chat levels individually, so you can easily balance them and never have to worry about missing a cue from your teammates.Advanced Battery Booster CircuitryThe X41 has a &ldquo;battery booster&rdquo; circuit that squeezes every last bit of power from the batteries and assures high quality sound until they&rsquo;re completely dead. This allows a pair of AAA Alkaline batteries to last for as long as 25 straight hours of game play. You can also buy standard rechargeable batteries in place of Alkaline batteries.Powered By USBThe transmitter is powered by a single USB port on your XBOX, or from a nearby PC or laptop. So there is no need to fuss with a separate AC power adapter.","reviewerName":"Jacob LeTourneau \"Sideburn Slayer\"","summary":"Poor sound quality","reviewText":"I bought these as a replacement for my TV speakers.

Also, with a exceptions, none of the features from San Andreas seem to be present (noticed exceptions so far include the tip bar in the taxi cab missions, and [possibly] the flame on burning vehicles). The game also seems to lack any of the more annoying San Andreas glitches (like not getting on a bike properly).While the map is essentially the same, many locations look different - many others are in the process of being built. The 'Portland Docks' are much more dynamic and impressive, and the unique jump locations are also far more imaginative. I have also noticed that the lighthouse island is accessible.Hidden packages are in completely different places, as are unique jumps, rampages, etc... Some old, familiar faces make a comeback, including JD O'Toole (you might remember him as 'The Director' from Manhunt), and the Sindacco family from S.A. I'm not mentioning the obvious ones (like Toni Cipriani, Salvatore Leone and the radio stuff). There's a load of neat new side-mission types - like garbage truck missions, and one where you get to ride on a faggio and shoot targets while someone drives you around. The multiplayer stuff alone deserves great credit - the missions are greatly varied, and a lot of fun to play with others.Those who missed the \"indie\" style of radio in Vice City and San Andreas will also dig the stations in LCS - the radio is yet again, full of made-up boy-bands and \"customized\" (i.e. includes references to the game) hip-hop and rap, as well as real-life Indian, Arabic, etc.. music. For the fans, Lazlow makes a comeback on chatterbox, which is now a program on a talk radio station (again, excellent material).Overall, great game. It's both great as a rehash of a classic that will (probably) never be topped, and as a game on its own - it's well worth buying.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2005"}

I decided to get this as a backup to my PS3 copy so I can play around the house wheneve I have a few minutes. This is a slightly slimmed down port of the console version which a few changes such as less cops, less traffic, and fewer online opponents. All of these alter the experience slightly, but in a good way. Less chaos means the overall experience is more controlled and not as frantic, which I personally think is a good change for the Vita version given that the control is not quite as precise as using a PS3 controller. Also, not having the vibration feedback also dulls the sensation ever so slightly.This game plays just like the console version in terms of the format. The visual are sharp and the car locations appear to be identical. The only (very) minor gripe is the text is really really small and hard to read if you don't put the Vita right up to your face. Not a huge issue but just wanted to share my observation. Online play is super easy and fun. Having no lobby is very cool and makes getting into actual racing very quick and simple.All in all, this a top-notch game that I would highly recommend to all Vita owners!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2012"}

This one, the sequel is also cel-shaded stealth based game, but this time the little levels are replaced with a few giant episodes with multiple missions within that episodes.There are three characters that can be controlled, Bentley, a little turtle with bombs, Murray, a hippo with punching power, or the character you'll primarily play as, Sly, a racoon who can jump and pickpocket.  There are eight episodes, each one requires either one of the characters to move towards one place in the level in order for the mission to start.  Each mission usually consists of pickpocketting or sneaking around with Sly, smashing or carrying stuff with Murray, , or participating in a mini mission with Bentley (either a 2-D flying shooter or a low tech move a triangle through an obstacle course thingy - both are pretty boring).While the description is pretty basic, the unfortunate thing is that that is pretty much it.  For 20 hours, you will constantly move traverse to one part of a level, which is sometimes not trivial, view a slideshow, do a few of the things described above, and repeat over and over again.  The eight episodes are different looking in some aspects, but it's still the same thing over and over again.  After a while I find myself screaming at the game, \"Sly can pickpocket, I get it, can I do something different?\"The good thing is that the game engine is fantastic.  The jumping, the sneaking, the graphics, the controls are all well done.  If they shortened the game, added some different types of missions, and removed a lot of the repetitiveness, it would be one of the greatest games ever.  Another great thing is that even though most of the missions are the same, you rarely repeat parts of a mission because if you die or get caught, you usually don't have to start the whole mission over again.  It really cuts down on the frustration.  Also, the game is really balanced in terms of difficulty.  It's never really hard at any one point, and the later levels don't leave a bad taste in your mouth like other games where the make the final parts of the game nearly impossible.In terms of graphics, it's overall very well done.  Usually an episode consists of a small town, castle or prison that is both cartoony (in a good way), yet very detailed.  A lot of time and effort was done making the episodes.  The only problem I had was that color scheme was pretty similar, making it look monochromatic after a while.The movies are decent, though most of it was in slide shows format, but you still get a lot without interrupting the action.All in all, it's quite a different game from the first one.  In some aspects it's much, much better, but overall, it just wasn't as fun.Pros:Huge levels require lots of exploringGood mixture of stealth and thieveryRequires little repeating of missionNever really stuck at any one placeGood graphicsNo guide requiredGood balanceCons:Same basic missions over and over againRequires traversing the same terrain over and over againJust plain annoying after a whileMini games are stupid and lameTime to complete: 20 hoursFrustration level: low/mediumDifficultly level: low","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2004"}

It might not have a vast amount of songs compared to the last two but surprisingly (with my little knowledge of the Beatles) pretty much all the songs are great to sing, play with the guitar, and so on.The game has a lot of quality through its cutscenes that take you through the life of The Beatles. They don't spell out everything but they are nice and while playing, if you ace a song with 4 or 5 stars, you will open up videos, pictures, and stuff to detail the life of the band. It has all that you would expect in multiplayer from tug-o-war to playing co-op. The inclusion of being able to have two people sing along through the tracks was a great addition.

I'm not always the best, but typically I score well and participate in the objectives instead of hiding. Despite this, I can play Marksman or Tactician. I don't touch the other classes becuase I don't have enough of their equipment unlocked to make them worth playing. Where CoD excels is giving you everything fast and letting you decide to give it back via prestige. BFBC2 had more to unlock and you earned those unlocks very quickly by playing the class the way they were meant to be played. In KZ3, prepare to play as a Tac, battle to capture a spawn point, often taking multiple deaths and time from the  higher paying objectives for a whopping 50XP - only 350,000 to go until my next 3 unlock points are open. The pacing here does not reward players for playing at a high level in their given class like MAG or BFBC (where a medic can earn more points for *gasp* being a medic on the field than sheer number of kills). Instead, you ultimately are trying to earn as many kills as possible while participating in objectives is secondary.Second - lobbies. KZ2 was the gold standard for setting up both custom matches that anyone could join or private matches that still awarded XP. Getting a group of friends together to play against other clans or against each other gave KZ2 serious legs. It was simple to set up and typically worked without a hitch. That is gone here in favor of a simple 8 man squad. No private matches or lobbies. And since there is zero customization in regards to game types, you basically only have 1 way to play. That may have worked 3 years ago, but this is a serious step back from KZ2 and what the market offers today.Where KZ3 has failed is making a game that I want to put 100+ hours into. Despite the flaws of MW2 or Black Ops, those games keep me coming back for that next level. BFBC2 & MAG have better squad dynamics and the pacing for unlocking items is far superior. It's shame, had they simply updated the classes a bit and gave the crowd some new maps, the game would have been far superior. Unfortunately, only a month in and all of my clan mates are drifting back to CoD & BFBC until the next big shooter hits this fall.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K6DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"Killzone 3:  3x the fun and 3x the experience","reviewText":"I've been a big fan of Killzone since it came out on the PS2.  With each game the developer has taken slow but SOLID steps in creating a strong FPS game that refuses to pull its punches.  Each installment improves upon the existing and Killzone 3 doesn't disappoint.  The rumors of a short campaign, blotchy storyline, etc are very overblown. Not only does Killzone 3 deliver a solid, faster paced single player campaign than the previous installment, but the Multi-Player is some of the most addictive I've experienced.GAMEPLAY - Single PlayerIf you played Killzone 2, better yet... the KZ3 SP demo you know what to expect.  I actually found the controls of the final product smoother than the demo. There was more response to the aiming and I even had to turn down my sensitivity from what I had been playing the demo at.  The campaign of the game easily spans about 6-8 hours or did so for me, which is far better than the 4-5 hrs some review sites were claiming.  They either rushed through the game or played it on Easy (which is no fun, you feel like a god on Easy mode)  Combat is fast yet smooth with the enemy AI being quite smart in how it combats you.  You can see there was a very high polish put into the Helghast AI as they will consistently take cover, blind fire and work to create flanking setups on you.  If you played through Killzone 2's campaign KZ3 has a similar setup to how it progresses(cutscene, tons of combat/action, cutscene... rinse and repeat)  The gameplay gets changed up consistently. You can go from ground n' pound style  to suddenly on a tank turret back to ground pounding then suddenly in a mech then flying a jetpack etc.  There are some rail shooter events (clearly designed for the MOVE controller support) but they actually do a great job giving you a break from being a foot soldier.  Overall, the single player campaign has quite a lot to offer with plenty of variety and embracing you in a true feeling of war.Multiplayer - Not my strong point but the MP is actually enjoyable.  If you played the KZ3 MP demo there isn't much that has changed other than new maps and some small improvements.  The MP setup is the best Killzone has offered yet and might even give Call of Duty a run for its money on the PS3.  While the MP might not be for everyone it is definitely worth checking out and has a lot of potential for some great competitive matches.STORY/SOUNDKillzone is pretty much the story of the ISA and Helghast war.  First Helghast invades the ISA, the ISA counter and Killzone 3 picks up right where Killzone 2 ends.  Don't expect an award winning storyline here but it is present.  Killzone 3 focuses this time on the ISA efforts to escape as well as the internal workings of the Helghast leaders.  It provides more depth than the previous games while not being to overly chatty.  Killzone 3 does a better job presenting the story than Killzone 2 did I feel, but it also brings to light the storyline is very weak.  However, story was never really Killzone's main object.  ***  The Audio in KZ3 is fantastic.  Guns sound powerful, AI units and Helghast enemies sound very life like.  Ambient noise is incredible especially during firefights.  You can tell they worked really hard polishing this game so that the audio effects help immerse you into the gameplay.GRAPHICSI don't even have to say much here.  The graphics look amazing.  While they aren't jaw dropping nor give you \"awe factor\" like sun sets and stuff; Killzone 3 uses its powerful graphic engine to give you a very realistic feel of the battle.  Snow, water, fire, gun shots.. it all looks amazing and creates stunning environments.  The only negative I could say about the graphics is that when you go to a cut-scene the character textures don't look nearly as good as the weapon and level textures.  But, we all know we're playing Killzone 3 for the in game action not looking at how bad Sev needs a new haircut ^_^REPLAY/LENGTHAs said earlier, for me the SP campaign on NORMAL clocked in at 6-8 hrs give or take.  The campaign was a ton of fun and just like Killzone 2  I could see myself playing through it quite a few times to try for some trophies, or just to own some Helghast.  What truely boosts the length and replay-ability of this game is the MP.  I wasn't fond of KZ2's multiplayer so while KZ2 had lots of SP replay for me, it did lack that MP edge.  KZ3 however comes to the table with all cylinders firing. While SP is def worth replaying, the MP is what is worth keeping this game within arms reach at all times.  Even if you are not competitive(casual like me), the MP is fun with plenty of features to keep you occupied for some time.OVERALL (91% 9.1/A-)Killzone 3 didn't disappoint. It has been a long wait and well worth it.  The MP is better than expected and the SP-campaign exceeded my expectations.  I would give this game overall a 91% (9.1/10).  The game fired on all cylinders and what small negatives I encountered were far from game breaking.  The only real gripes I would take I found in the SP-campaign.1. The ISA voice acting wasn't really that good.  There was no sense of urgency in their voices and it just felt like they were reading lines (except for Rico, Sev and Jammer they had some great voice acting, as did the Helghast)2. Sometimes the Objective marker would simply bug out.  When I would try to tag where I had to go nothing would appear and my objectives menu would be empty (but I clearly had to destroy 2 more tanks or set a door charge somewhere). Minor annoyance3. Melee damaged doors to open them oddly, I would Melee the door and about a second later it would explode.  Weird lag, only was happening on the interactive doors you could break.Outside of those 3 issues the game was pretty much a fantastic FPS that well warrants a 91% score. It delivers a solid SP campaign experience and outstanding MP setup. A MUST BUY for any FPS fan** v1.03 was released 2/24/2011  this version has fixed Issue 2 and Issue 3 on my end **","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K6DG","description":"","reviewerName":"T. H. Johnson","summary":"Multiplayer review +storymode +move","reviewText":"I just got Killzone 3 a few days ago and so far I have only played the multiplayer so I'm sticking with just a review of that. Also, so far I have mainly played the Guerilla Warfare portion of the multiplayer. I have yet to fully explore botzone, et al.The GoodI love the fact that you can choose your class right away and switch at anytime before spawning, this gave me a chance to try out all of the classes and decide which ones I liked the most. Of course I loved engineer the best, I worked with it alot in KZ2 but being able to fix things right away and level up through that plus unlock class specific abilities and weapons is great. I loved the addition of fixing up a container of ammo for my teammates and destroying the enemies work and rebuilding it.  I'm also exteremly glad not to have that freaking shotgun. That was actually the one thing I didn't like about being an engineer.  The second class I love is the medic. I've also played one in KZ2 and i love the unlockables for it and love the addition of a bot to cover me while I'm trying to heal teammates.Sorry I can't speak much about the other classes as I have had very little experience with them.Now the BadI love being a medic in KZ2 but not so much in KZ3, aside from the unlockables and cover bot there isn't much use for a medic. In KZ2 I could get teammates up from a distance, in KZ3 I have to actually go up to the fallen teammate to get them up which is stupid for a support class to do. Especially with players running all over the map in stealth or disguise, or when their are marksman sniping from up high. There is very little you can do to get to a fallen teammate unless they are right next to you and even then you'll end up dead staying in that spot trying to help them. And speaking of the map and running around. The maps don't seem to have much structure to them as they do in KZ2. In KZ2 you had a basecamp with the option to spawn someplace else in the action. In KZ3 you are spawned wherever they put you and the area is always unsafe so you have to be ready to move. Nice touch, sort of, but someimes I like the option of starting at a safe place then preparing myself to enter combat. Or the fun times when you're holded up in your camp fighting off the enemy and you can actually do something as a team. In KZ3 the sense of team work is kinda gone. Even in KZ2's bodycount, some sort of team work had to go into getting the most kills. In KZ2 the maps were well thought out and you felt like you where actually going somewhere, in KZ3 it's just a big mess of areas and you feel like you're running in circles.  Also IMO, there doesn't even seem like there is much for the tactican to even do. They can't even lay down spawn spots, nor have I seen any benefits to having a tactican around except the extra firepower and run around with their bots, but actually capturing real areas or suprising an enemy by holding an area and creating a spawn spot, gone. nope you just spawn wherever. Teammork is so dead people don't even talk much because there isn't much to say because no planning goes into anything that's really happening on the map.IMO, They could have just added some of the things from KZ3 into KZ2. The bots for the medic, engineer, and tactican. The classes from the start, the unlockables, the jobs you can do in the game that could get you points, like repairing weapons and ammo containers, bots et al. It would have just made KZ2 even better than it already is. Also add more maps to KZ2 and more missions in warzone.  Of course whoever designed the maps in KZ3 should be shot. They are all horrible and I can't think of a single map I would consider a real favorite. After a while you get used to the maps but the design and structure makes tactical desicion making nonexistent. it's just a bunch of chaos, running around, and brutal kills and after a while it gets dull. I will still play the multiplayer because of the stuff I do like, the engineer, but while I'm playing KZ2 I'll be wishing that some of the KZ3 improvements where added, and be glad that most of them weren't.P.S. I could be wrong, but another thing that sucks is not being able to change factions before entering. so far I have tried to find a way to do that but have been unsuccessful. So taking away the player's right to pick the faction they want to join gives it another negative point for me.--------------------Okay I played around with multiplayer some more and I have to say that I really like operations and botzone. The map spawning seems better here and the cut scenes in operation is a neat addition.----------------------Storymode reviewHonestly don't play for the story. It's not as interesting as KZ2. In KZ2 they seemed to open the door for the possiblity that the Helghast weren't that bad, now that was thrown away in favor of a rushed story that was over before you even get a chance to get into it. Rico is still a crap character but it's obvious the developers love him. They added a \"Hot chick\" who basically doesn't add to the story. And the game was so rushed the developers didn't even have time to sync the voice audio with the video in the cut scenes. It was like I was watching an old chinese movie where the lips keep flapping loooong after the audio ended.-----------------------PS Move? don't bother, it's just very hard to caliberate and awful to play when you think it is caliberated. I even went to a message board to see how others are doing and many have said the same thing. I haven't played other fps games so i can't personally compare but I've heard that other fps games did a better job with the PS move.Okay now I'm done :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2011"}

I honestly have nothing to complain about here.- The story while multifaceted, was engaging to the very end.- The controls were flawless and the combat is the best I've ever played in a video game.- The graphics have improved since the last Batman Arkham game, especially with the character models. (They're no longer bulky and freaky looking)But...Both Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City had side challenges created by a villain known as the Riddler. These challenges involved hunting down glowing question marks, performing certain moves and image capturing certain objects in the world. Arkham Asylum had 240 challenges while Arkham City almost doubles this. The problem is you get ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for doing these challenges except a trophy/achievement. After spending countless hours jumping through unnecessary hoops, I would like to be rewarded with something a little less useless than a digital trophy (like an alternate costume or something).I know this seems minor all things considered, but it is something that bothered me immensely, enough to remove a star from my rating. I enjoy being rewarded for things like this, otherwise it all begins to feel like busy work.One more thing.

You move from mission to mission, working your way towards your objective.There are mini-games in there as well to test your button mashing skills. Unforuntately the very first one is to have a stripper dance around a pole to distract the bouncers. That's a pretty clear indication that the game isn't meant for those under 18.The gunfighting gives options for slo-mo scenes, with you diving and shooting people as you go. An adrenaline gauge tracks how many of these you can do. When you get into hand-to-hand combat, you can use combinations of kicks, punches and more to take out your opponents. So the game turns into a full fledged 3D fighting game.The areas you play in are well done - not perhaps cutting edge graphics, but still rather complex. The strip club, for example, has a variety of lighting and the marble floors reflect them all quite accurately. You have a variety of weapons to use and puzzles to sort through.

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

In fact, the image resolution on the Game Boy Advance's screen is greater than that of some HDTV's.  The Game Boy Advance has incredible sound and the speakers can play louder.  The sound is even better with headphones.  A nice added touch is the power light--It is green with new batteries, but turns red when there is 20-30% battery left and the light slowly fades out.All these improvements are very helpful and amazingly have virtually no effect on the size.  The GBA still fits easily in your pocket and is only about a centimeter or longer and wider.  In addition, the GBA has two shoulder buttons on top that aid in game-play.The game paks are half the size of old game boy games but the GBA still plays all 1000+ Game Boy games already released.  Due to the smaller size of the new games, the old Game Boy games stick out the top half-way, which is disappointing.I would say that the Game Boy Advance is a very well designed portable gaming system and definately well worth its low price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2002"}

Players will take the role of Frank Simmons as he tracks down his brother, who went missing on a trak into the Himalayas to find an ancient Buddhist Artifact","reviewerName":"bunnyrabbit4","summary":"Great Graphics, Interesting Storyline...weak controls","reviewText":"Cursed mountain is a very well illustrated game that conveys the sense of being in an isolated and virtually abandoned Tibetan mountain village that has fallen under some kind of evil curse. I like the use of references to Tibetan culture and hope that more game designers began to work to bring more of these exotic cultures to life. I think the game could have benefited from using more of the rituals, for instance the Tibetan death ceremonies in the storyline and relying less on a \"seek objects and do battle\" format. Just walking around this local is interesting, until you have to do battle with the ghosts who have taken over the town.As good as the Wii can be at some things, I find that combat is not always one of them.These battles involve coordinating several remote actions. Once you have added a spiritual component to your pick axe, (which happens very early in the game) you have to manipulate both the remote and the nunchuk in order to successfully combat the phantoms. The C button on the nunchuk must be depressed so that you can use your third eye and activate your spirit weapon. The B button on the Wii remote is pressed to fire your weapon and the A button must be held down to do rituals which involve moving the remote and/or nunchuk in specific ways to dispel the ghost once it is wounded.This would be great if the Wii remote worked better. Finding the cursor (as you probably know from playing other games),especially with hungry ghosts bearing down, can be as challenging as aiming it. At other times your are able to aim it, but nothing happens in the game. The movements needed to completely dispel the ghosts are complicated and it is very hard to know whether you are doing them wrong or if the remote is just not fully conveying them. I found what works best is a frenzy of heavy shaking in all directions (including a strong wrist snap forward since this is the remote/nunchuk's weakest direction).Seeing during combat is another issue. You are always following your character rather than seeing through their eyes. The + control pad is supposed to change to first person, but it doesn't do much and can not be used with the third eye in battle. The minute the third eye is activated your movement is also curtailed.  When the attacker is close, you often find yourself blocking your own view of combat and looking at your back. Moving to the side makes it very hard to aim your weapon correctly.Perhaps my least favorite thing about the game is that you are forced to submit to the auto-save feature. I hate games that make you replay major sequences over and over. To me that is boring, and very frustrating when you are forced to repeat major battle scenes.As Wii games go, Cursed Mountain is a very good looking game, with excellent graphics and sound. It is reasonably enjoyable even with the flaws. Exploring the exotic locals and learning about Tibetan culture are interesting enough to make this worth playing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2009"}

I have played and beaten the prequel thoroughly, even getting the extra ending for finding all the Precursor Orbs. I loved the game from one end to the other.When Jak 2 opens, it's clear that the story will be taking a new turn into a dark place:  our heroes are in a bad future, and we take control of Jak only after an interval (told through cutscenes) of his having been tortured and mutated.  It seemed to make for an interesting new take on the series, but very quickly you realize that unlike its predecessor, Jak II imitates more than it innovates.  Even worse, the imitation isn't even in the same genre:  Jak 2 dovetails its platformer formula into a more \"sandboxed\" open world that heavily mimics the Grand Theft Auto series.  I've played the GTA series and loved it, but here the fusion fails miserably.  As the storyline progresses, frustrating side quests and attempts to inject variety into the gameplay are quickly derailed by the fact that a single mistake blows the entire operation, bumping into someone during a race can trigger a full alert, and you can easily get shot out of the sky, have your vehicle explode out from under you, or find yourself surrounded by a never-ending stream of guards.I'd like to say the awfulness ends there, but unfortunately the amount of effort quickly outweighs the payoff.  There are times when \"puzzles\" amount to \"how often can you kill/smash things before you're caught and killed?\"  In more than one sequence, you become convinced that Jack Thompson has finally found his \"murder simulator\":  the goal is to bang on the trigger, again and again, as fast as you can, while guards die screaming at your feet.  The difficulty is balanced by a bonus \"Dark Jak\" feature that makes you super-powerful. However this feature gets seriously annoying: it takes a lot of dark eco collecting to charge it up, and during these murder-fest stretches, it's all too easy to accidentally bang the lower trigger and blow your charge.  If you plan to use this power burst to get yourself through a difficult spot, if you don't survive to the checkpoint, you won't have it available to you again because there won't be enough Dark Eco lying around to recharge you.Where I finally gave up on this game--at the 94% mark--was when the number of pointless conveyor belts with hard-to-reach switches over boiling lava and/or radiation pits made me realize that this was no longer \"challenging\", it was more like a test to see how angry the player could get before they take the disc out and throw it against the wall.  I have beaten many a game and put up with many, many death sequences, and in the end Jak killed my desire to go on far deader than any of the bodies I'd stacked along the way.  Not clever, not fun for long, and not recommended.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00095LIC0","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"Different but still fun.","reviewText":"Recently I was finally able to get Kirby Canvas Curse. The game got tons of great feedback when it came out years ago, and is still placed in a lot of top 20 DS games lists. That surprised me, especially given how many great DS games there are now. It's a good game despite not feeling like a Kirby game. But hey, if you were sick of going around sucking up enemies this could be for you.Gameplay is pretty simple- Kirby is rolled into a ball and you have to navigate him through each stage while defeating enemies and solving some puzzles here and there. You draw lines on the touch screen which act as bridges, walls or platforms so he can keep going. Tap Kirby to propel him forward and if there's a gap in the floor, draw a line over it so he doesn't fall. It's easy for the first couple of worlds, but later on the difficulty spikes up a bit and you'll need to be fast with the stylus. You can tap enemies on the screen to stun them, and once Kirby touches them, they're toast. Some have powers that Kirby can use, most of which you'll be familiar with if you've played previous Kirby games (flame, needle, rock, etc.). After you clear three stages in each world, you'll get to face one of three boss challenges. Each one's different: one puts Kirby in the roll of the BreakOut ball, another has you racing and collecting food, and the other simply has you connect the dots. And once the worlds are done, there's the final boss. Though there are also special tokens you can collect in each stage that net you a little something special at the end too.Unlike any other Kirby game, Canvas Curse is refreshing, but doesn't feel like a Kirby game to me. There's no flying, eating enemies, or animal buddies. Kirby stays in ball form the whole game. It took me a little while to get used to controling him exclusively with the stylus, but I got the hang of it after a few stages. When you draw lines, you can go a good length before using up your ink and needing it to refill, so go nuts with the bridges. Sometimes it got annoying when I needed Kirby to go in a different direction, especially on small platforms, because you need to draw a wall and propel him toward it so he goes the other way. 'kinda wish there were more boss fights than just the 3 main ones too, but it's not that big of a deal. Also, make sure you collect every star when you can, because the game doesn't hand out 1ups very often.The graphics look good still today, and there wasn't any slowdown when I played. Some of the later stages have just plain beautiful designs, often looking like abstract art. There were times when I'd let Kirby stay still so I could enjoy the scenery. Likewise for the music- a lot of it's memorable, something I haven't said for a Kirby game since Kirby's Dreamland 2 over 10 years ago.If you can find a copy of Canvas Curse and love Kirby, it'd be hard to not recommend it to you. Just keep in mind what the gameplay's like and give it a half hour or so before deciding if you don't like it. With all the hidden tokens, it should keep you coming back for a while.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2010"}

There is no pretense about depth and complexity.  You will do two things, shoot lots of stuff and dodge lots of bullets.  That having been said, S&P2; is a shining example of a genre.  In many respects I compare the game to Nintendo's Star Fox or Sega's Panzer Dragoon since those are the two closest modern comparisons I can think of.GAMEPLAY: S&P2; sticks to the classic design of some of the oldest shooters out there.  There are no power-ups, alternate weapons, or any other gimmicks.  There are two characters to choose from.  Both play very similar, but the difference is how their charge-up shots work.  Both characters also have the ability dodge, jump, and fly.  Beyond that, the concept is simple... shoot everything that moves and blast away massive boss enemies.  This game relies on brilliant level designs and boss fights, which is a welcome breath of fresh air to the genre.  Some levels are strictly 3D where you shoot everything ahead of you and others are truly old-school 2D scrolling levels.  The transition between the two level types is seamless and I didn't even realize it happened until several minutes after slipping into a 2D level.  Unexpected but very welcome.PRESENTATION:  S&P2; is basically a huge chain of impressive boss battles strung together with short sections filled to the brim with enemies.  Killing more than 600 enemies on a single level isn't unheard of.  The storyline that ties this game together is pretty bad, basically giving the player a taste of some of the worst anime script writing I have suffered through.  The voice actors sound bored and it is pretty obvious they didn't put much effort into their recording.  I couldn't tell you what is going on in the story only because the voice acting and script is so painful to watch I end up skipping it every time so I can get back to the shooting.  But seriously, this is a shooter and anyone who picks up any game in this genre is going to buy it for the action, not the story.GRAPHICS: Sometimes S&P2; is beautiful and sometimes it is just a little bit too old-school for its own good.  Many of the graphic textures are very low resolution.  The character models are stiff, bland, and jagged looking, especially on the menu screens and during cut-scenes.  In many respects it looks only like a cleaned up N64 game.  Other times the game has really impressed me with neat lighting effects that I didn't expect.  The game shines the most when it is in motion.CONTROLS: The Wii is a perfect choice for a game like this.  The nunchuck controls movement and the pointer allows for precision blasting.  Top notch.DIFFICULTY: There are three levels of difficulty, Easy, Medium, and Hard.  One thing that I like is that bosses seem to have different phases or patterns depending upon the difficulty, which is a nice way of changing things up. Kudos to the designers for this.  On easy mode I almost never die.  On medium I have found that I usually have to fight most bosses two or three times in order to beat them.  The difficulty feels almost perfectly balanced to give me a challenging experience without frustrating me.VALUE: This is a short game.  Playing through on Easy mode will probably only take about 6 hours, maybe a bit longer.  A two-player mode is present, but the 2nd player only controls another shooting reticule and doesn't have the ability to charge their shots.  It is a nice addition but so much more could have been done with it.THE SINFUL:+++ Smooth, fast-paced action throughout the entire game+++ Interesting levels with interactive environments+++ Awesome boss battles with huge screen-dominating enemies+++ Perfect controls+++ A focus on quality levels and bosses that proves gimmicks and power-ups are not necessary.THE PUNISHING:--- Some of the graphics are pretty ugly, being only a step or two above N64 quality in parts.--- The game is short, which is honestly pretty expected with this genre.--- A terrible story with voice actors that sound bored out of their skulls.For any fan of the old scrolling shooter genre or any fan of Star Fox or Panzer Dragoon: Buy this game.  This is a shining example of a dying genre that definitely deserves a little more love.  Everyone else should probably just rent the game to see if they like it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2010"}

Anyway,  I was so excited to find out why cyrax became cyber cyrax,  and I even got to play with his human form and such in story mode.  I felt so bad for Scorpian,  even worse for Subzero.  Raiden is amazing in the story as well.  Oh I even learned some history about kitana,  and gosh... that Mileena girl is a freak.  I'm trying so hard to not give a y story mode spoilers.Oh,  okay. So there's this challenge tower, full of 300 challenges.  It's so fun,  once you hit 25 you ding a achievement then another for completing 100... But some challenges are tough as well..Online play right now is laggy and takes forever.. Not sure if a update will correct this.  The game itself comes with a online play code which will activate the online play,  (meaning don't buy the game used or else you buy the code from xbox.  one time use only).The ladder/arcade has some hidden fights (so fun, I love secrets and they ding achievevements).  The ladder is fairly easy to complete.  Complete it with every char and ding a achievement.The graphics are superb and absolutely stunning.  I am very happy with this game,  I am still playing it,  I've only had it about a week now,  but I'm loving it.  I'm sure any fighting game fan or Mortal Kombat fan will feel the same.  It's so worth getting.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"A great free roam title for fans of the genre.","reviewText":"I have never been a fan of the GTA series. I was always partial to the Driver franchise. I always liked Driver because it had better graphics. Then GTA 4 came out and based on a lot of good reviews and bought it. All those reviews were right. The graphics were actually very well done to my surprise. The game play was simple and easy to pick up. The realism of this game surprised me the most. You actually have to break to take turns unlike in most other free roam games where you just turn and somehow the car makes it. The story is pretty well done with some interesting choices involved. The game actually has two endings based on your decision.Presentation- The game does capture New York City very well. There are a lot of people walking around including hookers. The music is based on a radio system where you can change to different stations to hear the music you like. The one complaint I have is that the game is a little dark even during midday. 4/5Graphics- The graphics look pretty good. The cars show a lot of damage and the people themselves look pretty lifelike. Some of the people could have been modeled a little better, but this world is huge and it is a small complaint. There are also some weird glitches in car damage, but not overly distracting. 4.5/5Story- The story is pretty well done. It develops nicely over the length of the campaign. Some of the side missions are a little to far fetched, but the core missions are well developed. There is a lot of variety, the use of cut scenes help, and the ability to choose between different actions helps to lead the story in different directions. 4.5/5Game play- The realistic car steering is a nice touch that adds to the realism. The only main gripe I have is that you have to tap X to run. Why couldn't they just make it hold the X button instead of tap it? There are a lot of cars to choose from, but the cover system could've been done better. I rarely used it. The auto aim is nice, but can be turned off if desired. It would have been nice if there was more customization, but I'm sure they'll add it into GTA V. The online free roam is a nice touch and has added to the replay value of this title. 4.3/5Lasting Appeal- This game takes about 30-40 hours to beat. It is an engrossing journey that you must finish. There is a lot of time spent free roaming the city as well. This city is massive and full of secrets. The online adds some fun for you and your buddies to enjoy. 5/5The Verdict- This game was a surprise to me as someone who was not a fan of its predecessors. I have devoted many hours to this game and I still love running away from the cops and doing jumps with some buddies online. This game does have its drawbacks, but overall it's a great free roam adventure. 4.5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2009"}

The best part of the game is just swinging around... its so cool you will almost get dizzy on it. Moreover, you can pull-off some style combos while flying around and this will get you energy back and make you have even more fun. Its like having an SSX3 game put into a super hero game.Plot: 7 out of 10. The game follows squarely the movie, adding however a bunch of side quests. Side quests do get sort of weak after a while, though.The Bottom Line:This is truly a well done game!

{"product_name":"B00005V6BB","description":"Medal of Honor: Frontlinemarks the debut of the Medal of Honor franchise on the PlayStation2. InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"George Rownd","summary":"It's a good FPS and war buffs will love it","reviewText":"This game has great graphics, THE BEST SOUNDING GUNSHOTS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE THERE.

I frankly thought it sounded odd for a game, and boring, but once you get into the game it's a lot of fun. The writing is good, the characters are interesting, and the city is vibrant. The city can be explored and is massive, though limited, intentionally, in terms of the sandbox that you might be used to from GTA games. You are a cop after all. Pedestrians are much, much more alert to manics driving through town, and while they can be killed, it takes some work!The cases are interesting and while you can usually stumble your way through, if you interview individuals poorly, or miss clues, you're likely to blow the case. While the action isn't significant for a video game, it feels that way as you assume your character and play through the story. There are some chases and shootouts, though nothing major. Your partners are varied and colorful, and sometimes help with the case. At the very least they say funny things if you drive like I do.It is definitely worth checking out and it's nice to have this kind of story based, interactive game available along side all the other genres of gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

You can change the look of your character and play as a knight, a vampire, a soccer player or create your own look. I also enjoyed customizing my sword so that it reaches across the screen to stab enemies.While the overworld graphics look great, the underworld takes a hit. The graphics in the dungeons and caves become a bit repetitive though there is some good level design down there. The puzzles are moderately challenging but not too hard to figure out. I'd put the difficulty of this game as less than \"A Link to the Past\" on the SNES.In fact, the map even has an indicator of which dungeon you should visit next so you will not be wasting hours trying to figure out where you are supposed to go.3D Dot Game Heroes is a rare example of a game that can appeal to older players through the sense of nostalgia and yet offer a reasonable challenge for younger players.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2011"}

The problem with video games today is that we all know about the games 1-2 years before they even come out. By the time you FINALLY play it after it's been hyped up and advertised to the end of the earth, it's boring immediately because you know and have seen all the characters, you know the story, you know what's gonna be in the game. It spoils the new game experience. Obviously based on all the hype and excitement you would assume the game is gonna be the best game ever even though you haven't spent a second actually playing it. So you buy it the day it comes out or in some cases pre-order it? and 3 months later you sell it on Ebay cause it's boring. Only with watch dogs it took me a day to get bored. GTA V was really boring after you beat the story, but this was boring period.. So glad i didn't fall for the hype, i made that mistake already with GTA V.Open world games just aren't good anymore and they haven't been since 2008's Grand theft auto 4. For as long as it takes for these open world games to be developed they get boring incredibly fast. GTA 4 got everything right: Gameplay, story, characters, REPLAY VALUE (Missing from watch dogs and gta V), and the fun factor. Plus the Driving wasn't great but at least it wasn't boring. Speaking of driving the driving in watch dogs? Terrible and boring and so is the sound of the cars. Ubisoft should really stick to Assassin's creed because Watch Dogs is a really boring game especially considering it took 6 years to develop. What a shame..","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2014"}

{"product_name":"B003O6CB6S","description":"","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"Feels like shovel ware, buyer beware","reviewText":"Call of Duty: Ghosts is a scathing indictment of how tired and drained the formula has become for the modern First Person Shooter.Game play: Taking a step back from Call of Duty: Black Ops II, Ghosts has you herded down one path. You enter shooting galleries, kill all the baddies and then control is taken away from you while some scripted event happens. This outlines every single mission. The scripted events are what ruin the experience the most. Simple things such as opening doors are restricted from the player; you have to wait for your A.I partners to open the doors. How insulting is it when the player is not allowed to even open a door? Not surprisingly this is not a new development, as all modern shooters exhibit this bewildering behavior in an attempt to make the game feel more cinematic. Ghosts feels like a roller coaster ride. You're stuck on rails, forced to see the experience as the developer wants you too, for better or ill. Invisible walls and barriers ensure that you won't jump ahead or miss some spectacular set piece that you have no control over. Its maddening to think that developers are still shoveling out games like this.  Ghosts was touted as the next generation Call of Duty, meant to complement the next generation of gaming consoles. Don't be fooled; this is the same Call of Duty as all the other Call of Duty's. Worse yet, its leagues below the Black Ops II, as if the primary goal was to de-evolve the franchise.Graphics: Most disappointing. First of all, textures look just as poor and bland as is known for the Call of Duty franchise. Assets are re-used for many of the environments. Shadows are ugly blotches and terrain is massively low-rez. For all the talk of this title being next generation everything looks so ugly. In fact, Ghosts looks graphically worse than Black Ops II, which came out a few years ago. I'd imagine its due to Ghosts being developed for current-gen platforms as well as the next gen consoles, with the end result being ported to the PC. So what PC gamers get is a very ugly game that attempts to offer some dazzling fidelity. If you check the graphics settings it has quite a few features to toggle, but the end result is still a very low-rez experience. Worst of all, Ghosts is poorly optimized for PC, tanking frame rates and stuttering occurred for me during every mission. I'm running a GTX 660ti, which is not a new card by any means, but I'm able to run Battlefield 4 on High settings so you'd think that I could run Ghosts on full since the graphical difference between the two games is like comparing a wonderfully shot picture to a crayola-smeared child's drawing.Audio: Oscar Mike this, Oscar Mike that, Ghosts is full of these wonderful cliche's and tiring military jargon that we've come to loathe. Character dialogue is  shallow end at best and everything else is forgettable. Don't look for an epic soundtrack or anything memorable, because you won't find it.Multiplayer: Perhaps the most disappointing feature of Call of Duty: Ghosts. Stuttering, frame rate drops, server lag, and an overall inferior experience to Black Ops II. The maps aren't great, the weapon selection feels smaller, and a lot of the game modes from previous Call of Duty games have been stripped down or removed entirely. Otherwise, if you've played any of the other Call of Duty multiplayers, you've played this one. The only 'new' feature introduced here is the ability to fully customize your avatar, even choosing gender (Welcome to the 21st century).What I'm saying is buyer beware. If you're a Black Ops II player I'd say stick with that,as it is superior to Ghosts in every way possible. Call of Duty: Ghosts is a stark reminder that modern First Person shooters need to change, and fast.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SZ836","description":"","reviewerName":"Brendan Ross","summary":"Honestly one of the most entertaining games I have ever played","reviewText":"Borderlands 2 is not a complicated game.  It's a first person shooter (FPS) which is focused on all-out shooting and looting.  And more shooting.  And more looting.  And then some more.What makes the game so entertaining, then?There are a few key areas.  The first is the setting and the characters, both of which are steeped in humor and pure entertainment value.  The graphical \"style\" of Borderlands 2 contributes to this -- it follows from the original Borderlands in following an animated comic book style of graphics, but upgrades this significantly with lighting and colors beyond what we saw in the original.  This graphical style is supremely appropriate for the kind of setting and characters, and humor, that the game contains, because the game is not aiming for a \"realistic\" feel, but rather a more contrived, less serious, more funny, and ultimately more entertaining one.  And this works to beat the band.  It keeps the game light-hearted and fun, which makes it a great game to play after work in the evening as compared with a more \"serious\" game.Another core area that makes the game great is the loot/leveling model.  Although the game doesn't feature the same loot explosion/loot pinata effect of the original, nevertheless loot keeps flowing, and one of the core enjoyments of the game is comparing and optimizing your loadouts.  And many of the weapons are just very, very entertaining to use.  In addition, each class has a signature power which can be built upon and upgraded and which defines playstyles that are markedly different for each class despite the fact that the game is essentially a shoot and loot game.The game is, in many ways, a hybrid of the loot system of an \"action RPG\" like Diablo or Torchlight, on the one hand, and a first person shooter, on the other, with a lot of humor thrown into the mix.  It makes for a very entertaining game to unwind with, and ultimately an enjoyable and relaxing gaming experience.  Frankly, this game is just pure fun to pick up and play, even if you are not generally a shooter fan.  Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"Clayton J. Gibbs \"Horror Soundtrack Collector\"","summary":"Extremely Linear","reviewText":"While Castlevania has been a varied experience throughout the years, this update is in a round-about way a combination of them all.  You've got the varied enemies, the nice backdrops and the beautiful soundtrack, but it feels all too linear to me.  Sure, you can re-play levels after gaining new skills, but it's not like the old castlevania where you had to back-track or navigate using a map system.  My other turn-off were the upgrades.  Instead of upgrading equipment, you upgrade skills, which in turn, makes the game heavily reliant upon combat button combinations.  Somehow, this all reminds me of Dantes Inferno.  The environments are great, but it's obvious that there is only one path to go on and it's a lot of short-lived levels.  The enemies may look different, but they are all played very much the same.  I got bored rolling around and slashing or fighting giants via 'Shadow of Collosus'.  I guess I didn't find this game as awe-insspiring as others in the series or other great games out there like 'Uncharted'.  Seems to me the gaming industry is skimping great potential games such as this and some of us are forced to accept a mediocre experience.  Even as a die-hard castlevanie fan, I'm not all that thrilled to own this game and several times I've gotten bored and set it down for ssomething else.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2011"}

Taylor \"runman\"","summary":"Good System but toooooo slow","reviewText":"I did not pre-order the system, but a local big retailer had several in store that were not pre-ordered, so I was luck enough to get one.  To my disappointment, TVii is not out for this device yet.The controller/touch pad it interesting, mostly responsive to touch, with only a few problems with the touch screen, but only minor.  The problems comes when trying to access any of the programs on the screen.  A double press of one of the icons starts the Wii U on a journey to launch the program.  Most of the programs are taking 5 to 10 seconds to launch, and then pressing the home key is a 10 to 15 second wait for the home screen to come up.  Currently there are no controllers with the screen you can purchase, so don't break it.It is a fun system to play with and if Nintendo can speed up the time it takes between screens than the Wii U will be a good system, but not a great system.  Hopefully once the TVii gets added to the software bundle, it will be worth a little more.  Than I can edit this review and give it 4 or 5 stars.For playing games, the Wii U does a wonderful job, with it's 3 core processor humming right a long, very nice and smooth... just like and XBox 360 or a PS3.  While there is little doubt that this game system will be in short supply for the winter.The good news for Nintendo is that we, the consumer, are used to purchasing all the new computer when they come out.  As an example, Apple rebirths their iphones and ipads every couple of months and people go out to get the latest and greatest.In conclusion, I do not think that Nintendo has hit a \"home run\" with the Wii U, I think that they have gotten slightly ahead of the curve until next October or November when the new game systems typically are released into the market, just in time for the Christmas push.**** update**** 11/20/2012  ****I received some negative feed about how slow the system is.  I timed the Wii U from exiting a game to the home screen, and it took 17 seconds.  I thought the system was broke, so I looked around on the internet for professional reviews and that was one complaint about the system was the time between menus.I purchased Black Ops 2 for the Wii U also, In order to play the game, I had to go through another update.  This update took 37 minutes.I did purchase the Wii U controller cover made by Nintendo, it comes with a protective cover (many different colors), 2 styluses and a screen protector, and the sleeve and protector were easy to put on.A USB hard drive can be hooked up to the Wii U, the Wii U will format the drive, so all information on the drive will be erased.  You cannot move the drive from one gaming system to another.  The new game system that reads the hard drive will format the drive and all information will be lost.Many of the expensive games like Zombie U can be purchased from the Wii store.  You have to have a hard drive attached due to the large file size.  Since it is a large down load, it will take some time. (Black Ops 2 cannot be downloaded)The rumble in the game controllers are rather weak.  I had to pay close attention to even notice there was a rumble at all.  On the good side, it is easy to switch from the large controller to the smaller controller during the game.Looking at the memory, GPU, CPU and memory bandwidth, it appears that Nintendo has caught up with XBox and PS3, maybe even gotten ahead of the game. The system is very fun to play games on, but the controller takes a bit of getting used to.For people whom are looking for more than just a gaming system we will have to wait a little longer to see just how well the system works.  Netflix is up and working and is pretty simple to get around in.*** Update Again ***Hulu plus has just been released for the Wii U, Another download and off and running.  Hulu looks pretty good so far.Amazon is working now too.  The only problem is with the controller screen...  you cannot turn them off while in Netflix or Amazon.*** update 12/05/2012 ***Another Wii u update (and only 45 minutes this time)  the system is slightly faster.  Instead of taking 15 seconds between screens it now takes on 12 seconds.  Not a huge improvement.  Wii u's with updates will not be shipped out until 2013.  If this is a Christmas present and you have hopes of the receiver of the gift being able to play with the Wii u on Christmas day, please install the update before wrapping.  No fix for turning off the controller screen with Netflix, Amazon or Black ops 2.The Wii u reminds me a lot of the military... hurry up and wait.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2012"}

Regardless of what the \"gamers\" say on these reviews that rate it anything other than a 1* or IGN's laughable 95% review of this game for PC, the PC version is a prime example of why it will be pirated, and why I don't really care if it is.First off, this is an actual good improvement of MW2. Everything is greatly tweaked, everything looks nice, and the co-op is top notch. But if you plan on making a 5* product on the PC, IW, you can't cut features and then raise the price. There's absolutely no excuse for reason for charging $60 for this game. That's a -1*. Greed should never be rewarded. Then there's the lack of dedicated servers. P2P isn't the worst thing ever, but it's not good. It really is only as good as the host. That's another star removed. Then we took out mods.

I really like this installation!Madden 10 addressed draft AI, so that teams fill roster spots that need filling. This year, game play was improved.I too don't really understand all the whining.I was apprehensive, so I rented it first, and dug what they did to the feel of the game, so I bought it.First though, some of the bad. The Franchise, and \"Road to Glory\" have not changed AT ALL! Since I spend most of my time in Franchise, that kind of sucks.Game play however, has been improved dramatically. Yes, I hate that they changed the audible system, and kick meter, (Again), but it's not anything you can't get used to, and once you do, it works great.You now set all of your audibles, and are not at the mercy of random plays when chosen on the fly with the right stick.The Hot routes for receivers, and line blocking are now controlled with the D pad, and also take a little practice to get used to, but work very well.Where the game Really improved however is in the running game, and pass receiving.You really don't need the \"Speed Burst\" the way the game is now, because your offensive line actually blocks! If you motion a tight end to another side of the line, he too will block intelligently, not just perform an, \"Olay\" letting a backer, or D.E. cream your back!Two improvements were made to the passing game. The wide outs finally make catches in bounds! A novel concept, and long overdue! Also after making a catch, they now run forward, rather than inexplicably running backwards for a 6 yard loss like last year. That really got old, and frigging fast!Anyone complaining about defense? Your calling the wrong situational defenses. The AI is better this year. I can finally stop a 2 minute drill on D as well as have my guys not miss so many tackles as in last years game.Online is about the same, but with some stuff added to the menus so it makes better sense.O.k., you could call it Madden 10.5, but it changing a bunch of modes, such as Franchise, but leaving the game play as it was last year would have sucked! The running game is finally usable, the passing game is improved, the graphics are great, even the play by play is improved. Collinsworth needs a few new lines, but, oh well.Oh, if you're a purist, stop whining about the \"Game-flow\" and just turn it off!! Game-flow is cool for beginners, or if you just want to cruise through a game. Hey why shouldn't a beginner get to play this game? All the new features can be turned off, so just do it!If you are new to Madden, you will love Game flow!Setting up your game plan is a bit of work, but pays off in the end.Now that game play is improved, (Not perfect, but improved), I would like to see changes in Franchise. The to practice while in franchise, keep your teams uniform when re-locating, a deeper draft system, and we should have a reason to play the pre-season, I'd even like to take on, or change to another franchise, if I want to. Hey, It's my $60.00!I'm willing to hang with this year. It's not like they didn't address anything. They are getting the game play dialed in, and they did a good job.If you want to pass and buy next years version, to wait for more mode changes, fine, but if you want just a better gaming experience, I recommend this years game even over 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2010"}

In particular, I had to do some hacking with settings to get sound to work. It turns out this is a fairly common problem, but nothing is really done about it and so you have to google it and figure out the solution.This is a very good game.Unlike the COD games, this one's RPG elements make it customizable and the character your own. Unlike most modern games, which require you to hit A,B, and C to then see a cutscene, this one lets things happen and have you deal with it. The best part is the death system. If you die, you revitalize in a vita chamber. The enemies will have their HP whittled down from your previous life.This makes death an inconvenience and something to be avoided, but upon dying, you aren't faced with a loading screen. You don't have to do things perfectly. After all, this is just a game. Losing time and having to backtrack from the vita chamber is penalty enough for dying. You end up losing some of your time, which is what you lose when you reload and replay anyways.The art style is inspired and the Randian philosophy gives more meaning to the elements of the game world. It is kind of a depiction on how Ms. Rand's perfect utopian state could devolve into totalitarianism and brutality as they had to deal with the problems that all states deal with. For example, how can citizens truly make free decisions when they are faced with addictive products in the marketplace, that subverts their very free will? That's the role that ADAM takes in this game.There are several genuinely creepy moments in the game which left me, a jaded FPS fan, shaken. But on that note, this game seems to go too far in the horror direction. I really wish that we could see a game set in pre-civil war Rapture.The genius of combat is that there are generally several approaches that you can take. There are environmental hazards such as puddles of water which synergize well with electricity. Oil slicks and fire. If you get bored with that, you can always hack a turret, or just straight up shoot up the place. Though, towards the end I just went around and hit stuff with the wrench.This is better than COD where it seems all you do is pull down the trigger of the automatic rifle.Another nice touch is that conversations are done in-game and in-world. They are not done in cut scenes every 10 minutes like Mass Effect.Cut scenes are the worst thing in modern gaming. They take you out of the world and make your investment in the gameplay moot since at the end of the cutscene you're back to 100% health.The story is well done. The nice thing to me is that sub-plots of the story are told via listenable audio diaries. This is smart. lots of games force you to stop and read text on your screen to get more story. this is terrible. game screens are not the place to read prose. Having the story told to you while you are playing the game is a great way to tell the story. It does not waste time. It lets you keep on playing.Well worth the acclaim.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}

Having beat it, here's my review of what Team Ninja got right and what it got wrong. (I played on Path of the Warrior difficulty, so the easy setting may be slightly different)Good:* Much more detailed enemies and graphics, including the ability of nearly every bad guy to be amputated/decapitated and or chopped in half.* Bodies of most enemies stay around after death, giving you an increased feeling of carnage and destruction. Leave a trail of death to follow!* Cool weapons* Easy saving of games at Dragon Statues* Massive Boobage - unrealistic proportions and extra jigglinessBad:* Some massive slowdown in certain levels when lots of enemies are onscreen. Game over screen visual effects styling is bad and often VERY slow framerate.* No map. WTH? Some levels you need a map* Almost completely WORTHLESS ninpo! The Inferno magic is about the only one that does anything (homes in on baddies). But being that many of the bosses are fire-based demons or flyers, magic is almost worthless. Piercing Void is absolutely useless as it requires you to target an enemy and by the time you launch he ball, the baddie has moved. Short-range on the wind magic equally useless.* Some lackluster level designs, especially caves, tunnels, or building interiors. Several levels feel rehased, especially the Flying Fortress level.* Added feeling of \"cheapness\", due to reliance on button mashing and cheap tricks by the level designers. Several areas of the game are maddeningly frustrating due to this kind of cheapness, whose idea of challenging you is to throw wave after wave of the same enemies at you, or put ranged attackers well out of your reach. Examples are the grenade launching soldiers that spam explosives at you from afar or archers, usually appearing in pairs. Exploding jellyfish/mines that respawn. There must be at least 30 of these each time you encounter them.* The damn biting fish are all back, including the big grabby swimming ones and the airborne ghost piranhas.* Stupid looking/ugly enemies, with lots of them having some skull motif.  Many of the enemies' faces are modified versions of skulls. Stupidness includes wolves that hold katana in their mouths and chop you with them?!* Having to kill bosses a second time. 1 guy you have to kill 4 times. I know this is a trademark of the NG series, but 4 times???* Lack of replay value. NO UNLOCKABLES except a measly sound test option and new colored costumes when you begin the game again after beating it. No Sonia as a playable character, no Missions like in NG Sigma. Would be great to be able to play Sonia or Muramasa.* Lots of dumb unrealistic mechanics like the ability to swim in lava! WTH??.. Invisible barriers everywhere, limiting your interaction with the environment and keeping you several feet away from touching what looks like accessible scenery. Another is the lava filled armadillo boss that comes out of the crashed air fortress.. this thing was the machine's power core??? Back to the cheapness of the design: this boss exploded after you beat it, causing instant death if you don't know what to do before hand. This boss is tough enough if you are playing it the first few times through and to have it explode and kill you is a cheap trick.* Some bosses are VERY easy to kill with a fully upgraded Scythe* Much uglier, sloppier items interface w/ blood splatter motif.The predecessors Ninja Gaiden Black and Ninja Gaiden Sigma were much better in terms of gameplay balance.Rent this first if you are a casual fan. Having owned and beaten all the variations of the first NG, I am highly disappointed by this game, especially the lack of extras. After seeing how many features Sigma packed onto the PS3 version, I expected those to carry over to NG 2. No chance. No way to view beaten cut scenes, no photo gallery, concept art, rotatable models, nothing!! It feels like a rushed product. No replay value at all. Perhaps they're going to double dip and release NG 2 Omega. Still a very good game, mind you, but just feels half-done.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2008"}

Cravens \"Loves a good story\"","summary":"True Space Horror","reviewText":"I have never been one to play horror games or watch horror movies, but for some unfathomable reason I was drawn to Dead Space. I was always into sci-fi, so the futuristic setting really got me curious about how Visceral mixed that with horror. I ventured to the mall on November 2008. After I bought Dead Space I came home and sat on the floor just looking at the box. Had I made the right decision? Is this game scary, and, if it is, will I be able to finish it?As fate had it, I lived to now review one of my all-time favorite games. I'm so glad I bought Dead Space. It proved to be a particular experience I hadn't known before in terms of video games.GAMEPLAY:The game is ingenious in many ways. First off, as I mentioned before, one cannot avoid being swept away by its unique setting. Being in the futuristic Ishimura in Isaac's futuristic yet imperfect engineering suit made me feel like I was playing a ramped up Metroid, and spreading blood on the walls from necromorphs to ensure survival while a female intercom voiceover announced a gentle warning to stand clear of a certain part of the room made me feel like I was on some crazy ride, like Alien Encounter at Disney World (back in the day). In short, the setting is just cool. The lights, the holographic inventory/screens, the ship noises, the necromorphs disturbingly interrupting the sci-fi ambiance. It's just so cool.Combat is truly something else. Shooting the necromorphs in the head just won't work; you have to \"dismember\" them. This means shooting off their limbs and getting blood all over the place, otherwise they won't die. If they get too close Isaac can smack them with his gun or stomp them with his foot. This feels slow and clunky, which is something some people have complained about. However, I believe this serves to make the game more realistic as it underlines Isaac's vulnerability as a lone engineer on some terrifying, derelict spaceship.For combat, you'll have many weapons (seven) to choose from, and if you test out different ones you'll get achievements. You can carry up to four, but the more weapons you carry the more spread out your ammo is. This is something you'll want to keep in mind if you're playing on higher difficulties. My personal favorites are the Plasma Cutter and the Force Gun. All weapons have a primary and a secondary fire, and as you acquire \"nodes\" via exploring or in-game stores you'll be able to upgrade weapons and Isaac's suit. On another note, buying better suits results in a change in Isaac's appearance.STORY:The lore of Dead Space is some of the best in sci-fi. You've got aliens, politics, and religion all in one place. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't continue any further beyond the fact that Isaac is an engineer sent to assist a spacecraft that sent out a distress beacon. As you can probably imagine, for most of the game Isaac is trying to find a way out as well as finding his girlfriend, who was stationed on the ship before Isaac arrived.Equally as enthralling as the story itself is the game's storytelling. You don't get cookie-cutter cutscenes. Sometimes you'll get cutscenes of dialogue. Other times you will access hologram video files. Other times you'll stumble upon audio and text files. Besides the dialogue scenes, these various files are chronologically random, and hearing/seeing all the heart-wrenching and disconcerting stories pieces together the tale of the Ishimura in a refreshing and engaging way.One thing I have to admire is how much Visceral has invested in the Dead Space world. Besides the sequel, they have developed various media that fleshes out the world Isaac lives in. The book, \"Dead Space Martyr,\" is extremely good and worth a read by any fan of the video games.SOUND:Ahh, the sound. It truly makes the atmosphere. Sometimes you'll hear a creak in a door just before a necromorph comes charging at you. Other times a vent will bust open and nothing will come out. After a while that distant squealing or screaming from a helpless victim will make you stop Isaac from progressing down the hall so you can breathe for a minute. The music here is intense, and the sound from all the in-game elements make the Ishimura feel like a terrifying dungeon rather than an advanced spaceship. There were more than enough times where I ran Isaac out of a room once an objective was completed, because I was too scared to look back.Besides the scary sounds there are some really awesome ones. When Isaac has to walk out in space the vacuum sound effect is spot on and will make you feel like you need to hold your breath like Isaac. Other noises like the clanking of metal in an engineering bay and similar areas really make the Ishimura feel alive.In conclusion, I don't think you'll be disappointed with Dead Space. While I have heard mixed opinions from hardcore horror gamers, none of them have said this game is bad or not good. With that said, this game is a wild ride at a great price that requires your full attention (as well as your lights being off). Oh, and having some good surround sound helps, too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2012"}

It is special because with it you can actually FLY!!! Jump off of a tall building and use firebird strike and you can fly over much of New Marais until your energy source is depleted. The only criticism that I have is that during melee combat the camera may zoom away from the best parts of the action which means that you may not be able to see who you are hitting all the time. Anybody that enjoys fun and exciting action adventure games should check this game out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2011"}

And it can now be enjoyed worry-free.The good plot ofFar Crybears eerie similarities to XIII, not in the tropical island setting but in that the hero wakes up with amnesia on a beach (with the roman numeral XIII tattooed on his arm) and than has to feel his through an obsessed assassin and a pack of ruthless mercenaries. The race is on not only to stay one step ahead of his conspiring enemies but also to discover his true identity.This was the first major PC game to sport the daring comic-book look of cel-shading. UnlikeBorderlands, which I found to have done so only halfheartedly, XIII pulls it off with gusto as the comic-book graphics are accompanied with comic-book exclamations and comic-book picture-in-picture format, offering a unique experience. It is like playing inside a comic-book - and it is great fun!Now, the game is not without its flaws. It has a checkpoint saving system that makes it much harder that it should and the guns (probably to stay faithful to the original comic-book the game was based on) look rather underwhelming. However, although not perfect, this a game that you will enjoy playing and you will remember it for years.When XIII came out in 2003 I went nowhere near it as it harbored an overzealous DRM scheme (an early version of TAGES) that blocked disk drives from working properly and refused to launch the game if you had any form of \"suspicious\" software installed (let's just say that UBISOFT considered NERO to be ...pirateware!). Eight years (and a couple of class-action suits) later, one can enjoy the game DRM-free (just be careful which version you choose).RECOMMENDED!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2011"}

Fire upSoul Calibur, and instantly you'll appreciate that the graphics and gameplay are even better than in the arcade version. AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends.

After achieving worldwide sales success and awards for both the originalMetal Gear SolidandMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons Of Liberty, series creator, Hideo Kojima combines the essence of both games into one unique experience.","reviewerName":"Brendan L. Agnew \"rothwyn\"","summary":"Heroes Are Remembered, But Legends Never Die","reviewText":"The idea of remaking one of the most beloved games of the 32/64 bit generation was bold, to say the least. However, with a Tri-Force of fantastic talent, the creative geniuses as Konami (Metal Gear Solid), Silicon Knights (Eternal Darkness), and Nintendo (video games as we know them) let their powers combine to recreate a masterpiece of both story and gameplay, even going so far as to draft an action movie director to bring the game's dramatic cinemas up to date. Many thought that, even with the obvious talent available, the taks of recreating the magic of Metal Gear Solid was too monumental to ever be accomplished. They were wrong.Popping the disk into my cubular Nintendo system and beginning the now-familiar quest to rid the island of Shadow Moses of those naughty super-terrorists proved to elicit the same magic that it did when I first played the game on the Playstation. The plot, the characters, the action, all were as great as I rememberd them, and even more so in places. With the help of new gameplay mechanics, re-directed cinemas, and a complete graphical overhawl, this game feels comfortingly familiar without being tired.Firstly, the graphics are easily some of the best on any game released for the GameCube, or any game this generation for that matter. Throughout, they handiliy hold their own against the acclaimed Metal Gear Solid 2, and in some places (particularly when it comes to face detail, physics, and animation), they completely blow MGS 2 away. Gone are the clustered pixels that served for eyes and mouths in the original. In the place of the then-astounding but now-dated character polys are incredibly detailed models, each with texture, style, and a hint of humanity in their eerily realistic eyes. In addition, weather effects, like the snow in the opening of the second area, now look a hundred times better, with more detailed environments both inside and out. There are a few textures here and there that look a little blurry, but overall, everthing is crips, clean, and purddy as h*ll.The newly redone real-time cinemas substantially add to the look of the game, both in quality and style. Even measuring them against the high standard set by MGS 2, these are true works of art that stand unequaled in their field today. The animation and detail make the viewer somtimes wonder wheather or not these are truly real-time, or instead are the more detailed (and more expensive) Full Motion Video scenes favored by the likes of Final Fantasy. However, all is done with the existing game engine, which stands as both a testament to the architecture of the engine that Silicon Knights built for this game, and the talented crew at Konami who made the cinemas.The central figure of Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes is its story, as well it should be, as such a wonderful narrative rarely strikes the cinema, let along the world of video games. With its intricate turns, palpable emotion, stunning revelations, and numerous double-crossings, Metal Gear Solid's narrative had to be told well for both the veterans and rookies who would experience it. The new cut scenes do just that, making what was old new again, giving the familiar plot points a fresh coat of paint, as it were. Sometimes, new action scenes altogether appear, and are so gorgeously coreographed and stylishly presented that they'll have you muttering \"Matrix-who?\" on several occasions.Finally, a game, no matter how good looking, lives or dies by its gameplay. The mechanics of Metal Gear Solid raised bars, set standards, and blew minds when they were first revealed in 1998, and it speaks of their quality that they hold up so well today. Solid Snake, super-spy extraordinare, must sneak into and through the nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses, and though he can handle himself in a  fight, it's far better (and a good deal more fun) to slip past the guards unnoticed. That's not easy. They're smart, even more intelligent than they were in the first game, with better sight, hearing, and more thorough seaching methods. However, added to Snake's original move set are some actions that were first seen in Metal Gear Solid 2, such as hanging from ledges, aiming and shooting in first-person, dragging and hiding guards, and hiding yourself in lockers.This is something of a double-edged sword as far as working the new gameplay elements into the title. Foremost, the lay of Shadow Moses hasn't changed much at all, making the inclusion of these new abilities rather questionable. Where would we use them. The answer to which is \"Wherever the heck you want.\" Twin Snakes puts the power in the hands of the gamer to play the game how they want to, which is a refreshing change from the customary hand-holding and linear nature of the original. There are times when the game is made more difficult by these inclusions (particularly in the case of the new bullet-proof shield-bearing guards), but more difficulty in this case is welcome. The original game could be downright easy on the, even on the Normal setting, but even the Easy mode in Twin Snakes will offer a decent challenge to both rookies to the series and veterans of the original.Last, but not least, is the soundtrack. This is a rather hot topic, as it were, as the main theme of Metal Gear Solid is unrecognizable in The Twin Snakes. Some purists would cry fould that such a masterpiece wasn't left alone. However, though its nostalgic value is missed, the existing music fits the new game's presentation like a glove, and stands toe-to-toe with its grandaddy in terms of quality.All in all, this is the best version of one of the best games of a generation. It has aged spectacularly well, with both its narrative AND gameplay being as impressive today as they were in 1998. However, even this is not enough. We also have more gameplay, new cinemas to tell the fantastic story, and a general polish that makes a game six years old feel as new as it did when it was first released. That, ladies and gentlemen, is no mean feat.With polish, detail, and gameplay that few games even today can boast of, Twin Snakes excels at its task and meets some high expectations, and starts the gaming year with a memorable \"bang.\" This game deserves both respect and purchasing, and it deserves them now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2004"}

Mass Effect was such an amazing, nearly perfect game that surpassing it was an effort almost automatically doomed to failure.  But what surprises and disturbs me is how Mass Effect 2 seems to have intentionally fumbled that effort by taking much that was great about Mass Effect and deleting it on purpose.At a surface level, much remains the same.  Dialogue choices and discussions are very familiar, and you can even import your character from ME.  Many of the same wonderful alien races and locations can be discovered, and you will delight in seeing familiar names and faces pop up from time to time.  But under the hood is a vastly different, and in many ways inferior, FPS/RPG.1)  Combat.  The combat system has been completely overhauled -- and many would say weakened.  Instead of infinite ammo weapons that have an overheat limitation, you effectively have ammunition in the form of \"heat sink\" cartridges that you need to replace or your gun won't work at all.  In other words, you can't just wait for a gun to cool down -- you need to find a new \"heat sink\" clip.  Did the laws of physics change between ME and ME2?  This seemingly subtle change has massive ramifications on your combat styles, since you can't simply blast your way through areas.  You'll find yourself running out of ammo at inopportune times, or randomly changing weapons to guns you hate or that are inappropriate for a particular fight just because you basically ran out of ammo.  I have no idea why BioWare thought this was a good idea.  Perhaps it stems from the use of \"heavy weapons\" with extremely limited ammo -- after all, why use anything else if you had an infinite ammo rocket launcher.  But why not just limit the # of rockets you can carry?  The net result of this is that you will use weapons like the sniper rifle less often, because if you can only carry 10 sniper rifle bullets, it's a waste of time trying to take down fast enemies.  Basically, you're back to counting bullets like in a WWII shooter, rather than relying on ME nanotech to mill microscopic rounds off solid ammo blocks.  Perhaps the Geth's true plan to enslave the universe was to trick everyone into using horrible, backwards weaponry.2)  Similarly, most of the cool equipment is gone or drastically reduced.  Instead of collecting different suits of armor or guns from shops or enemies, you find different pieces of armor that you can mix and match, or the occasional new gun.  But you only find new armor or guns occasionally -- after 15 hours of gameplay, many of my allies are still using basic starting weapons.  Armor is also rare.  Instead of picking exciting new armors and guns and customizing them with shield generators or ammo types, you have a very small array of items to choose from.  The entire loot gathering aspect of the game seems gutted.  While you may occasionally be able to research a 10% bonus to all sniper rifle damage, for example, that seems a poor exchange for ME1's dozens of sniper rifles and customizable features.  No longer can you add frictionless materials or extended barrels or toxic rounds -- you'll take whatever the gun gives you and like it.3)  Your combat HUD has also been altered.  Instead of seeing at a glance the shield and life levels of your buddies, there is a small picture display at the bottom that shows their faces.  For some reason.  It is very difficult to tell if they are injured or in trouble, and often you just find out the hard way since it is hard to monitor your own health and worry about any random status displays from them at the same time.  Again, there is no reasonable excuse for this change.  Another annoying combat change is that when sprinting (but ONLY sprinting) your character usually takes cover automatically when approaching something.  At other times, you have to use a \"cover\" button.  But the same cover button is also the \"vault over\" button.  So often during a heavy fight, you will sprint for cover and inadvertently try to take cover at the same time, resulting instead in you just leaping over the cover directly into enemy fire.  It's maddening.4)  The one gripe most people have about ME is the APC land rover, and how boring it was to drive around empty planets looking for mineral deposits or crash sites.  I'll give you that one.  However, ME2 somehow managed to replace this tedious exercise with something even worse:  planetary scanning.  With this horrible mini-game, you use a circular scanner to actually rove a planet's surface looking for mineral deposits or anomalies, which you find when your scanner readouts spike or the controller starts shaking.  However, even with an upgraded scanner the entire process is TORTURE.  It takes 10-15 minutes to do a single planet, and you can actually run out of probes and have to fly off and buy more.  Why could you spot anomalies and minerals from space in ME and see them on your rover map, but now you have to look by hand?  The entire thing is like pulling teeth -- I am honestly at a loss to figure out why anyone thought this was a good idea.  It's like something out of a Star Trek game from the late 1990s.5)  Character growth.  You don't earn EXP for killing things anymore.  Think about that.  Instead, you usually (but not always) level up once at the end of each \"mission\" -- but sometimes if it is a side mission you get a whopping 125 EXP instead.  The entire thing is idiotic.  Combined with maybe 1/2 the number of skills from ME and you are left with an extremely reduced RPG element that skews the game far more towards the FPS side of the scale.  Mass Effect gave you EXP for things as mundane as opening boxes, while ME2 barely even notices when you shut down an entire factory filled with murderous assault droids.  It's amazing how this makes you feel like you are just wasting your time with most missions.  And things that mattered a lot in ME are pointless now.  An actual conversation I had with Captain Anderson went basically like this:\"So, want to be a Spectre again?\"\"Sure.\"\"...Congratulations.\"Whoopity doo.  Similarly brief and unsatisfactory interactions with the comrades you saved the freaking galaxy with in Mass Effect have all the feeling of cameos of people being written off sitcoms.  I think we can all agree that Wrex rocked Mass Effect so hard we'd all happily play a 200 hour side mission with him, and yet in Mass Effect 2 he spends the entire game sitting in a chair.  Literally sitting in a chair!6)  Locations.  Remember the Citadel in ME?  Pretty cool place, right?  Well, in ME2 you can explore only a tiny fraction of it.  One level seems to consist entirely of Captain Anderson's room.  So too in many of the other locations -- there is almost no map divergence; you basically just run in a straight line from start to finish, with a few corners or stairways thrown in.  I honestly don't know what happened here.  In some places you feel like you're entering a giant maze or space station, but almost always you find out the maps themselves are tiny.  Another frustrating addition is the fact that levels and missions often end extremely abruptly and without warning, keeping you from collecting equipment.  Always, always, always pick up any equipment or open any chests before you move on to the next room, because every door or computer terminal could actually be the end of the mission, which teleports you back to the ship and prevents you from exploring anything else.  It's also painfully obvious whenever a fight is about to start, because you'll see a relatively open area with a bunch of boxes and low risers for you to hide behind.7)  Graphics & code problems.  ME2 is as pretty to look at as ME, but I don't remember graphics problems with ME.  In ME2, I've seen people's heads on backwards, rapid fire facial tics, and even characters stuck in walls.  Also, the \"resume\" feature on the main menu is extremely buggy.  I've had it ignore recent savefiles and instead start me at a point 4 hours earlier in the storyline.  Save yourself some headaches and use \"Load\" exclusively.  Also hard save often; the autosave is relentless.  I've actually had it autosave while loading (with both indicators popping up on screen at the same time).  What this means is that if you \"resume\" and through a bug end up loading an old save file, the autosave almost always simultaneously overwrites your recent save with a copy of that old save file.  So unless you carefully manage your files, you can lose hours when your autosave gets overwritten.All in all, ME2 is a step backwards.  If you gave the two games without any context to someone who has never heard of them, odds are they would think the original ME is the improved sequel.  After experiencing the lobotomized combat system, deleted RPG experience point system, scarce loot, and reduced maps of ME2, I can't really argue.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2010"}

It's a retro-themed game in the sense that there is no story, it's all about getting the highest score.  Don't play this game expecing a Mario-esque experience.  It's more like playing the same two Mario levels over and over again.  That might sound more like torture than fun, but Nintendo has worked their magic on this title and I found myself addicted to it immediately.The game starts off with Baby Mario falling from a stork flying in the sky.  It is your job to draw paths of clouds to alter his decent; aiming for coins to gain points and trying to avoid the enimies flying by.  You can also draw circles around enimies which captures them in bubbles that you can then fling up to Baby Mario to gain extra points.  The combinations are endless and the more points you score, the faster and more agile the Yoshi that greets you once Baby Mario lands on the groud.Once grounded, the gameplay changes to a side-scrolling environment.  Yoshi automatically walks forward and it's your job to guide him past the dangers that await.  Tapping Yoshi makes him jump, tap anywhere on the screen and Yoshi throws an egg to that spot, eliminating any enimies in it's path.  You gain bonus points by making combos such as placing an bubble-trapped enemy in line of some coins and tossing an egg that destroys the enemy as well as collects the coins.  The action can get very tense as the enemies, chasms and other obstacles keep coming in ever more intense waves.The game keeps track of not only high scores, but the kind of Yoshi used to get them.  This gives you great visual incentive to not only get the highest score, but to do it with the fastest, best Yoshi.  Want to play with a friend?  No problem.  The game supports single cartridge network play as well.This is a perfect game for people who like to play for short periods of time as well as those that like to play for longer periods.  The controls are so intuative that inexperienced gamers will pick them up easily and won't feel left out yet the controls offer so many possibilities that more experienced gamers will be challenged as well.  If you're looking for an exciting innovative game to keep you addicted for quite some time, you've got to pick up Yohi's Touch & Go.Even my non-gaming boyfriend got into the game and has since begged me to let him play it more.

The graphics and open-world design of the game are nothing short of breathtaking.  GTA IV was also an open world sandbox, but it was a thin veneer if you pushed beyond the window dressing.  This game succeeds at creating a living, breathing world, from the towns to the desert.  The voice acting is also top-notch and rivals any Hollywood production.But, in the end, this is primarily a shooting game and ironically, that is where it suffers the most.  Like the GTA games before it, the shooting is cheesy, simplistic, and arcade-like.  Countless enemies spawn like roaches from seemingly nowhere and just keep coming.  There must be some million-man cowboy army in ready reserve just over the horizon.  By left clicking on each enemy, the sight autolocks.  You left-click, autolock, right trigger fire, and release, then rinse, wash, and repeat for each enemy.  It is possible to nearly not aim at all using this method.This bothered me, so I switched to the expert mode for aiming so it didn't  automatically lock-on like I am a clairvoyant ninja assassin with heightened super-human reflexes, but I still found the combat over the top and arcadey.It's too bad, because between the open world, great graphics, and fairly adult story it could have been a truly great game. I think it's odd that Rockstar spent all that effort elsewhere only to dumb down the combat to virtual whack-a-mole. An ever spawning, million man army of moles that is.  Why go to the effort of creating a near-perfect immersive world to only then offer combat as simplistic as a stand-up arcade shooting game at Chuck-E-Cheese?Oh well, you can't argue with success and this game is breaking records and is highly critically acclaimed, so obviously I am in the minority.  Don't get me wrong, I do like the game overall but I think it is mainly because of the story and acting.  But everytime I get into yet another, thousand cowboys versus me shoot-out, I just kinda sigh and plug along.  This is a good game, but with some improved pacing and combat design, it could have been a truly great game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2010"}

Bridge is one of the most complex card games of all time, so I wasn't expecting miracles of AI brilliance, but I at least expected that (a) the minimum necessary information would be given to you so you could play the game, (b) the AI could at least give you some challenge, and (c) the game would implement the real rules of Bridge.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Necessary information (bidding history) is not available anywhere.  The bids are displayed on the UI as they are made, but they flash very quickly and are buried in a confusing flash of irrelevant information, and if you miss them, they're gone.  As atrocious as that experience is, the game only allows you to make a single bid, so it doesn't even implement Bridge rules correctly!  I'm thinking of returning the game, or seeing if there is such a thing as a patch for DS games.Given that I was trapped on a long flight, I tried out a few of the other games.Hearts was at least playable, but lacked the options that I would have preferred to be able to set (e.g. I couldn't configure passing schemes, rewards for hitting 100, or Jack of Diamonds optional rules).Solitaire was acceptable.Backgammon is my favorite game on this compilation so far, but even this lacks advanced features (doubling cube), and the UI is also quite annoying (you have to be very precise about where you place your pieces or it will reject your input).Chess worked and was, as expected, easily beatable.  At least the game knew to allow castling.  I didn't have a chance to try en passent.Bottom line:  jack of all trades, master of none.  Some of the games are fun, some are unplayable.  Have low expectations of what this game can do and you'll probably enjoy it more.- - - - -UPDATE:  years later, I find I enjoy this game more than I did when it first came out.  Yes, it's still a poor implementation of every individual game, and the abundance of flashing screens is still annoying.

I enjoyed beating all the missions (despite some of them being very frustrating) and some games like Mahjong are fun to replay indefinitely.

No, it's what the original Rocksmith should have been as described below.NOTE - If you own the original Rocksmith and you already have the USB cable, then the original USB cable will work with this game as well which is available for $20 less as a &#34;no cable&#34; edition.When I got the original Rocksmith, I was &#34;wow&#34;ed. Here was a PS3 title that wasn't a game, but an instructional software package for learning to play guitar (and later, bass) AND also allowed you to play notes on real songs with a difficulty level that adjusted on the fly according to how well you played.The drawback, however, was the interface. Rocksmith's menu was slow, cumbersome, and teeth-grindingly awful...having to strum every...single...time just to get the next menu. That, and choosing a song was laborious and slow with very limited means of finding the songs easily.If you were a former Rocksmith user, fret no more (okay, bad pun). Ubisoft has clearly listened to our complaints and has generated a menu system that is a lot snappier. Trying to find a song? Well, sort by genre, artist, song title, etc., and you'll find it quickly and easily. It's a huge sigh of relief and it's such a welcome change.There are new features as well. The Riff Repeater is especially worth noting that allows you to select portions of a song and vary the playback so you can gradually learn how to play more difficult sections. Excellent addition.If you're concerned about porting songs from the original Rocksmith to Rocksmith 2014, $9.99 is all you'll need to transfer the songs over EXCEPT for the following 5 songs due to licensing issues:-- Eric Clapton - Run Back to Your Side-- Cream - Sunshine of Your Love-- Seth Chapla - Star Spangled Banner-- Seth Chapla - Jules-- Chris Lee - BossYour other option is to keep the other disc, but switching discs is a huge inconvenience, in my opinion, and I wasn't mourning the loss of the 5 songs above.Rocksmith 2014's tutorial videos have also been revised and enhanced allowing you to skip sections within a tutorial video if you want to rehearse some of the techniques again. I'm loving the new videos better than the original and the positive feedback built-in feels empowering.Rocksmith 2014 also features a new &#34;session mode&#34; that will allow you to play bass or guitar alongside &#34;session&#34; AI musicians. I have tinkered with it a little bit, and it's surprisingly good but with limitations; don't expect this to replace the human component of a good-spirited jam. That said, there are a range of scales, BPMs, etc. modes to choose from and it's fun to experiment.Overall, 5/5 for Rocksmith 2014!!!

Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"O.P.T. \"O.P.T.\"","summary":"Too many cutscenes","reviewText":"I had a blast playing the first two R&C games, but I just cannot get into this one--which is surprising given the rave reviews.

{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"Troy Kearney \"avid reader\"","summary":"Get ready to invest a LOT of your free time in this...","reviewText":"The Grand Theft Auto series has been the dream games series for every player ever since GTA3 was released in 2001, followed by GTA: Vice City (aka GTA4) just last year.  So the inevitable question lingered for Rockstar Games of how do you top the two biggest-selling games of all time.  Simply take the GTA formula and shift it to a new location, and the end result is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (aka GTA5)GTA:SA takes place in the state of San Andreas (read: California, which is technically where the name comes from due to the San Andreas earthquake fault) in the early 1990's.  The main antagonist of the story is Carl \"CJ\" Johnson, who left San Andreas 5 years earlier for Liberty City (GTA3's city) to escape the violence that surrounded him.Now, he learns that his mom has been murdered and he returns to SA, only to find himself being framed for murdering a cop by 2 other corrupt officers (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson and Chris Penn), which leads him back to the family and gangs that he left behind.Needless to say, the area of San Andreas is HUGE.  Imagine both Liberty City and Vice City combined and you still have nearly 1/3 of the map that San Andreas encompasses.Several changes in the game include an all-new selection of stations to check out on the radio while cruising around the town with several songs that will definitely having anyone in their 20's (like me) having major flashback memories.  Another major change of the series is that you have to keep yourself in shape by both eating and exercising.  Too much eating and not enough exercise will definitely fatten you up and it will show on your character physically and gameplay-wise as well.  You can also gain/lose proficiency in riding bikes/motorcycles, driving, and (most importantly) shooting.  Also, remember when if you got a 2-star Wanted level in the first 2 GTA volumes, the cops would start shooting you?  Not in SA, where a 1-star will get the cops gunning for you immediately.This is definitely NOT a game for kids to play, since there is some STRONG language used by virtually everyone in the game (you'll hear more f-bombs, s-bombs, mf's and the n-word said in the first 5 minutes of the game than in most movies).  The missions are not all that easy, especially when you have another gang shooting at you while you're running around town.All in all this game should consume about 150 hours of time to finally get through, which is pretty much the better part of a week, so try to clear out a lot of time from your schedule.  So will you have a fun time in San Andreas if you played GTA3 and GTA: Vice City?  Oh yeah!  If you need this to complete your GTA collection, definitely get it.  If not, you need to have your head checked...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2004"}

We played through the whole world.  Then beat Super Luigi U (I view this more as DLC than a stand-alone game, but I'll not that on the Luigi U page).  Then we decided that we were going to find all the gold coins and secret exits.  This game's levels are so diverse and fun, we literally didn't stop enjoying the game for a minute.  Sure, there are some ridiculous levels thrown in; some of which I doubt one person could accomplish alone.This game looks incredibly vibrant on an HDTV.  A Mario game has never been this crisp before.  Each time I put this disc in and see the main-screen page, I think \"wow, this is HD Mario, THIS is awesome\"The point is, not enough co-op games create a thoroughly enjoyable platforming experience.  While it'll take some quite experienced platformer gamers to 100% this game.  We just 100% completed the game, and it was the most fun platformer, Mario game, WiiU game, and co-op game I've played in recent times.Beating the main Mario campaign is easily enough accomplished, but 100% completing the game is a something I challenge all of you do strive for.

Assassin pro, EMP and stealth bomber support package. Overpowered guns like dual FMG 9s, the striker, extended mag and rapid fire SMG's. Screenshake every 2 minutes etc. Black Ops 2 does not have these problems, but it has a bunch of new ones. The target finder has to be one of the dumbest ideas ever. Give the already social degenerate so called COD community an attachment that surrounds enemy players in a bright red box and it zooms in immensely. Yeah, that won't be abused. the lag is unbearable at times. getting shot around corners, zero reaction time. Getting tons of hitmarkers and getting killed in what seems like one bullet. The maps, while a general improvement over the abysmal maps of MW3, are not much better. Aftermath, Carrier and Drone are just awful. Headglitching is rampant in this game. There are headglitch spots everywhere. Ghost is unlocked at level 55 and only keeps you off the minimap during an enemy UAV when you are moving. However people still camp like crazy and are as annoying as ever. Also Treyarch saw fit to make all camo unlock via challenges. Half of them are unlocked by getting headshots, which happens gradually anyway. But some are ridiculous like get 10 5 gunstreaks (bloodthirsty medals). That's not easy to do. Basically only really good players with great internet connections will achieve gold camo. This is something I feel MW3 had right. Just unlock camo by getting kills with your gun. Overall I like the pick ten system and the scorestreak system is great but overall this game has too many issues to not be frustrating.The best part is being able to play with and against bots in system link and local lan play. let's hope Infinity Ward has bots in their next game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Michael A. Taylor","summary":"Something for everyone","reviewText":"I'm going to be quick and brief about this game review.+ Every mystery in the MGS universe is revealed.+ Gameplay is the best in the series.+ Every aspect of the gameplay is bigger and better(except boss battles).+ Loads of extras to collect. Making this games replay value high.+/- Tons of cutscenes(seriously about half of the game) However, you can easily skip or pause these cutscenes.+ Music is great+ Kojima really cattered to the nostalgia of true Metal Gear fans. There are many flashbacks and homages paid to earlier MG games and every(I mean EVERYthing) detail of the MGS universe is rounded up in this installment.- Some characters seem forced into the plot( Naiomi for one).  They play major roles in the plot but it seems they mashed everyone who didn't die in an earlier installment into the game just to have closure.  Also, some \"romances\" seem rushed. Actually, all the romances seemed rushed just to match X and Y chromosomes together.- My Biggest complaint about the game is the boss battles.  This is the cornerstone to the MGS series( Psycho Mantis being the greatest boss battle ever).  Of the 4-6 boss battles only one feels like you havnt done it before.  I realize that the boss battles are homages to the previous boss battles but they come off less inspiring.  You can redo things but make them bigger and better.  I did not get that feeling from the boss fights except 1. This is the main reason I took 1 star away from a 5 star game.So this year,so far, we've got GTA4(extremely overhyped and literally overrated on every website and article i read) and MGS4 as the main contenders for game of the year.  MGS4 gets my vote.  If you have a PS3 and don't have this game shame on you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Sreenadh","summary":"One of the greatest games ever made!","reviewText":"Rockstar have raised the gold standard for the sandbox genre to seemingly unattainable heights for not just their competitors, but even themselves.Topping Red Dead Redemption was always going to prove to be a mighty feat with unreasonable fan expectations, but Rockstar didn&#8217;t just admit defeat and nonchalantly pump out another entry into the cultural phenomenon that is Grand Theft Auto, they took this as a challenge and delivered on unearthly expectations and hype.After spending roughly 50 hours in Los Santos and Blaine County, I come to you writing this review with my own sky high expectations blown out of the water. For some additional perspective, I&#8217;m nowhere near ready to satisfyingly shelve the game and prepare for new releases or consoles as there&#8217;s still so much more exhilarating content to experience. Simply put, Grand Theft Auto V will go down in the history books as a landmark in gaming and one of the very best games ever created.Ambition and originality highlight the adventure in a myriad of ways but most notably with the enormous undertaking of crafting a game with roughly 100 hours of content around not one, but three unique and distinct protagonists with their own intertwining life issues. Michael is a retired professional thief stuck in a midlife crisis constantly at odds with his family, Franklin works a dead end job repossessing vehicles whilst desperately struggling to escape the urban lifestyle, and finally, there&#8217;s Trevor who is pleasantly psychotic and amongst being the most colorful character in the game, he&#8217;s also one of the most entertaining characters in all of gaming embodying everything the GTA franchise is about.I&#8217;m not going to delve too far into the plot because how everything unfolds; even from the very beginning is one of the most fascinating aspects of the game. All you really need to know is that you will be flipping between this criminal band of heroes in a series of elaborate missions and dangerous heists that feel ripped out of a movie to ultimately get rich and exercise some personal demons.Among these intriguing central themes are much more riveting plot points that touch upon everything from dysfunctional families, celebrity sycophancy, government morality, feminism, social media, torture, and overall brilliant satire of modern America. Every single scene, mission, and character is just ripe with provocative social commentary in traditional GTA comedic fashion, but this time around it&#8217;s relevant and intelligently nailed to a point that directly speaks to the player. These are all things you naturally would not expect from a GTA game but surprisingly they exist and greatly add to what is probably one of the most compelling narratives in all of gaming.Everything is also heightened from the fact that GTA V is just so damn fun to play. Shooting has received a drastic cosmetic overhaul taking cues from both Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3, complete with helpful cover and a weapon wheel. You can also toggle multiple aiming settings that include a traditional aiming system allowing you to flip between softly locked on targets. Fundamental control schemes aren&#8217;t all the upgrades though as you can now shoot gasoline in the environment to ignite a fire which hopefully leads to an explosion.Seamlessly switching between Michael, Franklin, and Trevor during frenetic firefights can not only prove to be advantageous but also cinematically intense. The most well-known example of this is sniping as Franklin while Michael snatches a hostage whilst rappelling down a towering corporate building but without spoiling anything, this highly touted feature is executed remarkably well.Each protagonist is also given a special ability that suits their personality and role in a completely new feature to the franchise. Michael can slow down time in a firefight similar to Max Payne in his franchise but without all the stylistic John Woo inspired diving. Trevor can enter a state of berserk granted with the buff of dishing out double damage and having all damage taken halved. Franklin&#8217;s ability goes in a different direction allowing him to slow down time while driving.All of these special abilities are highly useful and can be taken advantage of when in a pinch; in some ways they almost make the combat too easy especially considering the ability gauges recharge fairly quickly and your health already will always regenerate to halfway when nearly dead. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s an awesome feature and anything that mixes Max Payne into GTA can&#8217;t be a bad thing.Driving was given a lot of flak in GTA IV as the cars essentially felt like you were skating on ice so Rockstar dialed the unwaveringly required precision back a notch so that every method of transportation is more user friendly and accessible but doesn&#8217;t play completely arcadey. You&#8217;re still going to need skill for the various racing activities but for the most part, everything is balanced in a manner that should satisfy everyone. That goes for every method of transportation too, whether it&#8217;s driving, flying, exploring the deep sea with a submarine, or cycling on a bike.My only real issue at first wasn&#8217;t necessarily with the driving mechanics but rather evading the police. Maybe I&#8217;m just an oblivious idiot but the game doesn&#8217;t properly explain how to effectively ditch the fuzz, and leaves you just trying to burn rubber and leave them in the dust when in actuality it&#8217;s about sneakily hiding whether they&#8217;re far back behind you or in the immediate area. Once I became accustomed to playing hide and go seek with the LSPD however, it became thrilling to engage with them in ways that actually felt fair which is a rarity for the franchise.Exploring Los Santos with or without the LSPD breathing down your neck is an enthralling activity as well. We all were aware that GTA V would boast a map larger in scale than Red Dead Redemption and GTA IV but the gravity of that statement doesn&#8217;t resonate until you get out there and start searching around. Aside from San Andreas (which is coincidentally the setting of GTA V as well) I&#8217;ve never found a disconnect in a sandbox game that instills a feeling that I&#8217;m traveling great distances and am drifting away into a new locale entirely.The glamorous and Hollywood style appeal of Los Santos separated with rural America and vast deserts complimented each other in ways that serve as a testament to just how expansive the sandbox is. I haven&#8217;t even commented on the insane attention to detail yet but am still perplexed that while the credits rolled, the game was fading in and out of areas such as underwater ruins that I hadn&#8217;t even given a seconds thought about exploring yet.Assisting how remarkable the world already is on sheer scope are arguably the greatest graphics we have ever seen on consoles. The sun shines off of metallic vehicle paint jobs, advertisements and billboards litter the city, character models have outstanding motion capture and facial expressions, and astounding levels of detail touch every object in the game from trees to clothing. Getting in a helicopter and rising to a high altitude only to casually fly around and sightsee from above is breathtaking and mesmerizing, especially when factoring in how vast the game&#8217;s draw distance is. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, something that wholeheartedly applies to the visuals in GTA V.Physics are also out of this world impressive as GTA V runs on an enhanced version of Max Payne 3&#8217;s RAGE engine which astonishingly allows for unprecedented and lifelike ragdoll reactions to bullets, punches, head on vehicle collisions, falling, and more. Every single reaction is different, almost as if real life nerves are being simulated. Whatever is going on, it&#8217;s damned impressive and constantly keeps the interactivity from feeling stiff or dull.If you&#8217;re more about partaking in actual activities instead of sightseeing then fear not, because Rockstar have once again gone above and beyond the call of duty with seemingly endless amounts of entertaining side content. Right off the bat, the inspiration from Red Dead Redemption is evident as the Strangers and Freaks line of side quests return in which you encounter all sorts of warped and idiosyncratic characters that either may want you to stalk celebrities, help legalize marijuana (these missions are incredibly out there and amusing), do some extreme sports, and more.To further flesh out each main protagonist they even are granted their own individual missions with most strangers. There are also numerous random events in the world ranging from hijackings to assisting robberies to driving home hitchhikers and more. It seems as if around every corner is something to distract yourself with.Also returning by popular demand is the ability to buy property ranging from bars to movie theaters to the taxi company but in all honestly it&#8217;s rather disappointingly useless save for the Los Santos Customs which allows for free car modifications upon buying it. I suppose money is more of a novelty than anything in the game, constantly pushing the plot forward. There are some really nifty and revolutionary things you can do with money though besides buy a golf course that you&#8217;ll never use, like trying your hands on the stock market.From each character&#8217;s cell phone dubbed the iFruit is an internet app that lets you browse a fictionalized and satirical version of the internet. You can buy cars that will be directly delivered to your garage, check on some in game news, and generally get lost in another ridiculously detailed feature of the game but the most intriguing is the interactive stock market. Players with a broader awareness of what&#8217;s going on during the story will most likely invest in corporations that may be positively affected by a mission. If you&#8217;re planning a jewelry heist it&#8217;s probably wise to invest in their rival.There&#8217;s also a fully competent Tennis mini-game to play which is miles more entertaining than Bowling from GTA IV, which probably stems from the fact that Rockstar has experience with creating actual Tennis games. Playing Darts is also mildly amusing as are the interactive strip club private dance mini-games. You also have your traditional races that come in multiple methods of transportation ranging from cars to boats to ATV&#8217;s to jet skis.By far the biggest addition however in terms of side content is something once again derived from Red Dead Redemption; the ability to go hunting. Animals frequently roam around the forests and more rural areas of the game. Some will most likely inevitably become road kill as you unintentionally squash them as they trample on in front of you whilst you&#8217;re blazing down the road. If you ever get the itch to do it more professionally though you can acquire a calling whistle which points you in the right direction of elk, bobcats, mountain lions, and whatever else is roaming around out there.If you&#8217;re more interested in zanier activity it&#8217;s already proven that you can find Bigfoot (for real this time around) or go hunting for the 50 spaceship parts scattered around the world. Trevor can also go on Rampages (yes, they are indeed back), or pick up hitchhikers and mischievously take them to some cannibals living way up in the mountains, or accept bail bond bounty missions. Maybe you feel like investigating a murder mystery too or jumping through hoops to join a religious cult. There is just so much to do that it&#8217;s nigh impossible for any review to cover absolutely everything but I can tell you one thing; once I&#8217;m finally done writing this review I&#8217;m jumping back in to get lost again.Aside from looking good and playing good, GTA V sounds exceptional too. I&#8217;m not just referring to the cavalcade of gunshots and explosions either but more subtle things, like the shattering of glass or yelps of animals meeting their demise under your tires. The voice acting from a relatively unknown cast is fantastic mitigating the initial disappointment that Rockstar didn&#8217;t contract any major celebrities this time around.This also marks the first time that a GTA game has ever had an orchestrated musical score to emphasize critical plot points instead of just having nothingness or a random song on the radio play. Speaking of the radio stations, there are 15 amounting to a whopping rough estimate of 250 songs, so there&#8217;s potentially something for everyone.Winding down this review (finally), I think it&#8217;s no understatement when I say that GTA V might have the most content ever in a video game that isn&#8217;t an MMO or something without end. The story is smart and socially relevant satire with unforgettable characters, pitch perfect gameplay, and unbelievable graphics that will undoubtedly rival the early days of the next generation. Rockstar have gone above and beyond shattering sales records and deservedly so, for I firmly believe that GTA V will live on as one of the greatest games of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0009Q1IE2","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Joke 4: The Death of OpenGL","reviewText":"Back in the mid to late 1990s two major Application Programming Interfaces managed to dominate the PC game scene - DirectX and OpenGL, so much so that graphics hardware developers like ATI and NVIDIA built hardware around these APIs. OpenGL seemed to enjoy a life with game developers who used Silicon Graphics workstations (SGI) to create models and animations for games and film. We could buy high-end OpenGL graphics cards that where up to 64mb back in the days when 8mb cards where mainstream. Even the Nintendo 64 built some of its architecture around OpenGL graphics. In the year 2004 the high end 256mb cards where quickly bought up to enjoy the power of games like \"Half-Life 2\" and \"Doom 3\" (in fact \"HL2\" was the only reason for the upgrade). \"Doom 3\" is an OpenGL game and looked amazing. \"Half-Life 2\" used DirectX 9 where previously Half-Life 1 offered both OpenGL and DirectX support. Because \"Doom3\" was so dark it led many to wonder that if the game was brighter, would it reveal something questionable about the quality of modern OpenGL graphics? \"Doom3\" also had an option to use 512mb cards that have only been released in the autumn of 2005. Valve's choice not to support OpenGL further fuelled speculation that OpenGL may be badly lagging behind DirectX 9. \"Quake 4\" is confirmation of this problem... and it is more serious than previously thought. \"Quake 4\" is built on the \"Doom 3\" engine. Since \"Doom 3\" was mostly occupied with hiding you in dark places you never got to see the full quality of a brightly lit OpenGL first person shooter. Now that \"Quake 4\" has had to come up with a sequel to \"Quake 3\", ID software handing over development to Raven software, the horrible truth has come to light. OpenGL is simply leagues behind DirectX 9... and we are talking a big difference here. \"Quake 4\" offers absolutely no reflections. Instead we are still in the world of mapped reflections. Texture detail is the equivalent of \"Half-Life 1\". Polygon shapes are clearly visible even with every setting maxed out. Bump mapping is hardly visible. Steam and smoke is displayed as big successive blocks of floating transparent maps. Fire is \"Duke Nukem\" quality, fat orange blobs of quickly changing pixels. The shading and textures of the weapons look terrible. Again, no reflections on the guns, but we do have shadows. The facial expressions of your space marines are an attempt on matching \"F.E.A.R\" or \"Half-Life 2\" but you must turn up the Anti-Aliasing to round them off. Sadly even on a high spec gfx card this results in an even lower fps. You are a space marine that must run through the alien enemy complex, usually to meet up with a special marine who you must bring back with you, or to defeat an enemy outpost. The enemy AI does not exist. Everything is scripted. The enemy, the Strogg, instead moves exactly the same, coming in waves of two or three and you can see them move like clones of each other, getting blasted up the same way and dying the same, every single time. Not good. Lighting looks extremely blurred and the sky background is just one big map that does not even move except for the odd ship that flies around the place. Even the PS2 has better graphics than \"Quake 4\" which when on a PC at this quality begs the big question - what will the XBOX 360 have to offer if the PC version looks like a pre-millennium first person shooter? This is terrible news for everyone. The Quake series has been ruined. Multiplayer is the same quality as Quake 3. There is absolutely no need to upgrade. OpenGL is now officially dead! Only \"Doom3\" could mask its failure. Now we know why Valve did not support it. The XBOX 360 is faced with marketing a bad port to show off absolutely nothing that the 360s architecture can handle. Various tweak scripts have been released for \"Quake 4\" on the internet. These seems to have a little bit of an effect on improving game play ever so slightly, but sadly do not help much. You simple can't get what isn't there and that is the bottom line. To add further trouble to the mess is the fact that these poor quality OpenGL graphics are so demanding that even high spec card users will find themselves turning off lots of features and running the game at a low resolution. That is why \"Doom 3\" and \"Quake 4\" have a 512mb option... because it takes a juggernaut of a graphics card to actually round the graphics off and even then we are nowhere near looking at something as good as \"Half-Life 2\". Things are really that bad.As \"Quake 4\" was duel released with \"F.E.A.R\", a fully fledged DirectX 9 name, I would point gamers in the direction of that first person shooter instead and to also keep an eye out for \"Call of Duty 2\". OpenGL IS DEAD. QUAKE IS DEAD! ........noooooooooooooooo!!Pros:- Absolutely NONE.Cons:- Shockingly sub-par graphics.- Poor graphics still demanding high end system specs- No enemy AI.- Nothing new. Same as \"Quake 3\"- You must quit and restart the game every time for graphics settings to take effect.- Same price as better first person shooters out there.- It will break hearts.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2005"}

I was in a local [store] and no good game in sight.  I happened to see Wolfenstein on the top shelf and against my better judgment I bought it.  When I first popped it into my PS2, I was disappointed. The graphics were not super and the game play seemed dull.  After about an hour I found myself liking it. Why? Because this is one of the few first- person shooters out where the only point is to shoot and kill; no difficult puzzles or complex stories just simple fun violent shooting.  Don't get me wrong it wasn't the best game I've played, but non-the less it was fun.  The whole point of the game is you have to stop the Nazis from raising the dead and bringing all kinds of hell upon the world.  Do no fear; you will have an arsenal of 16 weapons at your disposal, like a combat knife, a Colt.45, an MP40, an M1S Snooper (sniper rifle) and the experimental Tesla.  Besides fighting Nazi soldiers you will also fight zombies and X creatures.  Zombies are pretty easy to kill but X creatures can take a lot of punishment, so take them out with a flamethrower or a heavy machine gun.  The game will expand across 6 environments from the pyramids of Egypt to Castle Wolfenstine itself.  Each level has secret areas and treasures that you can collect.  If you collect enough of them you will be able to upgrade you health, armor and many other things.  The graphics are the only real flaw with Wolfenstein; they don't really interfere with the game but they are not perfect and they remind you that you are playing from your living room.  Return To Castle Wolfenstein is an average first person- shooter.  Although it may not be the best game out there, it will entertain you for hours so if you ever have a spare [item price] buy this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2003"}

I would also have liked to have seen some Lamborgini's.But my greatest disappointment is that there are no racing colours for all the cars. Only the pure race cars have the racing colours. What I loved so much about GT1 was taking an everyday car, customising it and having the option of giving it the colours. Sponsors and a number. It was really alot of fun to take a mirage or civic and turn it into a race car. You can still do alot of customising to the cars. But they will always be in the same colours and look the same as you when buy it. You can change the wheels which is cool. It was for me a great appeal to get each car to the race colours and added alot of depath to the game.It hasn't really improved that much. If you take away the great graphics then it is pretty much the same as GT1 &amp; 2. But with less cars, options and features.It is still a great game, and it is still alot of fun to play.

The car selection has been trimmed, and I see good points, and bad points to that.  Sorry muscle car lovers, but they are gone from the line up.  Newer cars have been added such as the brand new not even out yet Acura RSX, and new Nissan Z car, and the new prototype Viper, and Mazada RX-8!!!!!  The tracks have all been beautifully rendered into the game, and the attention to detail is extraordinary.  They have even thrown in a few new tracks as well.  People have mentioned the heat shimmers coming up off the track, and the tire smoke of skidding tires, and sparks that shoot up after a car bottoms out on a rumble strip.  All of this makes game that much improved over the previous editions of the GT series.  One down side is the sound track to the game.

A light speaks to him, telling him that he can gain the power to save her life if he can slay the 16 colossi scattered throughout the cursed land that surrounds the shrine. Upon their destruction, there must certainly be a happy ending for all involved: Wander will save his love and the land will be rid of the cursed giants. Shadow of the Colossus puts the player in control of Wander who, along with his horse Agro, must traverse a beautiful land and defeat the 16 monsters that inhabit it. Every battle is incredibly epic and creative, giving the player a sense of wonder unlike that in any other video game I have played, but Shadow of the Colossus' emphasis on experience is somewhat costly to it as a game.As described above, Colossus' story involves a young man named Wander who sets out on a quest to save his lover by destroying the 16 colossi scattered throughout the land. Unfortunately there is no story development after the start, which places the story on the sidelines through almost the entire game. However, this allows the rest of the epic experience to sink in to a greater effect, so it can be viewed as a smart move as well. It also allows for a surprising and lengthy cutscene at the game's finale, which features several surprising twists and sheds light on other strange elements from throughout the game. Colossus' storytelling may be sparse, but in the end it allows for surprising twists and doesn't detract from the game's other fantastic elements.The entirety of Shadow of the Colossus involves two basic actions: finding the colossi and fighting the colossi. The mysterious light at the shrine gives Wander a hint as to where the next colossus is, and Wander's sword also points to the colossus when it is held up to the light correctly. The sword's direction is mainly what is helpful in finding the colossi, but sometimes the world's massive size makes it hard to know where exactly the sword is pointing, which makes it easy to get sidetracked and can take up a lot of time. If the player doesn't get lost at all, though, finding each colossus can take about 5-10 minutes of exploring the vast, open, and beautiful world. Unfortunately there is no draw to exploring the world other than finding the colossi: there are no other enemies, no side quests, nothing.However, Shadow of the Colossus' impressive visual design helps create a sense of wonder in the exploration despite the lack of available activities. The world is said to be cursed, but it sure doesn't look that way, as it is beautifully and vividly animated at every turn, sometimes looking very real. Its emptiness, sheer beauty, and massive size give the game a fantastic atmosphere. The rest of the game's graphics look very good, although occasionally characters and environments become blurry when viewed up close. The visual design of the colossi shows much detail, and it is always thrilling to watch them thrash about as Wander climbs all over them. Overall, Shadow of the Colossus is an impressive game in the graphics department, and is a remarkable achievement for the PS2.Shadow of the Colossus is all about an epic experience, and that comes in waves as players battle each of the game's sixteen colossi. Simply looking at these monsters is a sight to behold, as their sheer size can easily make anyone watching gape in wonder and surprise. The size and fearsomeness of these beasts is powerfully translated on screen; but after a moment of initial alarm, it must be recalled that the colossus must be defeated. Actually fighting these colossi always involves locating and stabbing their weak points repeatedly until their health meter runs out, and while this simple task doesn't vary at all, the approach to climbing on top of the colossus is fresh and exciting in every battle.The epic experience comes through very strongly in every single battle, as the concept of fighting these giant colossi in and of itself is naturally epic. Actually climbing up these monsters offers countless cinematic moments that often make the game feel more like a movie than a game, and the fact that the gameplay isn't incredibly deep also develops that feeling. But sometimes the cinematic appeal of Colossus doesn't come without making sacrifices to the actual video game, seeing as a helpful camera angle is often hard to find and the controls offer a steep learning curve. The game strives for realism so hard that the controls take a hit, and while it makes the game much harder to jump into they do eventually become second-nature, ultimately allowing players to enjoy Shadow of the Colossus for the epic, cinematic experience it is.The moment of delivering the finishing blow on the sixteenth colossus can take roughly 7-9 hours to reach. The game isn't particularly lengthy but also not all too short, providing a decent length although the inclusion of other elements aside from finding and fighting bosses would have improved the game. The system may be repetitious in theory, but in action it just doesn't get dull. Fighting the colossi is fun all the way to the end, and I know that Shadow of the Colossus will be a game for me to replay many times in the future.Shadow of the Colossus also features impressive sound design. Each music track is fantastic and strengthens the epic feeling in every battle; in fact Colossus' soundtrack may be one of my favorites from any video game I've played. The sound effects also contribute powerfully to the epic feeling of the game, with booming sounds of the colossi stomping, roaring, or otherwise trying to fling Wander off their back or obliterate him by other means.In the end, Shadow of the Colossus provides an epic experience the likes of which I have never seen in any other video game. Its fantastic sense of atmosphere and visual appeal create a memorable environment, while the 16 boss battles provide unique, challenging, and epic gameplay. Even with a stubborn camera, rough controls, and no extra tasks, the epic experience shines brilliantly in this PS2 masterpiece. Despite its very tangible flaws, Shadow of the Colossus is a brilliant and epic experience of a game that should not be missed.Positive:+ Story's finale features several brilliant twists+ Visual appeal creates a vivid sense of wonder+ Every battle is incredibly epic and well designed+ Adequately challenging overall+ Fantastic soundtrack and sound effectsNegative:- Exploration is forced and lacks much of a draw- Camera and controls create unnecessary difficulties to overcome9.0/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2010"}

The first and biggest flaw is it's too short. The story line is really interesting and vivid but it feels rushed and is over quite quickly. In between the story missons, you can do side missons to give you money and stats. The side missons give it more substance, but it's still not enough.I would recommend buying this game. I do like it. It's just I feel the developers didn't unleash its full potential. It could have been an even bigger hit if they added more to it. The graphics look great and the feel of the controls is nice as well. There are a bunch of weapons that you can use too. Such as pistols, rifles, shotguns, snipers, bows, knives, and let's not forget dynamite.Sometimes you're fighting outlaws, sometimes you're fighting Indians and sometimes you're fighting wild beasts. There is a lot of shooting and horse riding in it too. You'll like the game if you like either of those. The Second flaw is that the world of Gun is too small. While it feels big at first, the more you explore it the less you find. After I played it a couple of times, I new it like the back of my hand.One of the fun things in it is hunting for gold. There is 44 gold chunks scattered around. To this day have still not found all of them. I have found 43 of 44!! You get $10 when you find them. Then you can spend the money in the 3 stores to get upgrades. The third flaw is that they haven't made a second one yet!

{"product_name":"B004LLRYOY","description":"Square Enix FF IV:The Complete CollectionFinal Fantasy IV:The Complete Collection PSP","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Still Good Two Decades Later","reviewText":"There's a feeling that Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection is a waste of time.  In part because Final Fantasy IV has already so many releases it's not even funny.  The game has already been released on the Super Nintendo, original Playstation, Gameboy Advance and has a full blown remake on the Nintendo DS.  This is also not including the reissue on the Wii's virtual console.  By now, who hasn't experienced Final Fantasy IV that wants to?  It's still a great game, but it's hard to recommend the game to those who've already experienced it before (particularly the Playstation or GBA copy).  And the After Years isn't exactly going to add to the experience as it's fairly forgettable.Final Fantasy IV's story is simple.  Cecil, the dark knight from the King of Baron, has just taken the crystal from Mysidia.  But the means by which he was ordered to take it bothers him.  Something is going on in the Kingdom and when he brings about question to the King, he is stripped of his ranks as the leader of the Red Wings and is sent to a nearby town with a bomb ring in tow... that manages to come to life and burn it to the ground.  Finding his kingdom corrupt and realizing he has done wrong, Cecil decides to strip himself of the Dark Knight and become a Paladin and restore order.  There is, however, so much more to the story.  Final Fantasy IV has a good story in the RPG realm.  Whether or not it's aged well is something gamers may have to consider.  If you played it originally it might still shine.  As it does for me.  On the other hand, if you are just now playing the game for the first time you aren't likely to realize what the big deal is now.  In 1991 Final Fantasy IV was a big step forward for video games in general.  Presently there are still some gamers who don't particularly see the appeal.Nevertheless, many of the things Final Fantasy IV does are things the series continued to do for the next decade following it's release.  Giving characters personality and developing relationships between them started here.  The ATB battle system started here.  And the drama that the Final Fantasy series began started here.  The world is put on a stage, providing some twists and turns.  The series merely evolved on what Final Fantasy IV started.  As a result it's gameplay is as simple as it gets.  You get into battles and your characters wait their turn and attack.  Since it's active time your enemies might attack while you are still selecting in the menu.  You watch the actions play out.  Most battles are done rather quickly.  You do have characters that will learn more abilities as they level.  There isn't really a complex skill system at work here and most of it is straight forward.  There are no characters that you really have to switch out of your party.  The story will dictate who will and be in and out of your party.  But it will never leave you helpless.  There is usually a character you'll have that is perfectly suitable for your situation.In the past Final Fantasy IV was known as one of the most difficult RPGs out there.  This collection doesn't really have that here.  The difficulty feels toned down considerably.  Especially from the recent DS release.  Those looking for a challenge won't exactly find it here.  On the other hand the presentation is quite good.  The DS release may have crunched more pixels but it's hard to deny that some of it is downright ugly.  The sprites are smooth and detailed giving the game a soft look and it's still easy on the eyes.  It's reminiscent of the look you saw in earlier releases of Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II.The after years, however, wasn't very memorable to begin with and here it's not quite so memorable either.  In part because there just isn't much to it.  The main game itself is the real deal here, but the After Years feels like an after thought.  The same devotion that went into main game never felt like it was there to begin with.  The good news is that the main game itself is worth the money alone, but The After Years is likely to be done in just a couple of hours.The only other problem is whether or not the game is worth it if you've already invested in it previously.  Especially because the previous two releases weren't that long ago.  It includes all the extras of the GBA version... but for that you could easily get the GBA version.  And depending on if you have a preference for sprites or not, the DS version is still available as well.  If you already have Final Fantasy IV and you're content, there's not much need to pick this up.

I'd place it right under Halo, Halo2, Half-Life2 and right above Doom3 in the top 5 best xbox games of all time. There are a few hooks that simply make this game fun.- Graphics are beautiful. Really gorgeous.- Soundtrack/score is top notch (Amon Tobin). Listen to the track during the boat mission in which you toss people overboard. It's more beautiful than most Hollywood scores. There is some additional music from fake rock bands scattered throughout the game on radios for a nice touch. Even the added touch of foreign computers having their own particular cultural sounds when you turn them on/off. When a game designer goes to these lengths, you really have something worth while.- Cool new moves. Ability to knock people over and pull them down from ledges is cool. Grab them through Japanese paper doors. Knock them out from behind doors. All a lot of fun. Game also reminds you how to do them while loading. Good touch.- Items/gadgets still cool, hacking is especially cool- They lightened up on the alarms concept- As with other Splinter Cell games, the scope is global and these spy agencies are real. I like the multi-cultural immersion.- Co-op with modified levels- Long game- Glitch free. No consulting the internet to figure out what went wrong.- The story doesn't blame everything on Arabs or Islamic fundamentalism. The bad guys are a combo of home grown and global. At one point, you are technically \"at war\".- Solid upgrade overall over other splinter cell games.No complaints here folks.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2007"}

With playable characters like Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, and Mike Tyson, I thought this had the chance to be great.  Unfortunately, like with most pugilistic video game efforts, it is just too difficult to play without a steep learning curve.Though playing as classic boxers is fun, it doesn't make up for the fact that boxing video games have almost an impossible task when it comes to controls.  I played this with some friends for a couple of hours, and after that time all we determined is that we would need more practice to truly be good.  A LOT more practice.  Until you completely master the various punching/blocking/dodging controls, you it is pretty much just randomly hitting buttons and hoping for results.For a comparison: Shortly after trying this game out, I also got WWE 2K14 for the XBOX 360.  Within one match, I could easily pick up the controls and had great fun with the game.  I knew there was more in-depth controlling I could do, but I didn't need to be an expert button-er to dive right in.  This relegated &#34;Fight Night&#34; to the back of the gaming shelf.Overall, then, while this game is so tantalizing in offering all the classic fighters from days gone by, the controls still are not good enough to make it all that fun of a game.  Unless you really want to invest the time into perfecting it, don't bother picking this one up.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2014"}

K. Malone","summary":"An Instant Classic","reviewText":"After playing the demo that came bundled with Resident Evil Code Veronica X, there was no way I wasn't going to import this baby. Although it could technically be considered a spin-off from the Resident Evil series, I think DMC is best described as \"Loaded updated for the 128 bit generation.\" Truly, this game is very similar to Loaded; explore the dungeon, blow away countless enemies, find the key item, blow away countless enemies, find the exit, defeat the boss and survive by the skin of your teeth, repeat. It's essentially a very polished, stylish \"twitch game.\" Those who demand a cereberal gaming experience should seek elsewhere.The puzzle aspect is virtually non-exisitant. This game requires reflexes and fighting skills, not wits. That may sound shallow, but the constant action keeps you satisfied, and the boss battles demand a considerable amount of skill. Finesse and style are encouraged when fighting. Defeating enemies earns you red orbs, which are needed to \"cash in\" for new moves and power-ups. (Sound familiar, Onimusha fans?) How you kill an enemy determines how many red orbs you will earn. Blowing an enemy away with one shot from your grenade launcher will yield only one pitiful orb, but using your sword to juggle an enemy in mid-air for several seconds until he explodes before ever touching the ground will get you 5-10 orbs. This prevents things from becoming too mindless. You will surely find yourself re-entering rooms to spawn more enemies, because fighting in DMC is such a pleasure. There are a LOT of skills and moves to learn, and most of them require between 1500 and 5000 orbs. I couldn't unlock them all in my first play-through.Like the puzzle element, the story is kept to a minimum. I think you can count the actual expository cinemas that occur throughout the game on one hand, and still have a couple of fingers left over to pick your nose with. To do otherwise would interrupt the constant flow of adrenaline, which is the entire point. The story itself is no big deal, and the cheese in a couple of lines of dialogue could feed a small country. I wouldn't have it any other way.Graphically, I can think of no game on the PS2 that can surpass DMC. It's up there with MGS2, FFX, and Ico.Like most of the Resident Evil games, DMC took me about 10 hours to finish my first time, but I understand it can completed in two hours by someone who knows exactly what they're doing.Overall, I would strongly recommend Devil May Cry to anyone who even slighty enjoys action/adventure games, because this is surely one the best action/adventure games ever made.Update 12/29/08: Here we are seven years later, and as of now there are four games in the DMC series. I am of the firm opinion that DMC1 is still the best of them. The man who directed it, Hideki Kamiya, had nothing to do with any of the sequels, and it definitely shows. His latest game \"Bayonetta\" will be released in 2009, and it appears to be almost a sort of spiritual sequel to DMC1. I'm looking forward to it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2001"}

That game was the pinnacle of the entire series.  You could fly planes, attack helicopters, transport helicopters, drive a myriad of vehicles including jeeps, boats, tanks, you could specialize your class as a medic, a machine gunner, a sniper, a spec ops personnel, an engineer, and you could even be the commander of everyone on your team via a top down RTS mode.  BF2 came out way back in 2005, and instead of building upon these great design principles that defined the Battlefield series, the gameplay was drastically changed when it was transferred to cater consoles.Since BF2, the Battlefield series has focused largely on improving the graphics and single campaign storyline, but has removed a lot of ways that the game can be played as a result.  Slowly, more features from BF2 are becoming available: the ability to fly planes, larger maps, and more specialized classes.There are a couple of things that prevent this game from really holding its own against BF2 though: the main thing being the total amount of players that can participate in a match together on consoles is 24.  Going back to BF2 again, that number was 64.Playing BF3 on the PS3 in a classic BF map like Caspian Border (or any of the Back to Karkand maps) I constantly found no enemy resistance when capturing any of the enemy flags.  The reason being the maps were all designed to hold up to 64 players.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2012"}

As all the individuals you play, you will try to get closer and closer to the kid and to who the killer is.Now as you play, you can die and once you do, the story of that individual will end but you will pick up with the other characters. Now with QTE, not hitting a button on time will make a new action and often times the choices you will make could be completely different through a second play through.Down to the point. The game is great looking and plays really well. It was and is a creative game that blends a immersive story more than most have and the killer is a big surprise! My wife had enjoyed watching me play this game and I have a friend's wife that doesn't like games, play through it. This game can interest people not interest in video games. Its something special and deserves a chance. With that said, it is slow to start as you will do simple things to get used to the controls and it tries to develop the characters.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2010"}

A simple button mashing on the kick buttons with these characters can send them into a fury of kicks that can kill an opponent in just a few hits.  This is very frustrating when you've spent time practicing complex combos only for someone to come along and get the same results by just mashing on buttons at random.

{"product_name":"B0050SVGW8","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A triumphant return for Nintendo's beloved pink puffball","reviewText":"In recent years, Kirby has had quite a few rather interesting outings that took everything we came to expect from his games and threw them out the window for a number of unorthodox directions. He wasracing on stars,he was turned into yarn and thrown into an adventure comprised entirely of crafting supplies sans trademark enemy copying, and most recentlyhe's been split into ten versions of himself and controlled only with stylus. While those (and a few other radical departure games for Kirby) were actually pretty excellent in their own right, it's great to see the adorable pink puffball return, not only to Dreamland, but to his roots (there are lots of \"return\" puns here. I make no apologies for them, or for the fact that this is a \"long\" review, get ready). This is Kirby at his purest, most concentrated traditional \"Kirbiness\" in years, and that alone makes this a fantastic game. However, even without looking at that aspect alone, this game is amazing on its own.The story in Kirby's Return To Dreamland is simple, but functional. An alien has crash landed on Pop Star, and due to some truly good Samaritan impulses, Kirby and the gang decide to help their new extraterrestrial friend rebuild his ship. The story plays out in typical Kirby fashion, that being extremely charming (near cotton candy vomit inducing, and for once I mean that in a good way), and never gets in the way of why you and I pick up a Kirby title to begin with: gameplay and style.Hal Laboratories has always been known for making incredible games with well-established mechanics that border on perfection (Super Smash Bros.,Earthbound, Kirby... need I go on?). Even though Kirby hasn't been sucking, eating, and mimicking in quite some time, I'd argue he hasn't done it better than here. All of the enemy abilities you would expect to copy, such as hammer, sword, fire, rock, even the adorable-yet-uesless sleepy ability, all make a return here and they're as great as they ever were. There are new abilities to copy as well, and they really mesh well with the classics. As inKirby Super Star (and Ultra, obviously), Kirby's appearance is changed based on who he has viciously digested and copied, and they all look awesome. There really is something fantastic and viscerally satisfying about the traditional Kirby gameplay design, and it's really a blast here. Level designs are stupendous despite their simplicity and when combined with Kirby's puffball float-jump and his copying, it all makes for a truly memorable experience. I haven't had this much fun with a Kirby title since Super Star Ultra. Each copied ability has a range of contextual attacks depending on if you're attacking while standing, aiming, running, and jumping, which makes for a rather deep experience when you consider the many abilities you will acquire over the course of the game. Boss fights are as satisfying and epic as ever in Kirby's history.There are some new features in the gameplay that are worth mentioning here too. For instance, remember how intuitive and satisfyingly implemented shaking your Wii-mote was inDonkey Kong Country ReturnsorNew Super Mario Bros. Wii? Kirby's Return to Dreamland utilizes that action in much the same way. Some enemies are huge or glowing, and need Kirby's new Wii-mote shaking \"super suck\" to vacuum them up. Once digested, these foes allow Kirby to perform some truly ridiculous super moves, such as a sword that obliterates most of the screen or a massive fire-breathing dragon(!), and so on. Kirby's super suck ability is also useful for getting rid of impenetrable brick walls. These new abilities aren't really ever forced on you though, and don't feel gimmicky in the least, thank goodness.If you have friends alongside you, there has been considerable effort put into co-op should you fancy such a thing. Other players can play as Meta-Knight, King DeDeDe, and Bandana Waddle Dee (who wields a spear). Of course, none of these characters can copy enemy abilities, but they each utilize their own weapons and modes of combat to bring to the fight. This makes for a truly unique experience for each player, as totally different complimentary strategies can be implemented. Players 2-4 can also just play as a differently colored Kirby as well, and that's a blast too. The co-op in this game really reminds me of the old days of gaming. Tails' role in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 comes to mind. Lives and progress are only penalized if player 1 dies, and if anyone else does, they immediately respawn next to Kirby. This design really harkens back to a time when playing a game co-operatively was all about having fun together rather than getting a great score or everyone being punished for one person's mistake (and subsequently beating the tar out of that one person). I love it. I always give games extra points for being a great opportunity to bond with my wife, and this game has already done that in spades and I'm sure will continue to do so for a long, long time (Epic Yarn was great for that too). We have had a blast playing this together so far.Artistically and graphically, Kirby's Return to Dreamland is fantastic. Kirby games are usually the last hurrah for any Nintendo system, historically, and have always been the beaming example of what those consoles were capable of. Now, it seems with the Wii's console lifetime nearing its end, Hal Laboratories really knows how to squeeze out every last drop of capability the Wii has, even seemingly surpassing it. This is one gorgeous game, regardless of the simplistic art style and decidedly under-powered system it's on. It's vibrant and colorful, very stylistic, and nostalgic, which is exactly what I want from a Kirby game. When developers focus on art design over graphical limitation, it always makes for a better experience, and is why many of this generations' most beautiful games have been on the Wii (Metroid Prime 3andMuramasa: The Demon Bladeare both great examples of that). The music is exactly what you'd expect and want from a Kirby title, catchy, cutesy, and joy inducing. I don't think the soundtrack is quite as memorable as past titles, but it is still quite good and fits in the soundtrack canon.Kirby's Return To Dreamland is a remarkable game. I bought it as soon as I could find a copy from my local *cough cough* because I just couldn't wait (lots of confusion regarding when, exactly, this game released. October 24th, 2011, was incorrect for many stores, evidently). I suspect that many of you are like me here. I grew up loving Kirby's many, varied adventures in Dreamland, from the original 2 Gameboy Dreamland titles, to the SNES classics, to the DS remakes, to Epic Yarn, and now this. It has been quite a ride (on a star, maybe?). It's not a particularly long title. Conceivably, one could beat it in seven hours or so on their first attempt. Of course, there's lots of incentive to keep coming back for completionists. I'd say it's a very good value, and I'm a relatively poor, newly-wed young man who has to pinch pennies. For Kirby purists, the timeless, refined gameplay, beautiful, imaginative art/sound design, and overall charm of Dreamland and its citizens will be enough to make this particular entry a real stand-out for Nintendo's pink mascot. As a longtime fan of Kirby, I look forward to playing this game over and over for years to come, and I give it the highest recommendation. Buy it, devour it, and be entranced by this gloriously triumphant return to Dreamland.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2011"}

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Kevin J. Redmond","summary":"Good start, Okay Game, Some Flaws","reviewText":"First off, I would say a 3.5/5 is more accurate, or a 7/10.I will try to be as subjectively objective as I can. This is no Asheron's Call, Ultima Online, or Shadowbane. It is as much a theme park game as every other \"AAA\" MMO to come out in recent years. It looms as a shadow over other titles, such as Age of Conan or Star Trek Online. It is supremely better than anything modern except for the one dated title that everyone likes to compare it to... I won't even bother saying it because we all know which one. Does it share elements to this grossly successful \"other\" title? Of course it does. Just like \"it\" did, The Old Republic has copied elements from what worked in other, successful MMO titles. Is it a clone or a copy? I would have to say maybe, but it is something new and refreshing in many other ways. It is a theme park MMO... and that type of MMO hasn't changed much since Everquest (except to remove that pesky sandbox, which many of us still lament). Is it the be-all, end-all MMO... of course not.  It has many flaws to rival it's merits.Here's my quick breakdown:The Good:1. Voice Acting is Sufficient. You won't hear anything as well-done as the Mass Effect series, but it is adequate... and in places, pretty good. It does have some good people, and that's where it shines.  Nolan North is in it quite a bit, which alone means there's some good voice acting.  The diversity and acting quality of a lot of the rest, however, is merely \"adequate\".2. Stories are Adequate. The story lines in this game won't compete with a half-decent novel, but they are as entertaining as your run-of-the-mill prime time show.3. Group Questing is Actually Entertaining. I have always hated being in a group for questing in any other MMO. It's a penalty, curbing reward possibilities and just making everything take longer. The conversation and dialogue with NPC's makes grouping with a friend much more enjoyable.4. Instancing is at least Well-Done. I hate instancing... with a passion. Something ought to be said, though, about the way it was done to be less immersion breaking here. Walking through a glimmering force field into a private instance with NO load screen is a step forward, to be sure. Note: this only refers to private/group instancing WITHIN a zone.  See #3 below for more elaboration.5. Art Quality is Good. Sure, the graphics aren't top-notch (see \"The Bad\"), but the environments are often beautiful nonetheless. You don't need Arkham City graphics to be pretty (Arkham City was beautifully ugly), and ToR shines here. Worlds like Taris and Nar Shadda offer stark changes in artwork that is easy to appreciate.The Bad:1. Character Creation is Severely Lacking for a Modern MMO. In the days of character models such as those in any Cryptic game, Aion, or even EvE's new generator, the customization in SW: ToR's character creation system is pretty much a joke. The mesh/textures on character models are also very \"flat\".2. Engine is Poorly Optimized. There are many posts on the forums about bad FPS. Personally, I run an AMD x4 Phenom II Quad-Core 3.2ghz, 6gb Corsair RAM, and a GTX 580 (GTS250 for Physx, which doesn't apply here)... and I'm lucky to average 30fps on max settings (ironically the same average as people with far lesser systems). Considering the lack of technically advanced graphics, something is amiss here.3. The first several worlds are very \"corridor-ish\". The worlds don't seem very big, there is little exploration at the onset of the game. You are funneled from point A to point B to completed objective H.  They claimed an epic and huge feel to the game, but I'm afraid to say that I'm just not feeling it... at least not yet.  Instancing might be well done WITHIN a zone, but the rest of the time I am still reminded that I'm going from one arena to the next.  The fact that each zone exists as instanced copies also limits the big MMO feel.  Many people act as apologists for developers, stating that they don't like waiting for mobs to spawn because people are camping.  My opinion is this: the devs ought to create more than one or two mobs to avoid this, not 20 instanced copies of the entire map.  MMO's used to be gigantic because they had to be, now they are tiny and save development money by just putting people in separate copies of the same zone.  Some people might love small over-instanced maps, and more power to them.  I don't.4. It doesn't feel \"alive\" the way an MMO should. The only critters in the world are occasional HUGE monsters that are too busy grazing to attack. This seems like laziness, to me.  NPC's and Enemy Mobs are always standing in one spot, doing the same thing over and over.  The rare exception is a world boss that walks in a small circle.  Everything just seems so... static.5. Sometimes combat does seem clunky, sometime it doesn't. Most of the time I have fun with it, and I suspect a lot of people's issues stem from timing issues with abilities that can be corrected at some point. Still, fluid and responsive combat is a must in any modern MMO... and it's enough of a problem that I think it merits stating.These are just my highlights. There are other issues I have, such as it not being sandbox (they always said it wouldn't be, so this was expected), and lack of immersion things like being able to sit in chairs or sit on the ground without looking constipated. I also found that the advertised flashpoint (Black Talon/Esseles) seems to be the only one that is as interactive and conversational, but I've only done the first four.  Hammer Station and Athiss, the next two, are just your run-of-the-mill dungeon crawls.  I found this rather disappointing as BT/Esseles are the most fun I've had in a \"dungeon\" in a very, very long time.  Space combat is also underwhelming, and they have said they plan on doing something big with it later on... which is fine.  None of the issues in this section are really enough to affect my rating for the game at launch, however I still thought I would add them for sake of full disclosure if you're on the fence about purchasing.Despite the flaws, there are many good qualities here... so don't let the zero's, one's, and two's on metacritic dissuade you from trying the game. At the end of the day, I have fun when I log on... for now. I'm quite certain, having been in the beta since early on, that I will get my money's worth before I stop having fun. Give it a try.  At the very least, it is a good base from which Bioware will, hopefully, build a worthy and successful MMO title that will last years.Update 1/24/12: The patch that went live last night seems to have alleviated a good deal of my negative issue #5.  That is, combat clunkiness.  The issues were apparently something to do with input lag or ability timing.  From what I garner from the official forums, which are tentative at best, this isn't a universal solution... but for most customers it seems to be much better (myself included).Issue #2 regarding engine optimization also seems to have been alleviated somewhat for me.  I did some NVidia tweaking and got much better results.  However, with the belated inclusion of AA... many users are experiencing stark FPS drops (even with AA turned off).  Shadows remain a tenuous affair, at best... and don't look very good to boot.  Either way, I'm now averaging around 50-55fps with VSync on, with obviously higher results with VSync off.  It is quite playable/enjoyable for me.Final Update 3/22/12: After hitting max level and getting all the PvP gear I could want, and poking around with some of the PvE content and alt leveling, I lost my drive to log in.  I just didn't look forward to it anymore... most of the negative things I've commented on here have taken their toll, and the positives are just not enough to keep me here.  The game feels too narrow, too empty, too lifeless, and too simplistic.  As a result, I have cancelled my subscription as of this date.  Best of luck to those of you sticking around for longer.  I am aware of the big upcoming patch, but even if it delivers on its promises... it still doesn't change the fundamental design issues that I do not enjoy.  I might come back eventually, but I have no further plans to update this review if I do.  I hope it stays something enjoyable for the rest of you for a long time to come!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2011"}

I'm disappointed to report that about half-way into the game, the bugs start to appear.  At first the game would freeze every so often.  Then, it starting hanging during loads.  Lastly, it progressed to the point where I was getting unreadable disc errors, despite the disc being in pristine condition.  I managed to finish the game though, even with the frustrating bugs and I still recommend the game despite the bugs.Dead Island is a rather difficult game, which I found frustrating at first.  I played on my own, so that may have contributed to some of the difficulty.  I died many, many times in this game.  Luckily, you're re-spawned near where you die, so dying isn't that big of a deal. Some of your cash is taken away after dying, but that's about it.This game kept growing on me as I played though.  It has an array of missions and I would estimate it took me about 30 hours to beat the entire game.  I played all the side missions I could find.  Some of them were rather goofy, like delivering insulin to a diabetic character.  Some missions were more serious, but there was a degree of levity in this game, not often seen in similar games.The types of zombies can get repetitive, but the game makes up for it in the beauty of the scenery.  The game looks stunning overall.  Lots of different weapons are found throughout the game, which can be customized.  You can also pick different skills to improve your character as you level up.  The controls feel intuitive and work as expected. \"Killing\" the zombies is fun too, I have to admit.Overall, this game is a lot of fun if you can tolerate the bugs and can handle the difficulty level.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0086V5V8G","description":"","reviewerName":"PM_SuperFreak","summary":"Super fun game!","reviewText":"Being a huge fan of the Splinter Cell series, I had high expectations for Blacklist. Furthermore, I was looking forward to this game months ago since it has been several years since the last release, and I didn't get to play Conviction (don't have an Xbox). All that said, I was thoroughly impressed with Blacklist in many ways.Graphically, the game may not be the prettiest on PS3 but everything looks really nice. Lighting effects, which are a big part of the SC stealth gameplay, is handled extremely well. Level design is also done quite nicely. There is a nice variety of locales and situations for you to tackle, and you have the full arenal of the classic SC titles, plus a few additional that are taking out of Ghost Recon Future Solider.While there is definitely an emphasis on action/combat over the previous SC titles that focuses primarily on stealth, on the majorty of the levels/missions you have the freedom to choose how to achieve your goals; this is definitely one of the things that I loved most about this game.About half-way through the game, there's one slight 'surprise' in the gameplay which I will not spoil here. Let's just say that it made me think \"this is new; never saw this in an SC game before\". This 'surprise' wasn't a huge deal and didn't affect my overall experience.In the area of customization, I was very pleased with the amount of customization available, which has been expanded from previous SC titles. Now you can not only enhance your weapons/gadgets, but you can also spend your money to purchase general upgrades such as the ability to regenerate health more quickly or unlock special weapons.I do have a couple minor gripes about this game, which is nitpicky but I thought I would share. The cover system is really fluid but at times it feels slightly too 'sticky', meaning there is a slight lag in getting out of cover. This is not an issue most of the time, but if an emeny rushes you, that split second could mean the difference between taking out the enemy or get pumped full of lead. Also, one a handful of levels, you are required to use stealth, where any detection by the enemy will result in mission failure. While this adds intensity to the mission, some might find it to be a bit tedious if you find yourself replaying the level several times after failing.I tried the play a few of the side missions but these generally required stealth only and are extremely tough given that any detection will trigger enemy backup, which typically ends with you being hunted down ruthlessly very quickly. I think these are designed for CO-OP rather than single-player. I don't usually play online but the sheer amount of content is impressive.Overall, I really enjoyed this campaign from start to finish. It met and exceeded my expectations for a Splinter Cell game in pretty much all facets. Definitely highly recommend to any SC fan. If you like stealth games even just a little bit, you have a good chance of enjoying this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2013"}

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Law","summary":"Innovative Hardware, Suitable for All Ages, Yet Lacking Convenience and Short Game Play so far.","reviewText":"I'm sure a lot of people love Wii because of it's \"revolutionary\" motion sensing controller gaming experience.  So I am not going to mention how fun it is.Instead, I would like to point out the pros and cons of Wii at the current 2.0U firmware. Things may change for future firmware updates.The reason I give 3 Stars is because I average two major categories: Innovation and Technology.  I give Innovation for 5 stars, and technological achievement and convenience for 2 stars.Motion Sensing technology is nothing new, it has been applied to cell phone gaming and vehicle air bags for quite a while.  The system is barely an upgrade from the Gamecube.  It is extremely inconvenient to share game save data compare to PS3 and even Gamecube.  The innovation point is how Nintendo has achieved to redesign the motion sensors for even better game play experience.Pros:- Parental Control- Able to count amount of time user has spent to play different Wii channels. Best for parents tracking kids video game time.- Motion Sensing Controller is extremely similar as Playstatoin 3's Six-Axis Controller.  This brings brand new intuitive gaming experience.- Bluetooth wireless technology in Wii Remote prevents cord wind up hazzles and less wireless signal interference.- AC Adaptor is separated from the console. This makes it the smallest Next Generation Console on the Market at this moment.- Backward Compatibility to Gamecube and Virtual Consoles.- White color in a very clean design.- Built in WiFi for internet downloads.- New Internet Browser is available for download in April 2007- Cheapest amaong XBOX360 and PS3- Suitable for all ages as long as you can hold the remote and know how to swing it.- My 90 Year Old Grandpa was able to get a strike in bowling, hole in one in Golf, some tennis racket swing and boxing punches.Cons:- Games are not Region Free. Unlike Playstation3 and PSP, that are region free, user cannot play import games at all without modifying their Wii's hardware.  American gamers are going to miss out a lot of interesting Japanese games such as Gundam, Naruto, Super Robot War, and many many others, even those games that don't really require people to understand Japanese!- Unable to count the amount of time the user playing Gamecube games.- Cannot easily exchange the game save data from one Wii to another. Let me elaborate this problem.If you want to share your Zelda progress to another friend, you cannot simply store your game save in the SD card and bring to your friend's house to load in his Wii console.  Instead, you have to do the following1. overwrite his save file. Make sure you tell your friend to backup his own save data. Or,2. if he hasn't played the game yet, you have to create a save file by playing the game and save at the first save point.  After that, you have to overwrite the the save on the console with the one in the SD card.- You must need a gamecube memory card and controller to play Gamecube games.  You cannot backup or save any data on the Wii console's internal 512MB memory nor SD card.  If you want to know how ripoff Nintendo is on Gamecube memory cards, please read my other reviews on \"Gamecube memory card 1019 and 59 Blocks\".- The system resets itself even from minor configuration.- Cannot use the Wii Remote to call up the system menu when playing Gamecube.  Therefore, you cannot even turn off the system with the remote.- Lacking DVD movie support even Wii game disc has the memory and physical size of a DVD.- The system gets warm during standby mode. Not sure the power consumption during Standby mode.  Anybody can clearify this?- It does not have an option for automatic firmware update in standby mode.- Somtetimes takes nearly 30 minutes or more to receive messages or Mii from other players.- Virtual Console Account is depended on the system's serial number instead of an online account.  That means if you have purchased any games/software from Wii Shop and suddenly your Wii is malfunctioning, either for an exchange or brand new replacement, you CANNOT redownload the contents for free in any replacement system.  You might need to contact Nintendo regarding to giving you back the Wii Points for in-store exchange/manufacture warrenty to redownload the content to the replacement system.- It creates a noise from the disc reader trying to read the disc even the slot is empty everytime the user resets or turn on the sytem.- Currently, most games are party games, it is fun when you have a buch of friends sitting side by side to each other.  There is currently no online games available.- The GPU and CPU is a lot inferior compare to XBOX360 and PS3; therefore, the graphics and controls are really bad especially for any kind of First Person Shooters. We'll see how well Metroid Prime perform in Wii soon.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2007"}

A few people talked me into getting this years, so I did and popped it in the ps3. I can't comment on last years, but this one seems to be put together well as far as the player mechanics and the graphics are good.  It does seem to be geared a little towards the offensive side of the ball than before. Offensive line blocking is vastly improved, which was my ultimate complaint in the previous games.  Tackling is good, especially Gang or assisted tackling.  Running and passing the ball are good also. Like I mentioned before, a lot of the mechanics have been cleaned up so gameplay and presentation is nice.My main beef is that it appears that EA sports wants you to pay to play online.

{"product_name":"B001COTC3E","reviewerName":"David Allen \"Trust999\"","summary":"High Hopes, Low Rating....","reviewText":"I've been a gamer now for about 18 years. I've played plenty of games on all types of platforms. I love my PSP as I can take my habit anywhere and get my fix. There have been many games put out for the PSP so far, some really good, and some horrible. Having finished Untold Legends - Brotherhood of The Blade, I was looking for another fun game, but something more current. On searching, I found two games, one of which was Resistance. I always thoroughly read all reviews to get a general feel for the game and what others think about it. I have to say, most got it wrong with this game.On receiving the game, I read through the manual. I was disappointed straight out of the box. The first thing I look for when searching for a game is if the controls are PSP friendly, and that means, that character movement is completely controlled by the analog stick. Most reviews said that is how the character is controlled in this game. Wrong. On reading the manual, I find that only forward and side to side character control is afforded by the analog stick, and to turn the character you have to use the triangle, circle, square, X pads in conjunction with the analog stick. This was exactly what I wanted to avoid because games that are not modified from the two analog stick control format of the PS2 and PS3 suck on the PSP because you don't have enough fingers to both control the character AND select weapons, AND aim, AND fire at the same time. Proper control on land should be totally by analog stick.I gave the game a run for its money. I'll be honest, the graphics and art work are excellent, and the story line is interesting. Sounds and music what little there is are very well done. But as one progresses through the levels it becomes increasingly difficult and then impossible to adequately control the character. This first becomes apparent when you try to swim the first time. You get an indicator to press down arrow to dive. OK, fine he goes under the water then what? You have to move the analog stick forward, but if you need to dive further, you have to press the down arrow again, hard to do when your using that hand to move forward. Turning is a joke as you attempt to use the Square and Circle buttons while pushing the analog stick. Down arrow will get you down under and diving, the up arrow button is all but useless as you die, lost and hopelessly disoriented as you've lost all sense of direction. Just to ice the cake they toss in a few Screachers later to attack you while you drown. Frustrating. The proper control set up for swimming should have been forward movement by analog stick and up, down, left, right by the symbol keys.As you progress you naturally encounter more and more enimies. Most of the earlier enimies are fairly easy, and ammo seems plentiful. Eventually you'll cross paths with an enimie called a Boiler. These lovely creatures look like the aliens you saw in the movie Independence Day. They have thick skin though so you have to shoot them forever to kill them. That uses up all or most of your ammo. The idea is, you shoot them in the head and their head explodes killing them. If you fail to do this, they explode their head of their own accord next to you taking away health. Problem, you cannot maneuver and aim and shoot at the same time because your both hands are having to control the character. You get used to shooting at the same time by pressing the R button, but unless you aim with these guys, be prepared to get blown up. Whoops, cannot aim, using that hand to do two other things, sorry. BOOM! This is a recurring major problem that only gets worse as you play along farther into the game. More enimies, less control, more of you dying instead of them. Half the time your out of ammo, even if you pick most or all of it up that you come across, which is pretty easy to do. Health is usually fairly plentiful, but there are some areas they could have cut you a break and laid one in a corner. There are some campaigns where you don't have any health options, you have to beat the gazillions of enimies overwhelming you or you die first. Again frustrating.Another poor design cue is with the weapons. There are plenty of weapons to use, and you get most of them in the beginning campaigns. Ammo is fairly plentiful, but because of control issues, you waste so much of it, you find yourself defenseless with useless empty weapons most of the time. A real problem is that each gun has different abilities, and dual capabilities. One for example is a regular gun in default mode, but acts as a grenade launcher in the other mode. The problem is, you have to aim the grenade and most of the time your needing to move while doing it. So that means your left hand is on the analog stick and your right hand is on the symbol keys, and they expect you to move, seek cover, and fire using your right button, but if you want to use the alternate weapon mode you have to press the left button, hold it then press the right button. So unless your a danged octopus, your not using the alternate weapons often. The other frustrating thing is, you eventually learn that for example the LAARK has some pretty good power. So you decide to select it, would you not think that a well designed game would display a tiny box or something with the gun name shown as your selecting weapons? Maybe the ability to press a button to refresh you memory as to what the selected weapon can do. Yes, you would expect that, but not in this game. Your on your own, all you get is a small icon, so unless you can recall in the heat of a battle while getting your butt blown off what the LAARK looked like, your SOL and DEAD.In the end this game was nothing but a lesson in total frustration. I did not enjoy playing it at all. Every turn was a struggle to control the character and stay alive only to die because the controls flat out suc'd. Designers of games like this where they are too lazy to change the control functions to PSP friendly should be put out of a job, there is no excuse for that type of poor planning and design. I can fully understand now why this game in spite of all of the glowing reviews was marked down to $14.99, still $14 too high in my opinion. Do not waste your time or hard earned money on this turd, buy God Of War first, now that is an incredible game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2010"}

It was amazing and had depth and style and this awesome vibe to it.  Well, they've taken that and killed it, made the game more cartoony graphics-wise, and made the levels more like \"clear this level\" instead of \"explore and see what's up\" like the first one was.Also of note: the voice of \"The Darkness\" isn't as creepy as in the first game.  It's like they forgot to turn on a voice filter for the actor.  The videos during loading sequences aren't as creepy-cool as the first game.  Now, they're a bother instead of this neat thing to watch.  The voice actor for the main character is taking his role too lightly - there's no depth to his role here either!Gameplay is OK - sure, you use your extra arm thingys and pick up guns and throw stuff, but the graphics are a step backward from the first:  Now, they're that annoying heavy-lined rotoscoped cartoony thing instead of that creepy-realistic type from the first game.It's not as fun playing it now, because intead of exploring like you used to, now it's more of a clear-this-level type of thing.  That's repetitive.  Also, you can only do very little with the arms: In the first game you could explore ahead of you, but you can't in this game.  It's really weak.The first game had a better vibe and better gameplay.  Now I see why I got this for so cheap so soon after it's release!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2012"}

That was until my brother-in-law let me try God Of War at his house on his PS2.  Two days later, I had a PS2 so that I could finish that game. Then for Christmas a few years back, my wife purchased a PS3 for me.  I put my PS3 in our 4 season porch with a stationary bike and ride while I play.  Anyway, so when I heard that the Origins Collection was coming out, I ordered it right away.  I didn't want to play GOW3 before I beat GOW2.  I played the first one, then the second one and finally as a gift to myself, I purchased the third one.The first thing I noticed about the Origins collection was the picture was much more clear and the sound was times better than the PS2 version.  Also, I liked that both games are on the same disc.  Obviously, that means that you sacrifice something since the 3rd one is on a disc of its own, but I felt that the picture and sound quality upgrades were exactly what I wanted them to be.I am very happy I purchased these games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2011"}

The screen, despite having the same resolution as the small screen spread over a larger area, is crisp. Not PS Vita crisp, but it's not something you're going to notice and dwell on. The outside finish is vastly improved. Instead of the shiny plastic on the previous version, the XL has a semi-matte finish--almost a metalic finish but without the gloss. It doesn't show fingerprints like the previous version. The colors are great, too. The blue isn't as light as it looks in most photos, and the red also seems a bit deeper than posted photos. The device feels much better in the hands than the previous one. The 3D effect seems to work better. I stopped using the 3D on the previous version because unless you held it exceptionally still, you would see double images. This larger version is more forgiving. My only gripe is the camera--why put such a low-resolution camera in the 3DS? I probably won't be using it very much.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2012"}

Guitar Hero really proved its merit very well this past year for all the platforms, but especially as a newcomer to the Xbox 360. The last edition, Guitar Hero II really showed what it could do for 360 owners for what they had missed out from the Playstation 2 before. Surprisingly, the gameplay proved to be more exciting than what gamers had bargained for, with the additions of extras from Xbox live, and a wireless guitar to rock out to, many have been very anxious about a sequel to rock out with. Now, true 360 owners get a second chance to play to their hearts content.Guitar Hero III for the Xbox 360, maintains itself as a true sequel by delivering a lot of new additions to the rock and roll game from before. The gameplay includes a couple of new challenges here, from boss modes to the feature of battling others on Xbox live. The graphics are about the same as they were before, but the songlist really will drive new gamers well. The songlist that you can rock out loud to includes standards from acts like Guns N' Roses with their anthem Welcome To The Jungle, and the classic party song Kiss made famous Rock And Roll All Night, to newcomers to the Guitar hero franchise like The Red Hot Chili Peppers with Suck My Kiss and Weezer with My Name Is Jonas. The track list delivers with the gameplay well, but like always there are a few disadvantages to the game. The main disadvantage comes from the boss battles. You only have 3 boss battles to play, which leaves a lack of challenge. Also, with the gameplay lightly improved from Guitar Hero II, there really could've been more added here.Still, Guitar Hero III does a great job at bring the latest for the Xbox 360 well, rather than the disgraceful Guitar Hero Encore: Rock's The 80's which left PS2 fans feeling a little bitter in the mouth. Hopefully, Microsoft will have the added extras that kept the game so well as it did before. Still, if you haven't had the rock experience, than this is the game to buy for the Xbox 360.Graphics: B+Songlist: B 1/2-Sound: B 1/2+Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B for solo play; B+ for multiplayerOverall: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2007"}

Kim","summary":"LONG AGO, GANON, PRINCE OF DARKNESS, STOLE THE TRIFORCE OF..","reviewText":"I was overwhelmingly glad when I heard about Nintendo's release of old classics, however, only one game came to my attention; Legend of Zelda, which literally created new genre in the video gaming history(although Super Mario was pretty good too except I happened to have GameboyColor version, which has this 'another' version for the advanced player).  It was truly a GREAT game along with Super Mario and Metroid back in late 80s, and playing this classic once again proved that it still is.I recently finished GameboyColor version of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and was still playing its continuation, Oracle of Ages, when I got this classic (by the way, they are GREAT games!).  It became very apparent to me immediately that the series has evolved considerably by comparing with the NES version.  I was bit disappointed with its simplicity compare with 'evolved' series, however, playing the first dungeon convinced me that this classic is not about just simplicity; it's actually challenging.  It gives out heart or fairy MUCH LESS frequently, meaning that you would have to play every single part of dungeon cautiously (man, I got killed in the first dungeon three times straight!...ok..may be I happen to be a below average player..).So is this a direct transport from NES counterpart?  Yes it is, and I am glad they didn't change or add anything to it.  However, I thought the volume of music could've been louder, LOUDER!I simply bought this game because of nostalgic factor. I still remember vividly how much I loved this game, holding onto the Nintendo Power Magazine with Zelda strategy section; it was my Bible.  Finding out about secret stair by burning a tree or finally finding the way in the Lost Wood section... wow...it was an incredible, incredible experience in the eyes of 12 years old boy...So is this classic worth Five Stars?  Definitely.  I believe not only just having a classic of this magnitude itself is worths Five Stars but also being able to play this release of retro game, which ACTUALLY provides enough challenge and fun factor at your fingertip is more than enough.Witness once again the very root of this most-beloved franchise of video games.PS: starting a game with name 'ZELDA' gives totally new, more difficult version.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2004"}

However, one of my friends at work suggested this game and said it would be enjoyable.  Using my GameFly membership, I rented this game.  What has followed is now the 3rd week that I am absolutely going nuts in Pandora.First of all, the game strikes a nice difficulty balance in the story.  Get going too far ahead and you're going to probably die BUT...for someone good at these kinds of games there is incentive here to try and go through at lower levels, as you're going to experience up at a much quicker rate (and thus get closer to great Legendary weapons).  This is does not begin to touch the content in this game, as outside of the 120+ missions in the MAIN storyline, there are no less then 200-300 side missions in this game.  And then there are the GUNS...17 million different ones, to be exact.  No that's not a typo!  They are in 6 rarities (White, Green, Blue, Purple, Orange and Cyan, the latter being the rarest guns and shields in the game, to the point no % can be generated as to how often you might obtain one).  There are revolvers, shotguns, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, but what stands out is all of them have different magazine sizes, elemental properties, sights, damage outputs, regenerating ammo...I could go on and on.  The bottom line is you could literally play through this game 100 times and never get the same gun twice.  They also scale for level, so you CAN get a \"legendary\" gun at the level you are at.  As you continue to level up, so does the overall numbers of the guns.There is a great variety of characters you meet throughout the story, and that's good because the overall \"plot\" is kinda weak (you're being led to the \"vault\" and let's just say the ending won't blow your doors off, definitely not Mass Effect 3 here).Where Borderlands excels, outside of the guns and the various capabilities, is the HUMOR.  Call of Duty, Battlefield...they have NOTHING on this game.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but suffice to say when the Legendary weapon descriptions have you laughing out loud in your chair, that's a good thing.Now, to all of this, you add the Game of the Year, which includes all 4 DLC packs released during the time Borderlands has been out.The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned is probably the 2nd best piece of DLC on the game, especially when you get 4 players, there are places where you are up to your armpits in Zombies, not all of which are easy to hit.The Secret Armory of General Knoxx opens up the ability to get absoultely, hands down, the best possible weapons and shields in BL.  And is tough as nails, especially on the 2nd playthrough.  It also introduces the \"Secret Final Boss\", better bring 3 strong friends with you and have the strongest possible guns and shields if you want to take him (it?) down.There is also Max Moxxi's Underdome Riot, this puts you into an \"arena\" setting, with 5 stages and 5 waves, all different types of enemies and restrictions (such as \"enemy has stronger shields, etc).  If you remember the battle section of FFVII where as Cloud kept going, more and more bad statuses kept happening, same deal here.Finally you have \"Claptrap's New Robot Revolution\", as you go through the normal game there are Claptrap's you repair and in return (at least on the first playthrough, you get 3 additional slots to hold weapons, etc).  In the DLC, well I don't want to spoil it for you, think \"Planet of the Apes\" with robots and you've got the idea.When you put all this together, in terms of sheer gameplay you've got 60 hours at least.  If you start becoming one of those completionists who wants the best weapons (i.e. \"Pearls\"), then this can easily turn into a 400-500 hour game.  Yes, there are players verified by Gearbox who have put this much time into BL!The graphics are actually in a very refreshing style, vibrant and definitely makes Pandora into a living place (if Fallout 3 made you go cross-eyed from the repetition/dullness, you won't feel that way here).  The sound in this game is great, all the guns sound realistic and again, we go into the humor as you encounter enemies.  From a presentation standpoint, it's easy to lose sight of the main storyline quests if you start going to all the boards in the various locations, but on the other hand, those side quests help level you up as well.  The controls of the game are great and felt very fluid, I was able to jump right in with little difficulty.I do have a couple grips/recommendations, but they have no impact on my overall rating:- Whatever you do, I would NOT go online until you've finished the main storyline.  What happens is your quest log will populate with the \"host\" of the game, and this can cause missions like \"Keep your Insides Inside\" PERMANENTLY unable to be turned in.  For example, in my playthrough 2 I am completely stuck on a different, early mission.  The only fix for this is to find someone online where you are, and have them complete the mission.  This should then fix it for you.- Staying with the online theme, there are plenty of \"modders\" on all platforms, they have guns that are 1 shot kills (read:  2M damage) and infinite shields (read:  able to absorb 2 TRILLION points of damage).  Taking one of these weapons, if dropped, can break your game and, ultimately, break the intent of the game.- The music is a little better in the DLC, but we're not talking FF quality here.  Despite having its own soundtrack, it's not one of the best for the PS3 by a long shot.Final VerdictWhile I for SURE would not play this around kids, there are few games on the PS3 that offer this much replay value, variety, humor and gameplay all in one package.  Especially considering you get all 4 DLC maps along with the original BL game, the $23-25 this is going for is a steal, hands down.  Don't even hesitate a bit:  If you've got FPS friends, get this game.  You won't be sorry.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2012"}

Rose \"Blu Aficionado\"","summary":"Decent, Still a bit Disappointed...","reviewText":"First and foremost, I gotta say I'm a fan of FPS in general, everything from MW2 to Metro 2033, I enjoy playing them all.  That being said I was excited for a new CoD, even though I was a bit skeptical; admittedly I wasn't a fan of CoD:WaW.I signed into XBL, and saw almost half my friends list playing CoD:BO, this doesn't mean much though most people jump on the newest games right away.  I started the game up and went into MP with a few friends, immediately I noticed the pixelated image while loading a map...I didn't pay much attention and waited for the game to start.  This is where my first bit of disappointment set in.  The guns look terrible in my opinion, little to no detail aside from a patch of rust here and there.  The details are extremely lackluster, looking like they copied and pasted right over from WaW.I set aside the graphics for awhile and started running around, the second disappointment was easily heard.  The sound in this game cant compare to the fantastic sound effects in MW2.  Foot steps all sound the same, like your running in a mucky swamp, when on screen its actually pool side at a villa. Grenades sound like poofs, and barely give my sub-woofers a chance to create the rumble.  Gunshots are mediocre at best, I just don't get the crack of the guns like other games I've been playing.  All in all I'm pretty much let down at this point.I must say the gameplay, the bread and butter of any video game is pretty decent.  I can let the graphics and sound off in there lack of wow factor, much like Treyarch did apparently.  I ranked up to a level 14, and had a pretty good time doing it.  The guns seem to actually kill enemies this time around, instead of allowing them to run around the corner after half a clip.  The perks are nice, and the upgrade and money system seems to be really nice, and different.I upgraded my M16 with a few goodies including; flamethrower, ACOG sight, grenade launcher, and a suppressor.  Purchased claymores which thank you Treyarch you can now MOVE!  Overall the online action is non-stop, which is a good thing for a FPS.  The ability to purchase upgrades at your own pace and preference is nice, and you notice not everybody is running around with a UMP, with commando and stopping power.I'm hoping to start a bit of the single player game this weekend (looks like snow and rain) so hopefully that impresses me a bit more than the things I mentioned above.If your a diehard fan of Call of Duty, especially Treyarch's versions definitely pick Black Ops up, its a decent game, and more than likely you'll get your money's worth from the MP and zombie modes alone.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003R783IY","description":"","reviewerName":"Timothy G. Berntsen","summary":"No split screen multiplayer is a deal breaker.","reviewText":"Apparently, EA and Criterion have decided that the days of friends gathering around a TV and playing video games together should be shoved behind us and forgotten, because the only way you'll be playing Need For Speed on multiplayer is over the internet. Tell me, would you buy Street Fighter IV if there was no pay to play it against your buddies on the same couch? I think not. A racing game that has no offline multiplayer is as useless as a fighting game with no offline multiplayer. My only guess as to why EA would be stupid enough to publish this game is that they ignorantly believe that if people cannot play this game on split screen, they will convince their friends to buy a copy and play it online. Whether their reasoning was out of greed or laziness does't really matter, though-- the point is that this game is more like buying half of a game with one of the most fundamental features missing. There are much better racing games on Xbox that you can spend your money on that all have split screen multiplayer, so I suggest you send EA and Criterion a message by not wasting your hard earned money on this game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2010"}
