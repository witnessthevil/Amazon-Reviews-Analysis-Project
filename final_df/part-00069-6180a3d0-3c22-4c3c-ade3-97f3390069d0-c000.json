I've heard fairly good things about it, and it is fairly good, with a few exceptions.  The graphics and sounds are spectacular compared to Max Payne, its friendly rival.  The disarm cut-scenes are also incredibly good to watch.  The storyline does not resemble Max Payne in its darkness quality, but rather it is story of justice in the vein of Die Hard movies, with some goofy humor involved.Now to the bad parts...This game is incredibly hard, and I mean, very, very hard.  The flood of enemies against you are numerous, and they occur whenever you are close to fighting a boss -- sometimes.  Second, the enemies in a gunfight are particularly cheesy.  For example, the enemy can fire directly at you with a pistol, but you can't hit him when you are directly in front of them. Furthermore, the controls are awkward, unlike Max Payne.  They are not intuitive.  Lastly, the camera in the game is usually always stuck, so you get blindsided very often.Overall, it's worth buying it cheap, but do not get into the Max Payne frame of mind.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00020BV2E","reviewerName":"Maria Marienthal","summary":"Fantastic and inferior all at the same time","reviewText":"Yes, this game was painfully fun; however, the flaws were so ridiculous.  Honestly I can't ignore these so I will address them first.THE GLITCHES!  OH MY GOODNESS THE GLITCHES!And I thought Killzone was bad!Here are just a couple examples of the crap that happened during gameplay: when I called in a chopper to deliver an Allied APC, sure the APC came, but as the object entered my range, it simply dropped from the sky like a lead balloon and smashed my platoon.  Why\"?  Because a glitch caused the delivery chopper to appear as a Chinook, which clearly could not support the weight of the APC.  $80,000 dollars and 5 allies dead all because of one glitch.  I didn't complete that mission on that try.When I tried to plant a C4 cartridge on a North Korean scout jeep, a standard action, the jeep started to float.  Yes, it floated in mid air.  The C4 wound up underneath the C4, and my planned attack with the runaway explosive jeep never came to be.  I just had to set off the charge and light the vehicle up, blowing my cover completely.  I didn't finish the mission on that try either.Yes, objects float a lot.  There are just so many glitches in this game.  It's unbelievable.  Stuff with disappear and respawn and all sorts of weird stuff.  Honestly, it is unacceptable.Which is why I took away a star.Also, the game gets painfully repetitive.  Rescue hostages....escort someone....blow up some buildings....blow up someone....blow up his buddies....snipe some rogues....rinse and repeat.  There are 52 cards to get.......that's 52 punch outs and extractions.  52!!! Seriously think about that.  52 EXTRACTIONS.  Talk about redundant.The problem with this game is that by the time you've taken out the first suit of cards, you've seen everything that the game has to offer.  As you progress through the game, your air-strikes get bigger and you get more vehicle drop options.  Supply drops also increase.  But you can just travel around the map and pick these things up anyway.  You'll run into every weapon in the game as you play it.Oh and by the way, the mercenaries can't swim.  I couldn't believe how frustrating this game got to be sometimes and I often wonder how I managed to complete this game.Graphically this game was very unimpressive.  But then again doesn't that come with all Lucasarts games?  I mean come one...KOTOR's graphics? Tsha.......  The explosions were pretty, and so were the vehicles.  But the infantry animations were mediocre.  Lucasarts didn't take advantage of the power of the PS2.The AI is so dumb.  And that's all I'll say about that.Okay, enough with the ripping.  Here's the good news.What little game is not repetitive, and even some of that that is, is really fun.  The game allows for very many ways to accomplish missions.  You can go in stealthy disguised as your enemy's ally, or pack up a platoon of soldiers and dive in head first with guns blazing and massive explosions in your wake.  With the 52 capture options that you have, there is no reason to repeat a mission in order to try another method.  Just experiment on the next card.What is really nice is that you can hijack anything.  I'm serious, everything is drivable.  Civilian cars, military jeeps, humvees, tanks, choppers, the whole shabangabang.  Best of all, each vehicle is special and drives differently.The weapon variation is key.  Anti-armor rounds, light machine guns, heavy machine guns, anti-tank, anti-air, and RPG's are all there.  Even the humvees have gun variation.  It's just nice to know that you have about 90 different ways that you can go about blowing stuff up.I do admit to having a tendency of shredding something more than I promote it, so perhaps the confessions of this review may be slightly negatively biased. But the game is by no means awful.  The game was consistently fun, and even though I frequently got tired of the repetitive nature, I was able to come back to a very fun challenge every time.  No mission is impossible (maybe except for the King of Spades...that took a while).  But very often you will find yourself revamping your methods of completion for the more difficult missions.Another little thing that I liked about the game was its humor.  As Jennifer Mui, a lot of historical political humor was used.  It's just nice to see a bit of very minor intellectualism in videogames.  Yeah....games that aren't based on actual events aren't exactly full of useful information.  It's out-of-place spot in the game just made it that much more special, especially since the game was directly marketed as a \"blow the living crap out of it\" type of game.This game was actually quite good.  It certainly wasn't brilliant, but giving it less than 4 stars wouldn't be doing it any justice.  3 Stars would mean it was pretty average, and 5 Stars would mean it is brilliant.  This game falls into the gray area.  4 Stars is quite well fitting.  This is a good rental game, but it does have a lot of replay value.  Don't rent this game 3 times...just buy it.  Perhaps waiting for the price to drop would be wise.  It'll be the sort of game that when you dig it up in a few months when you're bored, you'll have fun playing it.  Hey check it out!  At the time of this review the game was going for about $25 bucks.  I'd say buy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2005"}

Although I'm a fan of survival-horror, I'm a big fan of first-person shooters, and I have been for years. I can understand why Resident Evil fans b***h about how this game sucks, it's not as awesome as the other Resident Evils(except Gaiden), the creepy vibe is absent most of the time, the voice-acting and story are more cheesy as well, and the graphics actually look worse than the other Resident Evil games on PSone. The game takes place after the events of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis on an island where apparently the infection had been brought to that was outside Raccoon City; where the infection started. You are a soldier, and during a flight on a helicopter a scientist was clinging to the bars on the chopper and he shoots down your flight. It turns out you are the only survivor and you've lost your memory (Gasp!). So you shoot your way through hell while discovering the secrets of your past. The shooting mechanics actually use the same buttons the other Resident Evil games use on PSone (Hold down R1 to aim and press X to fire), except trying to shoot something is not haphazard. The creatures are still gross, freaky and nasty, and the game feels like an arcade game (Think House of the Dead, Carnevil, and Time Crisis combined), plus you never run out of ammo, and you will laugh at the lame story and voice-acting. Still, this game while having better controls than the other Resident Evil games, it just isn't as fun as the others and it feels like it has more thrills than scares. Damn, this was a good Christmas. Especially with getting games like this one, Resident Evil: Director's Cut, Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Resident Evil: Gaiden, Parasite Eve 1 & 2, Final Fantasy VII, XIII, The Punisher, and Mercenaries which will keep me busy for awhile and I'll get to Amazon eventually to say if they are good (So far so good though, really good in fact).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2007"}

Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"You WILL learn the meaning of FEAR","reviewText":"Someone was most assuredly playing Halo one day and then, after watching The Ring, said, \"You know what would be cool? If we combined Japanese horror with a first-person shooter!\"  And thus FEAR was born.FEAR (First Encounter Assault Recon) is Halo without the power suit and vehicles in tightly confined, spooky urban environments. Your character is anonymous behind his faceplate, like Master Chief, and you possess powers beyond mortal men, including the ability to slow down time in Matrix-esque fashion.  The usual weapons of mass destruction are present as well: pistols, sniper rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, and of course the obligatory futuristic energy rifle.What makes FEAR different is its adherence to a disturbing plotline.  Project Origin has created a series of telepathically controlled clones (think clone troopers from Star Wars). They are the perfect warriors, led by their powerful telepathic commander, Paxton Fettel.  Only Paxton has been driven mad by the ghost of a little girl, Alma, and transformed into a cannibalistic mass murderer.  Cue our point man (that'd be the player) and the FEAR team.What ensues is a creepy romp through garbage-filled alleyways, poorly lit warehouses, abandoned office buildings, and weird underground laboratories.  We learn the story through more than dialogue alone; there are various opportunities to overhear answering machine messages, slowly unspooling the plot.FEAR is an interesting experiment in horror.  Horror is largely scripted, be it in a novel or script, thereby dictating when and where bad things happen.  In FEAR, although events are scripted, they don't necessarily play out the way the creators probably intended.  I was often looking the wrong way when a creepy ghost appeared, ruining the effect.  Conversely, some creepy moments wear off quickly when you've died twelve times and have to replay the scene over and over again.  Nevertheless, the game has its moments, not in the intentionally creepy horror but the subtle: a lone photocopy machine illuminated in the darkness as it photocopies nothing, the rattling of underground pipes ready to burst, and the accidental bumping of debris all kept my nerves frayed.And there is a LOT of debris.  Everything in the game can be hit, bumped, knocked over, moved, and blown up.  Except for the cast of characters.  This is a bit of a let down when some key cast members (who we just know are BAD (tm)) cannot be harmed with a pistol to the forehead, yet you can accidentally blow yourself to bits by shooting a fire extinguisher from a distance.  The game chooses when to be realistic at its creators' whim.FEAR has one of the most realistic artificial intelligences in recent FPS memory.  The clone soldiers work together, throwing grenades at the right moment, looping back around to catch you by surprise, and running and gunning when under heavy fire.  They leap over barriers and duck under cover, scream for backup and loudly declare their intentions over their walkie-talkies.  In fact they act a lot like...People.  It's so strange that a game fixated on the terror of cloning has the most human-like enemies ever to grace the Xbox 360.  The panic in a clone soldier's voice is almost pathetic when you eliminate his entire team: \"I can't stop him!\" When a soldier thinks he has the drop on you, he swears like a sailor.FEAR is bloody, violent, and foul-mouthed.  Sometimes the cursing seems a little egregious; sometimes it makes you wonder who taught the clones these potty words.  But the blood, especially in slow-mo mode, is glorious to behold, especially when a shotgun blast at point blank range tears through a clone soldier and the bookshelf behind him.FEAR has its flaws.  The collision detection isn't always right, snagging your character on strange parts of the board.  Bad guys fall all over in rag doll fashion thanks to the Havok engine, but they also sometimes fall in weird poses (on several occasions, a clone soldier fell and hung in mid-air). And the voice acting is so-so.But FEAR does one thing right, and that was enough to make me play it obsessively until I beat it.  You WILL learn the meaning of FEAR.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2007"}

The armor is tough, and possibly red-hot, because contact for more than a few moments is death, death, death.

The environments are much more varied than Oblivion's. deserts, standard deciduous forests, open fields, black/dead forest, volcanic areas, bamboo forest, ect . which brings me to my next point: this game is HUGE. The map is %25 larger than Cyrodiil.when you first start playing the game you'll notice the frame rate stuttering relatively often, but honestly, if you've played Oblivion for any time at all, it shouldnt bother you that much. the game could be much more polished though, which is my only real complaint.the menu navigation could be better, your inventory management in particular. your equipment is all together, not seperated by type at all. you have potions, weapons, armor, alchemy items, traps, and whatever else all scrambled together. so this aspect of the game feels a little sloppy that could've been very easily solved. the small text bothers me too, but that's in most next gen games these days. we just have to accept it, SDTV owners will always get the short end of the stick. that small text is very easily read on an HD. there should at leased be an option to have the text formatted for SD as well. maybe just an option in the menu somewhere. Dead Rising is still the worst text ive seen in a game. My TV is a 19\" SD and Two Sorlds isnt really that hard to read. it is a little annoyance though.as you level up you get skill points that you can manually apply to whatever skills/attributes you want through your menu. i like The Elder Scrolls system of doing the certain skill to improve it. there was nothing wrong with that, but i get more of a hands on feel being able to manage skills directly from a menu. the system reminds me of the ones in Final Fantasy X and XII. its not on a board or anything, but its a similar concept.the battle system really isnt much different from oblivion. you take turns exchanging blows with your enemy. the only real difference is in Oblivion you raise your shield and in Two Worlds you dodge attacks.i never really liked how all your enemies leveled up with you to keep everything balanced in Oblivion. it was an interesting concept but you never really felt like you were becomming more powerful. in Two Worlds you're enemies have set levels, so if you encounter an enemy and you're outmatched, you can go somewhere else and work on the countless side quests or just explore the countryside slaughtering everything in your path, and in no time you'll be strong enough to go back and take whatever is was on with no trouble.i enjoy the noticeable difference in the look of spells as they become stronger. the difference between a 20 damage fireball and a 70 damage fireball is a very nice thing to see. i cant imagine how cool all the spells and summons will look once you hit lv 100.people have complained about the storyline and voice acting, but the voice acting was decent. ive heard better and worse. i hear a lot of complains about the story lacking originality and just not being interesting. i dont find the characters or there underlying stories vert captivating like in some games, but i found everything in this area th be at leased decent. all the different factions/countries at war can be kind of confusing. there's a lot of different groups. the main storyline isnt bad though. your sister is kidnapped by an evil group of people who keep their faces covered and its up and its up to you to save her. this has something to do with an old family legend and their knowledge of it. your recovery and delivery of an ancient relic that only your family can hold is the only way to save her but could result in the deaths of everyone else in their world.all in all, even with its little annoyances, this is a great action RPG, as long as you dont go into it expecting something beyond the bar Bblivion set. if Oblivion had never came out, this game would have been the one to set the next gen RPG bar. period.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2007"}

Dean \"John\"","summary":"Glad I finally got this","reviewText":"I used to game exclusively on PC's - I'd scoff at people and their game consoles, and could never understand how they could possibly live and game with such few button options.  Then Halo came out, and I had to buy the original Xbox.  Since then I've gotten four Xbox 360's around the house, a PS3, a Wii, and a Wii U.  And I stopped gaming on the computer completely since the original Xbox and Halo came out...  Of all the game controllers for all the systems, nothing felt as good as the Xbox 360 controllers.  For me, they were the top of the line, period.  And for my 9 year old, the thumb sticks are placed perfectly, unlike the OEM PS3 controllers that are offset too far in the middle.I got hooked on Elder Scrolls as well on the Xbox, and played Skyrim, but was getting tired of hearing people talking about the mods and such they were doing on their PC's since I couldn't do that on the Xbox.  And when I upgraded my Media Center PC from a Mac Mini running Windows in boot camp to a new Alienware X51 with the Nvidia 660 card in it, I figured it was time to see just how much better Skyrim would look on my 55\" LCD TV in ultra high detail mode with the PC - and then I could mod things to my heart's content.So I grabbed this on sale from Amazon, plugged it in, ran the installer, and fired up skyrim.  For the first time, I was playing a game on the PC without having to do *ANY* configuration for the controller.  No picking what joystick, etc.  All buttons just worked, exactly as I was used to on the Xbox.  I then got Borderlands 2 on a gold box deal, and again it just worked.  Flawlessly.I love that I can now use the same controller I prefer when I decide to get something for the PC instead of the Xbox.  That was one factor in my not gaming on the PC, the logitech game controller I had just didn't feel as good as the Xbox 360 one did.  Now that's no longer a concern.If you like to game on the PC, and you like the Xbox 360 controller, this is a no brainer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2013"}

{"product_name":"B003Q9RG9K","description":"","reviewerName":"Campy","summary":"If the story was half as good as the gameplay...","reviewText":"So I finally got Valkyria Chronicles 2 after tracking it for months and months. I have not finished the first VC, but I think it's one of the best SRPGs out there. I love SRPGs generally and this should be in any other SRPG-enthusiast's collection.First the bad- the story is as thin and threadbare  as can be. It is told in short anime snippets and stills, paired with short voice clips. The artwork is beautiful, even as a downgrade from the absolutely artful and gorgeous watercolored first entry. The voice acting is probably as annoying as morning Saturday cartoon dubwork. It's pretty bad. Given that the story is not good to begin with, the flat voice acting didn't really stand out as a con, in my opinion.The gameplay is what has kept me grinding over and over this sweet little gem. As a portable, this genre as a whole really shines. The first Valkyria Chronicles was limited, in my case anyway, by the fact that I had to sit down for  hours at a time to complete one fight, and sometimes have it be a wash. While that could be infuriating, the fact that it had to be an uninterrupted bout made it a bit unappealing at times to play VC, so I would instead play sometime more action oriented that I could drop in a moment's notice.  On handhelds, most RPGs can be paused and picked right back up later in the day. Valkyria Chronicle and it's deliberately paced strategy action  benefits greatly from this feature.The gameplay has not changed from the first entry: you still see a general map which shows enemies in your vicinity and your own units, allows you to deploy new units into the field, with certain limitations. You choose one of your units and you can move in 3d spaces and choose an action. Fairly simple, and again, the same as it was in Valkyria Chronicles on PS3. This time around though, the class system was revamped, and there are special classes you can work your basic units into.  I had heard, and had been working my way towards this, that leveling up your units in the first entry would grant you special weapons, such as flamethrowers and other class-wide perks. This time around, you can level the class, but to move up to a more specific class, you need to complete and acquire certain requirements. Shocktroopers for example, can move up to shocktrooper vets or gunners (think of a trooper with a BAR kind of machine gun) and each specification has its own requirements. It calls for insane amounts of grinding, but oh-so-fun.  And like any well designed RPG, when you move up a level, or class in this case, it pays off. And how! Why bring a lancer who can easily miss a solitary target many yards away, when you can bring a mortarer, who can zero in on a sniper or a lancer(oh irony!) out in the distance in one fell, explosive swoop? Or better yet, why not take that annoying shocktrooper out with a sword-wielding fencer(I didn't know why we had guys with swords in a faux WWII game, but believe me, taking a claymore to a gun battle is kind of hilarious and effective)All in all, that small revamp in the way of a class system gave this game a depth I did not expect the original could even lack to begin with.You should check this game out if you liked the original, as the gameplay at least remains intact, or if you are a fan of the SRPG genre. As a comparison point, this game made me stop playing Tactics Ogre LuCT. And that was an excellent game all around. I would have to advise against novices to SRPGs to try this out as their first, it's a bit of an odd duck, although the game does make an excellent point of teaching you the ropes without being too harsh or too lax. And you still get graded, so you can win, but to win with enough style to get an A, that's something else.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2011"}

{"product_name":"B003Q55YCU","description":"","reviewerName":"J. W. Mullins","summary":"Modern Red Dawn","reviewText":"The heart strings the writers and designers try to pull start as soon as you enter campaign mode. You are awoken by Korean Military and sent to a reeducation camp. They load you on the bus where you are forced to look out the window as troops round up and murder innocent Americans. There are the body bags of men, women and children, and of course the child crying and watching on as his parents are gunned down. Its sort of a heavy handed way of trying to make you care about the game. For me it didn't work, the lack or true depth in the story or any character development at all really takes away from the great start to a really scary story.The gameplay is a fairly solid FPS. There are plenty of guns laying around and lots of interesting combinations (very MW2 like). Most of the resistance troops are wearing armor and vests in the animations but despite that you are very limited on the number of rounds you carry for your weapons. This causes you to frequently run out of ammo and have to get a pick up weapon. I would have liked to see more ammo dumps so I could keep using the weapons I enjoyed. The auto lock on can also cause trouble as it doesn't lock on to the closest target you want, but the nearest. So you will often find yourself killed by a close enemy you were trying to shoot as you locked onto an enemy farther away. Maybe I have just been spoiled by how good the system works in games like Modern Warfare. The enemy AI isn't great but they make up with it by shooting a lot and fairly well. I died a lot in this game. That also let me get familiar with the poor check point save system. There are many annoying missions where a triggered ambush will require almost an entire replay of the mission.Overall it was a fairly enjoyable experience with a few annoying moments. I wish they had spent more time on the story and how your characters really play a part in the over all story. But as short as the campaign mode is there was only so much they could cram in. And the campaign is very short, somewhere around five hours might be average. The online play is fairly good and helps to try and make up for the very short single player game. But if you aren't really an online player this game is a definite rental and not a buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2011"}

And while we're at it, just WHO was the target audience for this dreadful game???  Within 10 minutes of starting the game, my 6-yr old ran out of the room screaming and crying when Ahriman (the god of Darkness) was released...10 minutes later I ran out of the room screaming and crying because this game has the WORST storyline of any PS3 game (really, now...Light seeds & light gardens to control the god of Darkness?  Sounds like someone was on a hallucinogenic trip to come up with THAT), bore-me-to-tears repetitive gameplay and absolutely NO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES for any of your actions - Your character simply can not die...Even if he slit his own throat from being forced to respond to the same lame button-pushing mania over and over and over.Worst of all, Prince of Persia is consistently rated and reviewed HIGHER than all-but-ignored 5-STAR FUN games like TimeShift, Dark Sector and HAZE.  So it DOES prove that a developer can throw eye-popping graphics at SOME console owners (Pacifists, Fantasy Novel Readers) and leave them flabbergasted.  How PROFESSIONAL reviewers can be sucked into this Black Hole of Deception remains one of the Great Unsolved Mysteries of the Universe!Strip away the absolutely BRILLIANT graphics of Prince of Persia and there's NOTHING LEFT except mindless repetition with no threat of failure...Simply put the disk in, jump around and glide from canyon wall to canyon wall and then randomly push every controller button in rapid succession whenever confronted by a Bad Guy and YOU'RE THE HERO!!

This game was developed for a good 2+years and has been hyped up quite a bit. Make no mistake, Epic Mickey is a wonderful game, and should be on most shelves in most homes. Epic Mickey truly has all the right fixins for a good game to add to your library, it's just not executed as well as it should have been.Right off the bat I will tell you MOST youngsters will not be able to play this game. My 7yo daughter ended up throwing the controller down in anger and frustration and refuses to play again. If I had to give an age range, I'd say most kids around 5-9 range will be the ones who will want to go back to playing Mario.  So why is that? Well, main problem is the control scheme is wonky and the game is difficult as soon as the game starts. The game basically relies on some very good eye and hand coordination.  The painting part is the first issue, it does rely on the motion sensing of the Wii controller and little ones might have the toughest times using this technique to continue on to more levels. But the camera is the main issue.  It will ruin your day at some very inopportune moments. The camera can be adjusted to make it go behind mickey and is helpful, but i noticed sometimes it doesn't always go behind mickey depending on the position he is in and that can be even more annoying.I do admit that at times it's pretty frustrating, BUT know this,  it doesn't ruin the game as long as you can deal with it.  And the rest of the game is so amazing, I really didn't care. The classic Disney Characters scattered all over the dark world is worth the price of admission and many parts of it is like watching and old 40's Mickey Mouse cartoon. The sound, the symphonic score, the lush slurpy smooth graphics, this is probably one of the best looking Wii games out there now.Speaking of being a dark world, Epic Mickey surprisingly is a dark dreary game. In the beginning seeing him tied up and tortured might make your little ones a bit squeamish. I mean, this is a Disney game right? LOL? But it's nothing too extreme and I was surprised to see someone else say that it gave their tot nightmares.  Well, the dark themes and music is what makes the game so intriguing and different and I think most kids should be able to handle it.  Most of the people already have explained what the game is about, and I won't get into any detail. But basically this game is a mix of platforming (jumping and fighting with your paintbrush) and battles with enemies while being entertained by a very cool story. Epic Mickey is not for everyone, and if you're impatient and don't like platformers, you probably will want to pass on this one until it gets to the bargain bin. But if you can get past the annoying camera, there is a wonderful game under all that.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2011"}

Originally one of the last original Super NES games (and one of the best), Yoshi's Island finds you playing as the loveable long tongued dinosaur as you escort baby Mario through a number of huge levels.  This is platforming at it's most excellent with some of the most unforgettable enemies and areas ever designed for a game of this type.  Nintendo upped the ante for everything they introuced in Super Mario World and took a different turn on the tried but true physics of past Mario games, giving the game a different dynamic than that a longtime Mario fan would expect.  The graphics and animation are awe-inspiring to this day, and the level design is the best you'll ever find in a 2-D side scroller.  Even in these days of next-gen console gaming with uber-3-D graphics and complicated control schemes, sometimes it's just better to get back to the basics.

I played Condemned 2 many years later and, I think I assumed that it would have improved on the first game, making my expectations too high.  I suppose playing a game for the first time in 2013 that was released in 2008 would explain why it feels so outdated. One of the problems with the first game was that the combat was a little sloppy.  Everything was melee (guns? what guns?).  I got bored beating crazies with a gas pipe or a plank of wood.  So, Condemned 2 improved on this right?  Not really.  There are now &#34;combos&#34; that you can use, but that's about it.  You're still stuck swinging a pipe at weirdos.

I've read in countless reviews about people having more trouble beating this one than the first.  But I guess when it comes down to it, it just depends on how much luck you're carrying around.Because that's all you need.  Blind freakin' luck.  Most of the time, in the story levels, I just said screw it and rolled straight ahead and somehow made it through the goal in onw piece.  An example would be a certain level where you start on a platform, which leads to a lower platform where you will find a few buttons.  These buttons are play, fast forward, rewind, etc., and ahead of these buttons, on the tip of the platform is the beginning of a giant cone, with a spiralling path for you to try and stay on carved into it.  After about three tries, I kept finding myself rolling right off the edge, no matter what I did.  So, instead of hitting something hard and breaking my videogame-playing hand, I decided I'd take a risk and just roll staight into the damn cone and hope for the best.  And a few seconds later, I found myself on the platform at the end of the cone, with confetti exploding all around me.  This tactic is very useful for alot of the game's levels.On the multiplayer side, this game shines.  While the flying minigame is better in the first Super Monkey Ball, the rest of the games are better in this installment in the series.  My favorite being the monkey bowling.  You can play with either a straight, regualar lane, or a crazy lane, that does an assortment of different things.But when it comes down to it, if you enjoy having fun with your friends for hours on end, pick this game up immediatley.  Or don't and be bored.  The choice is yours...again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000IMYKQ0","description":"The Wii Nunchuk controller is a secondary controller that adds even more innovation to the next generation of gaming, and does it all with less physical movement.Used in conjunction with the standard Wii remote, certain games need the Nunchuk controller for additional control options. Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"apelegano","summary":"............","reviewText":"This product works well.

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"PG \"2 Many PS3 game...Too little time\"","summary":"Not Bad. Heavenly Sword and Darksiders are better--AND GOW!!","reviewText":"PSN ID GremDUDE. What can I say? When the demo for this game first came on PSN, I played it three times all the way through. I loved the graphics, the smooth framerate, the cool setting, the gory violence. Looked like an awesome game. While waiting for this game to come out, I picked up Darksiders...To put it simply, there is no comparison. If you have not picked this game up yet, please don't. Buy Darksiders instead. A game which is better in every way that you can think of. This God of War clone copies everything about God of War--right down to the ridiculously difficult and frustrating platforming found in God of War I. Apparently, the designers did not look very carefully at God of War 2 to notice that the emphasis was moved from making platforming challenges that require redoing the same thing 40 times to improving and actually perfecting the combat.There were several times during this game where I was so close to just either throwing the controller at the wall or smashing the disk. More times than I care to say. Not only is the platforming difficult and many times just requires trial and error. There are too many stupid time based parts where you have to kill so many creatures in order to move some switch or pull some lever. This was done a couple times in God of War but not even close to the extent done in this game.There are also some minor annoyances that continue throughout the game. No, the camera has not been an issue for me. For some reason, this is one of the most common complaints but not for me. The checkpoint system is to put it simply total crap. Not that they are far apart but if you find a collectible or Punish or absolve a sinner, this should be saved when you die!! My God, how many times I have had to do some stupid platforming part in order to find a collectible or find a soul just to die and have to do it over again. Did they test this game at all? Anyone with half a brain given this game to test would have brought this up!!Uggh. It is truly awful. I wonder how many of the reviews on this page actually finished the game or just reviewed it after the first hour or two of gameplay. I have not finished the game yet but I am one or two times dying away from just giving up. (I am on the part early in Anger with the elevator that you have to guide a wheel along a track before the fire burns you up. Uggh, simply annoying and horribly frustrating and unnecessary!!) Maybe I am just getting to old for this kind of game. Odd considering I just finished God of War I and II on the GOW collection for the PS3(well worth the money BTW) and Darksiders. Probably more likely this game just sucks. We shall see. If I go further in the game, I will post my continuing impressions but I doubt it.Update, I did make it past the frustrating elevator sequence and the next part is totally badass. If you get to the part with the elevator and are thinking about quitting, don't. The next part makes it well worth the effort. Still not done with the game but I still stick with my negatives mentioned in the rest of my review as they made too many frustrating and irritating parts to what could have been one of the my favorite game ever. Oh well.Second and final update... Finished the game. Overall, not too bad an experience and I actually enjoyed the Fraud level of Hell which many people complained about(There is a similar part to Darksiders where you have to kill your enemies in a certain way in order to proceed) The difficulty level is seriously skewed though. One of the other reviews complained going from Zealot to the third difficulty level(Can't remember what that one is called) There is just as much a difference from Classic(easy) and Zealot. On these kinds of games, I generally play on the number two difficulty level and that is what I did on this game until the boss battle where I think you fight Dante's father? AFter dying about 10 times( and for the most part this game was just annoying me more than I was enjoying it) I switched it back to Classic. The difference is ridiculous. I killed the boss in less than a minute!! The final battle with Lucifer(shouldn't be a spoiler--who did you think you were going to fight in Hell?) took me about 3 minutes on Classic!! It is so easy in fact that you cannot level up your powers as the creatures die so fast, you cannot absolve or punish them!! Literally, I had to keep switching the difficult level between 1 and 2 just so I could get experience without being killed continually by the bosses.For the most part, I have to sadly say that this game overall is a big disappointment. I would recommend getting Darksiders or Heavenly Sword over this game. Get this one if you have already finished those games( and God of War III of course) and still have an itch for some hack and slash. This game has huge potential but just doesn't deliver where it counts","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004EW948E","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A flawed but very fun shooter with a strong narrative","reviewText":"Binary Domain is one of those games that you can't help but love despite it's glaring flaws. It's obvious that the game was a labor of love by some very skilled developers, and it's ambition and scope is quite admirable. It's a very fun game with a few glaring flaws, but none of this is enough to drag down what is a very enjoyable game that lingers long after you play it.Binary Domain's major flaw is it's conversation/trust system. Being a third person, squad-based shooter, you lead a team of mercenaries with different combat specialties that can be constantly rotated in and out of your squad. The game incorporates a conversation system, where if you answer questions asked by your squad mates in a fashion that is favorable to them, their trust in you increases. On the contrary, if they don't like what you have to say, their trust will decrease. It's a very simplistic, almost forced mechanic that just feels amateurish and out of place. Even worse, is that you have the option to actually answer via voice through a microphone, but the speech recognition in the game is so broken, that it's just easier to use the conversation wheel. The trust levels supposedly affect how much your squad listens to you and obeys the tactical orders you issue while in battle, but again, this system is broken as well. They rarely do what you order them to do, which renders the entire dialogue and tactical orders systems irrelevant anyways. This whole concept should have been scrapped, because it just doesn't work like it should.Aside from this, Binary Domain is a pretty damn good game. The story really surprised me by being incredibly exciting, affecting, and full of twists and turns that will surprise you repeatedly throughout. It reminded me of a good Philip K. Dick story with a healthy sprinkling of The Terminator. The supporting cast of characters, despite being somewhat stereotypical, are very charismatic and well written and voice-acted, which only helps to serve the narrative. The gameplay is excellent as well. The shooting is satisfying, especially once you upgrade your and your party's weapons and abilities via the many vending machines scattered throughout the game. You'll find yourself in the midst of some incredibly intense firefights quite often, with a nice variety of robot enemies and bosses to take down. Set pieces are epic and the game is filled with some really memorable moments all around. If you are a fan of third person shooters, this is one of the best ones to release in 2012 - a real sleeper hit.Binary Domain is an awesome game despite its flaws. It's a shame that the game didn't get more attention, because it really does a lot of things very well. I hope the developers, who also did the beloved Yakuza games on PS3, revisit this IP in the future, as it could be an amazing next generation game with just a few fixes here and there. Check the game out in the meantime, as it delivers an really fun experience, especially for the very fair price amazon is charging for it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2013"}

I wish I could give the Kinect a solid 5 star rating, but it just hasn't quite earned it. It has many great features, but it's a far cry from perfect or even close. The tracking can get buggy at times and it doesn't feel too precise, but rest assured that the Kinect is like nothing you've ever experienced before. I'm still very hopeful for the future of this device, and I don't plan on selling it any time in the near future (unless it starts to give me the creepy \"big brother is watching you\" vibe) I'm 100% sure that in the next month or two, Microsoft will update the Kinect software to fix the various issues people have encountered with the device. Oh, and this has nothing to do with the hardware I'm reviewing, but now that the Kinect has already sold enough units to no longer be considered a risky venture, it would be nice if more developers would add their support to the system and announce some games to be released in 2011.-------Pros:Brand New ExperienceAccessibleResponsive Voice CommandsEasy SetupFun User Interface/MenusBursting With PotentialLiteral \"Drop-in, Drop-out\" Co-opGives You A WorkoutCons:Slightly Delayed ResponsesNeeds Ample SpaceKinect Adventures Feels Like A DemoSteep Price For AdmissionVoice Commands Are Limited To Kinect Hub and SELECT VideosNot Precise (Cannot sense body details, skeletal structure only)Facial Recognition Only Fairly Accurate-------(What I would absolutely LOVE to see for the Kinect in the future is simple, cheap, casual games made specifically for the Kinect in the Games Marketplace on Xbox Live Arcade.

(at the end of the tunnel, while gasping for air)","reviewText":"I got a Kinect for Christmas (2010). I was skeptical: the kinect would not have been something I bought for myself.  I enjoy games on the xbox, but I didn't think I would like xbox's foray into Wii territory.Oh how wrong I was!The kinect was easy to set up and calibrate to recognize me.  I did not run into any real space issues in my living room: when playing with a friend we just slide the coffee table up against the couch for additional room.  And it is with friends that the kinect finds its niche.Small talk over dinner and then? Rock Band was typically the answer.  Now Kinect provides another hilarious option.  Most people can only play Kinect games for about 10 to 20 minutes at a go without needing a break, so it is great at parties.  The camera flawlessly picks up people entering and exiting the playing field.Kinect adventures has a variety of little games (plug holes, river rafting, obstacle course, etc) that are a blast to play with friends.  And because it is EXHAUSTING to duck, jump, side-step, etc, the Kinect makes accidental exercise fun, no one has to wait for a turn for very long. The Kinect adventure supports two players at a time.At $150, the Kinect is a great toy for group events at the house. Everyone enjoys seeing friends knock about, and the Kinect Adentures even takes pictures of your group at the silliest parts of the game.  They are a bit like the pictures on Disneyland Rollercoasters that catch you screaming on the way down, except the Kinect catches you mid-jump, one leg in the air! This feature can be disabled for the privacy-concerned.  Or, like me, after the party you can upload the pics of the group Kinect-ing for all your friends to enjoy later.There is a slight downside: unless you are interested in the fitness aspect of the Kinect, I don't see anyone playing the Kinect solo very often.  At least until some better games are released.  Or--better yet--Kinect becomes an integrated option within games (here there is MASSIVE amount of potential for the Kinect--no D-pad fumbling for squad-mates just say \"Charlie, breach the door\" or wave to get your comrades to move forward or halt).So all-in-all Kinect is blast.  I can see it being used at every house party and dinner party.  Rock band is going to have to compete for group attention.  However, as of January 2011, there is not much solo-gaming going on with the Kinect.  I have high hopes to see it integrated with the controller so the great titles like Call of Duty or Bad Company or Halo see some Kinect optional features.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"M. Daneker","summary":"Final Fantasy light, a linear and overly simple entry","reviewText":"Much of what has made Final Fantasy a great series is gone in FFVIII; from towns and cities to explore to the simple satisfaction of beating lower monsters to level up to defeat harder ones, it's all gone. There will be no clever tactics of combining the right melee with magic with healing to defeat an opponent and no setting forth in whatever direction you like in search of treasure, experience or quest gains, you will walk the straight line and \"auto-chain\" your way through the 50hrs that is, FFXIII.I'm not going to bother with plot here as it's the only reason to play the game -- a movie with pauses that let you fight between cut-scenes.Even if some felt the battle system in FFXII could be overly automated it's nothing compared to the one in FFXIII. You now only control \"paradigms\" where you pre-select which abilities each character will use automatically within each of the paradigms (which, at least you can and will change throughout battles). So, you set up a paradigm say, one character medic, one commando (guns, sword, etc) one Ravager (magic) and another with two medics and a commando and another with two commando and a ravager, etc, etc. So you can switch your party tactics in battle to fight, fight and heal, just heal, magic fight, magic and heal and fight, etc. It's not exciting and it leads to a lot of mindless button tapping as you wait for the battle to end.Another big misstep was removing the real time/space battle system. Once again FF reverts back to the \"suck you into a battle screen\" so each area again has generic battle back-grounds so you could challenge on the screen five enemies before a waterfall but end up fighting three enemies before a rock-wall just to finish and be standing before the water-fall again! After each battle a character utters a generic \"yeah us\" or \"got em\" sort of line over and over and over and over again each battle, then you get an experience screen with 0 to 5 stars for your battle which supposedly affect what you pick up after a battle, but I've had a lot of five-star battles with no rewards and 2 and 3 star battles where I've picked stuff up.After the battle, of course you take experience and level up, right? Well, kind of. The \"chrysarium\" lets you level up each of your skills separately in a pretty 3D environment, but you very quickly fill all the spots and have to stop until you achieve some goal (boss battle) to earn more level-up spots. This stops your leveling dead and is very frustrating. Also, the 3D environment is not easy to navigate, but it doesn't matter as you'll just find yourself leveling everything up anyway since there's so many exp points you won't need to focus on any one talent.Since leveling is halted and there's no towns to buy from (stores are at save points and cost much and offer little) you can \"upgrade\" your weapon and accessories (no armor at all in this game just bracelets and weapons) by using \"stuff\" you've accumulated. The would be interesting if the \"stuff\" actually had specific properties, but alas, just different amounts of up-grade points. The key to this game to get stronger, get more stuff and upgrade.Those whom complained the game was too linear were, well, correct but not correct enough. The game is no more complex than Halo, in fact, it's the same basic idea as a corridor shooter, just run forward, kill enemies pick stuff up and sprint to the end while watching cut-scenes to tell the story. Halfway through the game I've still have done nothing but walk strait, the map is pointless since there's only ever one way to go. What's worse, you are split into several groups for half the game, so you are at least half done before you even get a full party.So, what's good in FFXIII? Well, the PS3 graphics are spectacular, the flesh still has a fake, waxy gleam but the settings are beautiful and there's no difference in cut-scenes and real-time graphics quality, frame rate is always steady. The sound, so-so, I don't feel a real 3D aural environment, the music should be turned off as it's loops, often has vocals and is generally boring or familiar but not in a positive way.The final word on FFXIII. Great graphics, fair sound, okay story, lousy fighting, crappy level-up system, completely linear and horribly repetitive. This is a sad, lonely entry that will not beg to be replayed nor will it drive you forward to finish it. Among other RPG's like Mass Effect 2 or Dragon Age it feels limiting and simplistic. This is like Final Fantasy for beginners, not the grand entry into hi-def gaming we hoped for.UPDATED 5/2/10Finally reached chapter 11 and the game \"opened up\" meaning there are 22 hunts you can go on. Grand Pulse is a shock to those who didn't buy a book to tell them how to upgrade weapons and accessories. I did buy the book because I kept dying and needed to read something on paper for tips on the battle system. While I learned it is in fact still button mashing the Synergist,Saboteur and Sentinel abilities to win battles, but it's just a matter of you die a few times, try a few different combos, and move on. Since you can't swap characters during battles you find no reason to swap them in and out, especially since everyone auto-recovers after every batter and everyone earns points if they fight or not.What's most frustrating is realizing that I have 30hrs play time and wasted a tone of money and resources poorly upgrading. If I had the guide-book from the start I'd have realized that you buy one things, use 36 of it to 3X your upgrade points, buy one of the best upgrade parts and then use them all at once with that 3X mulitplier, then you max out everything. Instead I squandered them trying to figure out how the system worked, now I've got nothing but low-lever accessories and only 2 maxed out weapons.Also, there's no way to tell the game to track a hunt rather than main quest, so I thought I was on the second hunt, but no, it had me on main quest and I had to turn around and walk for an hour.Finally, Grand Pulse is 10X harder than anything you've been through, dying will be a regular occurrence, every battle feels like a boss-fight and suddenly the Chrysarium requires 10X the points to advance.Now that I've gotten past the \"linear\" part I can honestly say, it doesn't improve.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"ceLeon","summary":"Beautiful piece of hardware and incredible power!","reviewText":"Hardware - 10/10 I won't bother you with all the technical specs and raw power that this machine has, you can go to other videogame sites for that. Out of the box you'll get everything you need to start playing (except the stand to set it vertically which is sold separately). You also get an HDMI cable which is pretty nice from Sony considering at this point all the ones I have are in use by some other console since my PS3 will still be used to finish all my pending games. The console gets a little loud when it first starts spinning up a disc, but it goes quiet again after a bit. Try to keep it in an open space with some room for circulating air. It doesn't get crazy hot but it won't hurt to do it. You get the power cable, the controller and a USB cable to charge it (BTW the controller can be charged while the PS4 is off). It's basically the same dimensions as the latest PS3 slim although this one looks way better next to your TV. No glossy finish, and the logos are barely noticeable. Hey, even the buttons to use it are very well hidden that it might take you some time to find them! It has 3 USB ports, that +1 from the PS3 makes a difference when you want to charge one controller, have a USB headset and an external drive.Controller -9/10 I have already reviewed this item but in short, WAY better than the DS3 controller, the dualsticks are at a better distance for my thumbs considering I have big hands and the touchpad is a really nice addition too and I can't wait to see what other games do with it. Although the triggers were vastly improved too I should emphasize on the sticks. Their form and their material makes it perfect for long playing sessions and your fingers won't slip as easily as with the DS3 ones. There's a small speaker in it but it's not really a big deal. Remember how the Wiimote also has a speaker? Yeah, me neither. There is a light bar in the back that can be used if you have the camera so it can detect where players are sitting and your movement, similar to what the PS Move controllers did. I'll update my review if I ever get a camera too.Software -8.5/10 I hope you're not one of the people having trouble connecting to the PSN and downloading the day 1 update they released (you can also go to sony's website to download the file and install it manually from a USB device) Powering up sometimes takes longer than I had hoped but once you're in, browsing is a breeze, especially in the psn store which makes it easier to find stuff than the previous version. Some users noticed that some of the media apps (for TV shows/movies) take a really long time to load. I'm not sure if that's Sony's fault or the third party that created the service. Hopefully they'll release an update for them soon. It's sad to see such a great piece of hardware and so powerful to still have to sit through very long loading times for thumbnails of TV shows.One of the big selling points of this console is the ability to Share what you're playing, just a tap of the 'Share' button in the DS4 and you can almost instantly start streaming what you're seeing, get your friends to watch you play and comment on it, you can also add voiceover and I believe video (if you have the camera)Games: Check out my reviews for Knack and Killzone to read my thoughts on those and as soon as I get NFS: Rivals I'll review that one too.I'll keep updating this review as soon as I have more comments about it.I'm also getting an X1 so I'm not a fanboy or anything for any company. I just play things and judge them for what they are. At this point there is nothing that would make me say to you \"Don't get this\". And $100 difference between this and the Xbox I have to admit it's a great advantage. We'll see how things turn out!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2013"}

The series gives us a technically new start to the Saints as now after a devious takeover by a mysterious criminal conglomerate known as the Syndicate the leaders of the Saints have been dumped into a new city where after doing some soul searching have decided to become the gang they were before fame and money softened them.  As the Saints start their hostile and bloody takeover of the new city they're living they must now overcome the other Syndicate lapdog gangs that also infest the city and have been given orders to destroy the Saints, but that's the way the Saints like it kicking A$$ and taking names.  What's also enjoyable about the game is like with the previous two you have character creation where you can design how your character looks/talks/walks/fights in the game as well as being able to upgrade your characters inventory or abilities.  The graphics are incredible as are the background scenery which is a real upgrade from the first and second game.  Again though like with the previous games this has really mature subject matter and for parents I'd advise checking the game info online to see if you feel it's to much for your kids, but still if your kids are fifteen or older then they probably seen worse on t.v. or at the movies or still the news.  So for a great and exciting game loaded with blood/action/gore and lots of attitude here's a very entertaining game to get for your gaming library....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2012"}

There are easy levels for children and more challenging levels for more experienced gamers. Being an adult and having actually finished the game, some might argue that it might not be challenging enough but all in all, there is a very wide spectrum of difficulty levels and challenges within the game such as collecting star coins, finding secret pathways, et cetera.There is HUGE replay value. This game can be literally played for hours. Graphics are outstanding and the new items can be a lot of fun (GIANT sized mushroom, mini mushroom, turtle shell, et cetera). Another challenge is figuring out what item is ideal for which level.Another nice part of this is that once cleared, a level can be played repeatedly. This is good for the little ones.Watch out though! You may be tempted to throw the game when you try a level for the upteenth time and get hit at the same spot! (definition of insanity - doing the same thing over and over the same way and expecting a different result!).Let's talk about the worlds a little bit:World 1 - Very easy, basic super Mario level that most players will recognize from past games. This level is good for the little ones. This world will get the player used to the Mario way of doing things.World 2 - Desert world. Obviously, a little more challenging. Some of the new skills required for the game such as wall jumping can come in handy, especially in the tower where one must wall jump repetatively in order to secure a star coin. Hint here: in order to open up world 4, one must defeat the castle enemy as \"mini mario\". Alternatively, opening up a \"warp cannon\" will also do it. This can be done in level 2A and is a bit tricky insofar as timing (bounce up on the turtle to gain access to yellow pipe - timing must be perfect!!).World 3 - Water world. About the same level of difficulty. Lots of carribean style entertaining music. Finding the secret exit in the ghost house will lead to a warp pipe (to world 6). Again, to do so, the player must be FAST with perfect timing (instead of leading through the traditional exit door after triggering \"p\" switch, go backwards and back down the stairs (without touching them) and go into the FIRST door instead of the second. The first door will disappear once the time runs out so the player MUST be FAST - may be a tad easier with a turtle shell).HINT: To this end, once the warp cannon in world 3 is open, a player can get a power-up item. Enter the warp pipe world but instead of climbing in the warp pipe, continue to the right and there will be a roulette type box where a player can acquire a power up. The player can go back and do this as many times as desired whenever desired. After the first time, the player can simply hit \"start\" and \"return to map\" if the desired power-up is not acquired.World 4 - A grassy world that can be challenging to the youger set although no doubt teens will have it down in nothing flat. Gaining secret exit in the ghost house (must bring a mini mushroom in order to accomplish this), warp pipe to level 7 will open.World 5 - Ice world. Probably this reviewer's least favorite because of the sliding. Again, finding secret exit in level 5 ghost house can get player to a warp pipe to level 8. The ice factor renders this level very challenging although again, teens will get the hang of it pretty quickly. Alternate way to get to world 7 is to defeat boss in level 5 castle as mini mario.World 6 - A little bit of everything in this level. These upper levels are more challenging and may take a little more time to the \"average\" person to defeat, especially if all the star coins are desired. Interestingly, no ghost house in level 6.World 7 - Again, gets a little difficult. There is a secret exit in the ghost house to open a alternative path - Timing and speed are key but not as critical in earlier level. Speed and timing of jumps are key to get the third star coin, however!World 8 - AKA \"nightmare world\"! Obviously, this world gets easier with practice but can be very difficult at first, especially for younger players. Obtaining all star coins in this level is the ultimate challenge! After defeating the first castle, when the player thinks it's all over - a new path is constructed and there is more yet to go. This is a nightime and \"spooky\" world and the spiders are VERY annoying.The minigames are a fine addition to an already outstanding game. Readers of my other reviews may recall that I enjoy the brain games. With that said, some of the minigames can possibly be classified as little brain sharpeners/teasers with memory games and reflex games.Overall, a terrific game with lots of replay value! I give it an A+ for fun!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2007"}

DiSpirito \"mentored1\"","summary":"Raging Blast to Play!","reviewText":"All right, so there are some important things to discuss.  Let's go.1. The graphics, animation, audio, performance, etc are all jaw-dropping.  Check some of the other reviews to read more about what people think.  I give it 5 stars.  It has to be seen to be believed, period.2. It's ID software, not Bethesda.  It's not a free-roaming open world, nor did ID say it was such.  It blends in quests and allows you to pick, so you can explore sections of the world in a directed manner.  It's a big change for ID and much better than the lead-you-by-the-nose of most FPS games.  It has some RPG elements, but it's not an RPG.  You can get upgrades for your gear and vehicles, some of which can alter the \"stats\" of your character or vehicle, but there is no progression, abilities, perks, or other special powers.  The ability to collect engineering schematics and construct everything from turrets to bandages to friggin' weapons is very cool.  Scavenging and buying raw materials is a lot of fun when you can actually use them.3. There are no checkpoints.  Don't cry, it's okay.  Do you know why?  Because you can save it whenever, wherever you want.  Thank the gods for that!  Checkpoints are silly.  Games that require you to reach a checkpoint to save are silly.  Save it whenever you want, it's easy.  Oh and it autosaves when you enter a new area, like a big enemy base or something.  Isn't that nifty?4. I hate vehicles and vehicle combat, but I'm not put off by these elements in Rage.  The vehicles are easy to control and the vehicle combat is break-neck fast with plenty of visceral action--and you get money for blowing up enemies.  That helps, a lot.  There are a good amount of upgrades and vehicle types, so it keeps this element fresh.5. The comparisons to Fallout & Borderlands are understandable but silly.  ID was working on this before those two games were released.  Anyway, it's a totally different game in a similar setting.  We wouldn't say that Need for Speed and Gran Turismo were the same game, would we?  I would hope not.  Rage is a balls-to-the-wall action shooter with a breath of player choice thrown in the mix.  The action is center-stage; all the other neat elements augment the action.6. The controls are tight, simple, and perfectly suited to the game.  You can assign items to the d-pad, activate them with the LB, and change as needed; weapons are assigned to 4 slots as well, which can be toggled quickly by tapping RB or you can bring up a selection menu with weapons and ammo types by holding RB.  It's so simply a monkey could do it (like me, for example).7. If you want rinse-repeat military action, you know where to go; if you want free-roaming RPG, you know what to buy (read: Skyrim, 11/11); if you want some pulse-pounding action in an eye-popping world full of character and things to do, grab RAGE.--END TRANSMISSION--","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002673XJA","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Fails Gene Roddenbarrys vision","reviewText":"Like many, I've really been looking forward to an MMO that breaks both the typical 'fantasy' genre or better yet linear progression structure of many MMO's out there, and while there was much hype to this game and it does have it's shining moments, at this early stage I feel it will be forgettable in a matter of time.One of the main problems STO faces is the challenge that lives up to the hype and IP franchise of promising to be 'The' Star Trek game.  Gene had a vision of creative solutions and thinking outside the box while introducing people to cooperative factions and exploration.  Well, unfortunately at this point the game thus far is reduced to one core component: combat.  While one may argue that all games must have a combat element (and I agree), in this new ST outing, Gene would be very disappointed to learn that the Federation is asked to shoot first, ask questions later.As other reviews have stated, the majority (note: not all) of missions are go to X and kill Y.  Or collect Z and report.  Perhaps it is too much these days for developers to flex a bit more creative muscle and come up with more than the traditional and tired mission types that are no different from all the MMO's before it.  I for one was really hoping to do more 'diplomacy', 'exploration', and 'scientific'-like missions, but in the end, there jsut isn't that feeling.Being that it is Cryptic and NCSoft, and having played CoH/CoV for 5 years myself, I still can't help but feel that this is a slightly more enhanced version and re-skinned version of those games.  Right down to the font type, crafting and auction elements, these are VERY similar to CoH/CoV.  Although I will give NCSoft/Cryptic credit...they do support CoH/CoV with numerous expansions so one can assume that they will also support STO for years to come.Not to sound totally negative, there are some bright spots: 1) Character creation is very deep and I haven't seen any other game close to the amount of detail one can let loose not only on their main toon, but their supporting toons as well.  2) Ship battles are fun and add a nice touch of strategy to them while keeping an eye on various weapons, shields, and ship systems.  3) Space graphics are more advanced than previous Cryptic/NC games which is nice, but still a bit behind others.  4) Sound effects are dead on.  5) There appears to be a lot of unique modifications one can make to your ship over time not just in look but buffs and devices as well.  5) Open instances can be fun if you get the right mix of players all vying for the same goal.Now a few tarnishes:  1) It just doesn't live up to the 'feel' of Star Trek which may detract from my pre-release expectations.  2) Ground/Away-team combat and missions needs work.  Animations and collision detection seem 'off', and already so early in the game I notice all these 'strange' new worlds and civilization are already repeating tile sets...(here's hoping that the devs will flesh this out later).  Same goes for the missions.  After you do a few of them (they are fun the first time around), they all seem to repeat their objectives yet again.  3) Chat channels are abysmal....here's to hoping they may support 'Vent' or other 'audio' based ones in the future.  Dare I say \"Barren's Chat\" (all you WoW players will know) can be easier to follow at times.  4) Some ship elements like 'scan' are very shallow and are one trick ponies at this point.  There is a lot of rinse and repeat type missions and exploration is questionable.Reading all this is not to say this is a bad game.  I played the Beta and now the final, and I suspect there is much more content to come.  Perhaps wait a few months before you pick this up to see what the dev's have in the pipeline.  If you never played CoH/CoV or Champions Online, you'll probably get much more kick out of this than I am so far, but if you have, then you'll quickly note the same formula/feel and think you've played this before, it just has a Star Trek 'overlay' to it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Underwhelming sequel to Halo : CE","reviewText":"Rather than go through the ins-and-outs of what Halo 2 is, how good the graphics are, or how things have been improved, I thought I'd simply describe why I was vastly disappointed by this sequel.Firstly, Microsoft and Bungie really built up the Earth aspect of the game - and as many others have stated the game isn't set on earth at all. You start off there but are soon whisked away to bog-standard linear alien levels.Secondly, a large portion of the game is played through the eyes of the Arbitor not the Master Chief. Whilst I enjoyed the Arbitor's cloaking capabilities, it was preturbing to not play as 'the main man' and other than for storyline purposes there really wasn't any point in not having the Master Chief as the person you 'are'.Moving onto the vehicles - man what happened? The Wathog's handling had been completely reworked and not for the better - I doubt we'll be seeing 'Warthog Jump' user videos using Halo 2's engine. The tank is a washed out smaller version of the one in Halo 1, and the Banshee's controls stink.Weapons had also been given the 'let's break it' once-over. The needler is puny as is the main SMG. Dual wielding doesn't add anything at all to the fun factor, and I played the game entirely through the first time without doing it. It's only when you play on Heroic or Legendary do you have to dual wield and that's primarily to retain double the ammo you can carry. Weapons disappear much faster than before too. So in areas where lots of bad guys spawn you find your cache of weaponry behind you dwindling as you shoot guys in front. Frustrating.I could also go on about how little changes, subtle touches felt rushed - the needler reloading had less frames of animation than the first, and you can no longer shoot weapons on the ground and make them spin around. It's little inexplicable things like that which I didn't understand... why break the physics? Why change the weapon animation?But overall my biggest gripe with Halo 2 was the atmosphere - it simply does not have the feeling, the heart, of the first. It feels on the rails and playing it often was a chore.Sparkly graphics and a couple of new weapons simply does not cover the shallow, erred experience that is Halo 2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2005"}

Let me elaborate.The first installment in this series was about 10 hours of pure adrenaline packed fun.  Sure, ten hours isn't a lot of time to complete a game, but in those 10 hours, there was almost zero downtime whatsoever.  The second installment took at least an hour just to get into, which was kind of a disappointment.  I thought that the controls were intuitive enough so that such tedium wasn't necessary.  But then even once I got into the game, I quickly realized that the objectives were just not as fun.  The first game involved infiltrating crime lords havens to eliminate them.  The objectives were clear, and I knew exactly what I had to do from the start.  In this installment, the objectives are much more abstract.  I honestly don't know what it is that I'm trying to accomplish when I go activate the laser beams and then take out dozens of zombie-like creatures.  It just doesn't make sense.But this game makes up for the lack of adrenaline catalyzing action with clearly outlined objectives by the fact that there is simply a lot more to do.  And the game is much better organized as well.  Most of the objectives are outlined and located in the game's main map screen.  Plus, as skills increase, I get to see more than just improved driving or aiming.  I actually get new abilities while new equipment is made available.So after putting in quite a few hours, I've realized that even though this installment doesn't have the same strengths that made me like the original so much, it has a few of its own strengths that stand out on their own.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2012"}

And hey, to be honest, Sam Fisher can even give old Snake a run for his money, both as a character and in terms of the title's gameplay, and that's not easy to do.First off, Splinter Cell takes place in the Tom Clancy near future (much nearer now than it was when the game was released) of the fall of 2004. The Georgian president, after reaching power through a bloodless coup, was being investigated by the US. Trouble is, the agent, or agents, doing the snooping have gone missing. Now, as a member of Third Echelon, Sam Fisher must find them, and what they discovered that got them in trouble. And, as is the case with Tom Clancy's universes, there's a whole lot more going on than meets the eye. As Sam, you have to find out what. Sam's getting gray around the temples, but he's more than capable of holding his own, and getting Michael Ironsides for his voice was inspired.The name of the game here is stealth. And this game won't hold your hand as much as Metal Gear Solid, making it that much more challenging. I could go on and on about the fabulous graphics; the lighting, the animation, the butter-smooth control, and the extraordinary AI. However, I won't. They are all top notch, the AI especially. Sound and sight are what alerts them to your presence, which means light and noise are your enemies. You have to creep around slowly and softly, stick to the shadows, or create your own. Take enemies out one at a time, or pass them by in the darkness like a ghost.That's really the best thing about this game: total and complete immersion. The world, lives, breathes, and thinks, and you have to stay one step ahead of it. Splinter Cell encourages you, FORCES you, to think like a highly trained covert operative. You must become Sam Fisher, because if you don't, you'll die, a lot. Actually, you'll probably die a lot anyway, but in this game, that's not a problem. In some parts, this thing is unrelenting. Tom Clancy's one-hit-one-kill rules apply here, for both you AND your enemies. However, patience will keep you alive, along with caution, and, most importantly, you have to think like a spy.And that is what makes this game so great. Sure, there are a couple isolated times when you think that enemies should see you and they don't. Sure there are some times when a little more help from your espionage cohorts would be nice. However, this game is rooted in realism, and it'll stay with you. For example, you know you've been playing the game too much when you walk into your bedroom when the light is off and immediately notice which corner would be best to hide in. Seriously, this game makes you think like a spy that much, and, if you have the patience and skill, it is extrememly freakin' fun.There's not really much of a downside to this game. Unfortunately, don't expect the amount of action found in titles like Halo, or even Metal Gear Solid. This is about patience, information gathering, and doing it all without leaving a trace. However, if you dig this sort of game, you are doing yourself a disservice by not getting it and enjoying it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2004"}

My other complaint is that the controller buttons are overloaded, meaning that a lot of the button combinations have multiple uses, as a result you can easily find yourself somersaulting backwards off of a building that you were trying to climb, the open combat is pretty randomly bad to the point where i think Ubi could have substituted minigames for fights and it would have been an improvement.

It is a huge open world, with life breathed into it in great detail. While it has a core storyline of epic proportions, like its predecessors it is an open world you are encouraged to explore at your leisure.The beauty of Skyrim is that technology has finally reached the point where almost anything the creators of the Elder Scrolls series can imagine, can be done. For Skyrim, this means creatures of all different shapes and sizes, including dragons: enormous, flying dragons complete with fire-breathing & fangs. The world feels alive because there are animals wandering through forests, fish in streams, and sunlight and seasons, but it's the dragons who really steal the show. When you see a shadow pass over you, hear a sailcloth-like whoosh of air, then then that tremendous roar, you truly feel immersed in a fantasy world.Another enjoyable element is the way the environment is 'generated':  in many places, people and monsters appear at random, and how they behave can be very different.  For example, I've seen Giants pause in their patrol, stare at me thoughtfully, and then move on...but I've also seen a werewolf wander into a Giant camp and get completely walloped--when suddenly along comes a dragon, and I'm in the middle of a chaotic fray.Your character can be any race, gender, or type. How you play it is entirely up to you, but at the heart of Skyrim's story is that you are 'Dragonborn', a person capable of absorbing a dragon's soul and using it to unlock magical spells (called \"Shouts\") that the Dragons have used for centuries. These spells take the form of 'Words of Power' that you can find and read from walls scribed in Dragon-speak, and the finding of these is what gives you a variety of Shouts to choose from. The central storyline will guide you on your journey to become the hero the world needs, but in the meantime, there's no hurry: explore, take quests, talk to people, and try things, and you will be rewarded.As you 'level up' you don't have to deal with individual skills:  you are offered the choice to increase either Magic, Strength, or Stamina.  This may disappoint some long-time RPG players who love directly tweaking their stats, but I found I enjoyed this differences in gameplay just the same as if I'd taken the time to raise this or that stat in another title.  There is also a skill tree, called \"Perks\" as it was in prior games (and in the Fallout series)--and Perks are where you round out your character:  they are divided into many different groups, from weapons or magic types to speech and blacksmithing.Everyone familiar with Role-Playing Games has their own likes and dislikes, and Skyrim tries to cater to all of them. If you like being able to find rare and unusual weapons or armor, go digging in Dwarven ruins, find a treasure map, or talk to an adventurer who can't quite get that artifact they've been chasing after. If you'd rather make your own weapons and armor, you can do that, too. Alchemy lets you collect items from within the world and use them to mix potions. Enchantment lets you imbue magic into your equipment. You can even mix ingredients on a stove and cook! But none of it is necessary: it's all just added flavor to the environment.How you interact with others is another great feature of Skyrim: you will meet people who ask you to do or help them with tasks, and not all of them are heroic. In fact, the actions you take in some small village can shift the balance of power and cause things to be different the next time you return. You can choose to be a hero or you can keep people living in fear. If you know where to look, your character can become a werewolf or even a vampire, which opens up a whole new set of ideas. Actions have consequences, and there may be times you made someone angry and the next thing you know, you run across soldiers or assassins with your name on their to-do list. You can win people's respect by brawling with them, or telling them what they want to hear...or you can intimidate them into going along with your plans.As you play Skyrim, you have the opportunity to earn helpers: people sworn to carry your burdens, follow you anywhere, and protect you with their lives. You can also hire mercenaries, and from time to time you'll run across people who will accompany you to a goal. Typically it'll just be you, or you and a loyal helper.That said, things are not perfect with Skyrim. I've yet to encounter a serious bug, but a friend of mine has had a horrible time with multiple issues. The UI is designed a little awkwardly: in their efforts to let you view every object in your inventory (and even rotate it with the mouse), the developers have given you a series of scrolling, layered menus that sometimes choose the wrong option, or close when you don't click exactly on the text you want to select. Your helpers can get weird: my 'housecarl' Lydia has gone berserk on occasion, killing a harmless dog or rampaging up the mountainside slaughtering goats. And then there's the fact that these characters who interact with each other sometimes don't get the idea of 'personal space': you could be talking to someone tearfully recounting the story of how their daughter was torn apart by a werewolf when the tavern owner steps toe-to-toe with you and starts telling you they have great food here, and warm beds. If you can live with these oddities, then Skyrim is a very playable, very enjoyable game.I purchased the collector's edition of Skyrim. It contains a massive and detailed statue of the dragon god Alduin, perched atop a wall scribed in dragon-speak with words of power and I love the look of it. There is a thick, leather-bound art book, a DVD on the making of the game that fascinated me (such as how they programmed a dragon's movements, how they came up with a written and spoken language for dragons, and much more), and of course the game. My PC has some really nice hardware, so I'm able to run at full settings, and there is also a detailed texture pack downloadable from Steam that will enhance the look even further.That said, let me take a moment to point out that you have to activate this product through Steam:  once you buy it and enter the code, Skyrim is yours to keep and cannot be resold.  Thankfully although some Steam games have tighter rules than others, the Steam footprint for Skyrim can be minimal if you want it to be. On my desktop, I told Steam to keep the game updated, sync my screenshots with 'the Cloud', and keep me online while I play. On my laptop, I created a different character. I used Steam only to unlock the game, told Steam not to sync, to work offline, and I can play all I want without my Desktop save games getting overwritten. I've played in places where there is no network connection and haven't had a problem.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2012"}

From a sweeping storyline spanning numerous continents and fully encompassing not only the present but the past as well to an engrossing and deep job system that requires countless battles of leveling, Dragon Warrior 7 delivers an epic experience.This game even seems epic compared to old-time graphics, since it's an old-time game, looking like an SNES game on polygonal steroids.  Yeah, they're horrible when compared to today's biggest graphical contenders, but gameplay was always the draw of the old-timers, right?  Right, and what gameplay it is.Dragon Warrior has hardly strayed from its singular roots, 7 itself flaunting the same battle system, complete with similar sound effects, as all of the previous.  This includes a first-person perspective, numerous skills with fairly flashy effects, and little monster motion.  It this 7 remedied the stale, boasting fully fluid monster animations and quick graphically unique battle effects, both which add to the appeal and speed of battle.  Granted, the frequency and sheer volume of battles in a 100+(!) hour game can get tedious, but the compellingly written story will grasp the tenacious to the end.Overall, Dragon Warrior 7 is an uninspired graphical flop complete with a riveting story complemented by intelligent writing that adds to the battling, class-leveling experience.  If you're looking for a game that is a pure rush of 100 hour days-gone-by nostalgia, Dragon Warrior 7 should occupy the top of your list.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2002"}

At first it was fun to play as several of the Simpsons characters but when they started repeating their dialogue for the 50th time it became mighty tedious and tiresome.The gameplay is very simple. If GTA: Vice City is the Lego Technic of road rage games then Simpsons: Road Rage is, without a doubt the Lego Duplo. It is SOOO aimed at kids. No one over the age of 13 will be particularly impressed with this. It's just far to `safe'. The Simpsons TV show is full of satirical humor and intelligence but this game is just a cheap spin-off aimed at a much younger audience.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2003"}

The developers got everything right. It not only lived up to the hype but surpassed it IMHO. I am a huge fan of Arkham Asylum so I couldn't wait for Arkham City. I'm rarely that excited over a game that I would preorder it but I did with this one. I recently finished the main story and was only 46% done with the game which gives you an idea of the scope and magnitude of the overall game. I chose not to do all the side missions parallel to the main story to maintain some type of focus because you can get distracted with everything thing else going on. I had read on another review to wait to take on the Zsasz challenge and that was a good peace of advice. It requires you to fly good distances quite a bit and you might be right on the verge of going into something else at the time. Anyway I am now enjoying just prowling around Arkham City at will kicking badguy a%@ and finishing the challenges at my leisure. Will try New Game+ next and update.Pros:Story is top notch and can stand on its own in movie form.Graphics are ridiculous.Huge open world environment, lots of nooks and crannies.Combat is fluid and challenging if you want to gain XP and string devastating combos.Gliding around Arkham City is thrilling and fun.Gadgets are awesome.The predator stealth missions are intense.There are villains galore and they are done right!The Catwoman side story and gameplay are a solid addition.Riddler Challenges are pretty challenging and rewarding.Challenge maps are fun and let you hone your combat and predator skills.Lots and lots to do.Cons:Has to end some time.Bottom line:Buy this game now! Worth every cent. Kudos to Rocksteady and everyone involved in this masterpiece.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2011"}

Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City.

I was not going to do the hundreds of attempts needed to defeat him.  I just quit early which was sad but necessary.  Also there were way too many ride the power line to find the transmitter missions (about 15).  These type of missions are tedious because you must rigidly follow one path exactly the way the programmer wants you to.  Also the boss girl wrestling thing was bad because you can not figure out which way to mash the joy stick when trying to grab the object from her. Here is a tip for the programmers on that:  3 dimensions don't work that well in a 2 dimensional world.  Also some aliens are way to impervious to bombs landing right next to them but only some times.  This happens for the same aliens.  They will not even budge sometimes.  Kind of seems like you have to have your body facing them when the explosion occurs so you can't multitask.But the rest of the game was a blast hence the 4 points.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2011"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E1JS","description":"","reviewerName":"Siklootd","summary":"A Klassic Return to Form for Mortal Kombat","reviewText":"Mortal Kombat is a gaming franchise that has seen its fair share of ups and downs.  What began as an immensely popular arcade fighter back in the early 90s, has slowly devolved into a mediocre fighting game that always felt \"rushed\" and never felt complete.  The developers had toyed with various ideas throughout the years starting with Mortal Kombat 4.  With their first step into the 3D world, Midway made Mortal Kombat 4 a game with 3D graphics that fought within a two dimensional playing field.  However, the combat system was generic, utilizing a system in which all the characters played exactly the same and even had the same combos.  This took the feel of \"genuineness\" out of each fighter, and the introduction of weapons in Mortal Kombat 4 also felt tacked on.Onto Deadly Alliance, where the developers made every character unique once again, and this time expanded upon the weapons system added in the previous title.  However, due to the lack of characters, and the one fatality format of the game, it never felt the same as previous entries in the franchise such as Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, Mortal Kombat Trilogy, or Mortal Kombat 2.  Midway mixed up the formula again in Deception, bringing back many classic fighters, adding in some more, and creating new game modes such as Chess Kombat, Puzzle Kombat, and Konquest Mode.  However, Konquest Mode was a poorly developed story mode that felt tacked on, and never allowed the user to truly feel like they accomplished anything by beating it despite its immensely long duration of playtime.  With Mortal Kombat Armageddon, the developers thought that by returning every character from all previous entries would add enough flare to help revitalize the franchise.  However, Armageddon was lacking in variety (with several challenge ladders constantly repeating themselves, level design lacking, and AI extremely dumbed down).  The air combat was a nice touch but didn't add enough \"oomph\" to get the series back on track.The only Mortal Kombat game to be released this generation did not feel like a true entry into the franchise due to the lack of true violence in which the series is known for.  So, Ed Boon decided that a return to a more \"klassic\" approach may be exactly what is needed to return the gaming franchise back to its glory days.  That's where \"Mortal Kombat\" (9 or 2011 whatever you want to call it) came into play.  Seeing a return to two dimensional fighting is a major plus, adding to the challenge and the ability to perform more complex combos similar to those seen within Capcom fighting games.The game does more than simply return to the 2D realm of fighting, it brings back classic elements of previous titles that long time fans of the series are sure to appreciate.  With the move into 3D, the developers had dropped many aspects of the series in the process.  The most notable changes were to characters' move sets.  On games such as Deadly Alliance and Deception, classic character moves such as Cyrax's net, Sektor's homing missiles, Scorpion's scissor kick, and most notably Shang Tsung's morphing ability.  With \"Mortal Kombat (9, 2011)\", Ed Boon resurrected all of these old moves.  Classic moves such as Johnny Cage's crouch punch have returned, alongside other notable classics such as Reptile's energy balls, Jax's \"gotcha grab\", Noob Saibot's cloud attack, etc.  All of these moves were abandoned after Mortal Kombat trilogy, and it's great to see a return of such notable attacks that had defined these characters during their early years.Besides a return of classic moves, this latest entry also sees a return of classic modes such as \"Test Your Might\".  The game also features the return of many classic elements such as Dan Forden and his trademark \"Toasty\" appearing on the bottom of the screen.  Stage fatalities for classic levels have reappeared with levels like the Deadpool and the Pit making a return.  Re-imagining of character designs are also present with each fighter resembling their 2D counterpart in a more updated and modern manner.  The return of Babalities brings back that classic MK humor that helps take a break from the excessive amount of killing.The story mode is extremely well developed and covers the events immediately following MK Armageddon.  With Shao Kahn winning and defeating every opponent in the process, Raiden is forced to use a method of time travel to warn his past iteration about the dire future that awaits unless he can change it.  Raiden tries to change the future as much as possible, and in the process, new characters are born.  Gamers will see the rise of new faces such as Smoke remaining human and Sub-Zero getting automated in his place.  It's a very interesting plot that the developers went with, and the story mode feels well fleshed out, rather than rushed like in previous entries.The PS3 version sees the added benefit of playing as Kratos, lead character from Sony's hit franchise \"God of War\".  Kratos is a great addition to the game, and he kind of fits right in.  His games have always been over-the-top with violence, similar to Mortal Kombat, and his moves and fatalities not only fit his character, but fall right into place in the Mortal Kombat puzzle.Overall, this is a game that all long time fans of the series have been looking forward to, and NetherRealm Studios delivered on bringing back fanfare to the series.  The game feels like it was tailored to the fans with so many classic elements making a reappearance.  All the little touches will not go unnoticed by devoted fans, and this game may be exactly what the series needed to reestablish itself as a true contender within the fighting game genre.  An instant \"Klassic\".","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2011"}

If you want to play ranked warzone well your out of luck here.Epic really dropped the ball here.Plus you can no longer just drop in unranked matches. The game from this perspective just go and play has been ruined I must say. The lag has you glitching all over the board  and you just want to drop out but even this you cant do ,you must shut down your xbox.Than go wait ten minuites to get into a game you have no idea what type or area it will be in.GOW1 was great ,Epic could have just revamped and upgraded the maps ( as they did and they look really great I have to say) fine tuned the players(as they did again) added some great weapons( as they did to some extent,the balance here is a bot off) and the game would have been awesome. The shotgun makes an odd pop  noise here ,unlike gears 1 where it was authentic.Plus you cant shoot and run ,very little shotgun battles now.Some like that but really if you take out all the parts that made GO1 great than you are changing a great game not making it better.The chainsaw duels if the other failings of this game werent so great too would in itself almost ruin game.Gone are Gears 1 sneak ups with the shotgun and now its a free for all of shotgun attacks .Very lame and boring and takes the skill factor to about \"0\". And the duel chainsaw attacks pressing b like crazy is a joke too.Like playing ateroids from the 80,s.Just smash the buttons.No skill no fun just crazy.All in all the game has taken all that was good about gears 1 out of the game,made it absolutely stunning to look at, added lag that is so frequent you drop out of games on rountine just due to that,has a horrible menu that you cant just jump in any more and play and you have no clue what you will be playing.Taking the shotgun and chainsaw elements out of the gears type gameplay is a real shame too as now its like your not even playing gears of war but a whole new game.If they wanted to make a whole new game than they should have by why did they ruin this one? The horde mode is fun but again severe lag,horrible menu and lobby system too.If Epic doesnt at least fix the lag and flickering issues this game will never be played like the last one. I guess people will get used to the altered weapons but the lobby system I doubt it thats a  disaster.Just go play and you here ten people complaining about framerate,lag,weapons and the horrible lobby system.Their were never complaints about this while playing Gears 1, but now their is1 Says alot when you get ten people in room all complaing ,dropping out due to lag tooI give the game a \"C\" in its persent form ,if lag is fixed and lobby system where you can pick a game and get in it relatively quick like gears 1 than I would upgrade to a \"B\".The other issues are just too much to overcome to give it a better score.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2008"}

To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file.

{"product_name":"B003VWGBC0","reviewerName":"JoshJosh","summary":"I've played all the shooters, this is my favorite","reviewText":"I remember vividly the day the Quake 1 demo was released, and I spent an hour downloading that 10 meg piece of awesome to my 166mhz PC with 16 megs of RAM. That was 14 years ago and I've been playing first person shooters ever since. I've played every major one, including every one on 360 and PS3. And Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is my favorite.Why is this? First of all, I loved Battlefield 2 on the PC. I loved it because it was intense, and dynamic, and with a great balance between individualism and squad teamwork. Good players could dominate bad players but good squads dominated bad squads.Bad Company 2, despite its smaller scale (24 players versus 64), captures this dynamic. The vehicles are very powerful but each player and squad has tools to defeat them. The addition of vehicles forces the levels to be big, but the designers mix them up with a variety of large open areas and close quarter fighting. The close quarter fighting is similar to Call of Duty, fast paced and intense, but in only a few steps the game opens up to be a longer range, vehicle based game. The variety here is excellent and keeps the game fresh. It also encourages the use of all the different classes.The game's great squad system allows one to respawn next to a squadmate, which keeps front lines intense. This is the most teamwork intensive FPS I have played lately, aside from MAG (PS3 exclusive), but the game uses a slightly different respawn mechanic, and the core shooting is not as good as Bad Company 2's.And of course, I have to mention the destruction. It is better than the first game and most definitely not a gimmick. The entire battle becomes even more fluid and dynamic. Paths open up and cover disappears. It's amazing technology and DICE should be commended for getting it to work so well.That's all the multiplayer - and indeed that is why you should buy this. The singleplayer is not bad but hardly something worth playing more than once. It's not as good as Bad Company 1's, but then again, BC1's multiplayer was not even close to BC2's. It's a worthwhile trade-off.Bad Company 2, like all MP games now, has a full complement of unlocks, leveling, etc. The most annoying thing is that you need to level up a bit before you unlock the core elements of classes - for example, medics don't just start with health kits right away. Fortunately, it doesn't take too long to get it.Graphics have some problems - scenery is often plain, shadows and edge elements (tree branches, etc.) have this weird \"screen door\" look, and tearing is noticeable. I would put it below Call of Duty, Reach, and MAG, but you do get very large maps, destructible buildings, and drivable vehicles.Bad Company 2's sound, though, is phenomenal, keeping with other games in the series. Everything is punchy and solid, and it makes things very immersive, especially with 5.1 sound.In the end, like I said, BC2 is a great game that anyone who likes FPS games should try out. I was a bit disappointed when I looked at a recent Xbox Live activity list and saw this around #14, below the past 3 Modern Warfares, the past 3 Halos, and even Gears of War 2 (!?). This is a better MP shooter than all of them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2011"}

Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience.

As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly.

After spending almost three hours playing, I gotta say that I'm very impressed.First off, the graphics are stunning to say the least.  Right in the beginning, our eyes are treated to a visual feast of 3D-rendered imagery in the form of an intro video.  The graphics here rival that of Super Mario Galaxy.And then, we have our Werehog levels.  After Dr. Eggman ambushes Sonic and drains life from the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic is mysteriously transformed into a Werewolf-like Hedgehog form, a.k.a. Werehog.  These levels have been universally panned for their lanky controls and annoying music.  I assure you, only the ladder is true.  The controls here are far better executed than that of the Xbox and PS3 counterparts.  With a bit of patience, you'll be able to zip right through them.Matter of fact, the PS3 demo for this game made me want to buy the Wii version.  So far, I'm far more impressed with this version of the game.PROS:-Excellent motion-based controls.-Also can be played using Classic/GameCube controller.-Some of the best graphics available for the console.CONS:-Werehog levels take a bit of patience to master.-The combat music in said levels gets annoying, as it never changes.OVERALL:  Aside from the Werehog and the tediousness of controlling him, I have no real reason to put down this game.  Immensely enjoyable and wondrous to behold.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0009UBR3A","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"GREAT FUN...but not that original","reviewText":"The new Zelda game is the last one for the Gamecube. Lucky for me, as I didn't have to buy a Wii to play it and there does not appear to be much visual difference between the two versions. Whichever version you play, it's another outing for Link as the Kingdom of Hyrule is yet again under threat from an evil tyrant. Now, Twilight Princess could well be the best one since Ocarina of Time but it is very fortunate that the Zelda series is held in such high regard among gaming fans, because how many other games could get away with simply re-making the classic format in each new edition, albeit in a shiny new adventure? So if you have played Ocarina or time or Wind Waker or any of the older games, you'll know the story before it even begins. If you don't, the plot is as follows: A young farmer (called Link we presume, or whatever you name him) leaves his village on an errand, only to find that shadowy monsters are turning the land of Hyrule into a place of darkness. The creatures kidnap some of the village children, and when Link bravely follows them he meets up with a small fairy like creature called Midna who convinces him to join forces with her in tracking down some sacred artefacts that will help rid Hyrule of the evil invaders.Now this is all lots of fun, but I really think the series could have done better than simply repeating all of the previous games' ingredients. For example, you once again start out with no money, a health meter of 3 hearts and no decent equipment, but these can all be expanded as time goes on. On your travels you will again encounter the aquatic Hylians and their underwater temple (which starts off frozen), the rock shaped Gorons and their temple on lava-filled Death Mountain, and the man-eating plants and spiders of the Sacred Forest temple. You'll again find a new accessory in each dungeon, from the boomerang, to the bow and arrow, to bombs, then to the hookshot, and so on...and each time you will need to employ the latest one to kill the temple boss. In any lesser game series, this would be unforgiveable repetition, but despite the fact that I have pointed this out, I cannot deny the simple fact that in Zelda games it's all just too good to complain about. And this game is no exception. Use of all the tools and interacting with the environment is as much fun as ever, so the game designers seem to have got away with it once again!The meat of the gameplay is found in the temples, and one more thing that the series gets absolutely right is in the design of it's dungeon layouts. Now in this respect, every game IS different and Twilight Princess is a good example. The dungeons are great - full of clever designs and challenging puzzles. And most of the challenge comes not in skillful fighting or jumping, but in solving the mystery of how you actually get from one room to the next. You really have to look around and think up ways of getting the various doors to open, or cross chasms or reach very high up switches. The game never tells you what to do, and this has always been the great strength of the series. And of course the temples are full of monsters, most of which are classic Zelda foes. I smiled with recognition when I saw Skulltulas (spiders), Deku Babas (plants) and Keese (bats) coming at me, but then again, because of this I was already familiar with their weaknesses and had little trouble in dealing with them. The same goes for the bosses. If you've played any previous game, you'll know just what weakness to expect, when to defend and when to strike. The boss fights are actually much easier in this game than they were in Ocarina of Time, so if you got through that you can sail through this one.But there has been some amount of innovation. As similar as this game is to it's ancestors, it does have new ideas. Early on in the game Link finds himself transformed into a wolf (it's the only form he can take anytime he is in a part of Hyrule that is enveloped in the Twilight), and several areas of the game are played in this guise. I have to say I didn't really enjoy this aspect, and the first time I had to go though an area as Wolf Link I didn't enjoy it very much. His moves are very limited and fighting is a real chore. I am glad this new concept is here but I think the game designers made a mistake in deciding on the first challenging area to explore would be in wolf form as it not the strongest aspect to the game. There are also accessories/weapons that have never appeared before, and these were very welcome - these new items make the boss battles you use them in some of the best moments of the game (like the Desert Fortress boss fight - wow!) And of course the new graphics are fantastic. The world you live in is huge, with many places to visit and explore. Characters look amusing and well designed, and Link himself has a very appealing face, and quite a graceful appearance, although in his village outfit (before he gets the classic green hero uniform) he looks quite awful and I was relieved that he soon changed out of that daft get-up.What I must say though, is that the game gets better and better the further into it you get. Later dungeons call upon use of every item you have so far accumulated, and you'll also need to be using both wolf form and human forms alternately to access some areas much later on, and often multiple times in the same rooms. So don't be surprised if that boomerang that you stopped using once you had all the better weapons still gets called into action again when you had all but forgotten it. But it's all par for the course, because another thing among the Zelda games' greatest strengths is the necessity to never forget what you have LEARNED, no matter how far back in the game it may have been, because be assured that by the end of the story you'll be using every single skill you have to get through the increasingly complex puzzles.I started off this review with my negative thoughts about the repetition of the same ideas in every Zelda game, but in truth I could write paragraph after paragraph about how many aspects of Twilight Princess are pure excellence. It's probably because the basic concept of the Zelda games is just so foolproof. I would imagine that for anyone completely new to the brand that this game could prove to be mind blowing. It's also really lo-o-ong! You'll be able to spend hours and hours on this if you want to. All the mini games, pieces of heart searches and shopping upgrades are still here. And for any existing fans it's a fantastic new environment to play in.  I suppose the main drawback for longterm fans is that we are going to know what to do in advance a lot of the time, but the game designers still managed to make me work hard, so I am sure loads of other fans out there won't be disappointed. Even if it's not a revolution in the same way that Ocarina of Time was, it's a quality product in every sense of the word.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2007"}
{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"IdrilCelebrindal","summary":"Bioware at its best","reviewText":"I was a big fan of the Baldur's Gate games, and when Bioware touted this as the spiritual successor to BG, there was little doubt that I would want to own it.  My experience with CRPGs is admittedly limited - primarily to BG, Neverwinter Nights, Fable, and Morrowind.  But that being said, I would readily state that this is easily one of the greatest I've ever played - if not one of the greatest RPGs ever.I'm less than a fifth of the way through the game, and I've clocked in a solid 24 hours of gameplay; at this rate, I'm certain it will take me a full 200 hours to complete just the first time through.  That's partly due to the fact that I keep getting distracted from the main plot by the dozens upon dozens of sidequests.  And that's not even yet taking into account the significant character stories that will play out depending on who's in my party; or the fact that this is just one of the six origin stories - and when I play again, I can have, in many ways, a brand new experience when I try one of the others.  I've also sat down to play it at least a dozen times, promising myself I would go no more than half an hour, and then wind up playing it three hours or more; this game is like crack - I tell myself I can stop at any time, over and over and over.Combat is at the heart of what I love about this game; I find it to be immensely satisfying.  Bioware RPGs are the only ones I've ever encountered where combat is both real-time and party-based.  They thankfully switched to a mana-based magic system, and added in a similar stamina-based system for warriors and rogues; so while mages get to learn and activate cool spells - of a wide varying, and in increasing levels - warriors and rogues learn special tricks of their own in battle - taking it beyond simply swinging swords at one another.  You can pre-set things by the tactics system, with individual commands for each character depending on each step within a battle.  Personally, I like turning the tactics off, and taking full control of each of my characters, determining when and what they do.  The only thing I miss is having six people in my party, rather than four.The other driving force that makes the game so fantastic is the story and character.  There are loooong stretches of dialogue and story, and your individual responses can significantly impact the game.  Breaking away from the alignment system, characters are not so much classified as \"good\" or \"evil\" - but they will approve and disapprove of your actions, which is judged along a point system, depending on how that character feels about you at the time.  If disapproval goes too low, that character may leave your party and never come back. (And depending on gender, if approval is high enough with certain characters, it can activate romance.) But it may come about from doing something that all the other party members significantly approve of; Bioware promised that they wouldn't be the obvious \"right\" and \"wrong\" decisions to make - there are situations with difficult decisions to be made, and there really is no right answer.The camera system was a big reason I wanted the PC version, rather than for the Xbox 360, or PS3.  I love the freedom of looking around; the fact that I can bring the camera down directly over the shoulder of my character, or that I can pull back to a top-down perspective like Baldur's Gate - primarily useful during combat, with a broad view of the battlefield.  Similarly, as someone who recoils at the traditional WASD utilization of so many CRPGs, I actually rather enjoy what's employed here - with the option to use the keys to move your character around, or using the mouse to click on the area of ground I where I want my characters to move, just like in Baldur's Gate.There's a camp site always accessible, which functions as sort of the hub of the game.  While there, you rest of up from injuries (acquired anytime someone falls in battle), re-stock supplies with the dwarf merchant that follows you around, access downloadable content, and initiate conversations with the other members of your party - but even that can be tricky; say or do the wrong thing, and the character you're speaking too may suddenly drop significantly in approval points.  Also, in addition to the unique characters for your party, kudos to Bioware for recruiting the likes of Tim Curry, Kate Mulgrew, and especially Claudia Black for voicework - I would consider Black's character, Morrigan, to be like Minsc in Baldur's Gate: you have to play through with 'em at least once.The individual class systems are more customizable; the character creation centers more on actual appearance - down to the shape of different parts of the face, and so forth - and then you simply select a gender, race, and class.  Then, each of the three base classes - warrior, rogue, and mage - has subclasses, one of which you can emphasize on into the game.  Similarly, each time a character gains a level, you are given points with which you can assign to increase attributes such as strength, magic, dexterity, cunning and constitution.  You also get to decide the new abilities and spells for each character as they level up; rogues can learn stealth and lock-picking, as well as specific combat tricks; warriors can determine whether you want to emphasize a two-handed weapon, two weapons at once, or sword and shield; and mages learn a variety of spells based on nature, spirit, etc. that vary between offensive and defensive.  There are wonderful little details that ultimately prove toward making your individual character - and party - entirely unique.My only, minor criticisms of the game are this:-The subquests, though fun, are not altogether varied or creative; most the ones I've encountered thusfar usually involve going somewhere, killing a person or group of people for whatever reason, and reporting back.  Though I do rather like the added abilities of persuasion and intimidation - depending on your strength and cunning.-I turned off the persistent gore in the options menu, because I didn't want my characters walking around splattered with blood all the time; but beyond that, I actually find there to be so much to the point that it actually becomes comical.  Bioware seems to have become so delighted in including it in this game, they didn't stop themselves from going completely overboard, and it occasionally can make some of the more brutal cutscenes of battle somewhat difficult to take seriously.A final note about technical requirements: my computer has a chipset, rather than an actual graphics card.  The rest of my specs are more than adequate (3 gigs or RAM, 2 GHz processor), so I downloaded the character creator and it worked just fine.  I read around a lot online, with varying opinions about whether or not a chipset could handle such a technically massive game like Dragon Age, and finally just decided to buy it on the hope that it would work.  I put the graphics on their lowest settings, and always play it with my computer on high performance, and it works just fine.  Is it perfect?  Of course not.  It struggles sometimes with loading, and a few of the cutscenes; and if more than a dozen characters are on screen, the frame-rate drops significantly; but it gets by.  And that's all I need.  So if you're in a similar predicament, I would recommend trying the character creator, and doing research on gaming message boards, etc. - because even with just a chipset, there is still a possibility that the game could work on your computer.I love Dragon Age.  I'm not even close to finishing it and I already love this game.  I play mostly console RPGs, and find they usually become bogged down in repetitive, turn-based combat, utilize immensely flawed real-time combat, or synthesize themselves with other genres.  Only Bioware has ever managed to produce what I believe to be the perfect RPG; one that is never too reliant on one element, but rather perfectly balances gameplay, combat, story and character - in the most seamless form as though playing out an epic fantasy story as the main character.Between Dragon Age and Baldur's Gate II, nobody does RPGs like Bioware.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2010"}

Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Enjoyable if you persevere","reviewText":"Sareth, a young hero on the planet of Ashan, is thrust into a struggle between several competing factions for a mighty artifact, the Skull of Shadows, his use of which could determine the fate of the world. Arantir, a dread necromancer, wants to use the Skull to help him rule the world, whilst another faction favours destroying it or using it to re-imprison an ancient force of implacable evil. The choice is in Sareth's hands...It's difficult to pin down exactly what kind of game Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is. It has an inventory system and you gain skill points as the game progresses, which you can use to increase your effectiveness at combat, magic or stealth. It has a main storyline, but also a couple of optional side-missions at various points. Yet it isn't really an RPG. The game is thoroughly action-based, there are a few cut-scenes and very little in the way of hub or open areas where you can do jobs on your own. So it's more of a hybrid RPG and FPS.The game uses the Source Engine, previously used to power Half-Life 2 (and, since then, games like the Left 4 Dead and Portal series), and like Half-Life 2 the game is based around a gimmick. In Half-Life 2, you had a gravity gun which you could use to, for example, pick up a tumble driver and fire it at velocity into enemies' faces. It was a fun gimmick, especially since if you tired of it, you could ignore it and continue to use guns.Dark Messiah of Might and Magic also has a gimmick. It's called 'your foot'. Essentially you can use 'your foot' to 'kick' enemies, often into handily-placed fires or walls of spikes (which are, inexplicably, legion in the game, even in ordinary people's houses) or off ledges. Unlike Half-Life 2, this gimmick is not optional. Kicking an enemy is sometimes the difference between a fight lasting five seconds or ten minutes.Combat in Dark Messiah is hard, frustrating and annoying at anything over the lowest difficulty rating. You tend to die if you take three hits from the enemy, whilst they keep coming after sustaining dozens of blows, even small goblins. Keeping your shield up (or sword in parry mode) and knowing when to riposte blows is vital to ensure victory. That is, if you refuse to kick them to death using the omnipresent environmental hazards. Once you've gotten used to the oddities of combat, however, the game becomes far more enjoyable.Level design is frequently ingenious, overcoming the Source Engine's frustrating 'load every ten steps' feature by making maximum use of vertical space, with ascending or descending house floors and tower levels (often with a handy empty middle bit you can kick people down) being intelligently used to ensure maximum carnage with minimal loading. There's also huge spaces with clever ways of traversing them, sometimes recalling the Jedi Knight series, and intermittently the Prince of Persia games (particularly your character's ability to grab onto levels and haul yourself up, which is very weird in the first-person viewpoint). Graphically, the game is reasonable, though both character models and particularly animation are a bit weak compared to the two-years-older Half-Life 2. Environmental graphics and particularly lighting remain strong, however.The storyline is fairly weak and predictable, and your NPC helper for most of the game is pretty useless (she's no Alyx Vance, that's for sure). Also, despite being set in the same world as Heroes of Might and Magic V (and presumably the same universe as all the other Might and Magic games), there's little to no cross-over with the other titles, making the use of the Might and Magic franchise name questionable.Overall, Dark Messiah is a very oddball and conflicted game. On the one hand, the environments and level design are particularly strong, and combat, though sometimes frustrating, can be satisfying once you've mastered the various sword fighting combos, blocks and, of course, the use of your Mighty Foot of Insta-Death. On the other hand, the storyline is not particularly compelling and the NPCs are extremely thin. Yet it remained interesting enough for me to finish the game and, since I only paid 3 for it in a Steam sale, was also reasonably good value for money.Dark Messiah of Might and Magic (***) is a reasonably enjoyable game with enough problems to put off the easily-irritated. Those who persevere with it will - eventually - find much to enjoy. The game is out now in the UK and USA.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2011"}

You know have a bigger variety of characters to choose from (Note Jill and Shuma are optional depending on if you have previously downloaded for the DLC from the spec ed of MVC3 or..willing to shell out money for said characters. Same goes for costume pack. i.e. Chris, Captain America, Iron Man/Iron Patriot, et al.)In within this assortment I found a few that were so intuitive, (meaning no special learning curve required.) that I managed to kick ass online during first use of characters such as Vegil, Nemmy and Hawkeye. However,Marvexploitation (Marvel 70's characters) such as Nova, Iron Fist and Ghost Rider may require a little practice. The gameplay is somewhat tweaked in terms of balance,but the game is basically the same and that's a good thing. I noticed the additional new colors for the fighters, that range from cool, (Black Nova, Both Ghost Rider and She Hulk sporting Fantastic Four Logos, Bucky Captain America)whimsical (Dante and Vergil \"Color swap\" African American Iron Fist) to downright perplexing. (Blue Hulk,White Nemises,etc.) But all in all, it adds more variety to the roster and the special pre-order costumes are a bonus.What's also great is that the themes for the characters have not changed.  I could never tire of \"winds of Madness\" which is wesker's theme from RE5 and Taskmaster's theme just keeps me inspired during the heat of battle. For the most part, the music is a remix from the previous MVC games.My only complaint is regardless of the 36 characters, some decisions are questionable and not to mention the omission of Marvel Icons like Daredevil, Punisher (well at least  you get to \"play\" as him when you select Captain America)Blade, (WTF, you can have Dante the demon slayer but not Blade the vampire hunter??/!!?)Black Panther, or even Capcom side like Jedah from Darkstalkers, Hunk or Leon from RE,The guy from Onimusha, Regina from Dino Crisis and of course the original fighting robot Megaman.

{"product_name":"B005YR308S","description":"","reviewerName":"Lucas Black","summary":"One of the best movies I've ever seen","reviewText":"Let's start with one thing.  This game is essentially a choose-your-own adventure with a gritty, noir-style crime drama which relies very heavily on being cinematic.  As far as \"fun\" well it's not really a video game in a conventional way.  You can walk and interact with things, but it's mostly to move the story along.  You'll perform actions by pressing on-screen prompts or moving the right analog stick or the actual controller itself.  That's basically it for gameplay, which is, in itself, the least important part of this movie.The story, in simplest form, is: there's a serial killer known as the \"Origami Killer\" whom has young boys drowned within the span of a few days, then leaves their body somewhere with an origami figure in one hand and an orchid on their chest.  Conceivably he could have just as easily been called \"The Orchid Killer\" but, well, there you have it.  One of the main characters, Ethan Mars, has his son kidnapped and proceeds to track the boy down by completing a series of tests issued by the killer to show his love for the boy in exchange for clues.The other main characters include Madison, a photo journalist, Scott, a private detective, and Jaden, an FBI agent.  You'll control each of these four to investigate the Origami Killer in various ways, proceeding through the tightly-written drama.  Twists and turns are common, false leads abound, and in general I found it masterfully written, even if I didn't end up liking whom the killer ended up being.The main catch is the non-linear story progression.  To give an example: the playable characters can die on the way to the end, and that's it.  No do-overs, you just have to progress without them.  And yes, it is possible to simply not catch the killer, and the kid can die, and that can be your ending (of which there are several possible ones for each character).  I'm not sure if there even is a \"Game Over\" screen.  If you make a choice, wrong or right, it's there to stay.  There are others in the game you can choose to kill or not, or get caught by cops, and doing so can help or hinder you, or change future points in the story.  Be compassionate, or order people around, and your interactions with them in the future change, or maybe they won't even be around you any more.  This means that how you play the game makes the story unique to your choices, and there isn't really a \"wrong\" way to do anything.As far as I know, this is a unique feature to this single movie.  It can be depressing at times (most times) but it's like a book you can't put down.  Yes, it is a bit on the short side, but if it had been drawn out longer it would lose its punch.  If you're into experimenting with your games, give it a try.  If you want to stick to generic shooters like Call of Duty, no one will look down on you for it (I will).Very Minor Spoiler: When using the ARI near the end with Jaden in his office (if you let him make it to that far) try not to use it longer than you have to.  It is harmful to him.  The game doesn't overtly tell you that.  If it did, I wouldn't mention it here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0009PETYO","reviewerName":"Kristopher G. Williams \"zerokoolkw\"","summary":"\"Whoa!\" - Neo after playing Path of Neo","reviewText":"Finally a game fills the gaping void in the videogame universe that was created by that abomination \"Enter the Matrix\". Not to be repetitive but this is the game that should have been released 3 years ago. Forget about Ghost and Niobe in this game you play as the man himself and it from the beginning you really do feel the power of being The One. This game follows the new movie-made-into-a-game formula which is: stay true to the content of the movie by including all the best scenes for that movie BUT elaborate by adding new scenes to give the player a less than predictable experience. There are plenty of expanded scenes from all 3 matrix movies and things that you might have seen in the movies if they were Peter Jackson length (wink, wink). Though the cut scenes typically include footage from movies (which most matrix fans have seen too many times to count) but these cutscens have been re-edited in a sort of remixed fashion to give them a fresh feel. The only thing I would have improved about this game is the fighting system. Basically the fighting system just feels kind of clunky and is basically unpredictable. Some of the coolest move sequences are created through pure button mashing rather than trying to perform strategic combos. I think this game would have benefited from a system that was more like the one in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, which is much more precise and responsive. Having said that, you still feel like Neo when you're able to jump into the middle of a hoard of enemies and take them all to school in a matter of seconds. Some people have called the game \"repetitive\" but I think this assesment is somewhat misleading. Path of Neo is a beat'em up fighting game; there are quite a few fight scenes in the matrix films; so it's no suprise (to me anyway) that there are a lot of fight scenes in the game. The game does a good job of breaking up the monotony with a good puzzle or a first person shooting sequence like the chain gun helicopter scene.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2006"}

To start out with I will say the graphical upgrade is noticeable but not  a massive step forward. The presentation , the game modes , and the menus are still the same the game just just has better textures and the models and runs very smooth. The major strides have been made are in the actual gameplay itself. That is night and day and it is for the better. Madden 25 on PS3 in my opinion was a step back from Madden 13 , they fixed some issues with the physics but in the process made the AI completely brain dead. The ability for defensive backs and offensive linemen to read and react was the worse I can remember ever playing. This game has fixed that, the players react properly to situations. No longer will you be playing zone defense and your defender just stands there and watches the receiver go by. How many times have you went to tackle a guy and your defender just bounced off the ball carrier with his hands down stuck in the pursuit animation? I would recommend this game to fans of Madden that did not like Madden 25 on last gen, because I hated it and I love this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2013"}

In fact, when I was setting them up, I thought they were not working as it sounded like the sound was coming from my stereo speakers, but in fact it was coming from the cups.Unfortunately, my experience was marred by the horrible quality microphone. The mic is capped at 16khz, which is very low quality for vocals. While this may be fine for some programs, even in Skype/etc the quality is notable. For actual vocal recordings - commentaries, podcasts, etc - you can forget about it.Another thing to note is that if you record your voice using Adobe Audition, your playback and recording qualities have to be at the same level, meaning you not only have to record at 16khz, but you have to playback at 16khz too. Needless to say, this is a horrible experience.After discovering many wireless headsets have this problem - due to wireless bandwidth limits, sending/receiving high-quality audio and recording high-quality mic seems to be technologically impossible right now - I've decided to switch back to a wired headset.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2013"}

I had just moved to a new city and really needed something to do on the weekends. This game was/is the perfect release.What's great about this game? First of all, the graphics. This is something that has been bragged about before and rightly deserves its place on the mantel of impressive. Nearly a year later and I am still impressed with this games graphics and the fluidity of its play.A problem for a lot of people when it comes to this game is the way that game play is executed, in an awkward mix of 1st/3rd person, but after surviving your first zombie mob, you get to used to this detail.My problems with the earlier RE games was that I always found myself out of ammo, having to fight my way through with a knife, which would take literally 10 minutes to kill anything. This game has done a good job of keeping you stocked on what you need, but not to the point of being over stocked, with ammo to burn. It's really just enough to get you by and challenge you.The one element of this game that I never found interesting was the weapons upgrades. I beat the entire game with the first weapons that I picked up and I just upgraded them all the way through, rather than finding a new gun and having to waste money upgrading it. Plus, towards the end, you get magnums, grenade launchers, and upgrading your pistol or shotgun becomes a distant thought.The nice thing about the zombies in this game is that unlike the Left 4 Dead series, these Zombies actually become more intense as the game progresses. Adopting armor, weapons, and new breads as time continues. Fighting the bosses is the most annoying part of this game. In other games, I have looked forward to boss battles. Here, they are annoying and what it takes to defeat them is repetitive. It's walking the maps and finding you and your partner in the middle of an ambush that makes this game so much fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2010"}

This is a definite addition to the series as a prequel! The game's story takes place before the first Resident Evil takes place. This time you get to witness the beginning of Umbrella's mess in the eyes of Rebecca Chambers along with Billy Coehn. What's unique about this over the first series however is the \"Buddy System\" and the \"inventory\"!The buddy system works just fine and it is pretty fun to fight along side with your partner. One thing I noticed though is that to easily get a zombie off of you \"WITHOUT\" taking damage is to have your partner shoot them off of you! That's just one example on how working with your buddy is essential when solving puzzles, playing on hard mode, and especially the bonus game you get after beating the game! Loading times aren't too bad when switching from one character to another even if they're in another room. Gamecube is really a powerful system to innitiate short loading times!The inventory is pretty neat too! Not much of a huge change but you get drop unwanted items anywhere in the game! What's good about that is that you don't have to go back to a storage box like in the other Resident Evil games! Your map will locate the exact spot on where you left the items! It works really well in the game plus with the new \"Buddy System\", it's essential to do such action.Great game, great new buddy system, inventory works well, almost flawless. I just wish the ending shows more things but you should see for yourself. The bosses are pretty cool but too bad some of them are a little too easy for their appearance! Pre-rendered graphics works exactly like the remake of Resident Evil 1 and it's still breathtakingly stunning! Controls is just like all the other Resident Evils with the exception of Resident Evil 4 and it's still the same! Nothing wrong with it at all! If you played all the other Resident Evil series before 4, then you should be used to it by now and for me, the controls are flawless! Try not to compare this over Resident Evil 4 or you may not enjoy this at all! This game should be judged by it's quality and is however an instant classic!

{"product_name":"B002I0JAVK","description":"","reviewerName":"David Allen \"Trust999\"","summary":"Really A Great Game","reviewText":"Its not often you come across a game that is fun to play, challenging without being ridiculous, and not so long it seems to go on and on forever. Batman Arkham City is one of those great games where the mix is mystery, darkness, difficulty, and less is more are all combined to make for a winner.I actually had heard of Batman Arkham City a few times since its release. I ignored it as I assumed it to be another boring Batman game. A gift card this past Christmas had me at my local game store and I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. Batman Arkham City can be a smaller game if you do not download the Catwoman extras which affords you several levels that are worked in as you play the regular levels of the game. If you choose not to, or cannot download the Catwoman levels, its no big deal, the game will not suffer because of it. I had no means to connect so I played the basic game.Batman Arkham City as has been explained takes place in a section of Gotham that has been sealed off and all criminals set loose within its borders. But be they as it may, these criminals always seem to find a way to wreak havoc of some sort, and Batman gets into the mix. The basic overall story in a nutshell is this. Batman must enter Arkham City to make a rescue and the Joker infects him with a deadly virus and he must get the antidote or he will die. In this pursuit he will have to deal with the like of Joker of course, and also a few other favorites such as Penguin, and Mr Freeze.The whole game is a big puzzle. You must learn how to travel from one end of Arkham to the other. You'll be doing this a lot. You'll also need to learn how to take out enemies, both passive and armed. There are plenty of level up's along the way that apply to Batman's abilities, suit, and the tools he has to work with. As you progress you will gain access to a few advanced weapons. You start out with a very basic arsenal. I liked the idea of realistic basic weapons instead of loading him up with ridiculous weapons you would not see Batman have. Getting into areas of buildings is always a challenge. You have to find the entrances, but getting to them alive is easier said than done. You have to be stealth, and you need to think about your moves and what skills you have available to you.Enemies can be very deadly at times, but none are impossible to defeat with some thinking and learning to use and apply different skills. Use of the Detective Mode is a must to get through the game and help with your ability to apply stealth as you can see your enemies before they see you and you can know which are passive and which are armed. Detective Mode also is your key to finding your goal or your way to that goal. Use it often. Bosses are difficult without being so hard it became frustrating.Travel is either on foot, which can lead to lots of fights as the streets are full of thugs and murderers. Or you can use the roof tops by jumping to gliding. Some areas such as the industrial area are more difficult to get to and require the ability to fly and grapple to get there. Once you get the hang of it, you can travel from one end of the city to the other in a few minutes by gliding and grappling.Puzzles were not overly difficult which was perfect for me, I do not like to waste too much time solving puzzles. There are hints in the game for your benefit in solving a puzzle. Challenges can be well, challenging. Some are easier than others. I found the Gliding sequences in Ra's Al Ghul to be quite frustrating as the gliding and diving doesn't exactly work very well. But it is possible, if I made it anyone can make it!There are side missions of course, and you can choose to play them as they become available, or wait until the end and go back and play them. I chose to play them after I completed the game. That way I had my skills up, and knew how to do most of the things required to get through the missions. One mission is a series of missions based on how many Riddler trophy's you found. SO you may no be able to complete all of that mission depending on how many of those trophy's you picked up. You can go back and collect them if you want, they appear on the map as question marks. Some are just sitting ready to be picked up, others involve some action to get to them.In the end I really enjoyed this game. It was not overly difficult, the stealth game play was fun, and the open world allowed me to pick and choose what I wanted to do at any given time. I'm going to go pick up Asylum and see what the original game was like, I'm hoping it will be as much of a blast as Arkham City.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2014"}

The next-generation of fighting has been built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and XBOX ONE by the team behind the critically-acclaimed Fight Night franchise.Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology,EA SPORTS UFCbrings the action, emotion and intensity inside the Octagon to life in ways that were never before possible. The next-generation of True Player Motion not only showcases the diverse, powerful and fluid of attacks of elite mixed martial artists through Precision Movement, Dynamic Striking and Strategic Submission Battles, but also brings the combatants to life with Full Body Deformation and Real-Time Exertion. The simulation of Human Intelligence takes leaps forward with the strategic and adaptive MMAi system and is expressed through the most realistic characters ever created in a sports game.Feel the Fight &ndash; Gameplay FeaturesStep into the Octagon with the most realistic take on fighting ever achieved. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, every fighter, strike, takedown and submission will make you feel the fight.&bull;MMAi&ndash; A mixed martial artist&rsquo;s mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fight.&bull;Full Body Deformation&ndash; Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to the Fight Night franchise changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighter&rsquo;s flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression.&bull;Real-Time Exertion&ndash; A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring mixed martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world.&bull;Fighter Likeness and Facial Animations&ndash; EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. For the first time in an EA SPORTS game, every single licensed athlete in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon.&bull;Precision Movement&ndash; MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters.  Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns.&bull; Dynamic Striking&ndash; A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too. A dynamic environment allows you to pull off jaw-dropping moves using the Octagon, including roundhouse kicks, superman punches and much more. Combine those abilities with the best striking technology in the industry and that one perfect strike could change the fight.&bull;Strategic Submission Battles&ndash; To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat.  EA SPORTS UFC re-invents the ground game to create a battle for position and control that captures the strategy of a submission battle. Like the real sport, in EA SPORTS UFC fighters will work through multiple stages as they work to advance or escape from a fight-ending submission.&bull;Real Damage&ndash; Every fighter knows that one good shot can ruin your day.  EA SPORTS UFC introduces a non-linear damage system which can result in big damage coming from a single strike. The system produces a greater variety of cuts and contusions that is true-to-life and has never been possible in a simulation fighting game.","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"Great UFC Game","reviewText":"First off, this is a fighting game.

{"product_name":"B002I0IVC4","description":"","reviewerName":"JoshJosh","summary":"it's SSF4 on the 3DS","reviewText":"Until the PSP launched, we did not get many good fighting games on portable systems. The systems just couldn't handle the games, they didn't have enough buttons, and so forth. On the PSP, there were many - Street Fighter Alpha 3, Tekken 5, Guilty Gear, Soul Calibur, etc. Add Super Street Fighter IV 3D to the list of great fighters on portable systems. In fact, this might be the best one.The best thing I can say about this is that it feels like Street Fighter. The controls can get rough, but the moves work. The combos work. The pace of the fights is correct. This *is* Street Fighter IV. Compare it to the Street Fighter IV for the iPhone - that doesn't feel right. The pace is weird. The iPhone game plays like an old portable fighter would, odd and off-putting but with the same characters and moves. The 3DS game is the real deal.This even has all the same modes. Arcade mode is the same, and includes the car/barrel minigames. The AI seems to be the same as the console) version too. There's local multi, a training mode (with similar setup options as the 360/PS3 version, and a challenge mode with the same challenges as the 360/PS3 game (which could possibly be more challenging due to control). There's even online play, though it is all funneled through the ranking system. There are no replays or spectator modes, which is understandable.Control in this game takes some getting used to. Both the circle pad and d-pad are competent, but the d-pad is a little more precise. You can set moves to the bottom screen, which helps for ultras and the like. It's not as good as a joystick or controller, obviously. But like I said, I was able to do all of the combos I normally do on the 360/PS3 version.The graphics are the most noticeable downgrade. For one thing, the backgrounds are un-animated bitmaps. It's not a big deal, since you don't pay attention to the background during a fight anyway, but it is there. The game also runs at 30fps in online or 3D mode, which is significant, but as I said, the game is very playable. Turn off 3D in the options and you get a full 60fps in 1-player. The characters look amazing in this game - very close to the console version, and animated spectacularly well. This is where the computing power went and it shows.I gave this game five stars not because it is perfect, but because it retains everything that makes SSF4 such a fun game. Not just that, but Capcom did a good job of taking advantage of the 3DS' capabilities - the 3D effect is subtle but nice, dynamic 3D view (with the camera behind your shoulder) is a nice novelty, and there are even StreetPass functions.

Most people praise the story as being the strongest point but I say it's the characters. Far from cardboard, these characters are truly alive with emotions, all of which you can both see, thanks to great animation work, and hear, thanks to the fantastic voice acting. The world they inhabit is also quite beautiful, despite the rust and decay of this post apocalyptic setting.But there are flaws and chief among them is the abysmal frame rate (for the record, I hope I'm talking about the right thing). Although the animation itself is quite good (especially monkey, who swings through the air like an actual monkey), the movement (and the controls) are extremely choppy at times. I really hate having to compare it with the same game that pretty much everyone compares it to, but Enslaved lacked the smoothness of Uncharted. The movements are uncomfortably jerky, both visually (camera) and texturally (controls).Graphically, the game can be quite beautiful at times but it can also look a bit messy. Perhaps I need an HD TV but I found it rather difficult to make sense of my environment, especially when platforming. In fact, most of the time I would simply lean my analog stick towards the direction I suspect I'm suppose to go and press jump. Many have complained about the ease of the platforming but I thought that was the best thing they could do given the circumstances.Finally there's the story and this is a rather small gripe. The reason why I decided to praise the characters rather than the story was that I felt a little dissatisfied with the ending. (NO SPOILERS) Granted it was a beautiful ending, but it felt a little quick. It left me wondering why there were credits rolling so soon. I also hoped for a lot more romance between the two main characters but what was there was touching and convincing all the same.There is a small collection of games considered by many to be the hidden gems of video game story telling and I'm sure you're heard of them. Many gamers have reminisced about their experiences with Ico, Psychonauts, Beyond Good and Evil, Folklore and a few others. Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the experience I got from Enslaved and strongly believe that it deserves a place among these hidden gems. Unfortunately, like most of these gems, I fear this game will be overlooked. Understandably, this game is not for everyone, but if you are a fan of good story telling, great characters and those hidden gems that nobody plays, then I highly recommend experiencing this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2011"}

The thing that makes this game what it is  is it's immensly deep storyline.  The storyline will absolutely blow you away.  It is so detailed and so intricate that even playing the game dozens of times straight through, there are still parts I cannot understand or comprehend.  The game follows more of an RPG than a FPS, you will find most of your time running around trying to solve clues, find contacts, and so on without even having a weapon drawn.  It is nothing like the shoot-em-up Quakes, Dooms, and Half-Lifes.  The game has content, it has gameplay, an excellent musical score, and, once again I'll say it, the best storyline anybody has ever come up with.  This is the kind of storyline that could, with the right people, make the best action/mystery flick ever devised.  I am so enticed in the storyline even this many years after its release (and I first bought it the day it was released after playing the demo) that I even converted the music to listen to on my home stereo.  THAT is how addicting the game is.  If you have any brain at all, you will definately LOVE this game.

Having a blast playing the game! I'm gonna just jump right in with the review:PROS:> Cool game, extreme blood & gore, halfway decent fighting platform.> Very nice graphics (easily a 7 out of 10)> Challenging, but, not insanely hard.> Tons of cool weapons to pick from, ammo is easy to find> God/Extreme Mode: Which lasts for around 15-20 seconds when you use L3 & R3 buttons> Overall: A lot of fun to play!CONS:There's not that many, really...I know it looks like I'm writing a lot of complaints, but, I'm kind just being a bit nit-picky....> One of my major complaints is the camera angles during fighting sequences....pretty annoying! Not horrible, but, could have / should have been done differently, in my opinion.> Orcs have an EXTREMELY LIMITED vocabulary! They basically only say 2 things... \"Kill the Space Marine\", and \"Space Marine\"....OK, and maybe a moan or groan when they die.....BUT....TWO PHRASES???? COME ON???? REALLY!!!! THAT really gets annoying!!! Especially when you have to kill literally THOUSANDS of Orcs throughout this game, and you hear the SAME 2 phrases OVER & OVER & OVER AGAIN!!!  Jeeesh!!!  Would it have been so hard for HAVOC to be a bit more creative on the Orc dialogue??? Just 2 more dumb phrases would have been much better, and easier on the ears!> Overall Gameplay: Now, this is the weird thing.....Even playing on EASY mode, you might find yourself throwing the controller a few times. While it's not an extremely hard game to play or master (overall), I must warn you, there are some parts of the game that are just pure insanity. And this is even on the EASY MODE! You'll find yourself dying like 12 times just trying to get past one part, while sailing through other areas in 5 minutes flat?????....makes no sense...but...whatever??? Some parts of the EASY MODE actually feel like you're playing on HARD MODE...> And this brings me to the final Complaint: \"Health\"......The health meter is OK, but my gripe is if you're in a huge fight, taking on 30 Orcs at a time, you need to do a Finishing Move to gain health...OK, no big deal.... but, while you're right smack in the middle of doing a finishing move to gain more health, you'll die, because 80 more Orcs are slammin' you all at the same time.....Kind of annoying, but, I can deal with it.Overall, it's a really fun game, with tons of gore, a bit challenging, but, the limited vocabulary of the Orcs gets a bit old, really fast.  :)  BUT, if you can grab yourself a \"used\" game, it's really checking out. Hours of fun!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2012"}

From Software had already scored a huge hit with \"Demon's Souls,\" and the idea of this game seemed very intriguing: an homage to the top-down action adventures of yesteryear, with particular attention paid to the granddaddy of them all, \"The Legend of Zelda.\"But \"3-D\" is more than a tribute. It is a blatant rip-off. I say this in the best way possible, because if there is one game a company should rip off, it's \"Zelda\". Hailed by many as the single greatest game ever made, \"TLOZ\" changed gaming forever, from its use of the battery-pack for saving, to its open-world environments, to its dungeons and bosses. \"Zelda\" had it all. Of course, it spawned many quality sequels, but with the advent of 3-D gaming, the top-down beauty of this classic has been lost.\"3-D\" has a full dose of itself, however. There are numerous references to 8-bit classics of yesteryear, from strange translations of spells, to clues that point you nowhere. There's even a developer's room, harking back to games such as \"Chrono Trigger.\" But scratch below the nostalgia, and you have some quality gameplay that's worth coming back for.Anyway,The Good:1) The Nostalgia - I loved every minute of it. As a 35-year-old gamer who remembers crowded arcades in the early 80's, it was great to revisit the quirks of old NES classics.2) Exploration - \"3-D\" has a large overworld map, just like Zelda of the past. But many of the secrets of this map are obscured, or unattainable, until you get certain abilities. This adds length to the game, but it never feels unnecessary. A world that was a pain to traverse early becomes easily maneuverable later.3) Bestiary - This gets it own section. In order to get enemies into your bestiary, you actually have to HIT them with your bestiary book. It is amazing how much fun this adds to the game. The weapon itself has short range and pathetic attack, and often it takes many, MANY hits to \"book\" an enemy (particularly bosses). There are many enemies to hit, and some of them can be quite challenging.4) Character creation - I spent hours with this, creating strange and wonderful characters. It might not be for everyone, but it's fun nonetheless.The Bad:1) Perspective. At times, I found the dungeon cameras incredibly frustrating. When trying to book the Dark Knight, I would often take phantom hits for no good reason. Sometimes, your character will get hung up on environment, or won't be able to use his weapon because he's too close to the door. It's a pain.2) Control - the game utilizes a mix of the grid system from \"TLOZ\" with analog controls, and while sometimes the effect is good, it often fails. It's annoying that my character can move diagonally, but can't ATTACK that way.3) Music quirks - At times, the music would start skipping, particularly when moving from screen to screen. It always freaked me out.The Best:1) Trophies - It's nice when a game gets it right, and these trophies only serve to add to the experience. For example, in order to get many of the hidden trophies, you have to defeat a boss without getting damaged. That adds to the experience. Booking bosses also gains trophies, as does beating the game without ever dying, etc. etc. All in all, the trophies do exactly what they should - they ADD to the overall experience of the game.So, that's it. I docked the game a single star due to the few missteps I mentioned, but all in all, if you are a fan of the old school classics, you should buy this. Even if you aren't, there is still a lot to be had here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2010"}

Once again, you enter the mind of the Hitman, a for-hire assassin trying to escape a violent past. Eventually, you are lured back into your trade by a twisted Russian crime boss bent on assisting rogue countries for his personal and financial gain. You soon realize that you are caught in the middle of a ring of deception, and discover that you have become a target yourself, of a highly trained ex-Spetsnaz assassin. Utilize stealth, tact, and survival instincts to complete your missions.","reviewerName":"brutusmuktuk","summary":"A dress-up game for guys","reviewText":"One of the main things a stealth action game should have is an open-ended game environment, and Hitman 2 sure does. You can play the game one of two ways: sneak around until you reach the target and make the kill, or gun down everybody in your path on your way to the target. I suppose a third way would be to mix and match the two, but it's more fun to pick one and go with it. Not only do you have a choice of being sneaky or going in guns-ablaze, but within those two options you have other options. If you choose to be sneaky, the game provides a myriad of ways to do so. At the end of each level you get ratings based on your stealth and aggression: Professional, for the stealthy; Natural, for the split stealth and aggression; and Mass Murderer, which explains itself. It's all up to you how you want to play.The stealth in this game, while not Splinter Cell-caliber, is still very good. Unlike other stealth games, you rely on disguises rather than shadows to hide behind. It's a very effective and unique way to approach the genre, and fortunately everyone wears your size. For those who love games that give you different costumes for your character, you will enjoy outfitting Agent 47 into one of the many disguises the game provides. You can wear the clothing of any male character (no cross-dressing for our silent assassin) and take over their position. Thus changing into other costumes serves as more than a gimmick. In the first level, you can choose to be a postman delivering flowers, a guard patrolling the area, or a grocery man carrying groceries into the kitchen.Or if you don't like to be stealthy, you can just whip out your Ballers, Agent 47's signature dual pistols, and blast away at your foes. Along with being among the better stealth games I've played, this is also an excellent shooter. Even if you are aiming to be more stealthy, you always need to be ready to pull out your guns in case things go wrong. You do receive stealthy weapons, such as a fiber wire, but those require that enemies don't know you're there. Your gun should always be in the back of your mind in case something goes horribly wrong. Fortunately, the use of a gun does not mean you will lose your strong stealth rating at the end of the level. As long as you kill somebody without alerting others, it's stealthy. If you're the bloodthirsty type, though, you can just pull out your AK47 and mow down everyone in sight. There's rarely a limit to who you can shoot, so for the most part you won't get any of those \"Don't kill any civilians\" objectives. Agent 47 is given license to do whatever is necessary to kill the target. That means don't die and don't let the target get away.The game is not without its problems, unfortunately. Bugs and glitches litter the entire game, and they seem amateurish. They mostly affect the music or graphics, though, rather than the gameplay. The only bug that did affect the game was during a level when my sniper rifle began firing blanks. This didn't prevent me from being able to complete the game, but did remove one of the options to complete it. My biggest complaint has to do with the paranoid enemy AI. For some reason while you're disguised, no matter how normal you are acting, the guards begin eying you suspiciously. More often than it should, this leads to the guards pulling out their weapons and opening fire on you. And it's not about the guards seeing a strange face; they do this even if you're wearing a mask in a level filled with masked men. The high enemy suspicion at times did make the game frustrating, especially because it took a little bit of fun out of being stealthy.If you are looking for a fun shooter, or a fun stealth game, this blends both genres better than almost any other game out there. Since the game is so well-done, one might wonder whether the developer has guys with expertise in the business. At least I'm giving the game a good rating so they don't send anyone on me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E800","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Richardson","summary":"A First Class Remake of an Iconic Zelda Adventure","reviewText":"I've heard a lot of belly-aching about the 3DS being bombarded with \"ports\" of old games, but from what I've seen that is mostly not true. Ocarina of Time 3D (along with Star Fox 64 3D) is a remake in the sense that Pokemon Heartgold and Soulsilver were remakes; although the revision is faithful to the point of replicating most of the original version's flaws, the graphical and control upgrades are so significant that in good faith one cannot merely label it a \"port.\" It isn't. The game itself is the same, but the control scheme and menu navigation are very different for this dual-screen handheld console, and ALL of the graphics in this title have been updated and given the 3D treatment. Although the 3D effect is nice (particularly when you are looking across an open field or there are dust/particle effects), it isn't central to game-play and doesn't have the depth that other original titles for the 3DS have. This makes sense as OoT wasn't designed with stereoscopic 3D in mind. I still played the vast majority of this title with the 3D slider turned up because the development team did an excellent job with the effect. The graphical revisions in particular are very noteworthy. This looks like a graphically impressive Gamecube or Wii game. Backgrounds, which were previously very flat and static have been given depth and detail. Character models are much more rounded, without all of the sharp angles that proliferated in the N64 title. The graphical update particularly shines when it comes to faces and character models, though. Link's polygonal form and strange looking face are no more: this looks more like the version of Link seen in Twilight Princess in terms of the level of detail. Other background characters look similarly impressive.Controls and menu navigation are much easier than they used to be. One useful addition is the gyroscopic controls when Link is aiming something. Switching out items is no longer as laborious a task as it was in original. And a change made in item assignment, with the iron boots in particular, make the dreaded Water Temple a much more pleasant experience.I haven't noticed many changes to the actual game itself. There is now a helpful map feature in the aforementioned Water Temple that allows you to easily reference which rooms change the water level on each floor. Also included is a new structure that allows you to see 'visions' of what awaits you in your quest, essentially throwing you a bit of a bone if you're completely baffled about what to do next. I can't make any comments on the changes in the included Master Quest version of the game as I never played the original Master Quest on the original Gamecube. Its inclusion here does significantly affect the length and replayability of this title, though.Annoyances with the original remain, of course. The game's wonky save system is still there, along with the unforgiving way you're treated if you manage to lose all of your lives to a temple's boss (I can't tell you how many times I had to traverse the entire length of the Shadow Temple because Bongo-Bongo kept killing me). Autolocking on enemies (so revolutionary for its time) is still a troubled and error-prone experience, and the game's substandard camera issues remain.Although the changes from the original aren't as drastic as those in-between, say, the original Resident Evil on the PS1 and REmake on the Gamecube, they are still fairly major, and if you enjoy Zelda games AT ALL this is a wise investment. Especially if you never had a chance to play the Master Quest version of this game before this remake. This is highly, highly recommended, and is one of the best games on the 3DS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2012"}

Most of the classics are here though, like Sonic, Streets of Rage and Ecco. There are also a few deep cuts and the occasional \"why did this one make the cut?\" choice, but as a whole the collection is solid, especially when counting the nine unlockable games.The achievements (33 total) are a curious lot. Not all the games have them, and the ones that do have only one as far as I've seen. Sometimes they're involved (like unlocking Roo as a playable character in Streets of Rage 3) and other times they're almost ridiculously easy (like \"Get a Chaos Emerald\" in Sonic). Most are worth 30G. I would have liked to see more achievements worth less. That way each of the 40 primary games could get 25G and have multiple achievements. Instead of having only one achievement for Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (\"Get 100 Rings with Tails in the first level\" for 30G), we could get four or five (\"Beat the game in any mode\" (5G), \"Get 100 Rings with Tails in the first level\" (5G), \"Get a perfect on a Special Stage\" (10G), \"Collect all the Chaos Emeralds\" (5G)).The \"Save\" feature is very nice, meaning you don't have to have a five-hour session to beat a particular game. The listing of the games is also a nice touch: you can do it alphabetially, by genre, by release date. Players can also rate the games on a scale of 1 to 5 and sort the games by their ratings.The graphics have also improved, though not so much so they don't still feel like the originals (think what the memory add-on for the N64 did to that console's standard games and you get the idea). This is accomplished via a widescreen option and a smoothing option (like the Genesis titles you can get on the Xbox Live Arcade).All in all, this is a good collection of classic titles at a decent price (if you downloaded them all from the Xbox Live Arcade - most are available there - you would be paying a lot more) with some other titles thrown in for good measure.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2009"}

For those who have played a Metroid game before, Samus (Metroid's heroine) has been infected by a parasite. A parasite that has now infected everything onboard a space lab! A lab is not exactly a world; in fact it is blatantly divided into eight levels. Samus is lucky though, because she is already infected, so every mutated monster that she reverts to its normal self (by shooting it), the parasite leaves the body, where Samus can catch the parasite for energy or a replenishment of missiles, but if she does not, the parasite can fly around to find another creature to mutate. Basically enemies can indeed come back to life. There are an entirely new cast of enemies, monsters and bosses, but the most interesting enemy is a clone of Samus that follows just a step behind! The game is very straight forward, there are many features for Gameboy Advance, such as save points are everywhere, there are places to fill up your energy all the way, and everything is easy to find because of navigation rooms that make a map and mark where you should go, so that way it keeps the game moving forward.

They've made tossing someone out of the ring more difficult, and they've added walls to the arenas. I haven't noticed any control lag, as suggested by other reviewers, and you can change the voices from english back to japanese in the options menu. That reviewer is right, however, when he points out how insufferable the english dialog is.Here are the negatives: The game lacks online play, which is really too bad. Almost unforgivable, in my opinion. Some of the new character designs (Charade, Necrid) are really lame. The addition of Heihachi, from Tekken, doesn't add anything to the game, either, and Yoshimitsu is tired. Finally, being asked to play through &quot;Weapon Master&quot; mode a second time is downright tedious.On a picky note, some of the character re-designs fall a little flat. Xianghua, Seung Mina, and Astaroth seem to've lost something with their updated graphics.Now that I'm older and don't live at home, I depend on online play to compete against my brother, who now lives across town.

All games are scaled up to HD and you can apply a smoothing filter that doesn't effect gameplay, if you have a wide screen you can have the image stretched to fit your screen.I personally bought it for the Streets of Rage/ Shining Force games because I already have all of the Sonic games, Phantasy Star IV, Beyond Oasis, Vector Man  for my real genesis. But this collection is massive containing a lot of great classics you might not remember.Though as great as it is, there's a few games missing for no reason. Most notable is Sonic 3 and Knuckles (when they're locked on), it has Sonic 1,2,3, Sonic and Knuckles, Sonic 3D Blast, Sonic Spinball, but..not Sonic 3 combined with Sonic & Knuckles, a game that can't be more than 2 megs was left off the disc for what reason? None. It is Sonic's ultimate Genesis Collection, they have the games separate, but not combined so why not include his best run? Disc Space isn't a issue when dealing with games that came out nearly 16 years ago.Anyway you can't find much of a better value, they have a LOT of games on here and most are simply amazing, for very cheap. Some sounds are a little off, but again, it's a great deal and it's a must have in my mind. I probably have half of these games for my genesis and I got it anyway. It just loses a star for not having Sonic 3 or Sonic 2 combined with Sonic and Knuckles, it's Sonics best game in my opinion and it's insane not to put it in. (Thinking about it now, I'm sure they'll just release it for download on PSN/XBL)To sum it up, there's a lot of great games on here and a few not so great, but are still worth the nostalgic value. You can't get these games for a better deal, some are worth 80 bucks alone on cartridge form, and they're at least 10 dollars each on virtual console each. So 49 games (including unlockable games) times ten is 490 bucks vs Genesis collection for 30, can't beat this great deal.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2009"}

The only other fighting games I own for my Gamecube are the Mortal Kombat installments, which I've played to death. SCII seems to offer a slightly better fighting engine, with more responsive controls and depth. The characters also seem to animate a lot smoother, without the bothersome stiffness of Mortal Kombat.However, Mortal Kombat and most other fighting games seem to offer a more memorable lineup of fighters. Soul Caliber characters basically fall into three types: the handsome male warrior, the female princess warrior, and the bizzare beast monster. Maybe its because I never played the Dreamcast original, but I could care less what the history behind these characters is or what happens to them when they win. Namco tosses out tons of story text, but its not really involving. I never felt attached to any character like I did Johnny Cage or Kitana.The other problem is the Weapon Master (tutorial) mode. You can win money to buy more weapons and costumes and there's a mode where you can watch the characters do their beautiful weapon demonstrations. But overall I just preferred the unlockable content of Mortal Kombat better, which featured staff photos, interviews, production art, fun videos, etc. There's a lot to purchase in SCII, but the incentive to do so isnt quite as high.SCII is a solid fighting game and worth a purchase for all Gamecube owners. I'd just like Namco to build up a more memorable roster of characters for future installments, and maybe offer cooler unlockable goodies.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2005"}

It's a phrase I like to use with my kids when they want a toy that I think is going to interest them a total of about twenty minutes.

For the first time in YEARS, I find myself playing Madden far more than NCAA.  It took a few games to get used to the new controls and such, but I find a VERY fluid game of football in this year's Madden.  At first I hated that all of the pre-snap adjustments had been moved to the d-pad, but once you get used to it, it's much more intuitive than it was before, where you had the adjustments scattered all around the controller.  If you look at this from a newbie's standpoint, I think the new control scheme makes the game much more approachable.Control praises aside, the game has great balance between running, passing, and defense.  I don't feel like any one of those three aspects has an edge over the others, and that's key to a great football game (last had in NFL 2k5).I think a lot of the complaints are just a consequence of people not really giving the new control scheme a chance.

{"product_name":"B004EVWYYG","description":"","reviewerName":"dgdbear \"David\"","summary":"\"Two steps forward, one step back\"","reviewText":"This review is mostly to compare the games to the previous generation, as most people have already played some Pokemon games. If you're brand new to the series, another review might be better for you. That being said, here are my thoughts on the game.Pokemon games have a habit of cutting connections with the past every few gens. The first example was third gen, with Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald. They completely severed connectivity with the previous games, removed most of the old Pokemon from the main game, and removed some other features such as day/night and having a second region. Black/White is another example of this - you can only get the new Isshu Pokemon in this game outside of Dream World and a few post-game, Pokemon no longer follow you like they did in HG/SS, and once again you have to hold B to run. These aren't game-breaking changes, but I was really disappointed at the fact that you can no longer talk to your Pokemon. It was a really welcome change in HG/SS, in my opinion.The battle system has been revamped again. Dream World is a much-needed addition - It allows you to get Pokemon with different abilities, which makes a lot of previously unusable Pokemon more viable for competitive battles. Triple battles were added in too. It's not a style I really care for, to be honest, but I guess I might get used to it after some more playing. I prefer the classic one on one battles myself, but to each his own. As with every other generation, a bunch of Pokemon/items/attacks/abilities were added in, which will obviously have a huge effect on the metagame. TMs are also infinite-use now like HMs were in all the previous games, so you don't have to choose which of your flying Pokemon has to go without Roost or Aerial Ace. Not being a competitive player myself, I can't really give any predictions on how all these changes will effect the metagame itself, but I know that there will be a pretty big revamp.As for the new Pokemon in the game...well, it's a hit and miss. A lot of the new Pokemon have amazing designs, while others just look stupid in my opinion. For example - the fire type starter Pokemon looks cute, but evolves into something extremely stupid and ugly looking. At least we always have Everstones! Of course, everyone has a different taste in designs, but I just find a big line between awesome and stupid designs this generation. Speaking technically, there are 156 new Pokemon added - more than any previous region has ever added. It gives you a wide variety of what you want to use, which is something that the Pokemon series is loved for. You can always replay the game using different Pokemon, or train something new if you find something you like. It gives the series near-endless replay value.Another notable change - Seasons. Seasons last a month each real-time (Think Harvest Moon games if you've ever played them, each season lasts for 30/31 days), and they have some pretty big effects on the games. Some areas might be blocked off during Summer, while during Winder you can walk up a hill of snow to get there. If anyone hated the day/night aspect of GSC and DPP, you'll probably hate the seasons more - certain Pokemon are more plentiful in certain seasons, and the game also has the day/night cycle from the previous games. To catch them all, you'd have to come on during different times and different seasons. Though I haven't tried it yet, I assume you can just change the month in your DS to change the season in Pokemon, so it shouldn't be that crippling. On the bright side, it adds a lot of replay value and playtime to the game.Figured I'd mention one more thing before finishing off the review - the soundtrack. The first song from the series I heard was the Pokemon Red/Blue Champion Battle remix, on Youtube. It's great that they reuse some old tracks, and the new ones are pretty good too. Pokemon in general is known for pretty memorable music, but it was worth a mention.It all depends on your tastes. I'll probably still prefer Heart Gold and Soul Silver over Black and White, but these games aren't bad in any particular way (Like Ruby and Sapphire were). Personally, I wish that they waited until the 3DS to add in more new features, but it's a pretty solid game.Pros:156 new Pokemon to useNew abilities to make older Pokemon more usefulGraphic perspective changed to make the game visually more appealingDifferent seasons as well as just day and night (I personally like this, but I can see why many people wouldn't)Beautiful soundtrackCons:Can't get your old favorites until post-gameA lot of stupid designsThe Fire starter Pokemon's evolution (This deserves a special mention)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2011"}

Weir","summary":"Comfortable and great sounding!","reviewText":"I live in a small apartment building so it's nice to not be paranoid about bass levels late at night, or fire up an action game, or move,  late at night when the live-in girlfriend is sleeping. It's also nice to get my game on with a headset that also blocks out ambient noise, like the barking dogs of neighbors, or people who haven't figured out that when you live in a building with other people it's considerate to NOT slam your door. These headphones have been a blessing on all fronts.As many other reviewers have said they are plug and play. The blutooth USB dongle plugs into your PS4 system, you put the headphones on your head, and power them up...away you go without hassle or drama.Do download the latest drivers and the companion app for the PS4: it lets you assign a sound profile to the headset. Certain games, such as Infamous: Second Son (great game!) have their own unique sound profiles that you can assign to the headset.The headset instructions don't say this, but in order to download custom sound profiles the headset MUST be connected to the PS4 with the supplied cable in order for it to work. It can't do the job wirelessly. Other than that they are completely wireless.I'm no audiophile but I do have a decent soundbar system with a beefy subwoofer when I'm not using these headphones. With the headset on you notice subtle environmental sounds that you'd never hear otherwise. This was tested on Tomb Raider, Resogun and Infamous. If you're not an audiophile I can't imagine a better value at $99 bucks. These headphones have great lows, highs and mids for the price (and once the firmware is up to date) and I've worn them for up to 5 hours with very little discomfort.A lot of reviewers have trash talked the build quality. They seem fine to me. You're either wearing them, or they're sitting on your coffee table. They seem sturdy to me. Don't throw them against the wall?TLDR: Buy these, they sound great, are comfortable, and I can't imagine getting a better set of casual headphones at $100.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2014"}

Raillard","summary":"Next Generation polish, Dated Gameplay","reviewText":"Having just beaten the single-player portion of GTA IV, I am having a hard time sorting out my feelings for the game.  On one hand, it's a blast to play, and you can easily lose 30-60 hours of your life to the streets of liberty city.  On the other hand, there really isn't anything here that you haven't seen before.PROS: Terrific graphics, awesome \"sandbox\" (I'm starting to hate that term) gameplay, the most realistic city ever rendered.  Tons of game content, great voice acting and production values, tons of cool music to listen to, and the deepest and most mature GTA game yet.CONS: Underneath the next-gen looks... it's the same game.  The control, which had supposedly been revamped, still stinks.  You spend tons of time battling the camera (especially in close-quarters combat and when driving).  The new aiming system works pretty well, though it's not foolproof.  The biggest problem I had, however, was the canned, cliched and repetitive mission formats.  Virtually all of the missions follow one of three structures: 1)Nikko must kill someone.  Drive to where they are, shoot them.  2)Nikko must chase someone, THEN kill them.  Get in your car, get really frustrated at the unrealistic physics, kill the target.  3)Nikko must recover drugs/guns/etc from bad guy.  The chase scenes are particularly annoying, as run-of-the-mill cars will suddenly outrun your high-end sports car.  The new car physics model is a case of overcompensation- in trying to make it less arcady, the developers have made it unrealistically floaty.The interpersonal relationships is another gimmick (much like altering your body type in San Andreas) which gets old really quick.  There are no properties to buy, meaning you can expect to do a lot of driving between safehouses the game gives you.  There are no checkpoints, meaning that many longer missions will have you throwing the controller at the wall when you fail and have to repeat them from the very beginning (though Roman's taxi service does help a bit).Conclusion:  I still had a lot of fun with this GTA, but it also became readily apparent how the core gameplay has NOT evolved since GTA III.  Rockstar adds little tweaks, which is great, but the missions feel like deja vu.  Why is it so hard to make a character control scheme that doesn't have the character feel like he's on rails?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2008"}

This is really frustrating, becaus sometimes you'll try to stop yourself from getting a wanted level.-The hand-to-hand combat system is a real joke. You can seriously play through the hand-to-hand combat parts blind-folded. All you have to do is smash the X button several times. The character moves on his own.-The game is a bit too short.

More than 60 vehicles are available to drive through the 12 miles of environment; stop your car and get out whenever and wherever your want. Use weapons such as a Tommy gun, a Smith & Wesson model 27 Magnum, a pump-action shotgun, a baseball bat, or Molotov cocktails. Seven multiplayer modes are available via LAN or over the Internet, including Deathmatch and Capture the Flag.","reviewerName":"John L. Maillard \"Digital Enthusiast\"","summary":"Omerta: Doesn't Get Much Better Than This","reviewText":"If you have a PC and you like action games, a good storyline, terrific presentation, great graphics, and a whole lot of bang for your buck, then you should pick up this sensational game. Mafia is the tale of Tommy Angelo, driver-turned-mafioso henchman who works for Don Salieri and his gang. Combining aspects of Grand Theft Auto III and the terrific Max Payne games, Mafia delivers an unparalleled gaming experience that shows why the PC is the best platform around for the mature gamer.The city of Lost Heaven is packed with style and substance (with nods to New York City and New Jersey), and the 1930's backdrop works perfectly. The cars, the characters, the missions, and the gunfights combine to keep you interested and wanting to come back for more. The game starts out a little slow, but once you get through the car race, the rest of the missions each become a game within itself. Assassinations, escorts, planting bombs, bootlegging, revenge...you name it. Everything involved with organized crime is represented, and represented well. The graphics are crisp, and blood flows plenty, as it should when you liquidate the members of an opposing family with a Tommy Gun in an Italian restaurant. The voice acting is superb, and the &quot;flashback&quot; method of explaining the story works perfectly. The sounds of the city make the entire game come alive, with each section of the bustling metropolis orchestrated to its own beat. The cars look and sound genuine, and the driving portions of the game, while sometimes tedious, are a necessity that you'll eventually come to accept and have fun with, especially when you're blowing away the windshield of your tail while hitting corners at 60 MPH in a flatbed truck!There are some knocks against the game, such as not having the ability to save whenever you want (the game autosaves during key points). This can frustrate some, since many times, a difficult gunfight that promises quick death will have to be replayed multiple times since you can't save at will. However, there is a greater satisfaction after killing your opponents since the game will usually save after a tough shooting sequence! Also, the AI in the game is rather strange. Enemies are either completely stupid or very challenging, and all-too-often, you'll find yourself shaking your head in disbelief after you find that your enemy still stands despite the point-blank blast of your pump-action shotgun.But don't be fooled: Mafia is wholeheartedly recommended. The driving/gunfight action sequences are the best in the business, and when you combine the tight storyline with the sensational mission design, you've got a game that will keep you enthralled for many nights. A great holiday gift for the adult PC gamer in your family. Omerta.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2003"}

Matt Baker a member of the Airborne rangers taking place at the dawn of the Normany invasion as you jump behind enemy lines into the French countryside.  EAch mission level begins with a narration by your character and wonderful cinematics that bring a movie-like feel to the game which I really love.The variety of missions involves capturing towns, taking out tanks and machine gun positions, etc.  You can control various infantrymen and even your own tank and following traditional military manuevers to carry on to success.  The combat is fast-paced and exciting.  Aiming is a bit haphazard though.  There are times when you'd swear you hit a guy with a kill shot and he keeps on trucking so that is a bit of a problem and the main reason I drop my rating down to four stars.Graphically the game looks great with terrain features culled from actual locations in France (not that most of us would know this, of course).  The character models are very good and move smoothly.  The sound is very strong as well as the din of battle is almost deafening in surround sound and very authentic.

Nope, it is for people that want a challenge and have patience.I just finished the second boss (Taurus Demon) in this game but it took me awhile to figure that boss out.  I died and respawned back at the bond fire.  Then had to kill all the trash to get to the boss again then get my souls then try and fight the boss with a new strategy.  Died again went back to the bond fire, killed trash, died at boss, and at this point had 4000 souls.  Went back to bond fire and then died accidently jumping off cliff and loosing all 4000+ souls.  I was pissed that happened but calmed down and went back determined to kill that boss.  I figured out to climb the ladder and do a jumping attack (3 times) to kill that crazy boss.  I was so happy that boss died, only to die again by the dragon up top.  O'well I'm having so much fun playing this game.  See this is what this game is about and for some people they don't get it.

Enjoy a total of seven Mega Man games with remixed soundtracks original and sketch art, plus many other cool features!","reviewerName":"Destitute","summary":"Despite flaws and ridiculous sellers, the X Collection shines.","reviewText":"Well, what can I say? I used to love these games as a kid, and still do. If you're looking for a review that reviews the games themselves, look in my older reviews, because I think I've reviewed all 6 games on here. (even though those reviews are real crappy, considering I was only 13.)THE PREMISE: The X games are like the old Mega Man games. You choose one of eight levels, fight the boss, and get his weapon. The bosses all have weaknesses to a certain weapon. You also collect items like hearts to increase your health and tanks to store energy. And you get to blow a lot of things up, which is a plus. Like the original series with Dr. Wily, the final boss is always the same guy: Sigma. In some of the games, you can also play as Zero, too.Due to the success of the Mega Man Collection, it was only natural for Capcom to tackle the X games next. However, should you just get all the games separately, or buy this collection? Here are the pros and cons.PROS:This whole collection is probably less expensive than getting one SNES cartridge of the first three games.Remember how the Mega Man Collection censored Bass's line from \"Damn\" to \"Darn\" in MM7? They don't censor anything in this one. In fact, in the first game, they add a \"Damn\" when Zero saves X from Vile.Includes an extra game, too. Battle and Chase, I believe. I haven't played it yet.X3 is the rare PS1 version with anime cutscenes.X6 is retranslted and they got rid of the Japanese voices.CONS:The sound can get a little muffled at times.People say there are errors in some of the text. I read so fast, however, that I really didn't pay attention to it.The collection is not complete. X7 and X8 are not included.I like the SNES version of X3 better. In my opinion, it has superior music.In X4, they change one of X's power ups.It lacks on the extras department, unlike the regular collection.This isn't a flaw in the collection, but rather in human nature. Despite the game being fairly new, it's hard to come by. The sellers are rather greedy, also. Just look how much it is for a brand new copy. And some sellers sell the game for about $20, yet it only has the disc. So make sure you choose wisely in ordering it.Yeah, I put more cons than pros, but the heart of this collection is in the games themselves. If you like Mega Man, this is worth a buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2008"}
{"product_name":"B004J6I0YO","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Pohle","summary":"I'm torn.  Awesome game, horrendous translations.","reviewText":"After renting this from Gamefly, I began The Sands of Time (easily one of my favorite games of all-time) and after five minutes had decided to purchase it.  The graphics are much more clean and crisp than the PS2 version, the camera seems to have been improved (which was my biggest issue with the original version), the load times are better, and the framerate does not lag as it sometimes did on the PS2 though it will sometimes pause for a second when entering a new area.  It'd be nice to also have all three games in one package to save some shelf space.  However after having played more, I've decided not to buy.Reason being is the sound translation for The Sands of Time is TERRIBLE.  I've never heard such inconsistency and buginess when it comes to sound in any game ever, it's almost to the extent of being broken at some points.  Sound effects for objects/events far off in the distance blast through the speakers while ones close are almost inaudible, sometimes there's no effects at all or they drop in and out, and oftentimes they cycle over and over and I had no idea where they were coming from.  I could hear traps going off two rooms away.  The range of volume is all over the place and I had to continually turn my speakers down for fights, then all the way up all other times to be able to hear.  Keep in mind I'm only talking about TsoT here.  It very quickly became intolerable to play, and I have NO idea how this got past QA.  Truly, truly awful and trust me when I say this is not a small issue.  It was so bad I could not continue playing.The two thrones does not have this problem and is a decent port, and I've not played Warrior Within as I went through that bastardization of the franchise when it was released and won't bear to go through it again, so I can't speak for it.  From other review I hear it's fine.  I bought this almost solely for an improved version of TsoT, but as it is it's nearly unplayable in the audio department.  Though I consider sound to be of utmost importance in games, so I'm biased against a game if it's poorly executed.  Having an upgrade where pretty much everything is improved but one very important aspect is a severe drop in quality bothers me, especially in a game like this, because if the sound worked properly it would be marked improvement.Aside from this main issue I've also had it freeze/fail to boot up occasionally, though as someone mentioned here in their review disconnecting it from the network seems to help.  There's also no way to quit one game and begin another without having to exit all the way back to the dashboard and reboot it which is retarded and just lazy on the developer's end.  In the end, one of the worst HD upgrades/compilations I've ever seen.  Unless you don't care for The Sands of Time at all and aren't going to be playing it, I don't recommend this at all.  If you haven't played any of the Sands games, hunt down the PS2 versions and pass this up.Sorry Ubi, I can't support such an effort.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2012"}

Choose any character from the single-player mode, designate players controlled with artificial intelligence, and customize the match's settings: starting arsenal, weapons available for pickup, health power-ups, and match duration.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"Good James Bond game","reviewText":"Rare couldn't hold onto the James Bond licensing rights forever and when it expired, EA Games jumped at the chance to be the next company to make the next James Bond game. They enlisted the help of Eurocom to develop The World is Not Enough and it was released to the Nintendo 64 in 2000. Based on the movie of the same name, James Bond is out to stop a terrorist who has nothing to lose from causing destruction. Choose from the main story mode (14 stages all based from the movie locations) or the multi-player mode (up to 4 players play against each other or in teams with customizable match options to boot.) Completing missions in the main story mode unlocks its equivalent in the multi-player mode and beating missions under a certain time limit and difficulty level unlocks multi-player characters and modifiers. After each mission is complete, you have the option to save your progress on a memory pack (if you don't, you'll lose any progress once you turn the game off.)The PROS: The fact that there are similarities between this game and Goldeneye 007 is not a coincidence: High production values, spot on controls, the way you unlock bonus content and 4 player support are what you'll find here that you saw first hand in Goldeneye 007. Like Rare, Eurocom took its time in making this game and that's one of the main reasons this game turned out good. Add in digitized speech from all of the main characters, expansion pak support (higher resolution & smoother graphics) and A.I. controlled bots for multi-player matches (a la Perfect Dark) and it makes it an even more enjoyable game to play. When you are done with the story mode, grab some friends for 4 player matches against each other or in teams. There are enough options to customize each match to your liking and it will keep you and your friends busy and it's fun too.The CONS: TWINE comes real close to duplicating the fun times players had with multi-player matches on Goldeneye. It just feels different this time around and there's an odd quirk thrown into the mix: every match cannot have all players use \"good\" characters; one person must pick an \"evil\" character before the game allows you to play. Why Eurocom programmed this stipulation into the multi-player mode is anyone's guess and shouldn't be there to begin with.While The World is Not Enough is not Goldeneye, it's a good James Bond game that surprised everyone. It's based on a good movie and follows it closely while packing in unlockable bonus content and a 4 player multi-player mode that makes it a worthwhile title for the N64. This one is worth owning and if you choose to get it, make sure you have a memory pack and an expansion pak (they will come in handy, no doubt.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2011"}

It sets a benchmark for third person role playing games. It is as close to a DVD movie as a video game can get, because, unlike most first person games, the player can see and hear the player character as well as the non-player characters. The dialog wheel is innovative. When used properly, it delivers a continuous dialog, without interruptions. I first played the male Commander Shepard as a soldier, in his heavy combat armor, lugging an arsenal of heavy weapons, and that was fun. Then I played the blonde hair, blue eye female Commander Shepard as a vanguard, in her form hugging light armor, wielding her light side arms and awesome biotic power, and, Leaping Lizard, that was ten times as much fun!

After giving 2 days to try this game, I decided to return it back to Gamestop.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2007"}
{"product_name":"B002I0H79C","description":"Gears of War 3","reviewerName":"Ferdy","summary":"Great Game  - I Wanted More!","reviewText":"Pretty much everything about Gears 3 is awesome.  The graphics are mind blowing.  The battles are epic.  The characters include all your old gearhead favs along with a few new additions.  The story is a fitting conclusion to the trilogy.  It has some sad moments and some good comic moments as well.  The scene when Cole Train returns to his old home stadium was one of my favorites.  There's not a lot that's new in the actual gameplay or weapons since Gears 2.  The biggest diffference is that now you must fight the Lambent and the Grubs who are living above ground since their underground homes were flooded.  I would say that my only complaint about the Campaign mode of the game is that it was too short.  I just felt like the end came way too soon and was too easy to get to.  There weren't enough big boss battles. I finished the whole campaign in about 6 hours or less.  I know the first two Gears games gave me more of a challenge than that. I do like the coop games where the Gears and grubs are taking each other on in a last man standing type of battle.  The game is a great deal of fun and it's a must have if you're a fan of the previous Gears of War games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2011"}

Best of the series.","reviewText":"Silent Hill 2 is a HUGE game - one of biggest on the PS2 with the longest playing time. It took me a few days to complete this game. Silent Hill 1 and 3 can be completed in less than a day. Silent Hill 1 is a PS1 game so the graphics and sound are a little lame by todays standards. Silent Hill 3 has the best graphics and sound but is nowhere near as close to Silent Hill 2 in terms of plot and length. If you are going to play one of the Silent Hill games then this is one to get. It comes on 2 DVDs!The game is psychologically driven and is part of the survival horror genre. It certainly does last with you a long time after you have finished playing it. The atmosphere is disturbing and the locations are amazing. Imagine walking around a deserted haunted town looking for your dead wife who may have returned from the dead. The game is sooo errrie and nerve-wrecking that it will have you sleeping with one eye open when you go to bed. It can be depressing at times and is a thoroughly soul-wrenching experience, but that is still entertainment! The game is also less guided than Silent Hill 1 and 3 and you can find yourself going in the wrong direction at times, but that is all part of the game play to make the experience more realistic. The monsters are ace, especially the thing with the cone on its head.This is a fantastic story driven game with very limited downsides (not enough weapons and lots of running back and forth across the map to get items) but it is still a must have! If you are looking for value for the money then Silent Hill 2 delivers in length. It is like playing a horror movie. Two thumbs up!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2003"}

It's cheap, customizable, and has a wide variety of games including: Mario 64 DS, Animal Crossing DS, Mario Kart DS, and theres even some unique games that take advantage of the touch screen more than the others like ER: Under the Knife. [...] And the Silver DS is better than the others because you can actually sand it and it turns white for a nice coat if you wanna paint it. I painted mine Gold before the 90 day warranty was up and it was okay. I now have the only Gold DS around. PIMPED OUT! The DS has some other really cool and unique features like an annoying sounding alarm clock so your children can wake up in the morning, You can customise your DS Screen Name for Wi-fi Play and even change the color of your menu's and of your name's background Color. A great tool for the go. I don't think they will do this but I think they should make special DS cards that have a Spanish - English Translator that takes advantage of the MICROPHONE and Touch screen built into it so you can Ace that Spanish test when No ones looking. Oh did I forget to mention that the DS's Games are conveniatly built like small 1'' by 1'' micro-chip like cards. And you can even have a GBA game inserted while a DS card is inserted for the Double the fun. Remember those old Link Cables from the Gameboy years? Well now it's completely wireless right from the start you get your ds because there is Wireless Connectivity with the DS.Cons are: Gameboy Color/GB games can no longer be played, You can't use Multiplayer on GBA games with the DS so in order to play multiplayer you'll need an older style of Gameboy, I blew my speakers out on mine somehow, After all these years Nintendo Still hasnt created technology that can withstand dust from going inside the screen, How gay, No Mp3 player, no PSP video, and I stuck normal sterio headphones in it once and after I used it without them the sound would't work anymore, Then I tried sticking the headphone jack in again and taking them out and it worked.

I congratulate them, other big companies like Activision, and other rising stars like Apple. Essentially, these large companies continue to spend virtually no time on real innovation. Most of their budgets are spent on marketing and paying executives big salaries. However, they continue to sucker all of you into paying for any new piece of garbage they throw at you simply because you're still in love with an IP that has died ages ago.Here is why I really congratulate them. 90% of you sheeple knew this game was going to be DRM, yet you complain over and over again on how it screwed you in the past. Most of you are familiar with the track record of companies like EA and Activision and how they tarnished great developers when they swallowed them up (Bioware, Maxxis, Infinity Ward, the list is endless). Knowing this, you still spend between $60 and $80 thinking it is going to be different this time, or not having the patience to wait a few days to see how things pan out. You basically have lost the ability to learn from your mistakes.When the next big game comes out from EA or Activision, many sheeple will still buy said game on day 1. Then they will again post on Amazon, Metacritic, gamefaqs, etc. on how much DRM sucks and how much EA is the anti-Christ.You see, EA, Activision, Ubisoft, etc. know this. Remember that they spend more money on marketing than R & D. In fact, they have a lot of smart people working \"R & D\" in marketing and do research on this. They know you will spend $60 bucks every year for Madden, Call of Duty, SimCity, Sims, Assassin's Creed, you name it; and they know you will settle for less. They know you will put in a pre-order at your local Game Stop or online to get some crappy worthless in-game content that amounts to no additional sweat off their backs, but incremental ways to secure upfront money.EA - I solute you. I wish I knew how to swindle people of huge amounts of money year after year like you do expertly.For the rest of you, for once, learn from this and remember. I NEVER buy a game on day 1; even for the IPs I love.  I wait to see what the sheeple have to say, what the critics write (keeping in mind that there is a conflict of interest when EA advertises on their websites) and weigh it out. I then vote with my wallet, a much more effective method to send a message than complaining on Amazon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2013"}

The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"Andy Tatnall","summary":"Don't let this game's looks fool you","reviewText":"Pikmin has got to be the most original and addictive game I've played in a really long time.

But I got it as an early Christmas present and have just beaten the Decepticon campaign and have played some multiplayer. This is the best of all of the Transformers games out yet. I have completely enjoyed the game.You get to play as both Decepticons and Autobots through 5 chapters each. And the chapters are nice and long. You don't have to complete a whole chapter at a time, you can stop anywhere in the middle and continue from a checkpoint later.The story is perfect. It really shows you what was going on before the Transformers came to earth. And yes, you get to play as both Megatron AND Optimus Prime in the campaign, though Optimus is not the leader... yet.The controls are excellent, very easy to remember. You can transform at any time, and you have separate ammo for robot mode and vehicle mode. They also did a good job of making the vehicles look alien, but still recognizable as each character, eg: Optimus Prime has a truck look, but not a human truck look. The characters also look just like the good old, first generation, cartoon, (in build, not graphics). The graphics are amazing on both the Transformers themselves, and the planet. As you go through the game you feel like you are on a real, live, alien planet. Which the planet really is \"alive\", as you go through the campaign you will see how the planet Cybertron moves and lives.There is multiplayer, too (though only on Xbox Live). Which is both versus, or co-op campaign with up to 3 people, including yourself.You can unlock new builds for your custom Transformers by completing the two campaigns as well. Your custom Transformers are used online. You can change their color, primary and secondary. You also choose their weapons, abilities and power ups, which you unlock more from ranking up online. There are four classes that you can customize separately: Scout, Leader, Scientist and Soldier. As well as unlocking the ability to make up to 3 of each class by leveling up. Each class levels up separately depending on which one you choose to play with. You get to choose any class and build every game, and you can change it mid-game.Once you reach level 25 in each of the 4 classes, you can activate \"Prime Mode\" which gives you a very cool animated icon next to your name online, so everyone can see. \"Prime Mode\" resets your rank in all of the classes and puts you back to level 1 in each. But, you get the icon as well as an achievement and respect from the other online gamers :)All in all, definitely buy Transformers: War for Cybertron.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2011"}

{"product_name":"B007XVTR3K","description":"","summary":"Once again comes up just a bit short","reviewText":"Campaign:Once again the COD franchise drops the ball on the campaign. They got it right back with World at War with the four player coop, but then for some reason they thought it would be a good idea to take it away in future iterations. That shameful trend continues here. They say they don't have cooperative campaign because it doesn't \"fit with the story.\" Let's call it what it is folks--lazy writing. If cooperative play doesn't fit with your story, you write a new one. Don't make excuses for it--you just didn't want ot do it. Having said that the campaign is short and moderately entertaining and I knocked off a star because it was, as usual, not quite what people deserve in a top tier game.Zombie Mode:I'll be honest, the only zombie mode that was ever any good was the original map on World At War; the one that started it all. EVERY ONE OF THEM AFTER THAT WAS GARBAGE. They kept trying to make it \"bigger and better\" and in the process they forgot what made the mode great. Instead of putting your back to a wall and fighting for your life, they added a bunch of moronic gimicks like having to run around and turn on power, etc. I was STUNNED to learn today that they actually seemed to have learned from their colossal blunder. They've adjusted some mechanics as optional, like the moronic hell hounds. There's no more running around and turning on stupid power switches. It's back to what made it great; fighting for your life with some friends. Guns are fantastic and they seem to be more generous with ammo. You can also adjust the difficulty which is a nice touch if you have a two man crew. The feel of the zombies is also akin to the original, where they start out weak and gradually get stronger. In the later maps they started out ridiculously strong and got stronger VERY fast. Instead of a nice hour to 90 minute match where you'd make it to level 20-28, they had made it twice as difficult and took the fun out of it. Thank you for not screwing this game mode up AGAIN.Multiplayer:This is where I have to knock them a little bit. Multiplayer is great and all that, but frankly I really enjoyed the combat training mode that they had last time. IT made for some fun and casual games where my buddies and I could play against some bots. They have expanded the options this time around, and allow all game modes to be played with bots. Nicely done!! But then they lose a step by not letting players level up in private matches against bots. Don't bother telling me how people could just level up against the easy bots in private matches and then play in regular multiplayer. There is an easy fix--do JUST what they did last time--if you play combat training privately, that is the only place your experience counts. Problem solved. For some reason they chose to take away that options. I'm sure they had some brilliant reason...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"Improved upon the GTV IV formula greatly ~","reviewText":"I won't get into details or even into the politics surrounding this game. Merely I will compare this to the previous couple of GTA games and list the improvements for those familiar with the series.+ Vehicle control is VASTLY improved over GTA4.  Not quite as 'fake' feeling as the super stable control of GTA SA and GTA VC though.  Which is also a plus.  Cars can lose control, but it doesn't feel like you're playing Mario Kart nor does it feel bouncy like you're playing Stunt Race FX (remember that one???)+ Improved story and characters.  Basically you have three characters with different personalities.  It's kind of a blend of previous GTA archetypes and personalities.  You have the young guy trying to make his way in the criminal underworld, you have the deranged nut job, and you have the ex-con with a family who is bored with life and decides to get back in the game.  Their stories cross and it makes for one of the more enjoyable main mission story lines in the GTA series.+ Improved missions.  I say this because you have mission checkpointing.  If you fail a mission you can continue at the last checkpoint (which means you won't have to do over those tedious parts if that applies to a particular mission - in other words, if you spend 20 minutes carefully setting bombs, then have to evade the cops afterwards, you won't restart the mission if you get caught by the cops, you would just restart at the checkpoint after you detonated the bombs).  You also have the option to cancel the mission.+ Character and vehicle graphics are improved.  Not a huge item of contention for most folks since GTA IV looked really good.  But the character models are better quality and they are much better articulated.  You actually have them moving like real people and even their fingers move independently.  Facial expressions are much improved as well.  People have more than the basic emotions - their eyes follow others and they react realistically.  Cars also have more pop.  The lines are cleaner and there is much more detail to the vehicles.  Many you can actually tell what car or combination of cars they resemble in real life.  It's always fun trying to outrun cops in the car based on a Prius!+ Banter!  This one I really enjoy.  Previous games have included a bit, but this is really the first game where the characters truly interact while on missions.  And it's not conversation that MUST be heard to advance the game, instead it's a little commentary that adds fun.  It also depends on what actions you the player take.  For example, when Michael's son gets in the car he changes the station to rap.  If you then change the station or turn off the radio he whines and calls Michael an a-hole.+ Huge open world.  And I mean HUGE!  It's similar to GTA SA - well, because it's based on Los Angeles.  There are many familiar landmarks and buildings.  The city has a similar shape, size, and layout - though there is much less sprawl.  But it feels very similar to being in the real deal.  Once you leave the main Los Santos area, the world is not as similar to the real thing.  The outlying areas are not just empty swaths.  There is a lot to do out and about in the hinterlands.  Rampages, dirtbike and ATV races, even a few extra missions.+ Virtually no catastrophic bugs.  There are the regular little glitches and bugs.  But I haven't had any of the Skyrim style bugs that force you to shut down and restart the game.  Mostly just getting stuck somewhere (which isn't too bad as long as you can self grenade).  But I never got stuck anywhere I couldn't get out of.  There are a few interesting little graphical effects, such as people crashing cars in odd ways... but you can't really complain about these things.  The game is insanely detailed and I can forgive a few glitches that don't cause me to lose hours of game play by forced restarts.  25% through and not a single restart!+ Forthcoming GTA online.  I am looking forward to playing in the GTA world with friends.  And for free!  How sweet of a deal is that?  I'll update after they launch on October 1.So until my next few updates, enjoy!  I know folks will either love or hate this game.  But it's amazing and a vast improvement IMHO on GTA IV.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7S","description":"","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Ahh Max... what a pain!","reviewText":"I was a massive MP 1 fan and played it though multiple times. And although MP2 had its annoying moments (Batboy costume!) the introduction of ragdoll physics in MP 2 pushed the MP franchise up a notch. And finally, after a dire movie, we have Max Payne 3.And... well it's just not very good. I'll explain: firstly there are massively long cut-scenes here, I think my controller went to sleep a couple of times or perhaps I did. Now don't get me wrong, they're incredibly well directed and acted and surpass the movie for intensity and story by a long chalk. But I bought a video game not a movie, however great it may be, and ten minutes watching a cut scene is rewarded by having around four bad guys to kill followed by yet another cut scene - it just gets old really fast. And a cut scene can appear at any time, not just at the end of a mission. And the biggest crime of all is that you will probably not be in the position that you were just a moment ago. For example, early on you have a bad guy tied to a chair and there's some dialog between your cohort and him. After a while a tiny cut scene appears of a guy kicking open a door and opening fire. Now even though I hadn't moved I was suddenly in the middle of the room having quite a few holes pumped into me. It did in fact matter not where I stood as I would be transported to the center of the room the moment the little cut away ends.There's other gripes too as Max will randomly switch weapons after a scene just to make it that much harder. And boy this game is hard. with very little to no spare ammo, hardly any pain pills and rock hard enemies that take many shots to down. They're armed with an AI that consists of 'hang back for five minutes then run in when you're out of ammo'. Auto lock on must be employed to really make any headway in MP3 which renders bullet time pretty much unnecessary. Gone are the cool reasons for using the side-ways slow down dive move as you're better off running in a room and hitting left trigger to lock on and then firing over and over. I just felt the game was fighting me every step of the way for any enjoyment and not in 'oooh this is hard but cool' way but in a 'so, I'm out of ammo and options again trapped behind some cover so I may as well just go ahead and die and watch that cut scene again'. Sigh.The game doesn't even let you explore the locations. The very first mission was automatically failed simply because I didn't apparently immediately run in a straight line to the end despite the game prompting me to look for clues every where.I really don't know what to add. I bought the game, played it and just disliked it immensely. That in itself doesn't mean it's a bad game and clearly by the current high rating it has I'm in the minority, but I would urge a rental for old-school PC Max Payne fans.You may not like the direction of the game - even though the direction of the many, many cut scenes is admittedly superb.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2012"}

I have this wired controller which I use for PC gaming and they work great. I have never had any problems with them. What matters to me the most is response.

The next thing that I consider is comfort and I love the way that these controllers feel in my hands. I have used other brands which left callous on my hands from extended use. These do not do that. Another thing that I like with these controllers is the dual analog sticks which to me is a requirement as many games do not work well with purely digital controls.

As Mario Brothers has already been released repeatedly on the Game boy, Super Mario Brothers 3 is the real draw. And what a game it is.Super Mario Brothers 3 was originally released for the NES in the early 1990s. It went back to the original Super Mario Brothers side-scrolling formula, and added a great deal. It's all perfectly recreated here, with improved graphics and sound (save for the \"voice acting,\" which is unnecessary but not a true hindrance). The game is expansive, with a lot of different suits and many different options. The world map and warp whistles allow you to hop from one stage to another quickly, or you can play through the whole thing, possibly discovering things that got missed in the original.The availability of a save feature is the big draw here. The original game didn't have one, and so it was usually necessary to warp past worlds if you wanted to win the game. Now, you can take your time and enjoy the variety and fun of every stage, although you can still warp past ones you'd prefer to avoid.

And, worst of all, the Helghans know exactly how to use the planet against you.The in-your-face perspective comes to life as you take aim with exotic new weapons and mainstays from the previous games, including the M82-G assault rifle.

While I admit the trailers looked graphically stunning, the idea of another shooter where I shoot at enemies with a bunch of AI helpers was starting to get a little...old. However since I have a PS3 and a significantly smaller game library compared to my Xbox 360 library, I thought I'd give it a go since practically every PS3 owner will. However the more time I spent with the game, the more that certain issues started to creep up that never seemed to go away. Keep in mind, I wanted to love this game but the things the game does, well...I just couldn't wholeheartedly.Story: Seeing as how I never played the original, this is just going off the story found in this one. The ISA (Interplanetary Strategic Alliance) has decided to launch an offensive on the Helghast planet of Helghan and capture their leader, Scolar Visari. You play as Sev and go deep into the enemy stronghold/city of Pyrrhus to hopefully cripple the Helghast and become the victor.From a pacing standpoint, Killzone 2's story excels as the big firefights with you and your partner Garza will be mixed in with larger firefights involving your whole squad, turret guns, tanks and the like. But the characters are rather two-dimensional and aren't really given that much time to show depth. This is a balls-to-the-wall war game so it leaves all that sissy \"character development\" at home.Graphics: Right from that first trailer, everyone was floored at the visuals of the game and really showed people the power of the Playstation 3. Playing through the actual game reveals just as much attention to detail and a real sense of atmosphere. This is probably one of the more grimier and all-around colorless shooters around since it just looks so unfriendly. Enemy animations upon death are quite well-done as well (though their poking their heads out when they're in cover's funny) and character animations and designs are great as well. It also starts with a long and awesome cinematic movie meant to look like it was one shot. Kubrick would be proud...if he liked this kind of thing.Sound/Music: Like many war shooters, Killzone 2's sound is quite phenomenal and the all-around chaos of the battlefield really immerses you and makes you paranoid that an enemy is just waiting to take you down. Explosions and gunfire have a great kick and the score is frequently cinematic and scope and fits perfectly with the level. On the voice acting side, the Helghast's frequent yelling and swearing is amusing though your buddies seem to have a large love for profanity as \"s**t\" and \"f**k\" and variations thereof are frequently blurted out. All in all, everything about the sound and music is well-done but the voice acting is just...iffy.Gameplay: As anyone who's been in war will tell you, it helps to have a really solid team backing you up. Since you help them, they'll help you and stick together, and you win. What impressed me about the AI in Call of Duty IV is that they seemed to kill enemies a lot quicker than I could with my bullet already hitting a dead body. However, in this game the Helghast are fast and furious and your guys? Unhelpful is the word. I can't count how many times I was killed by an enemy they should've killed already. Or when we get ambushed only instead of taking cover, they just run around and stand there and occasionally do a 3-round burst while I'm doing all the legwork. Not to mention some of the level design makes it impossible to adequately take on the enemy. More often than not, I couldn't find a decent place to take cover since it left me exposed to a different group, moving only exposed me to a separate group whereas in games like Call of Duty or Gears of War the level design made it so that it was a reasonable challenge. Here it almost seems unfair. Add to that there's no visual indicator where you're shot so you can go \"oh okay, the enemy's on my right\" and several times I'd die and go \"where the hell was the guy anyway?\" I don't want to completely naysay the game on these parts but honestly I can't think of the game and not think of these issues.The other issue people have is in regards to the controls which have a weird sense of weight to them and almost feel sluggish. To a certain extent I agree and unlike other FPS games, I never felt \"comfortable\" playing this character where movements were natural. The default setting is a bit strange as well such as being in cover holding L2, leaning to the left or right and pushing in the right analog to aim down the sight which would be okay but I prefer others where you aim using the LT/L2 and fire with RT/R2. Then there's the Circle button acting as your action prompt, the ladder crawls, bomb plantings and such. Whereas in other FPS games this is a dual-layered button with usually X or Square acting not only as reload but action prompts but also the \"use item\" button. Having melee moved to L1 is a bit different and not as natural as using the Circle or B button on 360 games. Oh yeah and firing a sniper rifle? You have to press in the analog and instead of pressing it again to zoom closer, you have to press Up on the D-pad. While you can change button layouts, it's just not a very intuitive control scheme, particularly when other FPS' seem to have perfected them.Is there fun in the game? Of course since the gun battles are frequently intense and adrenaline-pumping but the real meat is in the multiplayer. Unlike other multiplayer games such as the Darkness and the recent Riddick game seem to have multiplayer just for the sake of having multiplayer, Killzone 2's MP and its community make it a worthy return-to along the Halo's and Call of Duty's since it's quite fun and probably get more enjoyment out of this mode than the single player. What the multiplayer in Killzone 2 boils down to is its use of badges, or essentially, classes. Want to bring people back to life so they don't respawn at the other end of the map? Be a medic. Want to set up defensive turrets or even repair the standing ones? Be an engineer. Prefer being sneaky and disguise yourself as a member of the other team? Saboteur. And personal favorite, the Scout, which can turn invisible if you don't move and comes equipped with a sniper rifle so you can snipe people halfway across the map and they'll go \"who the hell shot me?\"My one complaint is the requirements to get the additional abilities. At times you might find yourself unable to meet the requirements to get the ribbons because not enough people died by a certain thing such as a flying drone or turret etc, I haven't even made a dent in the Close Quarters one which needs a certain amount of melee kills while assassination kills are usually taken by another member of your team or they survive. Also it's not like you level up one class individually, they have to be earned with the Scout being way at the end. It might make some matches not as fun since you can be up against several snipers who have better abilities/set-ups than you do.Looking at Killzone 2 as a PS3 exclusive makes it a noteworthy game to the Playstation 3's library but as a game I just couldn't get into it as much as I want to. Despite this I'm giving it a 4 star rating since the amount of time and care the game developers took for the game as well as the multiplayer makes it good enough to play but I don't know, guess I was just expecting this to be an absolutely stellar game. Instead, it's just good to great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2009"}

In my book, it's probably one of the funnest Mario games to play...in my top 5 list probably. Most Mario games are pretty fun, but I love certain ones better than others. There is a mixture of elements in various areas from several different Mario games in this...dating as far back as even the original Mario Brothers, and the levels in general are set in the style of Mario 64...open world levels that you can run around in. Each of the levels, however, also contains things from other games. As an example, a couple of the boss levels so far have been on revamps of the air ships from Super Mario Brothers 3 on Nintendo. The very 1st boss level in the 1st world is against Bowser right away...very much liked how that was set up. You run along avoiding his fireballs from afar off in the background, and you wind your way over and up, over and up, and then around to face him. He blocks the way a bit and you have to jump over his fireballs as he shoots them, but then the 3rd time he'll jump, he'll land to the side a little and you can sneak past him. (Don't try to jump over him...it won't work. He's too big). He'll jump back in front of you when you run, but after a couple of cycles, you'll get by and you can drop him into the lava. There...there's my helping hand for those of you about to start playing it. ;-) The game hasn't been too ridiculously difficult so far like a few Mario Games have gotten, but challenging enough to not be boring. The controls handle well...no qualms there. There are a mixture of different classic power ups in this game, but also the addition of the boomerang Mario, which seems pretty cool, though I have not yet come across that power up yet, but from what I've seen online it looks like a pretty cool power up. I am unaware if there are any other new powerups in this game yet, but I believe the boomerang one is the only one thus far. All in all, from what I've played, this is an amazing Mario game and sure to please any Mario fan out there. If you have a 3DS, pick it up!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2011"}

It had a good story which is very very rare in games and it was very old school with heavy metal music, Megatron trying to enslave all the transformers and Prime as the reluctant but great leader.  This is the real deal.  If it was a book, I would read it.  But as a game it is also great because I got to be a part of it and at the end I can make my own autobot and fight on line.  I loved the gameplay, weapons, all the voice actors save Starscream were from the 80s cartoon or did a great job at recreating the voices and lines.  There was so much focus or the story and so many people forget that it was the stories that made the Tranformers great.  It was for kids but it clearly defines good and evil and in the animated movie it really defines good and evil and the people who did this game got it.  I purchased it new and I will happily buy another one new if one is made.  If I had children I would let them play this game.  I would also let them watch porn before I would let them watch the live action TF movies.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2010"}

The graphics and gameplay are actually better than most xbox 360 games.  The gameplay is amazing, and you can really see where call of duty 4 was heavily influenced by this game.  The game is not long, and it kind of skimps on story, but it is still a powerhouse.  Just like the call of duty franchise, it has a way of pitting you against a few enemy types from beginning to end, yet somehow making the gameplay extremely varied,  and keeping you wondering what is coming next.  This is done through the use of weapon types (Sniper rifles, grenade launchers, magnum, etc.), environment variation (minefields, destructible environments), and many mission objectives.  This game was released in 2006, and to date there are only a handful of FPS's, or any games for that matter, that I would rate higher.  If I had to rate this game between 1 and 10, I'd have to be fair and give it an 8 by modern standards, because we are comparing it to games like Mass effect 2 and modern warfare 2.  But for a 2006 ps-2 era game, it deserves an 11 out of 10.

{"product_name":"B00002STH5","description":"It's taken a while to get here, but Nintendo's 64-bit update to the old SNES classic, F-Zero, is here. F-Zero X is a stunning achievement in that it's truly the first racing game that runs at a brisk 60 frames per second, even in multiplayer. In fact, more than anything else, it is this feature that is F-Zero X's claim to fame. Does the rest of the game stack up? Well, it depends on what you're looking for.Instead of trying to compare it to its 16-bit counterpart, we'll dissect F-Zero X purely on its own merits. After all, the bar has been raised for racing games in general over the past few years. So what does the game have to offer? Well, first of all, forget any kind of simulation aspects. This is twitch gaming at its best. Although you can tinker with the basics, like acceleration and speed, that's about all you get to do. Everything else is just about driving. Playing like a Wipeout without weapons (which was like playing F-Zero with weapons), F-Zero X's only added enhancements are the inclusion of dash plates located at various points around the track. When you run over one of these plates, you get a severe speed boost that doesn't cost you any energy (after the second lap, you get boost power that you can use at any time, but it takes away some of your energy), enabling you to blast past some of your opponents. However, they too can use these plates.That's not to say that you can't dispose of your opponents though. By using the Z-button or the right shoulder button you can either crash into your opponent making his energy meter drop, causing him to explode if his meter is low enough. Or, you can try to shove him off the track if there is no barrier keeping you in. A number of play modes are available, including practice, death race, time attack, and vs. battle. However, the majority of the racing will be done in the grand prix mode, where the cup levels await. Each cup increases in difficulty, naturally, but with each additional level conquered, more and more racers are made available to you, adding replay incentive. If you make it to the final secret cup, you'll uncover a random track generator that offers you a fresh challenge every time.So what's the problem with F-Zero X? For starters, with up to 30 different racers onscreen at any given point, some sacrifices had to be made in order to keep the insane frame rate so high. Polygon counts on the vehicles are very low, giving them a particularly uninspiring look. The track detail is also very limited, giving the track a spartan feel to it. In its defense, the tracks are cleverly designed, especially the twisty corkscrew tracks that speed by at a blazing pace. One feature that's lacking is a first-person view. If speed was truly supposed to be on display here, a cockpit view would definitely have helped, but alas, there is none to be found. Control is pretty good, although the analog stick can be kind of touchy in places, leading to a few inadvertent fender benders. The sound effects are very good and actually add to the feeling of speed in the game. Unfortunately, the music can be pretty annoying in a cheesy synthesized-metal kind of way and doesn't really add much to the whole experience.As a game, F-Zero X is certainly thorough in its execution; unfortunately, there just seems to be very little in the game to keep you coming back. Sure, Nintendo incorporated all those funky characters to give it... um... character, but the game erases all that good stuff with its overwhelming blandness. Yes, the game can be fun in multiplayer, being supersonic and all that, but the game just lacks those certain intangibles that make a good game great. Practically flawless from a technical standpoint, the biggest thing missing from F-Zero X is that it lacks a soul. It's yet another stunning update to the legendary Nintendo catalog, but it's games like this that make you wonder: Where's Metroid 64 or Donkey Kong 64?

The moment I popped RE5 in my PS3 I was immediately underwhelmed by the game play.  Visually it was stunning, not doubts there.  Maybe I've been spoiled by Gears of War and Uncharted.  The ability to run and gun adds an extra dimension to game play that every other 3rd person or 1st person shooter provides these days (you can't do that in RE5).  Realistically, I'm not going to stand there and try to shoot zombies as they come after me.  I'm going to keep moving while I'm shooting to keep them away from me.  Duh.  I guess I can understand why Capcom wanted to keep some of the same elements from previous games to satisfy fans, but it's time to evolve.There is little to no scare factor in this game.  When I first started playing and had my character walk down various streets I waited in anticipation for monsters to jump out at me.  That didn't happen.  I could see the zombies coming from a mile away.  Yawn.A lot of other troublesome details have already been described by other reviewers, so I won't droan on about them.

I just haven't seen it yet.  This game is worth playing, but it's one of the few where I got bored with it right in the middle of the action and just decided to shut it off and take it off my wish list. My big complaint is that the story is fun, the voice acting is great (I LOVE the \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\" style of narration from Stan Lee) but the game play seems the same as previous games and has the same quirks that turn me off from all of them.I wish there was a button you pushed to indicate you wanted to crawl on a wall.  I hate getting ready for an action only to get to close to a wall and end up spazzing out and crawling around in circles trying to get back to where I was before.  The drawback in this game is that in stealth mode if you step into the light it's all over and it's SO easy to get \"caught\" up on a wall and end up in a spotlight.  Also, the zip line in this game seems to be a bit off.  Half the time when I'm trying to zip up to a perch I end up swinging along the ground instead.This game just doesn't do it for me.  It's way too much swinging around while camera angles spin like they are on a gyroscope, sticking to things you don't want to stick to and repeated one liners over and over again.I'm holding out for THE Spider-Man game (similar to Arkham Asylum in that it just won't be able to be topped).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0021TVYCG","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Inomplete (formerly titled \"We're loving it\")","reviewText":"UPDATE:Sadly, my review (see below) has to be downgraded down from the initial 5 stars (I love it) to a neutral 3 star (meaning \"It's Okay\").Everything I wrote below is still valid but, as I kept playing, it became increasingly clear that 2W2 was rushed to market before it was finished:- About half of the land mass is out of reach. You simply can't get there, the makers made sure to surround it all with tall mountains.- As you progress through the chapters, and each chapter is loosely associated to one of the world's 'islands', you move from densely populated, quest-rich lands to increasingly empty, more barren landscapes with few quests to complete, the last islands, the largest of them all, being 90% off limits.- Neat features such as 'sailing' go largely unfulfilled. Strangely, there is no commerce between the several islands and, once you find the only boat you can actually sail, there's really no place to go.- My 60 hours of play (I play slow so expect a 40-hour run for most) produced a most powerful character, armed with the most fearsome and cool-looking weapons, wearing a near-impenetrable armor. Sadly, it also produced an empty world. Everybody and everything that I could fight other than a couple of cats and ants is dead now so there's nothing to do other than kill 'guards' which gets boring fast.- I will not discuss the plot but I will say that end-game could have been scripted better.And, finally, the online mode is unplayable. It's extremely frustrating to learn that, after all this 'work' developing your in-game character, making him powerful, skilled and well equipped, to learn that you can't use it online. You are supposed to create a 'new' character or several characters 'from scratch'. Why? Nobody knows but I didn't feel compelled to even try 'online'.So, it's 'goodbye TW2. It was a nice game for the first 30-40 hours but I expected more. Overall, it's not a bad game but it could have been A LOT better. The way it is now, only mediocre. If I knew what I know now, I would not have bought the game._____________________________________________________________MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:As I am playing Two Worlds 2 (TW2 for the rest of this review) and enjoying every minute of it, I can't help but compare it with similar past and present RPGs. I'm thinking of Oblivion, the Fallout series, Demon's Souls and keep dreaming about the 'perfect' RPG. And the reality of TW2 seems to suggest that, given the technology and the reality of a budget, this is probably as good as we are likely to get, at least for a while.Two Worlds 2 is far from a perfect RPG. It follows the open world RPG conventions and expectations in many ways but, clearly, some of its features could be called 'steps back'. At the same time, other features can be called brilliant innovations and stunning as far as RPG conventions and technical advances go. TW2 is clearly at or close to the top, considering whatever else is available today for the current generation of consoles. Without a question it is a playable, most intriguing, addictive game. I know this because the 3 RPG players in my household, me and my 2 teenage boys are keeping the PS3 up almost non-stop and reserving time to play nothing but TW2 for hours and hours and sharing tips and stories at the dinner table and at breakfast.I don't want to do unfair and biased comparisons but it's a fact that TW2 is nearly all we play at this time, meaning that we stopped playing 'New Vegas', I plated GT5 on a temporary hold at level 35 and two 24-hour races short of the ultimate trophy and Little Big Planet 2 is barely acknowledged by the kids these days. So, let's go into some specifics.THE TECHNICAL MERITWhen compared to the 'older' great Bethesda RPGs such as Oblivion and the 2 Fallout releases - and I call the Fallouts technically 'old' because they are built with basically the same tools used with Oblivion - TW2 shows significant and in some cases revolutionary improvements. And here they are, probably not a complete list.- Bugs-free. After over 100 hours of TW2 play (me, and the kids together) we haven't experienced one single 'freeze' or crash. Not even one. Other than one Baboon, floating 6 feet up in the air, no bugs I'm aware of.- Quick saves/load. There's no such a thing as 'near-instant' saves or 'loads' but, when compared to the Fallout titles, Oblivion or even the great Demon's Souls, TW2 load/saves times are fast. On a PS3 it's probably 1/3 the load/save time you would experience on New Vegas. And, unlike it, TW2 does not bother saving your game every time you enter a new house or cave which makes for a significantly smoother gaming experience. The 'auto saves' do slow down the action for a few seconds but it's up to you whether they happen every minute or every 10 minutes or every 20 minutes.- The savanna. The only comparison can be made with old Oblivion because Fallout's desert didn't require such a 'live' environment. If Oblivion's landscapes were stunning and I thought they were so at the time, Oblivion couldn't handle 'water' and 'fire' very well - game would slow down to a crawl and sometimes crash whenever there you had fire, lava or flowing water in the background. TW2 thrives on showing us what open plains look like. Walking or riding through TW2's great plains is almost a National Geographic experience. As for fires, waterfalls? No big thing.- Water. Probably one of the most stunning advances in TW2 is the Ocean. I showed TW2 to a couple of friends and the two things I showed them first was a Safari and then we went for a swim. After the Safari, with Cheetahs waiting in ambush in the grass or motionless and blending with the environment on top of  boulders bringing 'ooos'  and 'ahhhs', the swim experience left them speechless. I can't think of any other game in existence that does it better. Try it.- AI. Not all is brilliant and some of it is dumb but, whomever did the AI for the Cheetahs and the Warthogs and the Baboons should be congratulated. It's simply beautiful. The savanna animals and the rendering of the ocean are hints of what 'next generation' RPGs could be like.On the not-improved or 'not implemented' category that clearly fall under the technical/technology category, I was disappointed that something like Havoc's engine, so well integrated it Demon's Souls and to some extent in Oblivion and Fallout is nowhere to be found in TW2. With some few, well marked exceptions - swimming is one - you can't interact/change the environment much. Yes, you fight your enemies and there's blood (or green goo) splashing all over but you can't, for example, cut an arm or squish a but or push a boulder. Swimming looks great but, once you come out of the water you're as dry as you were before you got in it.Another little technical quirk is the 'voice' part. Not the acting which is good but, more often than not, the beginning or the end of statements appear to be cut off. It's like if you are playing a small sound file and whomever cut the clip did it in a hurry and missed a fraction of a second from at the beginning or at the end. It's probably what happened so, whomever did the sound editing did not do a very good job and it can be distracting.THE WORLD(s)I'm nowhere hear finishing the game (just reached level 26 and entered 'chapter two' at the time I'm writing this) but it's safe to say the the world is 'large' and there's plenty to do. I've mentioned already the great plains but, of course, there's a lot more in TW2. There are mountains to climb, deserts to explore, oceans to sail, caves and dungeons to... survive, farms, towns and cities to visit. TW2's underground features and its towns look a lot more organic than Oblivion's and Fallout's. In Oblivion it was easy to identify the Lego-like components used to build the dozens of dungeons and other structures. It's possible that TW2 has a limited number of building blocks but it's either so many we don't notice or there's some custom layer superimposed that's hiding them and everything feels a lot more realistic. You find individual houses, winding streets, commerce plazas and crowds of people going about their business in the towns and they really seem to resent you if you don't mind yours and bump into them  so if you hear screams of 'were you raised in a barn?' or a girl giggle when you don't control your walk too well, it's not personal.There is a lot to explore and experience on your errands. Once you visited a certain area, you can 'fast travel' after that if a teleport could be found and you can ride a horse if you don't mind missing the opportunity of doing a little hunting for beasts or 'monsters'. And, talking about beasts and monsters, there's plenty of them and you can make it your mission to rid the world of them. Some of the animals tend to respawn but most of the entities that fight back with weapons appear not to. Which is okay because there must be thousands of them.The 'people' are either of the kind that mind their own business and expect that you mind yours but, of course, there are merchants, artists, individuals that will interact with you in connection to one of your quests as either friends or enemies or bosses and the members of the several leagues: fighters, thieves, mages, merchants and so on. Your reputation or notoriety plays some part in the way people interact with you but it's the various leagues that tend to keep track of what you do for or against them and afford you some preferential treatment on that basis.THE STORYOh, the story. But, does it really matter? We like RPGs because the reward of completing quests and solving puzzles we become increasingly more powerful, get to wear cool armor and weapons, cast awesome spells and, as we progress, can successfully fight and defeat enemies that would have blown us to pieces with a sneeze at the beginning of the game. In that respect TW2 meets the expectations. You start weak, you learn about the world around, you do the quests and solve the puzzles and, as you do, you level up and get to wear the cool armor and use the cool weapons. Hopefully, you'll be able to save your sister and beat up all the bad guys - the Emperor - eventually but... you don't want THAT to happen too soon because RPGs are about the thrill of exploring, fighting, looting, learning and growing. I haven't finished the game so I'm not quite sure what the story is exactly about but... I can't say that I'm dying to find out at this time.THE RPG CONVENTIONSIt's not essential but it's probably interesting to mention the way some of what we call the RPG 'rules' or expectations are implementing in this game so, here they are, in a list format.Controversial-------------------- You don't eat, drink, sleep. Or you don't have to. And you never get tired, hungry or sleepy. Sure, there are potions and useful plant remedies but you could finish TW2 without ever taking a bite or drinking one drop of anything liquid.- Your apparel/weapons/armor don't wear out, don't break. Once you acquire a sword it will always be 'as good as new' for as long as you use it, no matter what you do with it. One of my kids says that you could mess up your weapon if you swing at a locked chest but I have to check that.- You don't tire while fighting. There is 'stamina' but it appears only to apply when you run or swim. During combat, you can swing your big half-ton battle hammer for as long as it takes and you'll never break a sweat.- There is no compass. There is a way to follow you path on the big map or the on-screen minimap but only the big map tells you which way is North. In-game, what you get is a GPS-like view.- There are no set classes. This has been much discussed and it doesn't bother me a lot. You are going to naturally pick a mage-like or a fighter-like path and I doubt it's possible to build a powerful character unless you pick one. Trader, necromancer, thief... these are secondary past times but you probably must specialize in either brute-force or spell-casting.- Skill reset. This bothers me a lot more than the above. TW2, or one of the NPCs in it will allow you to basically reconstruct yourself and redistribute nearly all of your skill points. In other words, you can spend dozens of hours to build yourself as the fiercest sword fighter in the land and, for a small fee, you can turn yourself into an arch-mage.- Health regeneration. This is something that we've seen in the older RPG but not in the more recent ones. In TW2 your health comes back and even you 'poisoned' status goes away for as long as you are not in combat with your weapon drawn.- No weather. There is some day/night transition and what seem to be 'morning mists' but that's it. No rain, snow or wind experienced so far.- Anything other than weapons and armor is weightless. You can carry 1,000 potions, bags full of medicinal roots, mutated hearts and giant scorpion poison glands and a one hundred volume library on your back and it won't slow you down one bit.Well Implemented--------------------------I enjoy the way TW2 did leveling. Each new level grants you a few more attribute and skill points. You get more skill points for doing 'things' like killing lots of animals or picking many locks or brewing a number of potions and so forth. Your level and your skills decide which weapons/armor you can wear. Skills must be first taught before you can assign point to them and skill books are either offered to you or you find them or you buy them if you can afford it.Weapons, armor, staffs, shoes can be upgraded if you have the proper skills, can be sold/bought or you can break them (again, if you have the skills) into their components to be used when updating other items. Depending of how upgraded your equipment is, you can attach to them various crystals and improve either attributes (strength, accuracy, will power) or skills (lock picking, blocking).Spells are cast with staffs which can be broken apart and upgraded as described above and are build each on separate spell cards where various spell modifiers interact to produce some very customized ones. Of course, you will need the skills. And, as a mage, you need to specialize in air/water/earth/fire or necromancy and acquire the related skills or maybe try to master them all.Combat is not as realistic as I hoped. Demon's Souls will continue to be the best and smoothest combat RPG I'm aware of but it's a great improvement over the Bethesda games. There is thrust, swing, block, block breaking and the game is quite responsive to controls. However, as I mentioned before, you never get tired so it's quite easy to stun an enemy and almost never give it a chance to fight back if you keep spamming your best move. The enemies do block you and they do try their own tricks so combat is good by comparison but it could be a lot better.MY RATINGIt's clear by now that, with all its shortcomings, this is a 5-star game for me because Amazon's 5-stars mean 'I love it'. Which I do. Clearly, there is no perfect RPG yet and TW2 comes with major shortcomings. However, overall, TW2 is a superior game which I expect to play for quite a few hundred hours, and I am not aware of anything compelling in the PS3 pipeline probably until Skyrim launches in the fall of 2011. Which is why I'm saying 'buy it' because these are big budget products and if the talented people who are giving us these great games can't be paid, no one will hire them to do the next great RPG.________________________________________________NOTES:Nothing on the 'online' features yet because we've been too busy with the story mode part so far and had no time for online. So far, the best online (combat) RPG I am aware of is Demon's Souls.Not part of this review but, here's my brief, head-to-head, one-sentence evaluation of the current major RPGs currently on the market.* OBLIVION - huge world, great story, good humor, major slowdowns on melee scenes involving multiple characters and/or flowing water/burning fires/lava, occasional crashes, lots of huge, mostly cookie-cutter dungeons and ruins, occasional crashes, long load/save times, auto-saves every time you pass through a door.* FALLOUT - world not as large as Oblivion, great story, great humor, buggy, terrible melee combat, crashes, short main story. Did I mention buggy? Long load/save times.* FALLOUT NEW VEGAS - world same size as the original fallout, OK humor, feels like a large FALLOUT DLC, even more bugs and crashes, longer load/save times, melee still bad.* DEMON'S SOULS - the best online integration in any console game so far, incredibly brutal, the best hand-to-hand/melee combat, bugs-free (one crash in over 600 hours of play), the 5 worlds are relatively small but all is polished to near-perfection, load/save times quite long.* TWO WORLDS 2 - not much of a story but enough quests to keep one busy for a long time, basic humor, incredible outdoors environment, okay melee, large world(s), addictive, open world but player is strongly steered through the plot, extremely good implementation of magic and weapons/armor forging but many shortcuts (see review), bugs-free, short load/save time.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2011"}

But as someone who logged weeks upon weeks of dedicated playtime to Fallout 3, I'm simply here to say I was disappointed with New Vegas.  I realize there is always going to be some repetition to be found in sequels, but FNV will have you feeling deja vu all over again.  I'll just make a list:* Same weapons?  Yep* Same initial town full of well-meaning, hard-working townies under siege?  Yep* Same \"crazy outlaws\" vs. the cliched forces of military good storyline?  Yep* Same washed out, post-apocalyptic color palette of yellows, browns, and grey?  Yep* Is there a good-hearted super-mutant to befriend?  Yep* Are there difficult enemies in the hills at night?  Yep* Is there a formerly useful structure taken over by ghouls that you are told to clear out?  Yep* Is there a friendly ghoul that loves the term \"smoothskin?\"  Yep* Raiders who you stumble upon that don't put up much of a fight?  Yep* The exact same interior graphics, that will make you think you've walked through them 100 times in Fallout 3?  Yep.* Same corny radio stations playing oddly catchy old-timey tunes?  Yep* Same skill-improvement system?  YepAnd that's just a dozen that come to mind immediately.  The only real difference in single-player mode is the reputation system which seems kinda cool, but actually ends up kinda dumb.  It's supposed to give you the feel of being able to ally yourself with any of the main factions, trouble is that once you tick somebody off & have finished all of the stuff they want you to do, it become very difficult to befriend them again.  And speaking of that, the storyline this time around is supposed to be mysterious, but just ends up murky & disjointed.  You barely give a damn about any of the factions, and every good deed you do for one ends up closing off paths you could have done for another, which artificially limits gameplay options.  Ultimately, software glitches aside, once you actually experience the world it ends up really looking like a hurry-up cash-in that must have taken all of a week to program, what with all of the recycled rehashed objects and monsters.The difficulty this time around seems a bit more advanced, and the game-world is larger, but the various portions that make up playing it really don't make me want to come back and play it any more.  I would suggest Red Dead Redemption if you want to play in a really interesting game-world that won't be giving you flashbacks to a better game every 5 minutes.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2010"}

Marshall \"Geoffrey Marshall\"","summary":"The one to get","reviewText":"If you're on a budget, are interested in gameplay over graphics, and want a variety of games to choose from, the PS2 is the system for you. The graphics on the PS2 is admittedly not as fancy as the Xbox, but considering that the PS2 is almost 5 years old, its graphics aren't exactly Commodore 64 style. Its versatility comes out as a DVD player of good order (I haven't had any problems with it yet) and you don't need to purchace extra stuff to make it work. You can purchase a DVD remote for it, but you can still watch DVDs with just the regular control. Some people may jabber about the Xbox's harddrive, I say \"so what?\" I don't know many people who have used all 8 megs of their memory card, and if you want to go to a friend's house, you just carry a small memory card rather than your entire bulky system.Also, the game library for the PS2 is much larger than that of the Xbox with better exclusives. The only \"must-buy\" exclusive for the Xbox is Halo, and no other game on that system has caught my interest. All the games i've seen on the Xbox look really good, but that's not enough after a while.So in a nutshell, if you have to have only one of these and you're not a hardcore gamer, the PS2 is the better choice.

Also keep in mind that this review IS coming from someone who has played the first, which many who played this one have apparently not played.---Minimal Spoiler Below/Major Spoilers for FIRST GAME---Story: The hero, who I swear had a name in the first game, is held captive by Gandohar, the antagonist of the first game. The heros sister, Kyra, is being used as a conduit for his magical energies and the hero is used to restore the energy Gandohar saps from Kyra. As the heros strength weakens and escape seems impossible, he is saved by an unlikely ally, the Orcs. With their help, he sets out to kill Gandohar and rescue Kyra.Graphics: The graphics aren't much different than that of Two Worlds, they are slightly improved, but barely so. There are little special effects in the game and are all in all rather bland and dull, but not terrible, they won't make you stop playing, but they won't stand out either.Controls: The controls have received a complete overhaul this time, you'll actually use more than just the trigger and a few button for combat. Skills can be allocated to various buttons making for much easier combat. This is one of the few areas that I felt were extremely well done compared to the first. Talking, buying, sneaking, blocking and everything else just feel so much easier than they did before.Music/voice: The voices in the previous Two Worlds were mediocre, but not terrible and sadly some of the better works done at that time. They are done much the same this time, the game still suffers from a seemingly lack of translation or mistranslated, meaning the character says one thing, but what appears in text is something different. Although not game destroying, can be annoying. Music is to the same effect as the previous title, quite and low while doing anything, but picks up when in combat (or maybe I just had the music turned down in the options....).Other: Multi-player makes its debut and, while populated, is generally filled with either modders, newbies or trolls. If you can find a community (the TW2 forums?) you can probably get a group to play with. There is a separate smaller story in MP, which is pretty fun and easy, a Versus and a sort of village builder. All worth checking out if you have access to them.Achievements: For those who like achievements, you'll need a group of at least 4 to do the versus and some of the co-op story, as it can be a pain without 4 people. Other than that, they are pretty easy, especially if you got 1,000 on Two Worlds.Pro:- MUCH better all around- Easier to play- Interesting storyCons:- Feels a bit dated- Unpolished in some areas- Bad Multi-player","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2013"}

The alien, the predator, and the marine are all there, with MORE. But when they added more they also took away. In AvP, when you were one of the species, the other species looked like they were made of similar graphics. In sierra's version, the marine was in full detail, complete with hacker's tool and shoulder lamp (which I like), but the aliens were weird little moving things and not as good as the original AvP, where the Alien looked like it was out of the movie. This game is from the creators of half-life and all those, so go figure._______________________________________________________Update:Full Game:But, it is a fun game, and long game-play due viewing the different storylines of 3 different playable species.The Predator: most fun of the 3 species to play, plenty of weapons, can jump really high (just like the movie, this was missing in Fox's version). Definitely gooood fun getting trophies, etc.Alien: very fast gameplay, and a lot of sneaking around and weird camera angles due to climbing all over the walls.Marine: very fun due to the weapons and tools and trying to help your buddies.The game saves as you go along, but you can also save whenever you want. (Kinda helps if there are facehuggers around).A def. positive of this game is the facehuggers don't spook the hell out of you by disappearing then wrapping around the monitor screen like in Fox's version. In this one you'll see/hear it leap towards your face.Definitely try this game out if you're an AvP fan. It stays true to the series/movies.

I am not fond of the platform genre that this game belongs to but I have played my share of platform games and this game does platforming to the best quality platforming can be done. For those of you not in the know platforming is basically games where you jump on level and land on enemies. Like Mario 64 and Mario Sunshine. I played both those games but I say this game beats them all when it comes to the controls of platforming. Jumping from one rope to another never felt so good. Mario frustrated me when i kept on missing where i was jumping. I gave up on both marios like I gave up on Croc and all other platformers. This game I did not give up on, I just had to return it to blockbuster. Now for the bad parts. May be too kiddy for some, but never bothered me any. I actually expected sly to be more masculine but he turned out my childish. But, again, didn't bother me. Also the world is somewhat constraned. Ok, its very condtrand. You have a set path, you go that away or backwards. There are areas where u can roam around like mario 64 and then go to warps to your next mission. The missions are the ones that are the liniar straight forward follow the path mission. They all usually involve getting a golden key to trigger something in the mission area room that will advance the story like going into a boss fight or going into another mission area. Now, the boss fights. Theres a dancing boss fight, I love this boss fight. You have to follow the beats ala DDR but it is not anywhere near the level of difficulty as ddr. But one mistake and you got to start over again. Thats another thing about this game, you get hit one time ur dead. Its not a bad thing, trust me, most things are easy enough to dodge and if you cnat dodge it that means there must be some way to get around it. The game is short. Though I never finished it it said i was 60% done. ANd i maybe spent wat?7 hours? Maybe less. Idk. But if you like platforming youll love this game and since its cheap you should buy it.

{"product_name":"B000G7PMXC","reviewerName":"A. Bush \"mechanical engineer\"","summary":"Really fun, and super slick!","reviewText":"Although I have played a fair number of various shooter games in the past, the older Rainbow Six series was not, and is not, something that I ever had a chance to try.  Hence, R6 Vegas was my first venture into the lineup, and I was definitely impressed.The premise of Rainbow Six, which derives from a Tom Clancy novel of the same name, is a team of highly skilled operatives, hailing from various NATO nations, who are assigned to stop terrorist attacks and subdue threats of that nature.  In the case of R6 Vegas, the threat is a group of terrorists who have laid siege to \"Sin City,\" largely as a diversion to a bigger scheme.  This game is a few years old, but if you haven't played it I won't spoil the ending, because it actually has a really good storyline.  More and more of today's games are beginning to have movie-like plots, and Rainbow Six Vegas delivers with an engaging tale.The real fun, though, is in the things you can DO in this game.  Obviously, shooting guns is the primary idea, since you are taking out terrorists, but there are some seriously slick action features that make your battles seem all the more intense and generally contribute to your feelings of being \"a total badass.\"  The first and most prominent is the cover system.  It's actually not really realistic, because you can't view yourself in third person in real life (needless to say), but it plays well into the game.  Rather than hiding behind something and strafing quickly back and forth to spot and shoot enemies without getting cut down yourself, you can pull the left trigger when near a wall, pole, door frame, box, car, or whatever, and your character (Logan Keller) will take cover behind it, cutting to a third person camera which allows you to see enemies over his shoulder.  While still holding the trigger, you can then pop out (which reverts you back to first person view) and, having aimed while in the third person perspective, quickly take out enemies one by one without getting killed.  That might sound like it makes the game too easy, but Ubisoft was sure to make the AI very tricky so that the experience wouldn't come off as a breeze.The second cool action move is rappelling.  Since Vegas is the main locale, there are lots of tall buildings, which you usually infiltrate by dropping onto the roof from a helicopter, so you sometimes need to rappel down the side by hooking your cable onto a railing.  The great part about rappelling is all the features you get (along with the realistic character movements, which is always a nice touch).  You can lower yourself down quickly by taking big jumps and letting out lots of line, or you can basically \"walk\" down, or even up, the rope.  Furthermore, you are equipped with your pistol while doing this, and can take out enemies inside while you are still hanging on the rope.  Finally, you can actually turn OVER so that you are hanging upside down, and continue to cap people.  I'm not sure how practical this is, but it looks awesome.  Its best use is probably shooting enemies by appearing just below the top of a window, so that they can't easily shoot you in return.Other nifty game aspects include the ability to put on or remove a silencer from your weapon at any time, various door entry commands which determine how your two teammates will handle the terrorists within (you can even look under the door with a snake camera and mark terrorists for immediate targeting by your team), and a full screen map overlay that you can activate, showing the locations of terrorists who are firing at you, or who your teammates have spotted.The visuals in R6 Vegas are spectacular.  I gathered that Ubisoft was using the game to show off a new graphics engine, or something like that, and it is definitely a win.  Vegas is, of course, a very glitzy, bright, busy location, and the game designers put a phenomenal amount of detail into their maps.  Ornate wall decor, hundreds of blinking, dinging slot machines, carpet details, and destructible furniture are all carefully reproduced.  In addition, character appearance and movements are very realistic.  The game also features a great musical score which makes the scenes more intense.I have not played this game online, but I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign and got some good replay value out of the terrorist hunt mode.  In addition, split screen play is possible and it's a nice touch.  The game generally tends toward large, arena-type battles, separated by mostly uneventful transitions.  The arenas are countless, ranging from slot machine parlors to a 3 story theater to a rooftop restaurant.  Various strategies can be employed, especially when the arena is a closed room which must be infiltrated (a classic example being a very challenging level inside the dining area of a fancy Chinese restaurant).The game isn't perfect, though, as few games ever are.  Most of my complaints relate to regular gameplay mechanics (as I don't play online).  You can't fire a pistol as fast as you can pull the trigger, as on Call of Duty.  There is absolutely no melee feature, which is quite a disappointment for close range combat.  The game features an all-too-common spawn triggering system which causes enemies to pop up from nowhere.  Your teammates have unlimited ammo, which is a bit sketchy (on the plus side, they are also very skilled).  You can't run, jump, or lie prone.  There are a few other tidbits as well, but they are mostly nitpick details.Overall, this game is great.  The environments are spectacular, the gameplay mechanics are clever, the plot is engaging, and the replay value is high.  It's definitely one for the collection, so don't miss out!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2010"}

This is Activision afterall, no reason to be surprised. However, i feel the developer made the best game they could, with the limited resources that were provided to them. Activision could have a great game on thier hands, if they were more proactive in supporting thier developer, and poured more money into this project. As far as the game goes, it's really fun. Though rough around the edges. Many have said that the visuals are 2006 era, and i would tend to agree. The game controls fine though, and i really enjoy the added emphasis on stealth, tactical thinking, resource management, and survival. I was afraid that this would end up being some generic Left for Dead knockoff, and i am happy to report that it isn't. The Dixon brothers are represnted well here. And it does introduce some interesting mechanics, namely the travel and survivor team systems. Some may have wanted multiplayer, but not every genre benefits from that. This is especially true with horror, it seems. I feel that Activision didn't really care if this game was good or not. They were just in it for the payday. This is basically a small victory for the developer. Who managed to make a decent game, without proper support from it's publisher.PROS:+ I really enjoyed the pacing of the game. Stealth and patience are encouraged during many sections. And when combat does heat up, it can be rather intense.+ Even though the game isn't very scary, it does rely on traditional survival horror elements. Such as resource management, and slower pacing.+ I preferred the emphasis on melee combat. Encounters felt more threatening, and finishing off walkers was satisfying.+ I am glad that the typical zombie assortment was left out. No spitters or bloaters, or whatever. It helped the game feel more realistic.+ Two actors from the AMC series reprise their roles.CONS:- The graphics are extremely dated. Some of these textures are simply butt ugly.- The enemy AI is less than brilliant. Granted, these are zombies we're talking about. But when you observe one spinning in place, or continuously walking into walls...you get the looming suspicion that this is a result of poor game design ;-).- The game can be a bit buggy, although it never locked up on me (cough... Fallout NV... cough).- Though there are some interesting concepts being utilized here, most feel half backed. I am referring to survivor management and supply raids, that are located off the beaten path. Usually in gas stations or campsites. If your lucky, maybe even a small town or school. I always had fun with these, but couldn't shake the feeling that more development time should have been devoted to this. I guess this could be said about the game as a whole though.- The story barely has a presence in this game. Don't expect anything near the quality of the tv series or comics.- Though this is technically a budget title, $50 is simply too expensive for this.VERDICT:I had a good time with this game, though problems are a plenty! If you can find it for cheap (no more than $20) and enjoy horror/zombie titles, then I can offer a mild recommendation.6/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2013"}

If you are one of these people then this game is definitely for you and highly recommended.  If you are on the fence in either category, here are the pros and cons of this game as I see them.Pros:* Genuine South Park, no censors.  This game looks, sounds and feels like anything that could have come from the mind and voices of Trey and Matt.  As a different reviewer has said, it's like mainlining an entire season of the show.* Funny.  Just like the show, if you like those kinds of jokes.* Gameplay.  The game isn't terribly deep but the mechanics work in the context of the story.* Tons of loot to collect* Decent number of sidequests* Can go back after completing the final quest to wrap up missing sidequests.  (Edit: Did get that final Chinpoko.)Cons:* Frame rate.  The PS3 version has noticeable frame rate dips whenever entering a new area can become very jittery at these times.  Doesn't really affect gameplay but you do wonder why it's happening since there really isn't that much going on onscreen.  Like it's very own homage to Dark Souls' Blighttown.* RPG lite.  There are a lot of different mechanics in the game, magic, different AI buddies to control, elements, summons, etc, but really all you need to do is equip the best stuff when you get it, mash the buttons, and randomly heal.* Have to reload summons.  They're only good once per day but if you use one you have to go and find that person again to reload him to your action wheel.  Kind of a pain.* Was not warned that I was entering the final mission.  Game is constantly asking you if you're ready to proceed - until that final dungeon/mission.  Ughh..1 chinpokemon left to collect.Debatable:* Length.  Finishing almost all the sidequests and I'm sitting at about 15hrs.  Maybe this is a positive in that you just played a fun/funny game and can move on or you feel gipped because that is waaayyyy shorter than most RPGs.* Tons of miss-able achievements/trophies.  Maybe this is a big deal maybe it isn't but very few trophies are story related and most are miss-able.  Trophy/Cheevo hounds should plan ahead.The game is definitely not perfect in many regards but the faults aren't catastrophic and if you're a fan of RPGs and South Park the show, then they're easy to overlook.

There are Practice (teaches basics), Play (teaches songs), and Session Modes (creates a band to play along with you) that provide a good degree of diversity, which keep this interesting.The selection of songs is quite varied and it was easy to find several that he likes.This is a great way to have fun while actually learning to play!Highly Recommended!CFH","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

PS2 wastes my time because its gone in to the world of disk read heaven. Xbox never has this problem unless your disk is dirty, and GTA double pack froze on me but only for the first 3 days of owning it. PS2 may have a wide selection of games but over half of them are rubbish. Xbox has less of the crap games. The graphics are better than the PS2, multiplayer is better, thanks to xbox live. There is a hard drive for xbox so you can borrow music of your friends and store it on to your hard drive as well as game saves(you can use a memory card to take data onto someone's xbox). The PS2 doesn't need a dvd controller but xbox does(people will often already have a dvd player anyway).I'm sick of people saying that xbox is bad because graphics are great and gameplay is more important. XBOX is the ultimate gaming system for action games, Ninja gaidan is one of the best action games available and it's only on xbox and oxm(official xbox magazine UK)gave it 9.2. It's one of the highest ratings along with SPLINTER CELL 2, HALO, MAX PAYE 2, PROJECT GOTHAM 2 and BLINX the time sweeper and more. Ninja G.... is so good that OXM said cast your mind back to when you kicked someone through a stained glassed window in DEAD OR ALIVE 2 and remember how thrilling it was, times it by a million times and Ninja.....delivers on thrills . Buy the xbox for that game.Check out these very good games that are coming out in the future on xbox, ADVENT RISING(action), Kill switch(shooting), manhunt(horror action),  Driv3r(formally named driver 3 and it's like GTA),  Full spectrum warrior(only on xbox, action),  Spider man 2, Burnout 3, Richard burn's rally, Fable(only on Xbox)(RPG),  Ghost recon 2(3rd person action), Halo 2(only on xbox), Pro evolution soccer, Break down(only on xbox, innovative 1st person shooter), Doom 3(only on xbox and PC), Dead or alive 4, Delter force black hawk down, Def jam vendetta 2(wrestling), Goldenye 2, Freedom fighters 2,  Half life 2(only on xbox and PC), Jade empire(RPG), Otogi 2, Prince of Percia 2, Quake 4, PSI ops, Starwars Kotor 2(RPG), True crime 2, Top spin 2, The Matrix,  Time splitters 3, Silent Hill 4 and Star craft ghost. BUY THE XBOX FOR THOSE GAMES and I didn't list all the games that are only for xbox.Don't believe anyone that says xbox is trash because play Tony Hawks under ground on Ps2 and the gameplay is sluggish and so are the graphics compared to the xbox. Splinter cell 1 first came to Xbox with great graphics and gameplay and 5 months or so later it came out on PS2, people saying graphics improved, wrong. All the developers did was add a few colours on PS2 and xbox still had the best lightining effects and so on. When ever there's a game that goes multy format, it'll usually be best on xbox and Soul calibre 2 is a prime example.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2004"}

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"Easy To Hate Seriously Flawed Main Character","reviewText":"SPOILERS ALERT - DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THE GAME. Obviously this game shows off the PS3 just before the PS4 takes over. It was fun and challenging, but not perfect as others claim IMO. First, the game is about as linear as it gets. And I mean that as: Everyone who plays this game finishes in the same exact spot. For a moral dilemma-type game, this is an obvious flaw. Why fight through 20 hours of gameplay and go clear across the country just so the GAME can make the final, most important decision for you? I'm surprised more players haven't complained about this...The story itself is also disturbing because from Naughty Dog's view, the post-apocalyptic USA has only a handful of individuals with any semblance of values. Meet someone new on your journey? Kill them. Walk onto someone else's property? Kill them and loot everything in sight. Soldiers, security guards, medical doctors...Kill them. It really doesn't matter who they are. If they survived long enough to meet you and your 14-yr old companion, then they're about to die...violently. And while we're supposed to care about Joel and share in his constant struggle to survive and deliver \"the package\", just how much can you care about someone as downright BRUTAL and morally-deprived as Joel? At times he seems to kill for the enjoyment of it, which is not any different from the \"hunters\" who gun down unarmed civilians and then leave like they're late for dinner after they can't find anything of value on the bodies. Joel is no Nathan Drake (by design). And that's exactly WHY The Last of Us is no Uncharted 3.There's also no reason for a 14-yr old girl to be as potty-mouthed as Ellie. And now your needless trek across the country has turned her into a robotic killing machine without remorse. Nice touch Naughty Dog.Everything else in the game is well done. The AI will frequently kill your character if you make a mistake. They kill you with one bite. They kill you with marksman quality shooting. The controls work well. The audio and video is superb (which is expected at this point of the PS3's life cycle). It does lose 1-star of FUN from me because of the constant scavenger hunt for basic supplies you need for crafting. This is severely overdone and time-consuming. You think you just played a 20-hr game when in reality you played a 10-hr game and spent 10 hours looking in nooks and crannies for scissors, alcohol, etc. Nothing exotic, just basic supplies. How disappointing...And you don't even get the Assault Rifle until the last 15 minutes of the game. What's up with that anyway?I realize it's only a game and it's a survival game in a dark future. But your character is charged with saving the human race, and that's not some trivial objective. However, Joel kills every human in sight, single-handedly dooms the human race to extinction and then thinks so little of it that his final words are the biggest lie in the game...and he SWEARS on it. Not the kind of stuff heroes are made of. If these are the same actions YOU would take if you were really put in these situations, then this is your game. If not, then it makes it difficult to immerse yourself in the character...or even like him. The POOR ENDING left me with the feeling I could have just stayed home and watched the grass grow from the front porch.They should have just named the game Kill Or Be Killed, because that's what it devolves into. The only reason it's named The Last Of Us is because your character failed the human race...and he doesn't even give a rat's ass about it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000930DOQ","description":"James Bond 007 : From Russia With Love will be the first game to put players in the universe of the classic James Bond films. Set in the original 60's Bond era, the game features movie-based missions as well as original, action-intensive sequences, a broad and deep variety of gameplay, fully-integrated vehicles, social multiplayer experiences, gorgeous women, and classic, upgradeable weapons and gadgetry with modern mechanics.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"The best Bond game since Goldeneye for the N64","reviewText":"Since EA acquired the James Bond license, the games that they've churned out have been less than spectacular.  This time around, they've went back to the basics here with From Russia With Love, based on the classic Bond film of the same name, with none other than the original Bond, Sean Connery, lending his voice as Agent 007.  First off, you'll notice that the environments, characters, and storyline are amazingly faithful to their source material.  Not to mention that the assortment of available gadgets is a great touch as well, including the Laser Watch, Q-copter, and of course, the jet-pack.  Visually, the game looks slick and amazing, but there's plenty that stops From Russia With Love from being as special as it should have been.  The controls can be loose at times, particularly during driving missions where they can be clunky, and the controls during the jet-pack sequences aren't much better.  The enemy AI isn't anything to write home about either, and as a whole the game is relatively simple and shouldn't take long to beat.  Despite it's drawbacks, there is a fun multi-player mode here if you have a multi-tap, but online capability would have been more than welcome in this department.  There is a horde of unlockables as well, and the fact that this is Sean Connery lending his voice as Bond is just so unbelievably cool that any Bond fan won't be able to afford to miss this.  All in all, From Russia With Love isn't the best action/platformer you'll play, but it's certainly the best Bond game since the classic Goldeneye for the Nintendo 64, and it's a must play for Bond fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00DHF39KS","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Just What The Doctor \"Order\"ed (Updated)","reviewText":"First-person shooters today are generally lame experiences. Unpopular opinion though it may be, it's still one that I stand by. Let's face it, ever since the first \"Modern Warfare\" hit the market, every big company has been trying to compete with Activision's juggernaut, which means tacking on multiplayer onto everything imaginable and cobbling together a story campaign in order to make the game a more complete package or vice versa. Unless, y'know, you count \"Titanfall,\" which just said \"screw it\" to the idea of a campaign and decided to charge full retail price for a multiplayer-only experience. It's very rare to see a developer actually care enough about a shooter to cut out multiplayer and focus on building a strong single-player mode with a compelling plot, interesting sets, and villains that go beyond \"people who aren't white\" or \"Russian people.\" Yet that's exactly Machine Games has given us in \"Wolfenstein: The New Order.\" Yeah, it's kind of sad that Nazis are a fresh idea in today's gaming landscape, but hey, I'll take what I can get.\"The New Order\" imagines a world in which the Nazis nuked the United States and effectively won World War II, allowing their war machine to take over the globe under the watchful eye of the sinister General Deathshead. Every major location in the world has been overtaken by the Nazis, making everything into a concrete-and-metal jungle. But one man won't go down without a fight. Cue one BJ Blazkowicz, longtime \"Wolfenstein\" protagonist and rugged soldier with a penchant for reflective inner monologues. In a coma for 16 years after a failed assault on Deathshead's base, he's out for blood, attempting to find a resistance against the Nazis and aid them in their efforts. With the aid of old friends, along with new partners such as his nurse of sixteen years and returning soldier from the middling 2009 entry, Caroline Becker, he'll take on cyborg dogs, giant robots, and an army of black-suited Nazis in order to get to his arch-nemesis and return order to the world.Say what you will about yet another game where a rugged white guy saves the world, but I found the premise and execution of \"The New Order\" to be quite spot-on. Blazkowicz is a really compelling protagonist, no longer the bland meathead he's been in past entries. He has a serious case of survivor's guilt, is a ticking emotional time bomb, and has some really clever and insightful things to say in his narration.. Not only that, but he's a funny and likable protagonist on top of that, with some of his quips and mannerisms aiding him in breaking the mold in terms of FPS protagonist. Sure, he's no Nathan Drake or Joel, but he fits the bill quite nicely.The rest of the narrative does, too. Surprisingly, the cast is pretty interesting, and the female characters avoid simply being sexy partners to ogle. They're pretty well-written and resourceful, which is a saving grace in a modern shooter, where it's usually a remarkable feat having any female characters to begin with. On top of this, the story is very, very compelling and executed with a cinematic flare that rivals most things trotted out by Hollywood these days. In my opinion, too many shooters today lazily rely on first-person cutscenes and in-between animations that consist of maps or codec screens, and seeing professional, well-executed cutscenes to drive the narrative forward is quite exciting. Conceptually, too, this game is interesting, taking a concept woefully squandered by \"Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,\" then doing something unique with it. Truly, the idea of a world in which the Nazis have overtaken everything and purged \"impure\" people out of society is horrifying, and to execute it with such panache and flare deserves serious commendation.It's very interesting, though, that I'm more taken by the narrative than I am the gameplay, which by and large is nothing to write home about. Granted, it's miles ahead of modern military shooters which have two weapon slots and an abundance of quick-time events, and that alone makes it worth recommending. At the same time, the actual shooting mechanics and weapon selection are a tad boring. Yes, blasting off Nazi limbs and decapitating troops while dual-wielding assault rifles is really satisfying, but I wish there were more diverse weaponry to utilize. Most weapons are things you've seen before, and while all of them have a degree of nice kick and control to them, I feel like a game with a premise of a world overtaken by Nazi technology would have more compelling tools of destruction to utilize. So while shooting things is fun and all at times, I just wish the gunplay and guns to kill with were a bit more creative.Yet at the same time, I can't help but to applaud the decision to have gameplay here so varied and open-ended. Many studios try and fail to provide a playground in which players can be set loose to approach situations with stealth, tactical warfare, or all out assault, but \"The New Order\" is one of the rare ones that I feel hits that beautiful sweet spot. The game never tells you what to do, or guides you in a specific direction, with the exception of some corridor segments. Instead, players are set down somewhere and told to do a certain thing, but not how to do it. Maybe you'll commandeer some turrets and blast apart a base, along with any reinforcements that pop up. Or maybe you'll dual-wield knives and crawl through that base, silently dispatching everyone and then going about your merry way. Will you sneak onto a watchtower and snipe enemies, or will you run in with a machine gun with the intent of turning them into Nazi Swiss cheese? The choice is yours, and depending on your actions, you'll get perks in certain skill trees. Yes, this is one of the rare games that rewards you based on your in-game actions, and tailors itself to your playstyle. It's a nice touch that prevents things from getting stale, unlike the useless upgrade function in the last entry.\"The New Order\" is a game that hearkens back to mid-90's shooters with stiff challenges and big maps, yet reminds me of modern games in the vein of \"Deus Ex: Human Revolution\" in the sense of its progression and sets of choices put in front of the player. Honestly, while it lacks polish in some areas such as weapon variety or some pretty questionable texturing at times, it's one of the better shooters I've played in a long while. The lighting effects are simply gorgeous, especially on current-gen systems, and the environments are fun to mess around in. Nazi AI is generally pretty dumb, but it's dumb in that way that makes the game really humorous and fun at times. Whatever glitches here are minimal, and the rare ones I've bumped into don't harm the game and actually add to a more fun, entertaining atmosphere. There's a certain satisfaction to playing a modern, pretty-looking game where hunting for medkits and running out ammo are common occurances. Very few games manage to mix old-school and modern sensibilities and pull it off, but that's exactly what Machine Games has done here.\"Wolfenstein: The New Order\" is not a perfect game, and indeed, there are some departments it could use some serious improvement in. Yet overall, it's a complete package that I would heartily recommend to most people. There's plenty of replay incentive, and a constant series of memorable set pieces that are a blast to, erm, blast through. From stealth missions to assaults, stabbing to exploding, this is the game people who are bored to death of modern shooter conventions have been waiting for. If you're not a fan of first-person shooters, then there's not much this game will do to win you over, but if you've been starved for something fresh since the adrenaline-shot of creativity that was \"Bulletstorm,\" then this'll fit the ticket quite nicely.And to think, they didn't even need to add on multiplayer. Your move, Activision and EA. Your move.Score: 8.75UPDATE (5/28/14): Having finally gone through the entirety of the campaign, I've elected to write a little bit more. The last few sets of levels are fantastic, and coupled with some narrative decisions that came out of left field and genuinely shocked me. The ending left me almost as breathless and shocked as that of \"The Last of Us,\" which is some of the highest praise I can heap onto a game. While I still have issues with the weapon selection and the basic shooting mechanics, I can safely say that this game is well worth your time, especially if you're looking for a plot that defies all expectations, and will certainly change the course of this venerable franchise forever.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2014"}

It was the year of the Super Nintendo, the return of a particular messiah.  It was Mario's moment.  I can still visualize the little toothless kid I was thundering from school, slamming the door on the way home, snatching the SNES controller, and directing Mario as my mom repeatedly chastised,  \"not so close to the TV!\"  I couldn't help it, at seven years old I was a gaming addict.  Eventually, my face drooped closer to the TV, and in a decade of eye-ball glazing, I can salute the GBA port of Super Mario World Advance in praise, for it sizes up to the same rewarding fulfillment of its SNES forefather.Processed with an effervescent graphical makeover, the GBA version exudes a nice blend of enhanced colors along with a slight pinch of detail.  Another touch in the range of additions are the revamped music and the short, cheery quirks from Mario.  Running on a higher resolution and opulent audio, Super Mario World Advance clocks in an indistinguishable experience to that of the SNES.  Received as a faithful port, all the bullet stomping, shell-kicking, invincible star rampaging, and all the other aspects of 2D at its finest stuffed me on the sofa, solely rapt like I was seven-year-old again.  Safe to say, in a decade later this 2D platforming masterpiece still lives in a prospect of excellence.  For those who actually missed Super Mario World on the SNES (shame on you) now is the time to be acquainted with the incredible classic everyone will be revisiting.In summary, Super Mario World Advance has the player rescue princess Toadstool from the clutches of the unrelenting turtle-villain known only as Bowser.  The player's path is to sweep through the seven vast worlds where movement takes place on dotted maps.  After a level is diced another dot becomes accessible and up until a castle is reached.  There a Koopaling (one of Bowser's children) awaits to be whitewashed in one of many ingenious ways.  Upon defeat, the next world opens and past levels may be incessantly replayed.  Super Mario World Advance plays in an almost non-linear tone.  Each world gushes out a great heap of secret and alternate directions.  Hidden stages are typically unlocked by finding a hard-to-spot finishing point.The colorful rebirth of Mario on the GBA remains intact, giving gamers-on-the-go a workout for the fingertips.  Yet, of all its memorable and rewarding facets, Super Mario World`s real boom was its new hero, Yoshi.  A dinosaur with one threatening tongue, Yoshi was ridden and used often.  His use for exposing secret stages were required, letting the player experiment and endlessly search for any missed areas.  With the option of handling a new and welcomed character, playing in an extensive quantity of levels, and almost non-linear gaming, gamers can see why this 2D groundbreaker help pave the way for an era of outstanding gaming.From the world-shattering 2D of Super Mario World to the revolutionary Mario64, Miyamoto has definitely set the fundamentals of the Platform genre.  And the genius who prearranged the re-releasing of Mario pastimes on the GBA is definitely a lucrative, and for the gaming audience, a grateful one.  The GBA's port stocks all the bouncing stars, the flaming flowers, the growing mushrooms, the floating capes, and every1-up the SNES kept.  Even if you have the original, the GBA one is still worth the weight loss of your wallet.  Completed with slight enhancements, an unlimited lasting appeal, and glistening with Nintendo quality, this is Super Mario World with the liberty to play anytime and anywhere.  Because sometimes it's just good to dwell on the past and into your gaming memories.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2002"}

Back then there weren't a ton of good games so even the mediocre ones seemed better.  After God of War came out and pretty much took this style of action game to a whole new level, I figured the DMC series was done for.  I recently bought this game because it was cheap and I'm trying to play as many PS3 games as I can, mainly to put off buying a PS4.  I was very surprised and glad to see that not only is it my favorite in the series but it also has a fresh bit of game play that doesn't feel like just an old game redone.  It also doesn't feel like a God of War rip-off.  You have your original swords and guns that the old games had with the addition of some new ones that you can switch to with little to no effort.  The way they allow you to switch to different weapons during game play gives you the potential of some great combos, whether you're trying to or just button-mashing.  Although, learning how and when to use each weapon will greatly add to your success and even vital to beat certain enemies and get through specific doorways.  The story is well written and adds a better depth than the older games did.  I'm more into RPGs these days so it's not the best game I've ever played but it's worth it for any fan of action games.  I know some people didn't care for it for whatever reason but if a game is fun, it's fun.  I play games everyday and I still don't get caught up in the little details that sometimes ruin games for people.  Unless a game is truly horrible, without a doubt, I enjoy when it's not exactly what I expected.  I don't understand why any fans of the original trilogy wouldn't like this one a lot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2014"}

Sleeping Dogs, Watch Dogs, what's gonna be next? Eating Dogs, Walking Dogs, Lap Dogs, Hot Dogs?Anyway, Watch Dogs is fun if you like sandbox games. Don't look for a lot of innovative gameplay or a radically new take on the genre. With the exception of invasive multi-player (more about that below), it's a mashup of a lot of stuff that has come before it.In video game math, we can say:Watch Dogs = Grand Theft Auto + Deus Ex + Max Payne(free roaming, multiple ways to beat missions, a super slo-mo powerup, lots of guns)Watch Dogs = Grand Theft Auto + Heavy Rain + Lizbeth Salander + Edward Snowden(gang warfare, a dark, disturbing, voyeuristic tone, hacking, conspiracies, NSA-type surveillance)Watch Dogs = Grand Theft Auto + Clockwork Orange + the Untouchables(carjacking, ultraviolence, Chicago)So if any of that turns your head, you'll probably dig Watch Dogs. Or if experiencing a deviant dystopia that is influenced by Orwell, Kafka, andGaitskillsounds cool, you'll like Watch Dogs.The feature that seems to have received the most hype is the persistent and invasive multi-player. You don't have to launch a special multi-player mode to have other, REAL people enter into your game. Unless you're involved in a mission, another player can try to hack you or tail you at any time. I've never been big into multi-player gaming so I can't say this makes or breaks Watch Dogs for me...but I do think it's an interesting way to keep the game constantly changing and challenging for everybody. The online car racing, on the other hand, is exactly like it is in other driving games. As usual, knowing the courses and their shortcuts throughly is the key to succeeding.Ubisoft could have done a few things better. First, the load times are atrocious on PlayStation3. Every time you die or fail a mission, it's a long wait for the game to reset itself. This takes you out of the game and breaks up the flow. The only game that was worse for this is Stuntman. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the same studio, Reflections, was involved in developing both games! Second, again possibly related to Reflections, driving is kind of a pain. Pretty much every vehicle is hard to control because of floaty, super squirrely, or unresponsive handling. Finally, the story and character development doesn't rise above typical videogame level. While the writing in Watch Dogs is no better or worse than in most games, Ubisoft could have taken more care with such a highly promoted, Triple-A release. None of these are showstoppers, though.Bottom line: Watch Dogs is a fun and, thanks to current events, highly topical game. It might make you paranoid as well. Four stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2014"}

The game play is the same as the Xbox One, and the graphics look just fine on the 360 with very little difference. Nice job from Bluepoint on the port.The environments are just as lush and crystal clear as the Xbox One version, with a slight edge going to the Xbox One when fighting in close quarters combat on some textures. But it's honestly so negligible that you really would have to be looking for it to notice it, and the game play is so fast paced that it's not even gonna cross your mind once the magic of the game play takes over. I have also not experienced any lag at all yet.This is a great game on either system.So should you still buy an Xbox One for Titanfall? That is dependent on how much those little differences make that I mentioned, and if you want to spend the $450-500.I have played Titanfall on both systems. It's great on both systems. If you are debating on getting an Xbox One just for Titanfall, and already own a 360, personally I would wait and get Titanfall for the 360.

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"Great Game","reviewText":"That's really all that needs to be said. This. Is. A. Great. Game.It is always a pleasure to play a game where a developer shows attention to the most minute detail. Naughty Dog has gone that extra mile in pretty much every aspect of this game, and has created one of the better single player action titles I've ever played. I'm not sure it's \"the bestest game that you could ever play in 10000 years!\" or all that, but if you find yourself disappointed with this game, I would say that the problem isn't Uncharted 2; it's you.The Good:Aesthetic: Everything about the presentation of this game screams devoted attention. Emotion is rendered excellent for the characters involved. The graphics are stellar - bright, vibrant colors fill the screen, but the artwork is still magnificent. The voice acting is some of the most solid I've seen in a game (and I've seen a lot of solid voice acting).Control: You have to love the targeting mechanism. Gun targeting is fluid and sensible. Hit detection is excellent. Movement is great. It is as much a joy to play as it is to watch.Difficulty: The difficulty is really well thought out. Do you want a somewhat relaxing journey? Easy is great. Do you want to test your skills? Go hard. There are measurable differences in difficulty here, and it's easy to find the one that best suits you.The (sort of) Bad:(Disclaimer: I yield myself to the criticism of nitpicking, but there are some things I found...strange in this one)Melee/Stealth: Without a doubt, the biggest weakness in the game is the melee combat. Unlike the simple perfection of, say, \"Arkham Asylum,\" \"Among Thieves\" is pretty stupid when it comes to bare-knuckle brawling. I mean, are you telling me that it takes 10+ shots from my AK-47 to bring down an enemy, but I can do it in three punches? Really?!?Stealth is another disappointment. I'm a stealth guy, and let's face it: were I Drake, fighting countless hordes of Russian sociopaths, I would do my best to stay out of their way, as opposed to, oh, going toe-to-toe with them! In this instance, it is just too hard to suspend disbelief. Case-in-point: I am going through a city on rooftops, making absurd jumps, until I decide to...fall to the ground and duke it out with around 15-20 armed Russians who are MOBBING me. It just doesn't make sense.Story: Lots of people have really praised the tale here. I'm not going to be one of them. While there is a good bit of detail given here, this is really run-of-the-mill \"DaVinci Code\" stuff with some \"Indiana Jones\" charisma. I do believe it is accurately compared to a summer blockbuster action movie. However, I rarely praise the story in those, and I'm not going to here. It's not really predictable, per se, but it's certainly not unfamiliar territory, by any stretch. I would have liked a little more daring here.That's it. In short, if you own a PS3, good news. This game (unlike \"MGS4\") is a great reason to own the system. Action, platforming and cinema have never felt so seamless (Hideo Kojima could take a hint at the excellent cinema presentation here, which draws you in without boring you to tears).

But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun.

The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"Sarah","summary":"All New Super Mario!","reviewText":"I've always loved Mario, as he evolved through the years from the NES to the SNES and the Nintendo 64 and the Gamecube and now the Wii.

There are all new power-ups: Penguin Suit, Freeze Flower, and the Propeller Mushroom, and also the Mini mushrooms, regular mushrooms, and the Fire flower. What makes the game outstanding besides all else I've mentioned is the fact that four people can all play the game at once. Since we had never all played Mario before all at once before, when we tried it we were laughing hysterically at the fact that your Yoshi can eat other players and jump on each others heads and try to kill each other. We didnt even care about winning the level it was so much fun. However its still a ton of fun to play by yourself.It took my sister and I about two months to finish, but now it would only take a couple of days. This is one of the best games for Wii there is!

{"product_name":"B0002Y2XXQ","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"A Great Surprise","reviewText":"Something that's tugged at the back of my mind for years now is the question of what, exactly, happened to the ingenuity, simplicity and sense of wonder that was traditionally associated with video games throughout the seventies, eighties and early nineties. There's no question, today's games are a much more detailed, beautiful, realistic and life-altering bunch than the titles that filled the SNES, NES and 2600. As a NES owner, you'd never get an experience quite like what Metal Gear Solid or Grand Theft Auto can give you today. You're afforded much more freedom on an Xbox than you were on a Sega Master System, everything's in crystal-clear high definition and the soundtracks routinely eat up several CDs all on their own. You take it for granted that Mario can fly, because that's just the way it's (almost) always been. To introduce a similarly outlandish game in this day and age where anything new is scrutinized by the overcritical eye of parents, teachers, internal boards, the media, the government, the FCC and, perhaps harshest of all, the critics is almost unthinkable.That's why I'm amazed a game like Katamari Damacy made it to our shores virtually untouched. This game's a throwback to the absent-minded titles of gaming's infancy, when everything didn't need to make sense under the restrictions of the Earth's gravitational pull, didn't need to abide by the dynamic lighting of the sun as it floats across the sky, and didn't send you on missions that would give a real life government operative nightmares. Things just happen in Katamari, and you accept them as fact because that's just they way they are.Basically, Katamari Damacy is a telling of the life of a dung beetle on a cosmic scale. You control \"The Prince,\" heir to an apparently galactic kingdom, as he rolls tiny, sticky balls called Katamaris around the Earth's floors, streets and continents. When you roll over something, the item sticks and the size of the Katamari snowballs. The size of your ball is directly proportionate to the size of the items you can pick up. If you're piloting a tiny trash heap, you're just gonna bounce off if you try to roll up a tree or a fencepost. Your Katamari usually starts small, barely large enough to roll up an acorn or thumbtack, (not to mention easily tossed aside by the numerous mice that roam the city streets) and slowly increases in size to the point where it's picking up cats, then large dogs, then children, adults, motorcycles, cars, wrestling rings, houses, office buildings, etc. The real star of this show is the incredible scale of the game, how nothing is off limits so long as your Katamari is big enough.And that's really all there is to the game. You get a time limit and a certain size that your Katamari ball must reach within that timeframe, you're dropped out onto the floor somewhere, and you just start rollin'. It's incredibly simple, yet indescribably inspirational. While it may sound lacking in depth and replay value, I dare you to spend an hour with this disc and then casually put it away. It's physically impossible. I've never been one to immediately replay a game after finishing it, but I did just that in Katamari. The only thing that'll keep you playing is the never-ending challenge to top your existing high scores... well, that and your need to constantly explore this bizarre, psuedo-Eastern world... and it's been quite a while since I felt this motivated by nothing more than a number saved onto a memory card somewhere.Alongside its outlandishly original gameplay and story, Damacy is equally original with its simple, understated control scheme. The only buttons you'll need to use in this game are the PS2 controller's dual analog sticks and the \"X\" button. It plays like a weird mixture of Pac-Man and the old Midway tank-based arcade game, Vindicators. Pushing both sticks forward moves you forward. Pulling both sticks back moves you back. Pushing both sticks left strafes you left, two rights strafe you right, pushing the left stick forward and the right stick back turns the whole thing (camera and all) right, and vice versa performs the exact opposite function. The only time your fingers should leave the analog sticks is when you're reading some dialog (unfortunately, there's no prominent voice acting in Katamari) and you need to hit the \"X\" button to move things along.Visually, this is far from the most stunning game on the PS2 today. Honestly, I don't think there's a single object in the game that couldn't be faithfully reproduced on the Sega Dreamcast a thousand times over. Now that I think about it, the original Shenmue puts the graphics of Katamari to shame. But if you still think the visuals are the point, you obviously haven't been paying attention. However, one thing I'm relatively sure the old Dreamcast couldn't do is scale every one of those millions of objects, both moving and still, from full-screen to ant-size with no slowdown in sight. It's not right up in your face and obvious, like the majestic beauty of Gran Turismo 3 or Final Fantasy X, but this is a great display of the PS2's sheer polygon-crunching power.This is seriously one of the greatest games of 2004. If you haven't already played it and were waiting on some sort of official endorsement to do so, consider this your call to action. It's discount-priced right out of the gates at twenty bucks, (which makes perfect sense, because no matter how good this game is, I don't think I could've justified fifty dollars on it) and will reward you and your friends with hours upon hours of entertainment, even after you've completed all of the single-player quests.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2004"}

I'm not a hardcore Madden guy. I buy Madden once every 3-4 seasons after there have been several updates and changes. Apparently I missed the best one(Madden 10) when I picked up 11.First with the good:It looks great...mostly. At a glance, the game is amazing during actual gameplay. The clipping is pretty much gone and all of the animations are smooth as silk.The new presentation is really good, definately has the TV broadcast feeling. Finding an online game is easy and there are several modes to keep you occupied. If you want to get together with some buddies and talk trash, Madden 11 is a great game, hence the 3 stars.The Bad:Everything that is not gameplay looks like trash. The fans, the coaches, before game, post game, all of it. The graphics are flat and not detailed and stutter like crazy. Really atrocious.There is NO DEFENSE. I understand the Cowboys putting 38 on me, but the Bucs? A fast player (Steve Slaton for example) is almost unstopable. A run to the outside with a couple extra blockers; money play everytime. Pretty much any player with a speed rating over 90 is untouchable. Anything on the edges and they are gone if they don't get hit on contact.And that doesn't even consider the abysmal \"Gameflow\" play calling. Eight in the box blitzing for the Saints becuase they ran a couple times in a row, check. 4 wide running deep routes in the redzone for God only knows what reason, check. Useless.My main complaints though are with the actual gameplay, and these are old problems that have been around for years. The D will pour through the line on play action before the QB has a chance to fake the hand off. But a shotgun pass will almost always give you time to find a receiver. Most importantly, on higher difficulty settings, your players get worse (i.e. Andre Johnson can't catch anything) instead of the AI getting better.Every few years I think I'll give Madden a try, and every few years I'm dissapointed.

The mike is light which is perfect for little hands. Sound quality is OK, you get distortion when the kids shout. But otherwise you won't be using it anyway to audition for the next American Idol. The cord needs to be a little longer as most households now have larger screens, which mean we have to sit farther from the TV.The music theme sounds great and cute. The illustration and animation are very basic yet colorful and should be appealing to kids.There are four main rooms, Orange room, Grape room, Acorn room, and Apple room.The main part of the workshop is of course the Orange room (the library). There are 16 stories in which you can choose to read by yourself, or choose a storyteller. You will need to press the Wiimote \"A\" button after each sentence. Each story is just about the right length to engage a preschooler's attention, not too long and not too short. If you read the story 3 times, you can replace the faces of the main characters in the story with your own Mii.Grape room is solely for configuring the microphone volume and how to advance the stories - automatically or with the remote. It could be better if they just tuck this away as kids don't have anything to do here.Acorn room houses the basic instruction and how you progresses.Apple room is where most of the fun is. Kids will have a blast turning their voices to a robot, a giant, a gnome, fairy, copycat, and many others. Painting by voice is also quite fun using the screen as an electronic canvass with your voice. As long as you are talking to the mike, the little snail will keep on splashing colors on the screen. You can change the voice pitch by changing the colors. The colors are limited to yellow, green, blue, and purple and shades in between. The sing-a-long only has 4 songs - too few in my opinion. You can sing and record your voice with the music and choose to play it later. The big disappointment is the Learning Desk which could have been really fun but turned out boring and annoying. Some of the minigames are spotting the differences between 2 pictures, identifying shapes, basic math, categorizing things. All these activities completely ignored the Wiimote functionality. You would think that you can pinpoint the difference by targeting the objects on the drawings. My kids love comparing pictures to spot what's wrong with the other one. For example, if you see a round window on the first picture and is square on the other one, you will tend to click on the window expecting to show you a check or a cross with a sound of a bell. My son does exactly that. But it doesn't work that way. To find out the answers, you have to keep pressing \"A\" and read the answers at the bottom of the screen telling you what objects are not the same on the other picture. It just takes away the excitement. Same thing with the shapes, categorizing things and math. When the software asks how many circles are in the picture, my son started targeting all the circles he could find on the screen. But nothing is happening except the words on the bottom of the screen keep rolling up. He was wondering what was he doing wrong The questions are not even read by a computer, and so the kids cannot play by themselves if they do not know how to read at all. This part of the game should have been great. Instead, my kids gave up out of frustration.Another frustrating thing is about the electronic stickers that my kids have collected. If they choose a different background, they all disappear. They spent time and effort to collect the stickers and they are not saved with the old background.Not something I would expect from an established game publisher like Konami. Should have been a great concept, but it failed on many aspects.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2010"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization.

After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

I'll admit I started off having a lot of fun with this game. The combat was smooth, the graphics were sleek, and the amount of weapons and items was a nice addition. The good stuff ended there. I found the enemies to be very annoying. I couldn't go very far in any direction without a bunch of them attacking me and any time I went back to an area, even from just coming from there, they would be there again to attack me.The world being so blocked off was a huge mistake. You feel boxed in and can't unlock anymore areas without progressing in the missions which became repetitive and frustrating. I couldn't even get past this one boss battle with the help of a friend. The game gave me no hints or anything about how to defeat this boss that would kill me in almost 2 shots. Very frustrating and uninviting to new players just trying to grind and have some fun. I feel like if the game took a more calm approach where we could explore a bit more and grind it would have been fun, but instead it's just another game where the combat is shoved down our throats too much and it becomes a repetitive bore. I'm surprised this game sold so many copies and won so many fans but to each his own. Not for me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B001CMJAP6","reviewerName":"Old School Gamer \"What the hell's a gigawatt!?!\"","summary":"This review is for the GAMEPLAY ALONE!!!","reviewText":"I read a lot of bad stuff about the graphical glitches and hang-ups in this game, so I borrowed a buddy of mines to play it before I bought it. I never let technical issues's stop me from getting a game unless its something as abysmal as a pc game that crashes every time you save your game or something fun like that.This game is an extraordinary new title from square-enix. While it certianly pays homage to the strategy titles of old like Shining Force or Dark Wizard, it makes me think more of something like Dynasty Warriors, but as an rpg, a true rpg. That is to say that the battles take place on large fronts but still focus in on your main group. Its essentially a take on the epic feel of the huge battles that take place in a world wide war, but without losing focus on your select group of heroes. Its quite novel actually if you ask me and takes the feel of the drama up a notch. The story, from what I saw of the first 10 hours is quite compelling, especially for something done by the new cash-in squad at SE. The graphics are better than FFXII, so I wish people would stop making that comparison. The art technique and layout of the world itself CAN be compared to FFXII only because that is the type of rpg world SE seems to want to build now. I think their plan is to try and make rpg more accessable to American's by getting away from the Japanese form, which seems to be less popular(god knows why...).I can tell from 10 hours I will love this game but, having said all that, I am going to wait for the PS3 before I purchase my copy. I own both systems and can wait 4 months or so for the release of what will hopefully be a much more rounded out and perfected version of the game. It seems like SE tried as hard as they could to push this game to market before the holiday season because it was never supposed to come out before early first quarter of '09. Its simply presonal preference though, because I really want to get the best version of this game because it is THAT GOOD, honestly, and I do not want anything to take away from the experience.If you do not own a PS3 and want every rpg that is worth playing, you sincerly need to buy this game because it will not disappoint you. Tenchnical issues aside, its the best your going to get before FFXIII is finally released(unless you own a PS2 still, then it is Persona 4 ;p ).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2008"}

I'm glad I didn't pay extra for it, because it is terrible.  Our kids didn't even enjoy the parts of the game when it worked right, but the biggest problem is that this game is so much worse at sensing the player accurately with Kinect than our other Kinect games.  The result was pausing frequently because it didn't recognize the player, being unable to save a game, and somehow changing the look of the character (from boy to girl, different clothes, etc.) whenever someone else mistakenly step foot briefly within the Kinect sensor's zone.When it did sense the player correctly, the game was not much fun to play for our kids.  It looks like it is just an advertisement for a Disney Land property.  Plus, of all things, it encourages kids to run through the streets by themselves, looking for the next action, something we do not want to encourage our kids to do.This game is truly terrible, which is too bad, because we LOVE Kinect games like Just Dance 3 and Kinect Sports.

{"product_name":"B0000D12XI","description":"In 2001,Max Paynearrived to set the benchmark for action gaming, earning countless awards and revolutionizing the genre with cinematic combat sequences fuelled by the groundbreaking use of slow motion and compulsive narrative-driven gameplay. Now, working together with Rockstar Games' New York-based production team, Remedy has combinedMax Payne's hallmark gameplay with all new innovations and unmatched production values.Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payneis set to raise the bar for action games all over again when it's released fall 2003.","reviewerName":"Brian M. Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"","summary":"Max Payne II: The Revenge","reviewText":"Sequelitis has been a computer game marketing strategy since I was knee-high to a Commodore 64. While sequelitis in film means increasingly cheesy screenwriting and direction-such as with the *Alien* series-it means \"rehash\" with games.I don't mind a rehashed title if I liked it enough the first time around. My high school friends complained that Id Software's *Doom II* was more of the same, plus more demons and weapons. Good enough for me: *Doom* wasn't broke and it didn't need to be fixed. Others disagreed.People don't agree when it comes to current titles either. But as I watched the end credits of the second *Max Payne* roll before my sleepless eyes, I recognized a rare sequel. No mere rehash, *Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne* improves upon its predecessor in most respects.&lt;Same Gun-Time, Same Gun-Channel&gt;*MP2* resumes the titular character's torment sometime after the events of his first rampage. Vengeance hasn't healed Max. He drifts through the days while nightmares consume his infrequent sleep. He lives for his job as a re-instated NYPD detective, explaining, \"With no way to deal with the past, I kept my eyes on the road and off the road-kill in the rear view mirror. I chased lesser mysteries, other people's crimes\". Standing for so little, it is little wonder how easily someone pushes Max back into action.A routine call turns deadly when Max encounters a mysterious organization of \"cleaners\". Simultaneously he runs into Mona Sax, an assassin ally whom Payne believed dead from his first campaign. Payne's pursuit of both puts him once again across the paths of rival mobsters Vladimir Lem and Vinnie Gognitti. Everybody dismisses their conflict as another ill-Gognitti-inspired venture-Payne suspects something more.Max plunges headfirst into mystery, madness-and yes, infatuation. True to character, he suppresses his burgeoning feelings for Mona in the name of the job: to meet interesting people and blow them away.&lt;Die-Die-Die!&gt;Everybody gushes about the series' benchmark graphics and engine stability. And yeah, they are more impressive the second time around. What keeps my boat afloat are the control tweaks.Payne veterans shudder with memories of winding up a firebomb when an enemy suddenly pops around a corner, the player frantically backing up while scrolling through their inventory to a gun. Now players can lay grenades, club people, and break stuff with a \"Secondary Attack\" key. All guns can be used as clubs, replacing the pipe and bat of the first title. Additional tweaks:--Payne remains on the ground after completing a shoot-dodge maneuver--until the player releases the \"Shoot\" key or runs out of ammunition.--Shoot-dodging no longer expends bullet-time resource.--Explosives area effect have been reduced--Characters no longer suffer guaranteed death from Molotov Cocktails.--Slightly improved enemy AI.--NPC's fight alongside Max.--Players play Mona for several scenes.--And in a mod nod, developer Remedy lets players wield dual Desert Eagles and a wider variety of scoped weapons.&lt;Ladies and Lords&gt;Remedy isn't all sniper rifles and no story. *Max Payne* was a traditional vengeance game, whereby characters were merely layers to be peeled in an onion of evil. *MP2* is a more detailed and involved transition story. Remedy retains the occasional cardboard villain, such as a \"Kaufman\" character frequently named but hardly described; he utters two lines and dies in his only appearance. Lem and Gognitti display more character traits and figure prominently in Max's quest. Jim Bravura also assumes a greater role, being humanized beyond his pit-bull portrayal in the first game. Enigmatic as ever, Mona Sax reveals little such as her choice of shower songs, her outfits, and her love-hate opinions for Max. As in the first game, Max has a treacherous partner, but this one carries a back-story and she appears regularly.&lt;Payne's World&gt;Richer characters populate a like world. Some *MP1* levels felt empty and tired. I found the hotel and apartment segments particularly bland and over-used. *MP2* levels are constructed in significantly greater detail and subtly. Level boundaries, for example, are more logical than the hackneyed truck-blocking-the-road device used in the first game. Plenty of friendly NPCs populate some levels, such as a police station and Payne's apartment. While Payne repeatedly returns to a funhouse level, it is increasingly damaged and opened to exploration. Players won't encounter much on the creative par of the *Half-Life* or *NOLF* series, but the levels are still memorable and more diverse.Telekinesys Research provides its Havok.com physics engine to complement the world detail. It's not exploited, but Remedy made sure bodies would tumble off scaffolding and fold over rails. Payne can sometimes ram enemies. I have shot flammable barrels and watched them fall off balconies and burst among enemies. The explosions almost shake my monitor with Creative Lab's integrated EAX 2.0 sound support, even on low channels--though gunshots sound weak regardless.The engine functions fine on my antiquated system: 900 MHz Athlon, 512 MB stick, Geforce 4 Ti card, and Windows XP. *MP2* requires 2 discs to load and play, taking up 1.6 gigs of harddisk space.&lt;Detective Payne?&gt;It also took just ten straight hours for me to beat, from Saturday night to Sunday morning. Part three needed to be developed a bit more, while the climatic level lacked the satisfaction and suspense I felt when I shot up the evil office building at the end of the last game. As with *MP1*, I missed having crawl and climb functions. I'm also tired of inventory conventions; I'd rather carry three or four weapons and a bunch of magazines than a bunch of weapons with arbitrarily limited ammo pools.Considering the overall plot and play of the game, I wasn't bothered. *Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne* is a fine sequel from Finnish developers who appreciate stable game engines. Veterans and greenhorns alike should recognize the details elevating this gun-fu drama beyond mere rehash.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2004"}

I will enjoy this game like I used to enjoyed it. No complaints. Full of praise for Origins Collection.For those who have not played the PSP games, I highly recommend you to get it.

Also, like the Tony Hawk games,The Simsis a very addictive game.Players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people and influence the outcome of their lives, be it success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. The bestselling PC version of the game has, in recent years, been upgraded with elements like parties, pets, and vacations, but this iteration is closer to the basic formula.You start the game living with Mom in a one-story suburban house. You are immediately presented with certain life tasks, such as fixing the TV and making lunch, which are aligned with the skills you'll need for the game's main challenge--keeping your sims in balance on eight conflicting categories. For example, eating will have an impact on your sim's hunger rating, but it will also impact his bladder rating. You'll have to make sure that he keeps himself and the house clean, that he sleeps to restore his energy, and that he also has time to keep himself entertained. The free will option lets your sims coast a bit, and you can also save time by stacking tasks together. Time passes at the rate of about one minute per second in the game, but you can fast-forward sim time when you need to, such as when they're sleeping.The controls are justifiably complex, but adjusting to them is not difficult. You see your sims from an overhead perspective that you can both rotate and zoom. You direct their actions by moving a line cursor to where you want them to go or to what object or person with which you want them to interact.The game is surprisingly funny. Neglect your sims and they'll shout and wave their arms to get your attention. Allow one's energy to get too low and he or she will likely collapse and sleep right where they were standing.

A record like Wilt Chamberlain scoring a hundred points in an NBA game, Lara may never be surpassed either.The two TRs that were the most similar in play and total gaming were #2 & #3. I still like their look on PC even today. #1's graphics were pixelated, but we loved it all the same. #4 & #5 are good too. Now, TR:AOD(1st PS2 game), everyone complains about, but everyone that slammed it, finished it, and maybe even played it again. No one ever says that they played the first level and quit or threw the game away, which I've done before(Doom3's one dimensional play).Tomb Raider will always be the thinking person's game, not the fast twitch kill 50 monsters in-a-row type of game. TR:AOD was a very good game with a not very good control scheme. I really liked the colorful graphics compared to the new incarnations of muted colors in Legend, Anniv., and Underworld. Another game that everyone complains about is Rez Evil4(pc), but is one best playing games around. TR Legend is the best of the new bunch, with few glitches and good play. Anniversary is good too, but it has some sections for me that my non-teenage hands can't move fast enough to maneuver. Spinning blades on walls and Centaurs are killing me from finishing that one, and I've been able to finish every TR game 'cept that one. PC version proved easier than the sloppy joystick of PS2. Why have we gotten nine TRs so far?Because we love to play the darn thing over and over again. Personally I'd like to see a combo of TR:AOD and the last three, with a few items from the oldies. OK, back to TR:Anniv., if you haven't played any TR games to date, don't play this one yet. Start with one of the oldies 1-5. #1 is pixel-dated in todays standards. You always gain a greater appreciation for the newer games if you have played earlier incarnations. Try Legend or Underworld first also. I just think this TR version is very very technical, and requires some very good gaming skills to get by the Centaurs and some of the wall jumping, climbing, with spinning and slashing blades, all with a nasty time requirement for performance of these feats. Getting back to the Centaurs boss battle of Anniversary, I completed this with some challenge on PC, but find the PS2 controller almost to seem non-functional. It can't be me, right? I think Anniversary is excellent, but I've hit a wall.This game will test your gaming skills for sure, but not your shooting skills. Shooting in TR games is always a diversion to the true intent, being able to find your way through the maze of tunnels, cliffs, caverns, oceans, and buildings.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2009"}

This could be a good thing or a bad thing. It definitely doesn't feel like one of the $10 generic keyboards. It feels like a quality keyboard. Hooking it up and installing the software was quite painless. The next thing I noticed is the keyboard has no \"feet\". For a keyboard that costs $60+, I'm surprised of this basic omission. After installing, I got down to seeing what it can do. I love the feel of the keys. They have a nice \"springy\" feel. Not \"spongy\" like cheap keyboards. The swappable number pad is useful especially for lefties. For non-gaming use, I prefer to just remove it totally since I don't use it. Its design is beyond bad. It attaches with magnets, and pretty much falls off if you pick the keyboard up. For gamers, there are plenty of macro keys to program to your desire. My favorite feature though is the simple fact the keyboard lights up. I work in the dark all the time, and find this very useful. I don't find the gigantic knob to control the brightness to be necessary though. All in all, this is a very good keyboard. It could be great with some tweaking and additional features.Pros: Swappable number pad. Plenty of macro functions. Very good key feel. Nice illumination. Volume control. Solidly built.Cons: No USB ports. No headphone jack. No tilting \"feet'. Mediocre software. Number pad attaches with magnets.

{"product_name":"B000P46NKC","description":"Resident Evil 4 Wii","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"an average game with a big problem","reviewText":"After thoroughly playing through Resident Evil 2 and 3, I finally arrived to the overwhelmingly popular Resident Evil 4. I've read the positive reviews. I pumped myself up for all sorts of incredible mind-boggling graphics and animations to excite me like never before... and I can honestly say the previous Resident Evil games gave me a lot more satisfaction overall.Now, the graphics are truly memorable with every twist and turn your main character Leon faces. It makes the older Resident Evil games show their age. Throughout the game, many of these twisted-looking mutants will walk up to you in an attempt to kill you. Because the game is pretty easy, and because the game is mainly focused on nonstop shooting action, taking out the bad guys hardly ever becomes a problem. Most of them will die in just one or two hits from the shotgun. There's almost no challenge at all here. You can argue that the same sort of gameplay takes place in Resident Evil 2 and 3 (where a bunch of zombies slowly walk in your direction and you have to take them out one by one) but many of those zombies require a fairly decent amount of ammo to completely kill.In Resident Evil 2 and 3, you'd be shooting at a bunch of zombies and quite often it all became too much to handle and the zombies would eventually overpower you. Nothing like that in this game, because you can see them coming ahead of time.  That really hurts the gameplay.I hate how the dreary, quiet and almost shockingly life-like atmosphere of the previous Resident Evil games has been removed, with Capcom choosing to instead make a nonstop action shooter with loads and loads of bad guys frequently entering the picture. I admit that it looks pretty cool how you first see a shadow of a figure walking in your direction, and then it appears *right* in front of you a few seconds later. I can't complain about the graphics because they really *are* a sight to behold. But I can complain about the lack of a creepy atmosphere.  It would have made the game better, in my opinion.In Resident Evil 4, it seems like the game encourages one-hit kills, and honestly, most shooting games I've played that had one-hit kills only happened because of some cheat code I activated. In Resident Evil 4, it really *is* a simple game with Leon only needing to waste a couple bullets for each of the mutants he faces.I also really hate how there's hardly any freedem whatsoever to the areas you explore and walk through. There's one narrow path that you mindlessly follow for pretty much the entire game. It reminds me *so much* of the old Playstation classic Dino Crisis 2. However, back then walking down a small path wasn't considered much of a problem because the PSX hardware was pretty limited in those days. With the Playstation 2 and Gamecube, there's really no excuse for a crammy environment. Improving technology was supposed to eliminate this problem.  Maybe they will fix it when Resident Evil 5 finally arrives.I also hate the little things such as the sound your shotgun makes when it fires. It has a weak, quiet sound which isn't nearly as cool as the shotgun you found in Resident Evil 2.  Remember that gun? It made an exploding sound when fired. The death animations from the bad guys is pretty spectacular at first.  However, after about 20 minutes you begin to see them repeating the same death sequences over and over again, and that makes the game lose its impressiveness. Some of them stagger around before falling over dead, while others spin around. It gets old quick.  You can also aim for the face of a mutant and their head will explode.  It's not as cool as in Resident Evil 2 when their head actually blows to pieces, though.Most of the time the enemies don't make much noise after they've been shot. They're surprisingly quiet.  They mostly make a quiet \"aw\" sound and then fall over dead. A far cry from the unsettling moaning sounds from the zombies in the previous RE games on the Playstation.Throwing in a money feature was a bad idea, too. You can find money in these white crates sitting on shelves (in which you have to shoot to discover the money). Also money can be found from enemies after you've killed them. Money is used to buy better weapons from a merchant who occasionally appears on screen. Now I ask you, wouldn't it have been *really* awful had the previous Resident Evil games thrown this feature into the gameplay? The Resident Evil series is supposed to be about blowing apart undead zombies and making it out alive with the limited amount of bullets you are given. Once you waste those bullets and can't find anymore lying around, it's safe to say you blew it- you have to start the game over again. This is a GOOD thing because it increases the challenge. Now, you can just buy whatever you want when the going gets tough.  It just LOOKS strange collecting money in a Resident Evil game.The music is pretty unspectacular as well. I never once got the sense I was going to die because I was too busy mindlessly shooting my way through a narrow path and killing the same enemies time and time again in order to make my way to the next area... and then blaze my way through THAT part of the game. Repeat over and *over* again. The gameplay never changed. Some of the bosses were awesome, though. Those boss fights were the high point to an otherwise overrated and challenge-free game.The Wii version of the game is definitely the best, with the new control system and the updated graphics enhancing the experience. I just wish that during the creation of this game, Capcom had focused more on atmosphere and the \"occasional\" shooting instead of seemingly never-ending shooting. That way, you'd feel scared the entire way *and* you'd appreciate shooting the bad guys when the moment finally came. So much action is involved in Resident Evil 4 that you *really* stop taking notice of the fact that killing something is supposed to be a special moment in a video game when the time to do so finally arrives. You'll just be shooting your way through the game, collecting money and upgrading weapons, and repeating the same thing over and over again.  Resident Evil 4 takes about 3 hours to complete, and that's what you'll be doing for the majority of the time.Honestly, the gameplay doesn't feel much different from Medal of Honor (despite being a 3rd person shooter). I think we've finally arrived to a point when all action/shooters are starting to feel the same. When game companies update graphics, the control system and gameplay, they're actually accidentally removing some of the supposed flaws that make games special in the first place. People might look at the graphics in Resident Evil 2 and complain about the muddy and grainy appearance, but at least there's nothing else like it out there (well, besides Resident Evil 3).I say skip Resident Evil 4 and just play the old games instead. The updated graphics and enemy animations are only interesting for a little while and then the experience wears off.  I've actually stopped buying new video games for over six years because I began to notice a horrible trend in that all video games are starting to blend together and feel pretty much the same.  After playing Resident Evil 4, I think there's some truth to that.  Graphics don't always equal long-lasting fun.My biggest complaint however, is that the challenge increases by itself. This means there's no way to master the gameplay, and mastering the gameplay is exactly why I play video games in the first place. You see depending on how well you do in one room will determine the challenge in the *next* room. So if you blaze through one hallway and don't get hit at all, suddenly the next hallway will be loaded with hyperactive and exceptionally deadly bad guys that are not only more aggressive, but your health bar will decrease even more upon every hit you receive. This happens *the entire way through the game*. Death is now VERY likely to happen when you're caught off-guard by numerous and well-timed cheap shots on the part of the enemy.*Why hasn't anyone realized this?* I've posted on Resident Evil 4 message boards and nobody believes me. They just assume I'm trashing the game and flaming the boards in an attempt to get a rise out of people. I don't think so. This is a joke- an unfunny, terrible joke. Actually it's a major gameplay flaw. I don't want the game to increase the challenge for me depending on my skills- I want more aggressive enemies when *I* select a higher difficulty setting. If I were to choose a hyper or insane mode, yeah, this kind of thing would be totally appropriate. But not a normal run on normal mode. Oh well, some people don't care about this but it's a really big deal to me.It's NOT just regular stage enemies either. Bosses will suddenly make you pay hard and heavy when the game realizes how easy you're breezing through the rooms and hallways, the quick commands will be even more demandingly quicker (such as that dreaded knight room with Ashley or during any boss fight that requires shaking the Wii remote to avoid sudden danger). Fail to shake the remote in time and you WILL experience a sudden and surprising death.Let me give you an example- let's say you're almost dead and playing poorly, when the time comes to shake the remote you will be given 2-3 seconds. However if you're blazing through the game without taking a single hit, you're given half a second to shake the remote. Don't shake it in time and guess what? Death! Unbelievable. This wouldn't be a serious problem if it wasn't for the fact that many times the boss fights *themselves* require shaking the Wii remote which means if you're not fast enough to execute the shake, all that work wearing down the boss will be gone in an instant and you'll be dead meat.Any and all cheap ways that the game can take advantage of will be used against you depending on your performance in the previous room so the best advice? Play like crap. Take several hits. Allow enemies to throw weapons at your face. Allow them to grab you. Heal often. Shoot sloppily. Shoot enemies once or twice and allow them to recover and attack you. Pace yourself. Running hard seems to encourage your enemies to run faster. Does any of this seem fair? Of course not. Simply put, the game punishes you for performing well. Yes my friends, this really IS a twisted, terrible joke. Play Resident Evil 2 and 3 instead where absolutely *none* of this crap occurs.To be fair, clearing out an entire room without taking any hits doesn't *always* create a sudden jump in difficulty. Sometimes it takes 2 or 3 rooms of flawless or near flawless work for the challenge to magically go up. It always does eventually though- *always*. I've played through RE4 15 times at least and studied the gameplay carefully so I know something is not right.Now in my opinion, this isn't fair at *all*. It would only be fair if there was some kind of extremely hard or hyper difficulty setting and I was playing the game on that but... I'm not. I'm playing the game on normal mode. I don't get it!But do NOT go over to any number of Resident Evil 4 message boards and explain this to people. Nobody will believe you. Plus you'll get flamed. I'm not *always* a clueless idiot even if I might act like one sometimes! I know something is fishy about RE4's gameplay. I just can't put my finger on the exact problem and what's causing this (and if there's a way to stop it from happening because it completely ruins the fun for me).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2007"}

You can also do a few special side-missions for some extra money.  Throughout the game, I alternated between brothers.  I'm not sure if this is the best or most desirable way to play, but it does offer for some replay.  My only complaint about the game is the use of the duel.  It's pretty cool at first, but it's used against every boss.  If it didn't have this, I'd probably rate it a 5.
