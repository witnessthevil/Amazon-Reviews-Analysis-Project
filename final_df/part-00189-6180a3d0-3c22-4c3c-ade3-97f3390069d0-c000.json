{"product_name":"B001YHX4B0","description":"Blurring the borders of good and evil, this cinematic and stylized adventure stars Bayonetta, a heroine bent on sending supernatural forces to the depths of hell. Armed with her four enchanted guns known as Scarborough Fair, she battles both monstrous behemoths and angelic enemies. By combining special magic attacks, summoning primal forces and unleashing devastating weaponry, she impressively punishes anyone who gets in her way. From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint.Unleash your powersView larger.Amazing graphicsView larger.","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Gaudy, Ridiculous and Insane.... And I Wouldn't Have It Any Other Way","reviewText":"Bayonetta is a witch who has guns attached to her high heels, uses her hair to make up a removable skin-tight catsuitwhich can also double as a lethal weapon, and eats lollipops in an incredibly suggestive manner. Right off the bat, it's prettyobvious that you're going to know whether or not this game is going to interest you at all. If you can openly embrace the absurd,then \"Bayonetta\" will provide you some of the most fun you've had playing a game in years.Story: N/AIt doesn't matter. No, really, it doesn't. Yes, it's an entertaining plot; no, it's not directly tied to your enjoyment of thegame. It's very clever, very well-written, and even capable of providing heavy emotional moments on certain occasions. Butthis isn't a game that you should play for the plot. Not even in the LEAST bit. Moving on.Gameplay: A++I've never given any game's gameplay two pluses before, but it's appropriate with a title such as \"Bayonetta.\" Every singlebutton press, and even the tiniest of tiny analog stick movements, all serve some purpose. There is never a moment ofconfusion about the controls. As soon as you're in the heat of battle in the very first level, you know exactly what to do;within minutes, you're skillfully dodging swings of swords and wiping out hoards of hideous angels. Combat is fast andfierce, always engaging and never exuding the impression that you're button-mashing. In order to be truly proficient at thisgame, you'll have to practice your combos for each weapon extensively before attempting to tackle some of the larger foes.Give it time, and soon you'll be summoning wicked dragons and heinous giant feet made from your hair which crush yourfoes in one fell swoop. Patience and skill are key here.Sound: A+Light, poppy music which meshes in an odd fashion with the visceral, bloody gameplay will be lodged in your head forweeks. The music never feels awkwardly placed, and always fits the moment in a perfect manner. Voice acting isalso phenomenal; Bayonetta's sultry voice makes Lara Croft come across as an innocent schoolgirl. Every characterhas their own distinct sound, which is rare in many games of this genre.Graphics: A+Whether you're playing in HD or Standard Definition, every square millimeter of this game bleeds style and detail. Nota single speck of dirt was left untextured in \"Bayonetta\", and it's quite obvious that the developers took a lot oftime making their product look absolutely perfect. Character models are beautiful, and the lush environments range frombeautiful ruins to (!) the outer reaches of space.Overall: A+This game has it all: a memorable lead, perfect gameplay, beautiful music, great graphics, and enough replay value tolast you months. There is absolutely no reason to avoid this game if you own a 360 or PS3.P.S. - IMPORTANT NOTICE TO PS3 OWNERS:I've noticed a lot of complaints about longer load times for the Playstation 3 version of this game, which are well-founded;the game was developed for the 360, and ported to the PS3 by Sega themselves. There is an inexplicably higher loading timefor this version, but for those who game online, don't fret: Sega released a patch shortly after release which cut intothe load times significantly. Still, those who don't have online for their PS3 should be warned that they may be waiting a fewextra seconds to jump into the action each time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZD18","reviewerName":"ROBERT M.","summary":"Not horrible but has some flaws. Definitley not better then the upcoming Retron 5","reviewText":"For all of its promise, the Ouya falls victim to design missteps, poor performance, and a critical lack of compelling content. With the potential to improve, the product as it exists today misses the mark.The system is also marred by a number of technical issues. Under the hood, the Ouya has 1GB of RAM, 8GB of local storage, and runs on Nvidia's Tegra 3 processor -- a generation behind the latest model, the Tegra 4. While more than capable of running 2D platformers and even some more taxing 3D titles like Shadowgun at 720p or 1080p, performance is completely inconsistent. Some games run smoothly, others start to get choppy during action sequences and firefights. The system even struggles to handle the load of the primary UI at times, freezing up or producing a noticeable delay while scrolling.And then there's the controller.The Ouya's take on a traditional gamepad is an impressive effort, but has some glaring performance and ergonomic issues. The design has dense rounded grips that blend into a flat base with squarish corners. While the 4-way d-pad, action buttons, and analogs feel good, there is often noticeable delay between commands and on-screen actions. Some games perform better than others, but the Ouya can't compete with the precision of higher end game systems. Whereas the Xbox 360 gamepad or DualShock 3 have shoulder buttons that conform to your index fingers, the Ouya's are wide with hard edges. Subsequently, I  felt my fingers strugling to make fast taps.Like the DualShock 4, the Ouya features an integrated trackpad, but there are few apps or games that make use of it. While a centered Ouya button will take you back to the dashboard, the controller lacks a pause button or any dedicated method for bringing up contextual menus. As a result, game developers have been left to assign the role to one of the action buttons, but there's no standardized assignment. In some cases it's the O button, in others, it's the A. The complete lack of a dedicated button or established alternative seems like an absurd oversight. Better coordination with developers could resolve the problem, but for now, it ruins the user experience.Overall if the price drops It wouldn't be a bad pick up","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2014"}

{"product_name":"B004K1EA5G","description":"","reviewerName":"Anime Lover \"D\"","summary":"Good game","reviewText":"I have played a few of the DoA games and I know what I like, and this games does have it.  The 3d aspect is a good touch, the cinematic scenes of the story mode and the backgrounds of the fighting areas look gorgeous (and for the guy fans out there, the JIGGLE effect of your favorite female fighter is great in 3d). while it seems to slow the action down, it is not detract that it gives you the feel of actually seeing the area (if you go online and are trying to find someone move your 3ds around, the scene moves with you like you are looking through the eyes of a character.  this game is quick to learn, just pick up and go with the moves list below to reference or push on the touch screen.  also it has a streetpass mode like street fighter which give you some fun even when your system is in sleep mode.the cons of the game is as others said, the english dub is not great, the voices are rich but the movement is not there, the online is glitchy (but probably can be fixed in an update, but it could be a lag difference of where you are playing and the speed of your opponents wireless)but still good, and the ladder could have been better, but it is a good way to learn the game before jumping into online fights (and get a few outfits and characters).  the only thing about the combo list is that it is so large, while you can press the combo you want you do need to move fast to hit them in a fight.UPDATE:  Download 2 started up - I have two costumes for Kokoro and Akane - I hope they bring more out, and I wonder when Samus will be available to play with (and I wonder if they are going to give her the swimsuit outfit you get if when you beat Metroid in under 5 hours :-) )overall i give the game a very good grade, especially if you killed SUPER STF IV and are waiting for Zelda and Resident Evil.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2011"}

The thing is that they went back to WWII. Alot of people are simply getting tired of WWII. So for about the first 3 or 4 months that the game was out, I didnt attempt to buy or even play the game. One day I just happened to have some store credit at Game Stop and got the game relitively cheap. I started with the mulitplayer which is always fun for the Call of Duty franchise. So not many complaints there. The story mode is fun but COD 4 just put it to shame. As well as they put this games multiplayer to shame. The only mode better for this game is Nazi Zombies. This is a great game within a game. It is very entertaining yet difficult at the same time. You have horde after horde of Zombies trying to break into your building while you kill them and attempt to board the windows back up as they come in. It is very fun when you have 4 of your friends along for the ride. Its just great fun especially with the improvements with the map pack add-on(with extra achievments!). All together this is a great game! It's fun, action packed and competitive. I would recommend Call of Duty: Modern Warfare over it in the end though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00004TC6E","reviewerName":"M. VanPortfliet \"Matthew san\"","summary":"Its no Chrono Trigger...but still an amazing, beautiful game","reviewText":"I finally played this game recently, quite a few years after it's release. At first I had serious doubts about it, as there seemed little connection to Chrono Trigger (which I am a big fan of), and the gameplay and story just didn't seem to be nearly as good. However, once I gave it a chance I really started getting into it.I think one of the big downfalls of this game is that it is a sequel to such a phenomenal old SNES game, and everyone wanted it to be as good or better, which would have been a hard thing to achieve. In it's own right, this is an amazing game, regardless of it being a sequel or not.It is a true sequel, and the story does tie in directly to the events in Chrono Trigger, however, that's about it...the story. If you want to see the characters or environments of Chrono Trigger, you're out of luck, as this game has all different characters and takes place in the El Nido archipelago, in the same world as Chrono Trigger but never explored in that game.The other thing this game has in relation to Chrono Trigger is just the over all feel of the game...you can tell the same people made it.The graphics of the game are incredibly beautiful, and though already quite dated, they still stand up well (they are comparable to say...Final Fantasy IX). The environments range from beautiful tropical regions to complex castles and dungeons, and all areas are very well thought out, fun to explore, and interesting. I'm glad they kept the overland map the same as in Chrono Trigger, making it fast and easy to get around. The music is wonderful as well, and while I would have liked to have heard a few more Chrono Trigger classics, I really can't complain...the music is beautiful and very well done.The story is twisting and complex, and it's actually quite hard to keep straight what's going on sometimes and what world you are in, as the game takes place in two different dimensions of the same world as opposed to different time periods. The two different dimensions are very similar and it can be hard to keep straight what world you are in. Still, the story was very good, keeps you involved, and does end up having a lot of direct and very interesting tie-ins to Chrono Trigger. There is also a plethora of characters (near 40, I think), almost all of which have there own mini-stories.That was one aspect of the game I have mixed feelings about. On one hand it's great and interesting to have so many unique characters to be able to use, each with their own unique abilities and personalities. But on the other hand, having so many characters makes it hard to really get into them, their stories end up being rather shallow, and you can never really power all of them up. You'll likely end up with a couple favorites of every color attribute that you use most often, which really isn't bad. Overall, they did a good job with the characters, and I like the system they used.The gameplay is very fun, and although it is in most ways straight forward RPG, they do throw in some interesting twists to combat. Overall quite enjoyable.There is an almost infinite amount of secret tidbits to unlock, so much that it would almost be impossible to find them all without the strategy guide. The direction of the game can change depending on choices you make, and conversations are always different depending on who is in your party. The game is incredibly open ended, and has multiple endings as well. This coupled with the fact that it has a new game + feature gives it incredible replay value. I just beat it the first time and I'm already replaying it again with all of my equipment, elements, and experience from the first play through to try and get a different ending.Overall, I give this game five stars. It has excellent story, dialogue, graphics, sound, characters, and gameplay...every thing about it is great and it is a world you'll want to get lost in again and again. Alas, it is no Chrono Trigger, and a large part of me wishes they could have tied in some of the characters and places from that game a little more, but oh well. They did a different game in the same style as Chrono Trigger, and it's great fun. There are at least some fun little nostalgic elements, like at one point when you find an enertron and you can hop into it to fully revive your party, and when you get out you find \"you're still hungry\", along with the stomach growling straight from Chrono Trigger. Very fun stuff. Highly recommended to fans of Chrono Trigger, or just anyone who loves a good RPG with lots of replay value.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2005"}

I completed every other installment at least once. I did Double Agent Twice and finished the Coop (which is a different story).When \"Conviction\" came out, I read some reviews criticizing its stealth-ability and saying it is not the same as before. Thus, I wasn't so excited about buying it.Now that I bought it, Splinter Cell is my favorite again. My comments below only cover areas that a lot of people are concerned about:**Gameplay**Game play is amazing. You can go stealth all the way and finish levels without being detected. You have to monitor enemy movements, positions to plan your attack. The mark and execute system is also a nice addition. It may seem boring in the ads and gameplay videos but it is not at all. First of all, it's cool and fits Sam Fisher (the character) as an executioner. Second, you really have to strategize using it because you only get to \"mark and execute\" once after every hand-to-hand takedown.**Stealth**A lot of reviewers did not like how colors faded as you went into dark places. I respect their opinions but for me, it didn't bother me at all. I think it's just a substitute to night vision. A way to know that you're in the dark without actually losing sight of your character. The game just doesn't want you to rely on one gadget for a long time (like Batman's X-Ray vision in Arkhum Asylum) and miss out on the good visuals the game has to offer.**More to Play**After finishing the game, you can still play as one of two other characters in \"Deniable Ops\" with new maps and challenges.Also, just like in \"Double Agent\" there is a Coop Mode with a separate story and new levels. I play this with my little bro and its awesome.There is also something Called \"U Play\" that requires you to go online. I didn't try it yet.The only thing I didn't like about this installment is that, you cannot hide bodies that you've taken out.**Bottom Line**The game is excellent and as a fan of the series I was very much satisfied.

If it weren't for the shoddy control and ridiculous save points, I would be sharing the opinions of every reviewer out there and say this game is a 5 out of 5 or a 9.5 out of 10 like IGN. Unfortunately, cool graphics, a great map, wonderful environments, super smooth 60FPS and a compelling story does not make up for the fact that you will be fighting the godawful controls all the way through.Admittedly , this game is from 2002--which would be the infancy of first person shooters on Consoles. This hardly excuses not using the damn second stick on the Gamecube controller to make this game livable!! Sure, the left trigger locks on which is great to straff and blast through enemies. The problem comes when you have to shoot at things which the game does not consider enemies--like exploding mushrooms, or that rapidly respawning killer grass, or the hives where those big flying bugs come out of. AIming is nearly impossible!! You hold the right trigger and try to move the left stick(the only stick used for control in this game) praying beyond everything that the damn reticule will stay in one place. YOU see the cursor does not stop when you release pressure on the stick!! So you have to do minute motions with the stick and basically fire blindly until random chance has the reticule go over the item you want to shoot at.All of these things were bearable for the first 5 or 6 hours of the game(I explored every nook and cranny I was loving the game so much) The first few bosses were not too bad and then I got to a big bug boss who would recharge with these mirrors. Here is the method. You shoot this boss(for some reason the lock on was very shoddy for this boss) until he gets kind of winded. You then have to shoot a little red spot on the base of the mirror(Sorry for the spoilers but if you want to play this game, you are probably not going to want to read this review anyway right?) To destroy the mirror you have to hold the fire button to do a power shot at it. But the aim is so crappy that you miss half the time!! The first boss of the game was real easy and you could lock and jump sideways. Not sure why but that method did not work with this boss and he absolutely raped me time and time again.To make matters ever worse, this game uses Save spots. This would be okay if the damn save spots were right next to the boss. NOOOOO. YOu respawn way the hell away from the boss and have to do a 5 minute platforming section to get back to him. Why do Japanese games not believe the the checkpoint system? Please tell me why??????Uggh. I think I am just too used to modern games which are a lot more forgiving. So far my experience with the WII has been pretty bad. Should have just stuck with my PS3...","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2010"}

Granted, because it is a remake, it is tough to please all of the fans of the original.As a fan since the very first Final Fantasy, I have enjoyed watching Square fumble around through the years, occasionally bringing American gamers sheer brilliance (FF6, FF7, Chrono Trigger, FFTactics) but often sending us garbage (FF8, FF Mystic Quest, Tobal...).  Though the original Final Fantasy was very good, Final Fantasy IV (FF2 on the SNES release) was the game that set the bar just as Secret of Mana set the Action RPG bar.I have some pros and cons with this version.  But note that the original US release was slightly tweaked for American gamers who Square and Nintendo felt would be turned off by its difficulty.  I made a note of the changes below.  This is a true remake, not a re-release as the GBA and PS1 games were.  For a long time fan of the series, I enjoyed the fresh look and feel of this game while it retained the old school charm from the original.So on to the various versions:Final Fantasy IV Japanese Super Famicon release (can be played via fan-translated ROMs): much higher encounter rate, exp gained slower, gold gained slower, several bosses were very difficult, Cecil had Darkness ability as Dark Knight, Rosa had Pray abilityFinal Fantasy II US release: changed dialogue to be approved for 3 year olds (no mention of death, dead, dying) and included the phrase \"you spoony bard\", changed some item and spell names (White instead of Holy, Light Sword instead of Holy Sword), reduced encounter rate, lower level gain xp requirements, more powerful black magic damage, no Darkness ability for Cecil, Rosa had PRAY changed to AIM (Nintendo probably felt 'pray' would offend someone)Final Fantasy IV PS1 release: made the changes back to the Japanese style, tougher bosses, slightly higher encounter rate, better dialogue, some FMV cut scenes, and the annoying battle command window glitchFinally, Final Fantasy IV DS:Pros: changed to a 3d graphics style (therefore it doesn't feel like playing through the exact same game as before), enhanced musical score, voice acting (kind of a pro and con), cool cut scenes add more drama, higher difficulty, lots of added content, better battle interface (two screen works well), ATB improvedCons: the augment abilities (sorry, I felt that they added a bit too much power and I didn't use them - I preferred the higher difficulty), lengthy summon and special attack sequences in battle, mini map (sorry, I don't like them, I end up staring at it more than the actual screen!)But these cons are minor.  I still enjoyed the game immensely.  I had hoped for a little more bonus content, maybe some extras for the end of the game (mini-games and such).  The other thing that would have been nice: a playable version of the US FF2 complete with silly dialogue (I know you can play on a ROM, but it would have been nice, and wouldn't have taken that much memory, plus many younger players haven't played the original).Overall:  A worthy game for any RPG fan and a beautiful trip down memory lane for those of us who fell in love with the series years ago.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001CM62UM","description":"Thanks to Square-Enix, the original Star Ocean has finally made it to the United States in the form of Star Ocean: First Departure. A PSP remake of Star Ocean, which was never released in the U.S., First Departure adds several new elements, including all new backgrounds and a tweaked battle system, while still preserving the exciting storyline and themes of the original.Star Ocean: First Departure has been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes.View larger.Enter battle with basic melee attacks, special arts, or spellsView larger.In battle, you can control a character while the AI handles your teammates.View larger.Back to the BeginningIt is Space Date 346, and in a sleepy town on the planet Roak, defense-force members Roddick, Millie, and Dorn are on yet another dull patrol when a mysterious plague begins turning people to stone. Fortunately, Ronyx and Ilia, members of a Terran Alliance reconnaissance mission, beam down to the surface just in time. They explain that the plague is actually a biological weapon, and they take the defense-force to the space vessel to discuss how to save Roak from this mysterious attack.The majority of this role-playing game (RPG) actually takes place in the past, because the party realizes that the only way to save the people of Roak is to collect a particular genetic sample from the Roak of old. The game play of First Departure is fairly traditional RPG that has you moving about the world map on your journey, traversing towns and dungeons, progressing the plot as you go.Choose the Right StrategyYou enter battle either using basic melee attacks, special arts that require MP points and that can grow more powerful with use, or spells that also require MP points but take time to cast and can be interrupted before completion.Tactics let you set strategy commands for your characters before they enter battle and can be changed in the middle of battle. All characters will fight according to their set strategy, with different situations requiring different strategies.Private actions are sometimes offered as a character approaches a town on the world map. These private actions depend on timing as well as which characters you have with you as you enter town.. The outcome of these private actions will affect subsequent private actions, for better or worse.All New Artwork and New CharactersStar Ocean: First Departure uses a slightly altered version of the engine used for Star Ocean: The Second Story, but with many similar features. However, the pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D battle fields have been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes, and new playable characters have been added.First Departure has been given a much more dynamic battle system, letting you control a character while the AI handles your teammates. During battle, characters can move freely about the field, executing normal attacks with the X button, and performing special attacks with the L or R triggers. What's more, you can switch characters at any time with a quick press of the Circle button.First Departure also features an item creation system that lets you create new weapons and items to help you in battle, and an extensive skill system for developing your character as you play. You can boost certain party attributes, spending SP on skills to increase your fighters' speed in battle, for example, or spend points that develop your item creation ability and raise your character's strength.","reviewerName":"Blueblur1984","summary":"Meh...it was entertaining","reviewText":"This game sounded great on paper but the story is weak, the characters aren't very well developed and (though it should theoretically have a good replay value) I was more than happy to trade it in after the first play through.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004BD1DWG","description":"","reviewerName":"Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"","summary":"This is to Video Games what Emerald Knights was to Green Lantern Movies","reviewText":"I have a love/hate relationship with the Green Lantern series. On the one hand, it's one of the comic book hero series with the most potential (it's sci-fi, it has a ton of characters and lore to draw from, and features an insane cool weapon in the form of the Green Lantern Power Ring). On the other hand, the series is often convoluted, as they attempt to cram too much plot into a show/movie/comic, it has a tendency to be needlessly violent, and often, it's just plain boring, and incredibly weird. The live-action Green Lantern movie didn't exactly help, as it failed in just about every way possible. But through all that there was a ray of hope. The Green Lantern from Justice League was cool. And Emerald Knights showed that it was indeed possible to create a Green Lantern movie that was fun, exciting, and compelling. And then this game came along...If you've played many action games in the last few years (or some of the old arcade beat-em-ups) you've probably familiar with games like this. It&#8217;s a &#8220;button masher&#8221; where you fight endless hordes of enemies, complete simple objectives, and fight bosses with a combination of traditional gameplay and timed button events (with some fun third person Panzer Dragoon-style shooting for good measure). Has this been done before? Absolutely. Has it been done this well? Rarely.Power Ring UnleashedThe closest game of this type I can think of is The Force Unleashed. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s similar to God of War, but I&#8217;ve never played that game (and never will), and the Force Unleashed is a more similar type of game in that it&#8217;s designed for a younger audience and has you fighting more robots and such as opposed to graphic bloody violence. So it&#8217;s definitely more cartoonish (think the old X-Men Arcade game only in 3D with some other objectives and sequences tossed in).Unlike Force Unleashed, the action here, while quite monotonous, never FEELS monotonous. You have EIGHT assignable attacks. While you might think that trying to play a game about making any weapon imaginable with you mind would leave if you with lousy choices of weapons and too much repetition, the astounding opposite is the reality. Very quickly you will start unlocking new types of attacks, and varying the ones you use adds enormous variety to what might otherwise be monotony.Likewise the quick button timed events are NOT like the ones in Forc e Unleashed. While that game had me repeating the long sequences over and over because of a mistake I made somewhere, the sequences in this game were both much more entertainining and much better executed, with a minimum of frustration.In Brightest Day...Another example of the surprising quality of this game is that it features drop-in local co-op gameplay (a rarity these days). It really shows how much the developer actually cared about providing an enjoyable experience instead of a throw-away tie-in game. The game has been tweaked to make it actually fun, and if like me you just want to get to the end, you can get through the game without ever feeling that it&#8217;s unfair or cheating (throwing impossible objectives or bosses at you suddenly etc, like many other games do).The biggest plus for this game is really that it&#8217;s just so much fun, and so painless to play. If you quit the game it picks up where you left off (not at the beginning of the level). While it could have been another game that just apes the plot of the movie, it instead follows it&#8217;s own take on the Rise of Manhunters plot. There isn't tons of exposition or plot explanation and I&#8217;m grateful for it. Would you rather do you own research to find out more about a comic book universe (such as actually reading a comic or watching a show/movie) or sit through long and pointless cinematics that go on and on (I welcome that in a Metal Gear game, but it doesn't belong in action games)?It&#8217;s Cheap!Seriously, if you are a fan of GOOD action games, and especially if you have even a passing interest in the better parts of the Green Lantern story, you are probably going to love this game. It isn't deep. It isn't long. And it doesn't ever try to be anything other than what it clearly is (an arcade style action game). But it is VERY GOOD. And at this price, it's a bargain.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2014"}

I chose the Witch Doctor to be my first play through, though the other characters look fun, especially the deamon hunter. The only thing I have to say is they should have allowed you to customize the characters so that way if you play with other people and there are two of the same class you can tell who is who a lot easier. Only played an hour into it, but I can tell this will get as much play as Borderlands does and the multiplayer is a good change over the glut of FPS that is out there these days.

While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C.

And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"John Whaley","summary":"You Will Question Reality","reviewText":"Despite the stigma that the Gamecube is just for kids, a surprising number of high-quality games have been released aimed at more mature audiences.

Dishonored had it's moments but did not live up to expectations.  Good marketing doesn't equal satisfying product.  However, as another reviewer put it, the gameplay and interface are very much like Bioshock, which I agree with and is definitely a  plus.  Comparing the story to Bioshock's however, was a hideous error, in my opinion.  The story of Dishonored is pretty much unimaginative sci fi when compared to the story in Bioshock.  The Colonial-Sci Fi of Dishonored is not the conjuration of a master story teller, just as Arabian Knights with light sabres bent like scimitars would not be.  However, the controls were good, the combat was fun, graphics a little too Disney for me, but it excelled in the stealth category, which is probably why I didn't like this game more.  Stealth wasn't required, but with Dishonored, either you sneak or you slaughter openly against high odds- that's your only choice.  Though it was fun for a while, it's not a game I would play again.  Finally, THIS IS NOT AN OPEN WORLD GAME.  Your choices were predetermined, and though it was fun sneaking through sewers or sneaking through houses, or sneaking anywhere I could find off the beaten path, each area was small, and on the whole, the entire \"world\" of this game does not compare in size or openness or options to a true open world like Skyrim, Fallout 3 or even Dragon's Dogma.

First of all it has a hell of a story line and very good gaphics for a game in this type of category.  The ghost pop up and disseapear during gameplay freaking you out a little.  You have one weapon which is a camerea and you kill the ghost with it which sounds a little stupid but it's actually really cool.

You best play this game with someone or at least during the day because if you play this by your self at night you'll be scared silly.  This game is worth every penny and in my opinion is better then silent hill and resident evil.  The game takes quite a while to beat and once you beat it you can play it on another difficulty which has a slightly different story plot towards the end, otherwise there is minimal replay value.

It's somewhat marketed as a kid's game so I decided to play on 'hard' skill level. And let me tell you, I died a ton of times in this game which is a good thing for me! I did not want an adventure game that was a cake walk and very easy to finish. I enjoyed this game because you have three basic fighting styles to pick from. There's hack and slash, third person shooter, and stealth. Although I chose to use all three, you really don't have to in order to get through. I also liked that I had 6 ninjas to choose from and all 6 served a purpose.There are two problems I had with this game. The pointless snowball level, and the low variety of enemies. Like many reviewers stated, the snowball level added nothing to the game and was unnecessarily difficult, it really hurt the overall experience. Kid's game or not, I need to see a large variety of baddies. I think you should see different looking enemies with each level. There were only a handful of enemies throughout the game. Samurai with a sword, bow and arrow, exploding bow and arrow, staff, medium samurai, large samurai, and a ghost. And they all pretty much looked the same (except the ghost).In all, I thought this was a really fun open world game that you will have trouble putting down once you get into it. It's quite a steal for the price Amazon is charging!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2011"}

There are some cinematics and dialogue that explain a bit of the past, though.  I think the story is great and while I'm not finished yet with the campaign I cannot wait to see (SPOILER ALERT!!!) what happens to Kerrigan at the end.The graphics are pretty solid. Colors are bright and vivid, animations are smooth, and the CG work is excellent.  I give props to Blizzard for keeping up with the times for once (everyone knows how outdated Diablo 2's graphics were, lol).  I give the graphics a 4 out of 5.Sound is also superb.  The original music is back, with slight modifications, as well as some new stuff that's pretty cool.  All the sounds are flawless, and the voice acting is superb.  I give the sound a 5 out of 5.Presentation gets a 5 out of 5 as well.  The menus are nifty and easy to navigate.  The battlecruiser flying in the background is also real cool.Gameplay is, of course, the bread and butter of SC2.  If you enjoyed the first game then you will enjoy this one as well.  I'll start with the pros first.  The campaign is great and although some people say it's short, it is fairly long for today's standards.  I'm 17 of 26 missions in and around 10 hours of play time.  While the story isn't as huge as Warcraft's, Blizzard did an excellent job of making the story an emotional experience for what it is.  I also love the new characters they've added.  Tychus is especially cool.  There is plenty of added replay value in the campaign, as there are lots of achievments to aquire accross all difficulty levels.While the campaign is an overall satisfying experience, multiplayer is somewhat of a let down compared to the original.  Blizzard re-vamped Battle.net and it isn't what it used to be.  It works more like Xbox Live or PSNetwork in regards to the matchmaking system.  There are no longer chat rooms, no clans can be made, and the custom games are lacking compared to SC1.  I have yet to see a top vs bottom map and that was one of the most popular maps played.  The map editor is obviously more difficult to use because of all the extra utilities and technology included.  Another shocker is the lack of LAN play.  Blizzard did this because of pirating issues but it upset a ton of people, not including myself.  I feel that with how widespread broadband internet is today,  LAN really isn't needed.  Just my opinion though.  With all the stuff that Blizzard left out of the new Battle.net experience, I am still enjoying the heck out of playing online.Another thing that made a ton of people mad was the excusion of the zerg and protoss campaigns.  Blizzard is definitely going to get their money from people with SC2 because most likely each expansion is going to cost $40.  So, for the full SC2 experience you will most likely be shelling out $140 for the entire game when it's complete, and if you bought the collector's edition then...well you know.  I really don't have an issue with this since I am not hard up for cash but it does seem like a company of Blizzard's stature does not need to rip people off; especially since they are raking in the money from WoW.  I give the gameplay a 4 out of 5Anyways, with all the quirks about SC2 there is so much to like about it that I have to put the nonsense aside and enjoy this game for myself.  If you are a fan of RTS games and the original SC, then you cannot go wrong with SC2.  Just like almost any game, it's easy to learn but difficult to master.  Go out and buy this today.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2010"}

The game was stable, never crashed, and the graphics and artwork, as well as the imagery is pretty nice in general.The story is interesting, not totally original, and we've seen it before in various different incarnations, but the blend of Japanese style makes it subtly more interesting in many ways.  The extremely futuristic Japanese mega cities and all the cool techno ideas that are there definitely added to the ambiance.The characters are decent for sure, with most of the voice acting pretty convincing, and a decent type of squad based camaraderie that was actually better than most squad oriented action games.  The character driven story twists are even a bit surprising in a good way.The action is mostly good, with the usual video game diversity of enemies.  Later in the game, there are quite a few really interesting enemy robot types that keep it interesting for sure.  The basic action, shooting, and combat is decent enough, although not exactly stellar.As far as the overall gameplay, good, but not great.  There are no quick saves, just checkpoints.  Fortunately, they are in most cases close enough together where you don't want to always pull your hair out.  But, and a big BUT, this is a game focused on Boss battles in much of the game.  I personally, don't like most boss battles, as I find them time consuming and annoying most of the time.  But I can enjoy them if there's at least some relief, like quick saves, or status bars to know how you're doing against the boss, or any way to at least know it won't last 45 minutes and you die in the end and have to do it over and over and over.Unfortunately, because of all the boss battles, it gets exhausting and frustrating, as you have NO idea how you're doing.  In certain cases, there are incremental save points with the bosses, but in most cases, its yet another 20-30 minute grind when you get killed at the last minute.  This is simply one of the most annoying and un-enjoyable things that many video games seem to have lately.Now for the not so good. The controls are painfully bad.  Not a little bad, but really bad.  There is an auto-cover system that also doubles as the running/jumping/tumbling key combo, that causes you to be in the wrong place in much of the game.  You think you're jumping out of the way, but you end up auto covering in FRONT of the cover point and dying.  Dumb, just dumb.  And then there's the really stupid slowdowns in action, where you have to look at someone when they ramble on and on about something, and your character simply doesn't move fast, even if you need to.  What were they thinking?The controls and their awkward problems make the overall experience highly compromised, in whats a basically good and enjoyable game.  Its not really a case of console-itis, as much as its the fundamental design decisions about what are valid controls and not to the characters.  It just doesn't make sense, and really detracts from the gameplay.All in all, I liked it enough to play through it.  The story and characters, the settings and overall game were pretty good.  If the controls were just much less weird, and more precise, it could have been a great game, as the overall concept is pretty good.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2012"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"John Doe","summary":"Halo reloaded","reviewText":"True- there is a TON of Hype surrounding this game due to Halo 1 selling 5 million plus.

Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself having a lot of fun playing through this game.  Granted they're not bringing anything new to the table, but sometimes sticking to the tried and true methods works fine.  In this case it did, while it's not original, I still found this game quite fun.  They're using the Unreal graphics engine, but they seem to have designed it to be a lot more like Half Life 2.The storyline is also much improved in my opinion.  It doesn't feel as completely outrageous as the first game.  The first game was so out there that it became sort of stupid after a while.  But Blacksite deals more with developing new technologies.  So you spend most of your game fighting these super soldiers and robotic machines.  There are some alien creatures to fight as well, and they look a lot better than the ones you fought in the first game.  They actually look a little like the things from Independence Day, in their battle suits, but walking on all fours.  There are also these behemoth like creatures that come out of the ground that you have to kill.An added element that I thought was really cool was that you get to drive around in vehicles this time.  Usually I'm really iffy about these things because it's always a gamble when it comes to vehicle controls.  Luckily the vehicles are fairly easy to control in my opinion.  The only problem I have is that you can go really fast with them and it's hard to control at certain speeds.  Then again... I've never seen a game handle the speed functionality all that well.  I think Halo is the only one I can think where I felt pretty satisfied with the vehicle controls.Like in the last game you do get a squad that can work with you.  This actually goes on for most of the game.  Thankfully the AI is still good in this regard; the squad never really seemed to get in my way and was actually helpful rather than a detriment.  I like seeing that companies are finally starting to get these aspects correct.The weapons in this game were pretty run of the mill.  I felt like I had access to more alien technology in the last game, but the lack of this didn't hurt this game any for me.  I really enjoyed using the sniper rifle a lot in this.  That functionality was better compared to the last game, if I remember correctly.The environment this time around was a lot more destructible and I found that a lot more fun.  One part that was kind of annoying, though, was that you could destroy these crates, but there was never anything in them!  Don't these developers know that if you can destroy crates in a game you put ammo or some other incentive in there?  They did keep the dossier search from the last game.  This encouraged me to search out the environment and world a lot more and I'm glad they kept this feature as well.If you really enjoyed Half Life 2 and games of that ilk, then Blacksite: Area 51 won't steer you wrong.  Sure you might not be nearly as engrossed with it, but it's a fun game.  It's definitely not worth full retail price, but it's worth getting when the price drops.  It's actually not a very long game either, but I feel like it's just the right length.  This is the type of game you don't want hitting epic levels, because it would just get overly redundant.  It never reaches that point and the game feels like it's just long enough.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2009"}

When you learn to master the extremely tight controls, you will realize the unleashing of the highest quality a$$-kicking of any game ever made. This epic title may be the greatest video game ever produced.Graphics - On XBOX - second to none. The fluid frame rates never stutter. Load times are short, despite the elaborate level designs. Level design is so important in a game and NGB excels with levels that contain incredible variety and top quality & creative designs. The character movements of Ryu Hyabusa and the bosses have to be experienced to be believed. No other video game hero comes close. Cut scenes are also awesome on par with Metal Gear Solid 3 for PS2.Gameplay - The tightest controls ever. When you die in this game, (and you will die often), it won't be because the controls suck, it will be because you suck. When you defeat the game you will graduate to a whole new level of video game geekdom as all other games will be defenseless against your skills. Half way through the game, as you realize the full potential of a$$-kickery that Ryu Hyabusa can deliver, you are left in awe of the physical prowess of the character and the plethora of weapons of mass destruction at his disposal. For those who have a PS2 and played God of War, you know that game was awesome in it's own right and can be fairly compared to NGB. However, Kratos-GoW's hero, can't hold a candle to Ryu Hyabusa. This game is just so fun and satisfying to play.Sound - Great ambient and special effects sounds that take full advantage of a good surround sound system with Dolby Digital capability. Musical score is A- Grade, although it is second to God of War's amazing musical score. Cut scenes shine, as well, in this department.Overall - For those of you who don't fear a challenge and are ready to take on a truly epic title - then you must own and play Ninja Gaiden Black.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2005"}

The controls are improved over Heavy Rain, allowing for more diversity in game-play. In particular, the use of Aiden was an interesting feature allowing for exploration and environment manipulation.The plot is told in a scattered fashion, which allows for intrigue, foreshadowing, and better understanding of the games primary characters. Plot is central to this game, however there are limited events that actually impact the outcome of the game - it isn't to the end of the game that you make plot effecting decisions, but those decisions are only available based on actions taking during the game. Often described as choose your own adventure without choice one needs to keep in mind there are plot points in the game that will vary based on player performance and decisions.Ellen Page does an excellent job voicing Jodi, as does Willem Dafoe voicing Nathan.

After all the tech demos and previews of the game that were shown, I certainly had no room to disagree. It look absolutely marvelous. And when it was released, it still looked marvelous, but it played too much like the tech demo that we'd all seen.After a few hours of a convoluted story, repetitive missions, gameplay hindered by lack of polish (not to mention the middle-eastern protagonist speaking with an American accent...somehow!) I put the game down and never picked it up again. I am very glad it was only a rental.Two years and an onslaught of mediocre reviews later, ASSASSIN'S CREED 2 is unleashed upon the masses. Needless to say, even though I am a big fan of the Renaissance Era, I waited for the first volley of reviews before I went out and bought this game.ASSASSIN'S CREED 2 not only redeems its predecessor's many follies, but it is most definitely one of the best games of the year.You are once again playing as Desmond Miles playing through the memories of his ancestors. This particular ancestor is Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a citizen of Italy during the Renaissance Era. After members of his family are executed by way of betrayal, Ezio takes up his birthright and begins to walk the path of his father in becoming an Assassin.The STORY, after everything is said and done, is amazing. It's thick with superb characterization, surprising plot-twists, and a conspiracy that's so intricate and spans so many centuries, it would probably give LOST a run for it's money. I came to love Ezio's character (as opposed to loathing Altair) and how he changes so much from the time he takes his first life, to when his story comes to an end. And since you are learning many techniques along with him, you will feel as though you are growing as he grows.The WORLD through which Ezio skips through is probably one of the best sandbox-type worlds I've seen; rivaling OBLIVION, FALLOUT 3, and GTA IV in both scale and design. Just from what I know, everything is as close to historically accurate as it can get. Buildings such as Il Duomo look and feel as big as they should be. There are five different cities (including the one you come to own) and each feels so grand in scale that it's hard to believe that there are others just as big in one game. Renaissance Italy has never looked so good.The GAMEPLAY is better than it ever was. You are given an array of weapons to use against your targets, including: a sword, dagger, throwing knives, smoke bombs, poisons, and even money. And since the world is so organic, you aren't limited to just chopping your way through each mission. Whether it be stealth, brute force, or distraction, you will have many ways to accomplish each mission and side-mission. And with the much-praised freerunning system, even more ways are opened up.On top of this, you are given control of your own city. Yeah! All of the weapons, paintings (keep in mind, these are Renaissance paintings) and armor pieces that you buy are put on display here in brilliant fashion. You can also restore shops and certain locations within this city, which will bring in more foot-traffic that will add to the wealth of your town. It won't be long before the gloomy and boarded-up mansion that you take over becomes something more akin to a palace.The COMBAT is fairly simple, if that can be called a detriment. There's one button to attack and one to counter. It seems like it could get boring really fast, but I've been playing the game for nearly 30 hours now and I've yet to sigh out of frustration over an encounter with the guards. It feels fresh every time, and the kill sequences are brutal and bloody to behold. It will definitely not get old, unlike other games likeStar Wars: The Force Unleashed.If I had to say anything CRITICAL, it would be that the game is slightly too easy. Once you're done with the game, you should breeze through any achievements that you have left over, which leaves you with very little to do after the game is finished. Of course, there are a multitude of different side-missions (such as assassination missions, races, events where your goal is to beat the crap out of someone) but once you finish the game and upgrade your villa, there is little reason to actually go through and finish any of them. They all just equate to more money, which you will have more than enough of by the end of the game.And while the cities are near-perfect in their construction, the countrysides, while still gorgeous, are absolutely dull to walk through. There's nothing to really interact with and it all feels more like a background than anything else. I would've liked to see an environment more like in OBLIVION, where I didn't care that I had to walk clear across the map.In the third game, I would definitely like more of a challenge that would equate to some really good rewards and some very difficult achievements to complete. Collecting feathers is not difficult, just time-consuming. I hope that this is changed in the third game.In the end, ASSASSIN'S CREED 2 managed to fulfill every promise that it's predecessor put forth, and improved on those promises tenfold. This is a fun and beautiful game that should not be passed up. I've never played a sequel (besides maybeFallout 3: Game of The Year Edition) that changed up its own formula so much for the better. When studios like Ubisoft make so much money from one game, there is usually very little reason to go in a new direction with their IP (I'm looking at you, HALO 3), but so much has changed in this world inside the head of Desmond Miles, and it's changed for the better.I'm already eagerly awaiting ASSASSIN'S CREED 3 to see what age we'll be visiting next, but hopefully this isn't the last we'll hear from Ezio Auditore da Firenze.\"It'sa me! Mario!\" Bless them for that little homage. xD","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2009"}

It took about one hour just to download updates and also cache 8GB of data for faster play. Once I get to play for couple of hours, it is obvious that everything I love about GT5 Prologue is same or better - from beauty of the scenary, tracks and to the cars. The GT mode is still the race participating, money making events but with more levels than GT5 Prologue. The arcade mode is great to jump around to different track and scenes and cars.One major problem I ran into is compatibility with my Logitech G25's stick shift. At the beginning of the race, I can shift into different gears (1-6) using the gear box. But during the race, it would lose it. Shifting to next gear or previous will always result in \"N\" (neutral). I had to resort to paddle shifting. Also I didn't notice any force feedback. Will check with the support.I haven't tried online. The game says it's currently busy/overwhelmed. I understand that's how it is usually during a new release.But anyhow, with only couple of hours of play, it's already clear to me that this game at $50 - $60 is well worth the price tag.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2010"}

All that's missing is you!","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"Dead to Rights. . .","reviewText":"\"Dead to Rights\" is the kind of non-stop action game that will remind you why you play console games in the first place. Though the game's premise, style, and source of inspiration are easy to compare to \"Max Payne,\" the games themselves are readily distinguishable from one another, and both are equally as worthy of your gaming attentions.\"Dead to Rights\" casts you as Jack Slate, a larger-than-life cop in the fictional cesspool of Grant City, whose only real friend appears to be his canine partner, Shadow. Early on, Slate discovers the body of his murdered father in a construction yard, and then the action comes hot and heavy from then on.Slate's gun-slinging antics and martial arts brawls are quick to remind one of a John Woo film. The hand-to-hand fighting system is immensely enjoyable and reminiscent of updated classics like \"Double Dragon\" and \"Final Fight.\" The majority of the game's setpeices, though, involve thousands of flying bullets, and the gunplay is truly extraordinary. Capping the bad guys is rarely this satisfying, particularly in a game viewed from a 3rd person perspective. To add icing to the cake, Slate has a series of violent \"disarms\" he can employ to turn a battle in his favor, and executing them properly is gratifying in all its M-rated glory. \"Dead to Rights\" wisely switches between hand-to-hand battles and fierce gunfights at a fairly regular interval to ensure that the game doesn't get repetitive.Unfortunately, \"Dead to Rights\" also favors mini-games and puzzles that crop up every now and again to slow down the action. The idea is a sound one, but most of these sessions are just exercises in button-mashing frenzy. On the plus side, though, the mini-games segue into the storyline almost seamlessly, so they're not as jarring as they might otherwise have been. And speaking of the storyline, it's sure to entertain, and is helped tremendously by talented voice-actors and some truly cinematic cut-scenes.Aside from the mini-games and some questionable decisions in level design (which are an exception rather than a rule), \"Dead to Rights\" is a triumph. The game is bloody good fun from beginning to end, and more addictive than a set of Max Payne's painkillers. This remains one of the best action titles available on the PS2, and it should not, under any circumstances, be missed by fans of the genre.Final Score: A-","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2003"}

Great aspects from both games that i loved in both games are in this one.  Dante's inferno had a more sexual theme to it than GOW so what does Splatterhouse have? Hidden pictures of your naked girlfriend scattered throughout the game that you can put together and veiw as sort of amateur porn pics.  Gow had great visuals and story.  Unfortunately Splatterhouse has none of these but when you get a game where you grab an enemy and dismember it in a text based minigame you can't help but compare it to GOW.Visually as i said this game does not compare to GOW or Dante's Inferno.  It looks and plays likeAfro Samuraiexcept for TONS of blood, Humor and endless ways to kill your enemies.Gameplay can be a bit hard to figure out.  You can't really stand up and mash buttons til everyone on the screen is dead (not until you unlock a bunch of skills first atleast).  You have to use the block/roll button for defense if you get surrounded or if you unlocked certain skills you can bulldoze your way through it or just grab the nearest enemy and swing them 360 til you have enough room.One cool aspect of the game is the healing feature that uses spilt blood that you have accumulated by killing enemies to heal yourself.  Which is incredibly useful if your getting your ass kicked and your surrounded by a ton of enemies, you just throw out spikes that literally suck the blood out of the nearby enemies completely refilling your health.Fun factor all depends on how much gore you can stand.  If you think gutting a centuar in GOW3 was gross then you haven't seen anything yet. In Splatterhouse Rick opens the mouth of a enemy snapping the skull from the jaw then shoving his hand down their throat pulling out the lungs and throwing them on the floor.  If your opposed to that type of gore and violence then this game might not be as fun for you.Update and Spoiler alert sorta: Sickest part of the game is pulling out the sphincter of a mutant demon frog man.Much like Afro Samurai the music was a great compliment to the game but unlike Afro Samurai this game is not Repetitive or easy.Beating certain chapters of the game unlocks the original Splatterhouse games (1,2 & 3) as well as different versions of the survival arena where you go to a certain level and beat wave after wave of enemies until you die.Overall great game for fans of blood and violence period.  If you want something that looks amazing buyGod of War: Collection/God of War III.  If you want something other than GOW with an incredibly perverted storyline from begining all the way to Satan's dong swinging end battle thenDante's Inferno Divine Editionis for you.  If you want a game that is all about blood, gore, violence, humor, heavy metal and beating enemies with dismembered parts of your or your enemies body then get Splatterhouse.  It has lived up to my expectations and it just might surprise you how much fun it really is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2010"}

I know we should not have to do this but its better than NOT being able to play a game that has the potential to be the BEST RPG ever made.

This concern disappeared right after I put in Pilot Wings. The most incredible illusion of looking through a window occurs and you really feel as if the screen is almost unlimited due to this effect. Really stunning and convinced me that there is unlimited capabilities for the 3DS.I have played Pilot Wings, Ridge Racer and PES Soccer and each game had stunning 3D that transformed the experience. I should add it took a few days after the system arrived before I got the games, so going I had only the pre-loaded software to go by and really was not as impressed with the AR games that others seem to be. Also the OK Go video has some nice 3D but still not mindblowing. It really took the arriving games for me to finally be blown away by the 3DS.As far as the reports of headaches and/or dizziness I very much recommend you simply ease yourself into playing with the system. The more you play the more you you get used to being able to just focus on the sweet spot of the screen and will find that the annoying blur that happens when you look even slightly away from sweet spot will not happen much anymore. It really is about training yourself to just become familiar with how to view the screen.

AND THIS ONE IS INCREDIBLE!","reviewText":"Although probably not the greatest Kirby game ever, this is definitely the best handheld Kirby out there.Kirby Canvas Curse has Kirby regularly doing his thing in Dreamland, when an evil sorceress appears out of the sky. She waves her magical paintbrush, and the world turns to paint! Kirby gives chase, but the sorceress turns him into a ball! Helpless, Kirby lies on the ground and sees the magical paintbrush. Then, it transports to you on a ray of light! (also known as your stylus)This game is probably the only Kirby game with a good story (I haven't played any of the classics so I don't quite know). You play with Kirby as a ball. You can touch Kirby to make him dash forward and attack or just go faster, and you use your stylus to draw lines for him to ride. There are 6 main levels each with 3 smaller levels within, which each have 3 stages. Once you clear one level, you can go on to the next and the next, until you reach level 7 after facing a few boss challenges along the way. Here you see \"The World of Drawcia\". Here, you go through two stages. Once through, you see a very strange mirror. Once you enter, you are put in fierce battle with Drawcia Sorceress! I won't elaborate further.In each stage of each mini level of each level, you can find a Medal. There are 250 levels to hunt for and collect. However, most of the medals are NOT found in the stages. They are found-no, earned-in something called Rainbow Run. Here, after you have completed a LEVEL, you will find these mini levels again. However, you will be trying to either finish a certain stage as fast as possible, or will be trying to use as little ink for lines as possible. I have currently beaten the game (minus 3 medals) and now find Rainbow Road the only thing that is very satisfying.These medals can be traded for prizes inside \"Medal Swap\". Here you can get things from new courses in Rainbow Road to new characters! These new characters you must use in order to completely beat the game. Once you beat the game with all 5 characters and have gotten all the medals, you will have beaten Kirby Canvas Curse!This is a game that needs to be in every gamer's library of games. This one is just too good to pass up. I give it 5 stars out of honest. That is what I think! I'm not just over doing the star button here, I MEAN IT!! If you don't get it, sorry for you.

I have tried a number of different headsets over the years and this one tops them all without question.  The sound quality never suffers as a result of poor wireless connectivity as with some other headsets.  The sound is ALWAYS crystal clear and I have yet to hear even one dropout or distorted glitch.  The sound quality delivered by the XP510 is also the best I have heard from a gaming headset and also earns perfect marks.  The low end is strong and the mids and highs are nicely balanced.Setup is extremely simple and will cause you absolutely no problems.  Another great thing is that the headset uses a rechargeable battery instead of consuming tons of AA or AAA batteries like others.  This will really add up over time and will make up for a decent bit of the extra expense of this unit.  These headsets also have Bluetooth, so you can connect them to your phone and use them as a phone headset if you choose.Bottom line: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED5/5 stars","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0HIC8","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Posey","summary":"Rift - First Impressions","reviewText":"As some of you may know, I'm a pretty big MMORPG gamer.  What's an MMORPG?  An MMORPG is a massive multiplayer online role playing game.  Think World of Warcraft and you'll understand.  Basically any game where you have a bunch of people simultaneously playing and \"living\" in a world performing actions that both shape it and build upon it, be it economy, dungeons, socially, etc.  It's a fascinating thing to experience a living breathing MMO and one thing I have really come to enjoy over the year is playing MMO's early in their life.  Since the new computer I had built came last Friday and the early start preorder for Rift began the previous day, I figured this would be the perfect game to test out the new rig while also testing out a new world.  Read on to see how I fared in Rift.You wouldn't be far off to say that Rift is similar to World of Warcraft.  But, in the same vein, you wouldn't be far off if you said it was nothing like it.  That's just the nature of MMO's.  Sure, they share a lot in common, but you often have to look at the defining features and how they differentiate themselves from the pack to really get a feel for what is being offered.  So, let's get the similarities to other games out of the way first.  Rift is an MMO where lots of people play simulatenously, questing, chatting, killing monsters for loot and experience to get to higher levels.  Their's mounts, a mail system, an auction house, the whole nine yards.  Everything you'd expect to be present in a next gen MMO is there.  This is pretty standard stuff nowadays though (unless of course you're FFXIV...ouch.)The story of Rift is actually pretty decent from the get go.  You create a character from one of two sides, the Guardians or the Defiants.  I picked Guardian so I can't speak to the Defiant storyline, but in a nutshell the Guardian storyline involved you partaking in a war, dying, and then being brought back to life by the gods as their chosen warrior.  In the training missions you'll fight the war to it's conclusion and then be transported 20 years into the future where you are awoken by the gods to once again bring peace to the land.  It's a near concept, but it sounds more epic that it really is.  Although, I did find myself anticipating story quests to find out what was going on.  It's pretty solid overall, but nothing amazing yet.  Then again, I'm still early in the game.Like all MMO's, you're going to need to create a class to get started.  This is one of the ways in which Rift shines apart from the other MMO's like it.  When creating your character, you have to pick one of four classes - a warrior, a mage, a rogue, or a cleric.  This is a final choice and it dictates how your character will progress, so make sure you choose wisely.  After this, you enter the game and are immediately told to pick a sort of sub class.  For instance, I picked a warrior for my character and then in game I chose to be a Beastmaster warrior.  A beastmaster has an animal companion who fights at his side and they work off each others strengths in battle.  I believe there are 8 total you could choose from up front for your first class.  After a couple quests, you are given the choice to unlock another sub class.  This is where you are introduced to how the class sytem works in Rift.  In Rift, you choose 3 subclasses and then mix and match the skills you want between the three to make up whatever type of character you want.  Honestly, in my opinion, this is brilliant.  In other games, you are given a predefined character that you can grow with some options, but not many to how they will turn out.  In Rift, the options are multiplied by 3.  This really allows the player to create a unique class that is suited to their unique playstyles.  You can also unlock additional sub-classes and then mix and match which ones you use on the fly.  It really creates a truly dynamic experience that I think will allow for some amazing player builds.Just like in other MMO's, you are going to level your character by doing quests and dungeons all the while picking up loot and grinding to the higher levels.  That's pretty standard fare for MMO's nowadays.  What Rift brings new to this genre, is it's namesake, rifts.  Rifts are world events (meaning they happen out in the open, not in instanced dungeons) that pop up out of nowhere.  The sky opens up and demons or elementals come pouring out wreaking havoc across the land.  You need to team up with other people in the immediate vicinity (or call friends in to help) and fight back to the invaders and close the rift.  What happens if you don't?  Well, the world changes.  The enemies will take over your towns, kill quest givers (meaning you can't turn stuff in), and make life all the more difficult until you quell their forces.  So far, this has been a resounding success.  When you hear the war drums pounding and the rift logos lighting up on the world map, people flock to the location to participate in the battle.  Rewards are given based on participation and everyone seems to work together well (at least in the early going ons).  I have seen some events that went completely awry and towns were taken over and players had to strategize to take them back.  That was truly epic.The graphics in Rift are really beautiful.  It shows that the devs started out looking to make a great looking game with the attention to detail in the characters and the zones.  You'll spend a good deal of time just checking out things because it looks so cool in the distance or something took you off guard.  As someone who could never play on max settings before (pre new computer) this is a welcome addition.  In talking with other players in general chat though, you don't need a powerhouse of a PC to play the game.  You can turn the settings down and be just fine, even with some pretty old computers.  With my old dinosaur I was able to run on low in the beta and have a decent experience.While I covered the bigger things in the game I experienced, there are also some smaller things that really stuck out.  Like other popular MMO's out there, Rift has an achievement system.  If that's your thing, it's here.  There are also collection items that you can find in the world that allow you to pick up and learn more about the history of the zone, races, and wars going on in the Rift universe.  Crafting professions are pretty solid although I have to admit, I haven't done as much with them as I had hoped.  You don't need to buy equipment to do them though and you can have three at any given time.So, the big question - will Rift be around a year from now or is it another MMO that will fall victim to the behemoth of WoW.  I can't answer that.  My guess is that yes it will still be around but it really comes down to the player base.  There's enough here to keep players invested and playing for a while, that's for sure.  With the game officially releasing yesterday, the servers were full to the brim so it looks like Trion are keeping busy making things enjoyable for everyone on release.  I heard of no release day issues and everyone seemed to be handling things well.  So, if you are an early adopter to MMO's, you should come right in and enjoy the newest next gen MMO on the market that really is a great game.  If you are a little hesitant, then wait a little and see where it goes.  With more and more people logging hours into the game, you'll get a feel for how people warm up to the game and if it has a long shelf life.  So far though, the game has been pretty good at keeping my attention.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2011"}

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising. Players can choose from six different classes in multiplayer, each with its own set of pros and cons. Just as in the single-player mode, multiplayer games will feature dynamic elements, making each session unique.You can explore the world of Far Cry 2 from inside a car or flying on a glider.","reviewerName":"F. B","summary":"A good game held back by some annoying gameplay issues","reviewText":"Far Cry 2 was somewhat of a gamble for me, i was hearing mix things about the game, i had never played the original Far Cry, but i was itching for a new FPS(first person shooter)and wasn't feeling the new Call of Duty:World at War, and Fallout 3 hadn't come out yet, but in the end my FPS addiction took hold and i went for it.  And after about 25 hours of gameplay this is what i've found...The Goodness -The graphics are great!  The Africa setting is well done, it all looks how you would expect a current gen game to look that was set in Africa.  Vegetation, rolling hills, desert, jungle, grasslands which all have a distinct feel to them, as well as some animals here and there that liven up the various areas.The guns all have a solid feel to them, plus there is a nice variety of them, vehicles handle well and there is plenty of stuff to shoot at as well as fire propagation which is a nice touch.  Everything in the game is done from a first person view even including the cut scenes, as well as healing oneself by various over-the-top quick fixes, such as taking a bullet out of your arm with a knife or cracking your arm back in place, etc.Being able to do most things in the game how you want too. No set path you have to walk on.The actual gameplay and story are just alright, they could've been better, theres a lot of moments that are repeated through out your playing experience that make you wonder what the developers were thinking.The Badness -Enemy AI, no matter how hard i tried sneaking up on enemies is extremly hard to do in this game(not in a good way), i could be up on a ridge half a mile away from the enemy camp behind a tree and the moment i stick my head out all of them seem to know i'm there???  Kind of odd.  And once you take out one enemy, whether its with a sniper rifle from a far, up close with a silenced weapon or with your blade, some how all of the other enemies in the camp know somethings wrong which sucks you right out of the experience.Guard post, when you're doing a mission you usually have to travel an insane amount of distance from point A to point B and between you and the mission is about 2-3 guard post, now it usually takes about 10 minutes to get to where you need to go and having to fight to get there becomes annoying very quickly, especially that once you're done with the mission, you have to drive back and do it all over again becuase the guards within the guard posts re-spawn after a short amount of time and instead of it being fun it's just frustrating because you have to eliminate everyone once again.Driving, shooting, driving, shooting, mission, driving, shooting, etc...by the time it's all done you've added 20min to your mission, which is a lot when you have to do that for EVERY SINGLE MISSION.  A fast travel save system would work much better(think Oblivion), granted there is a fast travel bus system in the game, but the actual mission areas are usually far enough away from the drop off point of a bus to still be annoying.Malaria, you get malaria early on in the game and you have to do certain missions to get more pills, know what that means?  More driving and guard post.  They should've just made it one mission for the cure, not just more pills which you constantly have to do throughout the game, come on now?  Think i say, think!Multiplayer -It's okay, nothing that's going to tear you away from whatever your current online game is now.  They do have an unlocking system within their multiplayer, it's more of a thined out version of the Call of Duty 4 unlock system without the addiction quality of COD4.  And one of my pet peeves are online games that make everyone in the lobby click \"ready\" to play, which just slows down the game because you always have some people that don't click ready for some reason, take the option out like most online shooting games and things go alot faster.  Because of this, i would be in the lobby for close to 5 min sometimes, just waiting for everyone to be ready.The randomness -This has happend twice to me all ready in this game and it's just weird.  Apparently the enemies send off a crazy driver after you every once in awhile, they're usually in a truck with a mounted gun but sometimes it's just a bad guy in a car, it's really hard to hear the car coming and a lot of times when i've been on foot i've actually been run over by this random car that comes from no where, i'm all alone, walking to the next mission, no enemies in sight, and BAMN! run over by a car, just a little awkward.Final verdict -I don't think is game is worth $60, its worth $40, but not $60.  They get points for trying something new.  Some good ideas, awesome graphics, but some of the decisions that were made by the developers don't make sense.  Some ideas work, most of them are just annoying.  Definitely worth checking out, just do so before you buy it. I would give this game 3 1/2 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2008"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place.

Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Destitute","summary":"After four long years, the evil is back","reviewText":"Thirteen years ago, the first Resident Evil was released, and despite its confusing controls, frustrating gameplay, and horrendous voice acting, it quickly became the number one survival horror series. Nine years later, after many sequels, some of them non-canon, or not having anything to do with the main story, RE4 was released for the Gamecube, with a complete revamp of the gameplay. Gone were the complex puzzles, tank controls, and the zombies, but it was replaced by a fast-paced shooter that was fun to play over and over again. Now that the sequel has arrived, is it a worthy counterpart to RE4 and a great way to finish off the series?GRAPHICS: RE5 shows the beauty that the 360/PS3 is capable of. Beautifully designed character models and detailed monsters and enemies, along with amazing shadow effects, lighting, and an environment make it the best looking Resident Evil yet.MUSIC: RE5 contains a score written as if it were a Hollywood movie. But like movie music, it melds into the picture itself, not making you notice it much.VOICE ACTING: Yeah, we've gone a long way from the ear-grating voices of the original, when people were grateful to even have voice acting in games. The RE series has had a problem with keeping their voice actors for returning characters (especially Wesker. That confuses me, because why would you NOT want to return to voice a character as awesome as him? I'd voice him for free,) so all the returning characters have new voices, which to say are well-done.STORY: Since the game wraps up the series, there are not many plot twists (the identity of that masked person was obvious) or anything long-lasting introduced, but it's climatic nevertheless, explaining the origin of Wesker, the intentions of Umbrella, and the aftermath of RE4. There are files on the major characters, explaining them in detail, as well as a long timeline of the series up to RE4.RE veteran Chris Redfield returns for the first time since Code Veronica, now an agent of the group BSAA. Along with his new partner, an African native named Sheva, he searches Africa to uncover the latest biohazard threat, as well as searching for his old partner, Jill Valentine. There he faces new threats, as well as an old nemesis.GAMEPLAY: The gameplay is similar to RE4, but with a few new additions. You play as Chris, and Sheva fights with him, controlled by either AI or another player. Some people have complained about her, but I found her to be a nice addition, even though she can sometimes be dumb and get killed by an enemy, and if she dies, you die.  But other than that, she does help to take out enemies, and she heals you whenever you're in dire straits. Herbs heal both characters, by the way, and yellow herbs are absent. You'll also need to save each other from enemies, and when you're on very low health, you'll be incapacitated and will die unless your partner saves you, which sucks if you're separated. Like RE4, there are reaction commands in fighting and in cutscenes.Like RE4, you can collect treasures and gold and use it to buy items and weapons, but this time, the merchant is gone, sadly. Now you just buy and sell items when you die or when you progress to the next chapter. Kind of generic, but oh well. There are six chapters, with three parts in them. So while the game is short, it has replay value, as you can  choose any chapter you want, to either replay on a different difficulty, get a better ranking, which helps to buy goodies such as costumes and trophies, or find and shoot the hidden BSAA emblems, which unlock said goodies. Mercenaries mode also returns.ACHIEVEMENTS: Most of these 50 achievements are easy to get, such as beating the game and its chapters, saving your partner so many times, or killing a bunch of enemies a certain way, but others are a bit more difficult, such as shooting an enemy in the head when it's in the air, which I did, but I didn't get the achievement. Some of them have odd names, such as 'Masters of Removing,' an inside joke to the infamous 'Master of unlocking' quote from the first game, and there's even an achievement named after a Metallica song. You probably won't get them all in the first playthrough.BUY: It's a must if you are a Resident Evil fan. I mean, we've waited four years to see how it all ends, so be a part of it. There's also a special edition if you feel like shelling a few more dollars for some extra stuff.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001BNFQKO","reviewerName":"Scott Peterson \"I.T. Sme\"","summary":"Waste of time!","reviewText":"I never really cared for the GTA games, they're too violent and amoral, and several of the missions are borderline impossible.  I never finished San Andreas or whatever it was called and it was several months before I installed this after fishing it out of the bargain bin.  So I wasn't highly motivated to wade through a lot playing this game.I can sum my experience up like this:Try to install game, need to install \"Social Club\" first.  Huh?20 minutes installing game.Need to make sure the \"release date\" has passed.Insert license key hereActivate!  Yes, you must.Try to start game.Why won't you sign into Social Club?  Because I don't want to.You must sign into Windows Live to save your games.  WHAT THE?!?!?!?Skip it just to get to the game.Can't configure keyboard controls. Instead it's set up for an XBOX 360 controller?!?!?  Did I get a console version that somehow installed on my computer?Oh, the manual says it does have keyboard controls.  Just I can't configure them or even see how they're mapped.  Lose the manual and I'd have no idea what does what.Go to the Rockstar website and download a 300MB \"patch.\"  NOW I can edit keyboard controls, and can set up a Windows Live \"offline account,\"  Which is really just a dummy file on my hard drive.  I won't get achievements counted but at this point do I care?  I just want to be able to save the game.Finally play the $^&%^$!!  thing---after all I spent money on it.  It's a little like a cross between the better parts of San Andreas and Grand Theft Auto III.  The character of Niko Bellic starts to grow on you and isn't completely amoral, he's cynical about the world around him and does bad things, but isn't an evil person.  Rather than the wise guys of Vice City the storyline revolves around criminals facing the consequences of their actions and paranoia and mistrust--this was about the best part of the game.  While Vice City was a reflection of the 80's, GTA IV reflects today and if anything says things aren't very good right now.The appearance gets a much needed update compared to the earlier ones, but the game play aggravations are still there. A lot of time (same as San Andreas) is spent maintaining relationships with friends and dates.  They call at random all hours of the day and night, usually 2-3 at once, and they're always halfway across town and you have \"an hour\" (about three minutes in game time) to get there.  Be late and they're upset, and trying to play \"bowling\" or \"darts\" was slightly more fun than pulling teeth.  I'd much rather have had a tighter story than what was essentially time wasters.The shooter portions of the game are awkward because we're essentially zooming in on very tiny characters and the scale of movement is low resolution; by comparison COD4 makes me feel I have the fine control of a brain surgeon.  There's also the tedium of every time a mission is replayed having to drive all the way back across town to restart and most of them ended in a car chase.  Yes, I *know* the title is Grand Theft Auto, but still a little variety would have helped.Performance improved after the patch but even then it still dropped often to 10-20 frames a second on a dual core Athlon with a GTX-280 video card.  At the recommended settings.  This game is just a slapped together console port, and nothing more.  Should I remove this piece of garbage I'll need to \"revoke\" my install, otherwise I'll lose my \"activation.\"I've had big issues with activation ever since Microsoft put it on XP.  Recently on one of my computers the motherboard failed and I replaced it, and subsequently had to re-activate endless programs through no fault of my own because as the board was different they all assumed I was a thief.  If your computer goes out you suddenly are stuck trying to re-activate all your \"licenses.\"  And no, a backup wouldn't have worked as it was hardware I was replacing.All these barriers to make sure we're not thieves gives less and less incentive to buy their products.  There is no good reason why I need a \"Windows Live\" account just to save a game.  What is the reason for that?  Just to make sure we all have \"Live\" accounts?  Look how popular Live is!  See, all these people signing up!I probably wouldn't even be interested in the \"Social Club\" to upload videos and chatter and whatever else it's for.  I just want to play the game, that's all.  If you want to make it so hung up on all this stuff why not just put it all online so we play it on a website?  Did I also mention Social Club keeps coming up as a login prompt every time I start my computer, even after deleting it from my startup folder?I also have just about had it with game makers now treating PC users as as an afterthought.  PC's already outdo Xbox's and Playstation 3's on graphics, but if we have to \"activate\" (or buy new copies if we're past our limit) every time we upgrade there's not much point to it.  There's also not much point in building or buying a gaming PC with a high end video card if there's nothing worth playing on it.So don't bother with this game if you want to play it on a PC.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2009"}

As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords.

On one hand it was produced by Capcom, one of my all-time favorite publishers, and even they had seen enough potential in it to immediately produce a sequel. On the other, if just due to the period in which the game was set, I was immediately confusing it with Nobunaga's Ambition, a military simulation game that's had about 1500 sequels and dozens of imitations in the decade or so since it was first released. I'm not a fan of military simulation. But within the first minute of play my suspicions and fears were whisked away. Onimusha had taken hold of me, and however hard I tried, I just couldn't put it down for long.As Samanosuke, you've returned from a horrifying battlefield to discover the princess you've spent your life protecting has been abducted. Naturally, you embark on a simple quest to rescue the princess from her captors. However, instead of battling enemy soldiers, Samanosuke finds himself mixed up in the middle of a fight between demons and humans, the undead and the living. It's like Resident Evil on a grander scale.However, the similarities to Capcom's original \"survival horror\" series extend well beyond the mere involvement of the living dead and related monsters. Truly, the bulk of the game itself may have been ported directly from the RE series. Onimusha is not a true 3-D platform title, your surroundings aren't totally navigable. You watch from an overhead view, as Samanosuke runs from one pre-rendered background to the next. As you run off the screen, the camera angle changes and a new background fills the screen.Much like The Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, your ultimate quest is to defeat enemies and use their very souls to enhance your own performance. The story explains this away as such; on their way to conquering the Earth, the demons made mortal enemies of ogres. Enraged, the ogres have chosen Samanosuke to represent them in halting the demons' plans, a sort of sweet scheme for revenge. They grant you a bulky attachment for your right arm, used to capture enemy souls, and send you on your way. If that sounds a little bit \"out of left field\", that's because it is... the storyline on the whole is overly confusing, generally silly and even occasionally ignored.In keeping with that trend, the voice acting takes poorly written dialogue and brutally drags it along the coals. These guys didn't even ATTEMPT to match what they were saying with their character's lips, and it's not an uncommon thing to see your character's gums flapping for a couple seconds after he's quit speaking. Despite their ability to pronounce all the characters' names correctly, the voice talent just isn't getting the job done here. I'd rather read subtitles than endure this.Fortunately enough, the graphics almost completely make up for the lack of compelling audio just by themselves. As a first wave title for the PS2, there were most certainly lofty expectations for this disc, and I'd wager it's exceeded even those. Onimusha is a brilliant visual treat, taking full advantage of what the new system had to offer. Even live-rendered scenes look exceptional, with blur effects, trailers following various light sources on the screen, and a well-designed rogue's gallery to hack your way through.Likewise, the FMV scenes in Onimusha, infrequent as they may be, are stunning. Though they haven't quite reached the level of perfection that Squaresoft seems to demand in their cinema scenes, Capcom's crew is giving the masters a stern run for their money. While the story may be a little on the light side, the real emphasis in these scenes is on dynamic poses and memorable moments. As the back story is explained, hundreds upon hundreds of soldiers march in slow motion, illuminated only by the moonlight, their spears extending a good six feet above their heads. It's an ominous visual, one that sticks with you long after the power button has been turned off.As a standard hack-n-slash affair, the gameplay doesn't exactly light the world on fire. If you've played Final Fight, you basically know what the deal is here, though battles do occasionally require a bit more strategy than that old Capcom standby. You're granted a limited amount of magic special attacks, which are best saved for major battles, and the rest of the game is comprised of madly smashing the square button, retreating before the enemy can attack you, and repeating. Interspersed throughout the land are a series of rudimentary puzzles, which range from \"not entirely challenging\" to \"simple.\" You'll find a special item, hold onto it for a couple minutes, and then find the doorway or puzzle requiring its use. Again, nothing to write home about, but something that'll keep you occupied.My one major complaint about the game is its length. Perhaps I've grown a bit too used to RPGs that span upwards of ten, twenty, sixty hours before completion. I defeated Onimusha in four and a half, with relative ease. The end boss was a pushover, and I was never really concerned about being killed in that final battle. Though I did fall on three or four occasions, it was always due to my own stubbornness (I refuse to use potions and recovery items unless ABSOLUTELY necessary) and not any real difficulty built into the game itself. If you know how to press the \"square\" button and have retained any sort of knowledge from elementary school, you shouldn't have much problem defeating this one.Though it's heavily reliant on one battle system, things never seem to become monotonous. The scenery changes often, new enemies are introduced at just the right times, and there's a real epic, cinematic feel to this that can't be put into words. For all my words about what this game could have been, I think it's silly to overlook what it is. A solid, entertaining little package.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2003"}

I was really excited about this title and so I bought it. I'm both content and dissappointed with it. Why I'm content:The game keeps the side-scrolling style of original Contra games; The action is fast paced; the game is challenging (kinda like the Hard mode on Contra 3 for SNES); The control is crisp and layed out well, not perfect; the graphics are great, but not perfect.Why I'm dissappointed:Where are the M 80k Helio bombs? Where are the flying ammunitions you can shoot down?  And Why can't I recieve anything more then the 3 guns I'm givin' at the beginning (only 1 of them is really useful)? I said I liked the control, I do, but a lot of the times it's too confusing because every button is used. The graphics are a great mix of 2D and 3D but they could have done a lot more with the backgrounds. The music, although its cool heavy metal, it could have been something more original and more fitting to the game itself.Even though this game is fun, it's not up to par with the original Nintendo contras. What we need is Konami to put some REAL effort and time into a new contra game. This one unfortunately falls into a rental, and now with  a lot of stores renting out for a week, that'll probably give you enough time to beat it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2003"}

Posey","summary":"Fallout New Vegas - Review","reviewText":"Fallout New Vegas was by far one of my top anticipated games of 2010. I had the collector's preordered for months in advance and with the hundred + hours spent in Fallout 3, the game couldn't arrive soon enough. When the day came, I had off work and spent a solid 8 hours of gaming in the Mojave Wasteland before turning in for the night. The next day, before going to work, I decided to hop on and explore some while drinking my morning coffee. Unfortunately, I couldn't make it past the loading screen since my save file was corrupted. Without getting into that whole debacle, I eventually restarted the game, avoided the quest \"Come Fly With Me\" and have been save file corruption free since then.I bring up my save file issue because it's something that needs to be said in every review of Fallout New Vegas, the game is broken. If you are a Fallout fanatic like myself, this is nothing new to us. Fallout 3 had bugs galore and New Vegas is no different. I didn't experience any game ending bugs in Fallout 3 and have with New Vegas, but I have heard some people did experience big issues in 3. I just wasn't one of them. Bethesda has released one patch for the PC and Xbox 360 (not sure about PS3) but it didn't fix the big issues. It was mainly for fixing some texture issues and other graphical inconsistencies.  All of the known issues are documented and accounted for and Bethesda is working on it.  When will this come out, no one knows.  But if you take your time in the game and save often with numerous save files, you should be able to complete the game fine.  Just don't do the quest called \"Come Fly With Me.\"  I have over 50 saves right now since I create a new one every 20-30 minutes or so to not lose my data.  I recommend you do the same.OK, with that out of the way, I can get into the real review, so here goes...Fallout New Vegas takes place a few years after the events in Fallout 3 and on the west coast, Nevada and it's Mojave desert to be exact.  Vegas was relatively untouched by the bombs that fell during the war so much of the strip's buildings and structures are relatively untouched (except for weathering and wear).  You play as a courier who delivers packages for people.  In the beginning of the game you are caught by a guy in a striped suit and robbed before being shot in the head.  A robot digs you up out of your shallow grave, takes you to the town doctor, and your story begins.  After character creation and stat alignment, you set off to find out why someone tried to kill you and if wanted, exact revenge.  With this simple premise, the story will branch out to numerous sub plots and characters each with their own charm and personality.One of the best features of Fallout NV are the factions.  In the world of Fallout NV, there are two main factions.  The New California Republic (NCR) is basically a new military state government based out of California.  They are moving into Nevada to secure Hoover Dam because of it's power capabilities (running water).  Their opposing force is a band of slavers called Caesar's Legion.  These guys come from the East and rape and pillage their way across the land.  But, looks can be deceiving and they actually have a layer of complexity to them if you decide to check them out.  They too are trying to control Hoover Dam and a large scale battle is on the horizon that you will be able to influence depending on who you side with.  Along with the two main factions, there are a number of other minor classes that you can raise your standing with including The King's (Elvis impersonators who run Freeside), the Khans, White Glove Society, and many more.  They each have their own hierarchical society and you can work with them or against them to meet or fail at their goals.  Choice plays a huge part in Fallout games and NV is no different.  Your choice in what happens plays a big role in how the world will turn out.While Fallout New Vegas is an RPG at heart, it also has a combat system.  If you aren't familiar with the mechanics, you can choose from a number of weapons and depending on the stats you choose each level and corresponding perks - small boosts to different aspects of your character you gain ever 2 levels - you can have varying success with each weapon.  Most characters pick a weapon type and stick to it.  For instance, I always go with rifles.  As a result, I have a high gun and agility stat and my perks usually have to do with 2 handed weapon accuracy and extra action points since 2H weapons use more.  You could go with a melee based character, energy weapons, one handed gun wielder, or even bare fisted.  The choice is yours.Another aspect of combat is the VATS system.  VATS can be summed up by calling it a statistical auto shoot.  By hitting a button, you bring up a screen that shows percentages over different body parts on your enemy.  The stats have to do with your proficiency with the weapon, line of sight, terrain, etc.  Depending on how many action points you have you can fire off multiple shots directed at whatever limb you want and then fire.  The resulting explosion of body parts, especially with the bloody mess perk, never gets old - even after seeing it well over a couple hundred times since Fallout 3.  If VATS isn't your thing though, a new feature, iron sights, has been added.  This is the typical scope view in other FPS games and works well in Fallout NV.  I find myself using both with harder enemies getting VATS treatment.Something that people really loved about Fallout 3 but wasn't really prominent was the use of allies or companions.  In Fallout New Vegas, they are a mainstay.  You'll meet people throughout your travels who will agree to come with you and fight by your side.  You can give them orders, have them carry your extra equipment, and talk to them and receive quests.  It's a great addition and it works well, when it works.  It's not exactly broken as much as it is buggy.  Sometimes you'll move from one area to the next and your companion is nowhere to be found.  Other times they won't attack and will randomly teleport back to where you found them.  It doesn't happen a lot, but it does happen.  There are a lot of companions in the game and you can travel with them all, but only one at a time.  You may only have one humanoid companion and one robotic companion travel with you.  The rest can hang out back in your hotel room at the Lucky 38 while they wait for you.  Some of the companions are well voiced too with Felicia Day doing the voice work for one of my favorites, Veronica the Brotherhood of Steel Scribe.  The companions really help out in a fight as well with most carrying their weight.  All xp gained from their attacks even goes to you as well so don't feel shy to use them.  Nothing but good could come from the arrangement.Another new feature added into Fallout New Vegas is hardcore mode.  In this mode, the game isn't as friendly as it would be in normal Fallout mode.  For instance, using stimpacks in the regular game heals you instantly for X amount of health points.  In hardcore mode, they heal over time.  So, if you are in a firefight, you can't rely on that extra boost of health.  You also need to sleep daily and feed your character or you will suffer the consequences.  One good thing about this mode is that it can really be for everyone.  You can play hardcore mode on the easiest difficulty setting and still get that hardcore experience without the punishing difficulty of a higher setting.  Plus, there is an achievement for finishing the game using hardcore mode so this is good news for achievement hunters.One thing I did notice in Fallout New Vegas more so that in Fallout 3 was the quality of the story.  Even side quests are extremely well written and really make you feel that you are in this desolate land and exploring it first hand.  The characters have life and depth and the voice work is phenomenal.  In between missions, I find myself just randomly walking the wastelands with my companions looking for new places to visit and experience.  The world feels so lived in while also being desolate that it just asks for exploring.  This leads me to my next point - the graphics.It's not hard to notice that the graphics aren't the best in a Fallout game.  The engine is getting old now and it's starting to show it's age.  That doesn't mean you can't be sucked into the story though, far from it.  The graphics of this world do a good job supporting the story and making you feel that you are in a world where a war took place and the remnants of human civilization are clinging on for dear life.  The skyline will darken in the evening resulting in the glow of New Vegas to be seen on the horizon.  The ambiance of creatures unknown in the distance make the hair on the back of your neck rise.  Enemies yell to their friends to let you know that you're impeding on their territory.  All of this adds to the ambiance of the game world and it works well.  Don't focus on the graphics as you would a Gears of War game, but rather take it for what it is, a supporting role to the story and gameplay - you'll feel right at home.If Fallout New Vegas was completely bug free or at least close to it, there wouldn't be any questions about it - this would be the game of the year for 2010.  It's a shame that technical issues that shouldn't have made it into release hold the experience back for most people.  I've already heard of a number of people who traded in or sold their game after getting the game save corruption bug.  It's not just a few either, the forums are full of people with these sentiments.  But, for those of us who can look past the occasional graphics flare up or take measures to avoid save game corruptions, the result is an amazing feat of gaming that has an excellent story, lovable characters (including the evil ones), and a world which you can truly get lost in.  Say goodbye to at least a hundred or so hours of your life as you tune in and get lost in the Mojave Wasteland.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2010"}

On the 360 version, my game will still freeze, or not load a game save every now and then, so it is best to warn folks about that.  All you can do is remember to save a lot.The best thing about New Vegas are the various sub-stories and mini-quests.  Some of the writing in the smaller quests is great.  The main story line however is OK, but nothing special. The game introduced new factions and that offers some interest since you can befriend them or destroy them -- the choice is yours.Otherwise the game is perhaps too much of a repeat of everything Fallout 3 already offered.  Same engine and same digital assets.  The \"New Vegas strip\" isnt all that interesting so be prepared to be underwhelmed when you get there.  It is much more fun to explore that larger world in the game.So it is a tricky game to recommend completely -- though at the current bargain pricing and if you liked Fallout 3, it is likely worth a purchase.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"Amozarte","summary":"Spin That Wheel!","reviewText":"DJ Hero is the next iteration of rhythm game, which stars you as the mix master of Club Living Room.  While I found scratching a turntable to be vastly more fun than I originally expected, I'm afraid the steep cost of admission may limit the game's appeal.  Still, any fan of music games would do well to try out this fresh take on the genre.***The Turntable***The most notable feature of this game is the new peripheral, a turntable.  As with the basic guitars from Guitar Hero, the turntable is 100% plastic and feels a bit miniature (it's 14.5\" x 9\" and only about 2.5\" tall).  The turntable includes a free-spinning platter with three coloured buttons, a cross fade switch, an effects knob (choose between: Horn, Siren, Blam, Bullet, and Zap), and \"Euphoria\" button (i.e. Star Power).  In the upper left corner, concealed by a plastic flap, you'll find the D-pad and other traditional controller buttons.The core spinning motion of the platter feels solid, but the other buttons leave a little to be desired.  The cross fader in particular suffers from a lack of distinction between left, centre, and right.  There is a slight \"notch\" at centre, but it is quite subtle and when playing the game you'll often find yourself shifting clear past the notch, which causes more than a little frustration.  It seems to me that a more defined centre or even something as simple as a raised nub in the centre (like the bump on the middle button of the guitar peripherals) would have helped this issue.  Of lesser note, but nevertheless a disappointing oversight, the turntable is not ambidextrous.  While the documentation mentions an \"expansion\" for lefties, I can't imagine that many south paws will want to pay extra for a feature that could have and should have been designed into the base product. ***UPDATE: The retail turntable, unlike the demo version I received, is ambidextrous out of the box.***These complaints aside, the turntable serves its purpose adequately and its minor shortcomings are in no way an encumbrance to enjoying the game.  That said, I'd be interested to see the types of third party turntables that will be offered if this game proves to be successful.***Gameplay***The music included in the game features exclusive mash-ups of various well-known tunes, created by famous DJs.  I should quickly dispel a false notion: this is not \"Hip-Hop\" Hero.  In addition to the usual suspects like Jay-Z, Eminem, or the Black Eyed Peas you will also find a wide array of other artists such as Beck, Gwen Stefani, Queen, Tears for Fears, and even Mot&ouml;rhead.  The mixes themselves are rather creative and I found myself grooving along to songs to which I might not otherwise have chosen to listen.For those of you not yet baptized into the club scene, the game includes a tutorial taught by none other than Grandmaster Flash.  I have absolutely no DJ experience, but in one pass I felt sufficiently acclimated to the controls and jumped head-first into the quickplay mode.  The familiar \"note highway\" returns, but this time with only three streams.  The left and right each represent one of the two tracks, while the centre is for beats and effects.  In addition to scratching, you'll be cross fading between two tracks, tapping buttons in time, and sounding effects like sirens and horns.  Star Power has been renamed \"Euphoria\" but works exactly the same- you build up a meter and then activate it for score bonus.The demo included two play modes, Solo DJ Quickplay and Co-op DJ + Guitar Quickplay.  Solo DJ should be self-explanatory but co-op warrants a brief explanation.  Co-op allows one player to spin while another riffs a guitar part. (The retail version will also feature DJ + DJ co-op and will be available online or off).  The guitar gameplay is identical to Guitar Hero, but DJ + Guitar play is limited to certain special mixes as opposed to the entire set list.  If you're flying solo but want to play these co-op tracks, have no fear- AI will control the other part.There are four difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert.  As you might expect, each level becomes more complex, no surprises there.  However, on Easy the cross fader is omitted, leaving you to simply scratch the platter or tap buttons in rhythm.  This mode is extremely rudimentary and should be accessible even to those with only the most basic rhythmic abilities.  But unless you just can't survive a single track, I highly recommend starting on Medium because the game just isn't as fun without cross fading included.The background scenery for each gig retains the same basic art style of Guitar Hero, but replaces the rock concert stages with a psychedelic club atmosphere.  More importantly, the same old avatars like Judy Nails and Axel Steel have been replaced by new faces.  Even Grandmaster Flash has his own avatar!While the visuals are entertaining, the music is naturally the star of the show.  And the selections available in the demo did not disappoint.  The handful available blended old and new favourites to create a compelling sound that left me craving the full retail version's 93 mixes.  Hearing these truly creative combinations gave me a genuine appreciation for DJs- their craft truly is an art.  And while I can't promise that you'll love every track, there is something for everyone.The music is in fact so compelling that on my first time out, even though I had only intended to play for a few minutes, I quickly lost over an hour to the game.  In that time I never encountered any soreness or cramping but then again I also play piano, which may have given my fingers a leg up.  I could see newcomers suffering some minor ill effects, but only until their hand muscles have had time to adapt.The $120 price tag may be a barrier that some are simply unwilling to break- after all, that's two brand new triple-A games.  But if you've given this game any thought whatsoever I strongly encourage you to give it a test drive.  If nothing else, DJ Hero is a fresh take on the music genre and a game that offers a truly unique experience.  The mechanics are accessible, the music is creative, and the whole package is quite entertaining.***Notes***This review written prior to the retail release of the game, using a demo kit from the Amazon.com Vine program.  The demo kit included a wired turntable but the retail version is wireless.  More importantly, the set list contained only three solo mixes and one coop mix, so I wasn't given the opportunity to try out the entire list.  I feel confident, though, that this taste was sufficient material on which to base this review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2009"}

Now, with that being said how does it stack up to its predecessor on gameplay? Pretty darn good. The scenery is more vast and open compared to Morrowind. For example, you can stand on top of a mountain and look out into a valley and see another mountain in the distance where you can actually walk to if you want to spend the time to do it!The UI is pretty user friendly and I prefer it to the four windows in Morrowind. Everything is organized by tabs and its not too many mouseclicks to find what you need to.One thing players might notice is the amount of customization you can get with your character from hair, skin tone and even facial strucuture. I'm sure if you spent enough time you could probably make your own face in the game (Yes it is that indepth).The Radiant AI that was so lauded is right on the money. NPCs act according to what time it is so no more shops open 24 hours a day. NPCs will eat, sleep and walk around or mind their shops depending on the time. It's a nice touch overall and adds to the immersion factor.The quests are pretty enjoyable so far with a lot of variation and not too many FEDEX quests (so far). One of the more enjoyable ones  i've had was where an entire town and the surrounding monsters were all invisible because of a Wizard's spell that had some adverse side effects. I actually thought it was a bug because I kept getting whacked on and couldn't see it until I blindly swung my sword around until the wolf died.Speaking of bugs, there have no real gamekillers for me so far. The Elder Scrolls Forums so far have bug complaints mainly associated with Video Cards. If your video card is not in their recommended list then chances are you are going to have some problems which I'll list here:ATI X1900 seriesATI X1800 seriesATI X1600 seriesATI X1300 seriesATI X850 seriesATI x800 seriesATI x700 seriesATI x600 seriesATI Radeon 9800 seriesATI Radeon 9700 seriesATI Radeon 9600 seriesATI Radeon 9500 seriesNVIDIA Geforce 7800 seriesNVIDIA GeForce 6800 seriesNVIDIA GeForce 6600 seriesNVIDIA GeForce 6200 seriesNVIDIA GeForce FX seriesI have a NVIDIA GeForce 6800 GT and am having problems where the screen will go completly black except for my UI and other 6800ers have had the same problem even with the latest drivers released on March 17th. **Update*** Problem solved - When you first click to launch the game select OPTIONS then select -- BLOOM -- instead of -- HDR --. Haven't had a problem since and have logged close to 20ish hours of game time. However, video problems still exist except the new 7XXX and 6800 series don't seem to have any.I am willing to cut a little slack though and only knocked off one star for this mainly because the game is extremly vast and patches are on the way for mainly video support. It is a bum deal when games come out that don't fit everyone's computers but hey, it's a really really good game with a LOT of bang for your buck.Would I recommend this? Yes, but I would only buy it now if you have the supported Video Chipsets. If not I would wait until a patch is released and you can check this on Elderscrolls.com when it is released. Otherwise you might have a game you just can't play until your Video Card is supported via some patch lubbin'.Pros- Great Graphics- Immersive gameplay- MASSIVE world with countless hours of playing- Good story (Of course..it's Elder Scrolls!)- Fun QuestsCons- Video support issues","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00149MEWI","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Decent, but Silent Hill can do better","reviewText":"Granted, I haven't played through the game completely, but there are some serious weaknesses that should've been addressed. Balancing this are also some vast, vast improvements over previous incarnations.SH 5 follows Alex Shepard, as he traverses Sheperds Hill, his hometown, and then Silent Hill, searching for his little brother, who seemed to be in trouble in a dream he had. His father has also vanished and his mother is a near catatonic wreck. The story actually bears quite a few similarities to the movie, in the way the main character keeps chasing his brother, only to lose him at the last moment. Sheperds Hill tries to appear normal, but is overrun with smoke breathing zombies and skinless hounds, not to mention the canonical roads that vanish.The character attempts to be intelligent, planning to find his brother and get the hell out of town, rather than \"figure this out,\" but is bogged down by the limitations of a classical adventure game. He has to break through boarded doors with a fire ax, rather than a hammer that has to be found somewhere among the 436 tool boxes scattered throughout town. The few other players in town taht retain their wits can't bring themselves to flee the godforsaken place, and I hope sincerly that its explained at least to some degree.Significant Improvements: The combat system is a lot more fluid and beliavable. You can dodge and duck out of the way, and you now have a targeting cursor. Enemies has identifiable weakness and strength to certain weapons, and you can use the terrain to somewhat of an advantage, though most veterans still use the time honored tradition of run the heck away.Enemies no longer respawn, or spawn far less frequently, and there are fewer corridors of death where you can get boxed in and not be able to fight your way out.God bless them, but pick up items now glow with a glossy sheen, not a flare in the darkness, but you can now see interactive items, rather than relying on your character turning his head.Same Ol, Same Ol: Searching for that one piece of inventory, and being unable to kick open or shoulder through a door. One of the few things Condemned nailed perfectly.Drawbacks: Not enough scary. There are quite a few jumps, and some creepy points, but not enough punch like there was in SH 1 and 2. The writers seem to think that darker=scarier. WRONG. However, they've applied lessons learned, so I can forgive them this.Overall: Decent though not impressive graphics, a significantly improved h2h combat system, good voice acting, attempts at intelligent main character behavior, and a above average story thats been fleshed out more make this a rent-to-own, though I would rent initially unless you're an achivement or ending hound like myself. Definitely turn the brightness all the way up though, else you'll be walking into walls and corners constantly.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2008"}

A great franchise that requires alot of technical skill to master.  When I heard that Tekken 6 was coming to the XBox 360 I was super stoked.Upon the game's release I heard rumors that it was full of errors, especially with the online portion of the game, so I held off until they patched it.  Finally Namco got a patch out and I made my purchase.The fighting game action of the previous Tekken games is there and I still love it.  Choose your character and go 1 on 1 with your opponents.  The new bound system is a bit ridiculous, it allows an enemy to start a combo on you, slam you to the ground, and continue the combo (against a skilled opponent you can lose 60-70% of your health in one combo before you can retalliate).  Thankfully it takes some skill to get good at bounds and it's still alot of fun.  While nothing much has changed since Tekken 3 there are enough new moves and characters to keep things fresh.There is so much extra junk that I have no interest in that it's a bit upsetting.  I don't understand why Namco decided to make the \"Tekken Force\" the focus of the game and the arcade section (what the series is all about) the bonus.  They can leave Tekken Force completely out of the game for all I care, you don't buy Tekken for Tekken Force.  You buy it for 1 on 1 fighting.  Tekken Force (now known as Scenario Mode) itself is a bit boring and repetitive, but 75% of the game's achievements are found there so if you're an achievement lover you've got to suffer through it.  You run through levels, kill bad guys, collect items which you can customize your character with, rinse, repeat.  It plays reasonably well, it's just not very fun.Now for what most people will buy the game for, online.  I didn't start playing online until after the game was patched so I missed out on the majority of latency issues.  Overall the experience is pretty great.  You choose a character and it finds an opponent.  Before accepting the fight with said opponent it tells you their connection speed so you can avoid laggy connections.  Anything 3 or higher (out of 5) seems to run quite smooth.  The best part of multiplayer is making a public lobby with 4 people and playing an arcade-style round robin.  The winner stays, the loser goes to the back of the line.  It's alot of fun to make a room with friends and simulate the arcade experience.Technically the game looks good but not stellar.  Textures aren't the sharpest but they're not bad.  Animations are pretty good.  The sound is top notch though, excellent through our 5.1 system.Overall I enjoy Tekken 6 despite a few bugs and a few decisions on the part of Namco with the direction of the game.  If you are a fan of the series or just of fighting games you'll enjoy the fighting experience althoguh you may want to skip out on the \"Scenario Mode\" entirely.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2010"}
{"product_name":"Logitech G700s Rechargeable Gaming Mouse","description":"","reviewerName":"Derek G","summary":"Solid ergonomic mouse with good software but you'll need batteries","reviewText":"I first fell in love with Logitech products when I put my hands on their MX1000.  It was the only time I paid full retail price for a mouse.  As soon as I put my hand on it I knew I had to have it.  After that died, it was replaced by the stalwart MX Revolution which still works to this day (although their so-called \"unifying\" software won't support it.) *shakes fist*  The reason why I preface this is because many gamers have used a MX Revolution at some point and the G700s seems to be an evolution of the popular mouse.Like the MX, the G700s has that molded to the hand feel.  If you're a palm gripper like me, it feels like the kind of mouse you can rest your entire hand on.  Supposedly, the material allows you to wick sweat away from your palms while gaming.  That doesn't happen to me so I can't test the validity.  The top of the mouse feels like smooth metal but the sides took a little getting used to.  It's a rough texture that frequently made me wonder if the mouse was dirty.  It takes a little getting used to.The mouse wheel can be smooth scrolling or click scrolling as determined by the button directly behind the wheel.  This brings up a gripe about button placement.  You see the button selector sticks up high enough that it's difficult to reach the other button behind it.  You will likely never use it or use it for \"non-critical\" things.  Personally I have it mapped to check the battery level; a nice feature that lights up one to three arrows depending on the amount of juice left in your mouse.Speaking of batteries, you're going to need a few spares.  It comes with a single AA Eneloop rechargeable battery.  I am grateful that Logitech isn't playing the \"irreplaceable battery\" game like other manufacturers.  At the same time, you will either need to be very diligent about attaching the USB cable after a session or you will need to have some spares as the battery lasts little more than a day of gaming.  For me, this isn't an issue because I've already jumped on the rechargeable battery bandwagon and I have a drawer full of spare eneloops.  If you don't have them, consider purchasing something like thiseneloop 4 Pack AA, Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries with 4 Position Chargerand it will save you a lot of headaches.On to button placement.  The side of the mouse has four buttons that are easily distinguished by your thumb as the top two stick out slightly farther than the bottom two.  The three buttons on the top-left of the mouse I'm not as impressed with.  They are formed in a concave shaped that seems out of place on this otherwise ergonomic mouse.  The top and bottom buttons are not too difficult to reach without mistakes but the middle is oddly placed between the two.  Someone with a claw grip would have a better shot at distinguishing the three than someone with a palm grip.  The mouse wheel can also click left and right.  All buttons are customizable using the Logitech Gaming Software.The Logitech Gaming Software is a fully featured customizer allowing five different profiles to be customized for gaming on the road.  For at-home gamers, the software can scan your hard drive for existing games and add your selections to a seemingly infinite number of allowable profiles.  Each profile is determined by the filename executed when the game starts.  If you are familiar with navigating your computer files and folders this should not be an issue but it may prove problematic for those unfamiliar with delving into gaming folders.  I have found gaming detection to be mostly good but the occasional game aggravation pops up.  For instance, when Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon was released, the software would not detect the game until I Alt-tabbed out of the game and back in again.  Buttons can be programmed to repeat while held down or toggled on and off.  One notable exception is mouse-clicks.  Try as I might, I couldn't find a way for mouse-clicks to be repeated as long as I held down the left or right mouse buttons.If I had a wish list, I would ask the engineers to change two things.  First, I'd have them scrap the buttons in the upper left in favor of a design similar to their entry-level G300 mouse.  That mouse has two buttons on the top left and two buttons on the top-right.  Both sides are easily \"nudged\" without having to take your fingers off the left and right mouse buttons.  Secondly, I would want a charging base so the battery can be easily charged after a gaming session instead of plugging in cords and/or replacing the battery day after day.  Aside from these two requests, this is a dynamite solid mouse, well-engineered, with a lot of weight and decent button placement.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2013"}

It got to the point where she just flat out bought it for me on Xbox so I would play it.  I clearly had to put this in line as my next game to play.  So after I finished with Doom 3 I started working on this daunting project.  Don't get me wrong, daunting is a good thing in an RPG format, it just means it's quite long, negative connotations aside; I just have a lot of games in my que is all.The initial obvious observations are based on the character.  Basically the game provides you with the character; you don't create it like you would find in more diverse Role Playing Games.  Considering the fact I enjoyed Planescape: Torment to a high degree, this isn't a huge thing for me as long as the story line is pretty good.  The second thing is that you don't have a major overhead world view; rather you have the third person camera similar to what you find with Tomb Raider.  Thankfully the camera can be controlled and twirled around so you can see from many different angles.  You can also zoom in and out to get a better look at your character, but it's always centered on your character so if you want to zoom in on the person your character is talking to, you can't do that.  Frankly I found the zoom control sort of annoying in the long run because I sometimes would accidentally hit the button to zoom, I'm sure someone is now saying it's user error.  Either way, it was just very easy to zoom, but it wasn't a major issue and didn't happen constantly.  The world your thrust into is actually pretty huge, which is a wonderful aspect of this game, this means it's not a game that takes four hours to beat, you seriously get your moneys worth out of this!  Anyway in certain areas they've put transportation locations called \"Cullis Gates\" that can transport you to another gate instantly.  I thought this was an excellent thing because when you leave a territory and return all the enemies will reappear then you have to re-fight your way through if there's no gate nearby.  This is also great if you want to build experience pretty quickly, but also annoying if you want to start moving things along once you have a lot of experience already.The game starts off when you're a little boy living in a town called Oakvale with your father.  As in most story lines tragedy strikes and you end up being taken care of by the Hero's Guild and then the story transports you into the future and the main story picks up from there.  I have to admit the main story is pretty well done.  There's a lot of character intrigue and mystery, and of course lots of things to hack and slash!  Yes this is one of those hack and slash RPG's in vein of games like Diablo, only there's a little more to the purpose in some cases for our character in Fable.  I tend to prefer this format over the turn based concept that Final Fantasy uses and from what I gather non-turn base is typically the preferred.The in-game play options are really awesome though and there's a lot you can do with your character when it comes to interacting with the world around them.  You sort of build your character towards an alignment, but that alignment doesn't really affect the pre-determined story line.  Honestly the game is sort of lacking in that regard.  So as you play you grow to either be an evil character, good character, or a neutral character as you get experience points.  However, whichever alignment you lean towards does affect the way people in the towns react to you (i.e. being afraid of you or cheering for you).  The one bad point when interacting with the other communities is that the script is usually pre-defined as well, so you can't choose what your character says.  However, the other things you can do in terms of interaction more than makes up this limitation.  For example there's this whole category of items you can get called gifts and you can give them to people.  This townspeople interaction opens up a whole new world of options.Honestly, on some levels I was wondering if this game was targeted toward a junior high demographic, but in retrospect after having played through the game I think it's actually geared towards adults.  For example you can do really horrible things to people and do really nice things, the game is very diverse.  There are also these things called \"Demon Doors\" and they open only when you meet certain requirements, like one requires you to be married.  Some require you to do a great act of evil and one even requires your character to get fat!  Amidst the character interaction you can actually sleep with other characters.  You have to get them to like you of course, which you can do by using the \"flirt\" function.  When you go into your character profile and look at the statistics it has a line for orientation.  So that leads me to believe that your character can be more than just hetero!  A shame that your character is predefined as a male now that I think about it... I assume a lot of people would enjoy that added feature to choose a female.  Anyway, there's a demon door that also requires you to sleep around, how convenient that it's also near a bordello... which caters too all spectrums, from tantalizing to...well... disturbing.  On top of all this your character can buy houses and even get married.  This of course entails wooing the people and giving them gifts most of the time, but you can buy wedding rings from traders to seal the deal.  You can go to the level where you have a house in multiple areas and have a spouse in all areas, so multiple wives if you're into that kind of thing.The way your character gains experience is kind of interesting in my opinion and it's definitely pretty inventive.  You can get experience the normal ways: by killing enemies or completing quests.  Completing quests, as usual, gives you the most and you get it all at once.  But for killing enemies, when you destroy one, these little green globes fall on the ground and then it's up to you to collect them all in order to get all the experience they drop.  This adds a little more challenge in the game, because you can't just run off.  I think there's a bit of a time limit to collect all the globes as well, but you can also hold down the right trigger and it attracts them to you.  However, they are material items so they can get stuck behind other enemies in the way or rocks or whatever is in the way of the terrain.  Some you have to go track down if they get stuck!  The only problem with this is that you have to return to the guild in order to spend the experience points for leveling up the character.  It's not like other Role Playing games where you just go into the character profile and you can spend the points right away.  This is kind of annoying on some levels, like if you're nowhere near a Cullis Gate or in a new area where you're just lost and exploring.Okay, on to the parts that I actually hated about this game.  I have to preface this by saying I love taking my character on quests in any Role Playing game, it's a serious part of the genre and without quests it just wouldn't be as fun!  Now in any game of this nature there are main quests, quests that are necessary for your character to complete, and side quests, quests given to you at random by townspeople.  Now you get your main quests from the Guild Hall and you can choose which ones to accept.  This is all well and good and that design didn't bother me at all.  What was bothersome is that when you enter the area where you're about to embark on a main quest you cannot leave it!  You cannot save your game mid-quest.  You are seriously stuck doing it until you finish.  There were a couple nights where I got stuck staying up way too late because I didn't want to repeat a two hour quest when I restarted the game.  Yes, I had fun playing it, but being locked into a sequence was bothersome to me.  With a game that had so many functional options, I was surprised at this limitation.  Yes, it's more challenging, but there are some serious misgivings, especially when a single quest takes quite a long time.Personally I wasn't big on the menu options.  I love the fact that you had a ton of options.  You can wear tons of different clothes, you can get all kinds of fun and crazy items, and you can make your character do all kinds of silly things like flirt or fart with people.  The menus to scroll through these took so much time to go through that sometimes the people would walk away while I was choosing then I'd have to go find them again.  I love the options, but I think this was a case of there being just way too many.  I'm seriously torn though, because I do want to do even more!  I just wasn't big on the menu controls and I think other games have done it better, like the Baldur's Gates games, for example.With the \"Lost Chapters\" installment the game doesn't end after you beat the final boss are through most of the game.  No you get to keep going and enjoy more fun quests!  Honestly, the game is actually long enough without the extra aspect, but hey I'm certainly not going to complain about having more great game play to occupy my time.  Honestly, I can see why this game is quite popular and gaining serious notoriety.  The fun aspect of this game more than makes up for the failings.  The game certainly has a degree of silliness and absurdity in it, but that's what makes it playful and fun.  It's more of a light hearted Role Playing game when you think about it and kind of a nice break from all the extremely serious games that are currently in the market.  I quite enjoy the serious RPG, but it was just nice to play something with a generally different approach, not to mention quite creative.  I would seriously recommend this game to anyone who enjoys those kinds of games or similar Fantasy genre based games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2008"}

Metal Gear solid 3 substance, is definitly better than MGS VR missions, and MGS2: substance by far.  If any game developer is planning to make a game they made much more improved, they should check out how better this game is from the regular MGS3.  This game is definitly recomended for those who love the MGS series, and those who love stealth games.  Even if you have the regular MGS3, grab this, and if you never played MGS3 grab this. If you wanna be in a videogame where survival is not in a horror game, check this out.  If you have a PS2 and don't have this game, someone should serve you up with a facial slap.PS.oh yea...

{"product_name":"B00006M3R6","description":"Metroid Fusionis a side-scrolling action game that's more in line with the series' NES origin than its GameCube contemporary, the first-person action gameMetroid Prime. In this one, players take the bounty hunter Samus on an extermination mission through a research facility to kill X parasites--nasty creatures that absorb and assimilate the powers of their host. After she survived an X attack through the use of a vaccine made with X parasite DNA, she can now absorb the parasites to regain health and obtain special powers, like the morph ball, space jump, and wave beam. The problem is that the parasites are quickly making their way through the research lab's many dangerous projects and subsuming their abilities.As a special bonus to GameCube owners,Metroid PrimeandMetroid Fusioncan each unlock special features in the other game via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable. For example, by completingMetroid Fusion, you can unlock the original NES version ofMetroidinMetroid Prime. By completingMetroid Prime, you can unlock Samus's fusion suit for use inMetroid Prime.","reviewerName":"Charlie Brooks","summary":"New story, classic gameplay","reviewText":"While the Metroid series begins advancing into the realm of 3rd person shooters on Nintendo's consoles, Samus Aran returns to classic form on the Game Boy Advance. Metroid: Fusion takes the classic gameplay that made the series so popular and adds a few new twists on it. When Samus finds herself trapped among parasitic aliens and wearing a stripped down version of her power suit, it's up to you to guide her through a burned out space station using all the old tricks, from jumping and running to rolling up into a ball and hopping through vents. It's classic side-scroller action, and should feel immediately familiar to Metroid veterans.The game itself is a little on the short side, but has a fast-moving and interesting story that paces itself well. As you regain power bit by bit as Samus, you'll be faced with a new challenge as you take on the SA-X, an alien duplicate of a fully-powered Samus. If the game has a flaw, it's that it feels a little too familiar. While the plot is new, you're still basically playing through Metroid or Super Metroid, picking up power-ups in increments and waiting to get strong enough to take on the main villain. That said, the formula works well, and is definitely worth a play through.With a new story and classic gameplay, Metroid: Fusion scratches an itch that even the high quality of the Metroid Prime series has missed. It's a return to classic gameplay, and makes for a wonderful treat to veteran gamers. Newcomers to the series will receive a treat as well with a fun and moderately challenging side-scroller that shows off how the series became so popular. All told, Metroid Fusion is a solid game that provides just the right mix of nostalgia and new experiences.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2009"}

The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

The newest SC suffers from this slightly as it does feel like the same old game, but that is also its strength.  There isn't anything new that takes away from the core enjoyment of this supreme fighter because other than the new SW characters everything is meshed together for a smooth experience. The new critical finish comes into play so little as to non existent.  There is alot under what appears a shallow surface, however. The character creation only gets fun once you master it and unlock the cool equipment and weapons.  Ideally the game wants you to take everyone through its 5 chapter story mode offering but the hardcore restart elements of mission mode (my favorite part of the old game(s) are redone in the somehow less fufilling TOWER mode(it is lacking the storyline text& map that made the original missions more fun.)  Survival mode is redone as a backward crawl into the dungeon of the tower.  The unlockables come easier but it feels right as this is a more challenging SC as well.  Changes like these and the customizable skill and equipment set make SCIV VERY replayable.  I know this my thumbs still burn especially after taking the unwieldy DARTH VADER through arcade mode which took me longer than I care to admit.  Darth V. is tough to control as he should be with his mechanical legs, his forces powers and throws are tougher to use but with practice he can be worth the effort.  The story text for each character is enjoyable, and the incredibly deep moves list for each fighter is accessible from the pause menu as always.  SCIV is frustratingly hard at the right moments, and addictive in all the right places with an abundance of strategy and configurability, that plus its satisfying catalogue of fighters will have this disc running hot in my PS3 for awhile. BTW The install feature to hard drive doesn't shave as much off the load times as I was hoping for but I like having the option.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2008"}

Once you get control of Link, however, you get a whole new impression.  This is a welcome addition to the Zelda series and ranks up with Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time in terms of playability and pure fun.The story takes place over a century after the events of Majora's Mask.  The world is composed of several small islands separated by water.  The sheer size of this game is unbelievable.  Once you have overcome some basic obstacles, you can move freely about the ocean, pursuing side quests if you want.  The dungeons are fewer than in previous games, but considering the sheer size of them and the number of puzzles involved, you will probably not notice.  The side quests are larger too, and far more involved.  If you expect to find every single item and secret in the game, be prepared to put in over 40 hours.Overall, this is a fine addition to the Zelda series and is reason enough to get a Gamecube even if Metroid Prime, Eternal Darkness, and Resident Evil didn't convince you.Highly Recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0050SZ836","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Bigger and more badass, but feels more like Borderlands 1.5","reviewText":"The Good: Excellent enhanced visuals for PC, a decent story this time around, hilarious tongue-in-cheek humor, more loot than you can shake a pistol at, tons of side quests and huge maps to explore, badass tokensThe Bad: Extremely difficult unless played co-op, respawning is frequent and extremely irritating, trekking maps on foot is monotonous, story has a crappy ending, micro managing loot is a real chore, character customization is underwhelmingShooting things is what this game is all about and I mean all about. Borderlands is highly successful in mixing RPG with FPS bringing the best of both worlds to the table. Borderlands 2 is more of the same just bigger and more bad ass. If you didn't like the first game you won't like this one either. Fans of the last game will be very happy with this second installment.There is actually more of a story line here with more main quests. Of course there are a good 50+ side quests that you will pour dozens of hours into. You get to play as a new set of characters, but the same classes. I stuck with Maya the Siren again in this one, and I loved her Phaselocking ability where I could make enemies hover in the air for a bit or do damage to large enemies. You will also be happy to know that you can customize your character's head and skin as you find new ones as loot, but I would have liked a more detailed character customization system; it just feels a bit tacked on.There are just so many different enemies and guns in this game I couldn't even count. The guns are all varied with different stats, but you will be micro managing these again and it does become annoying. I wound up selling or dropping about 80% of the guns I found because a lot of them are pretty useless. This goes for shields, relics, grenade mods, and other things. There are 6 different class of weapons: rocket launchers, pistols, assault rifles, sniper rifles, sub-machine guns, and shotguns.You will always be switching up between different weapons in your four slots (that you slowly unlock). I never stuck with a single weapon for too long because I was always finding better ones. Enemies are constantly dropping loot and some weapons are rarer than others. Some do elemental damage which is actually a huge factor in Borderlands. Armored enemies are weak against corrosive weapons, and shielded enemies are weak against shock weapons. The new slag weapon coats enemies in purple goop that makes them weak to any weapons fire. Some of the weapons are pretty unique, I never found two that looked the same. Some have unique abilities like faster reload, better accuracy as you fire, and even one gun was cursed that slowed me down and made obnoxious noises when I fired. Some guns you can throw when you reload and it will explode as a grenade and regenerate in your hand. The guns are just awesome in this game and you will be looking for new ones every second you play.Of course the game is tough as nails, but as you level up you can unlock new abilities. This game is designed for multiple play throughs because you will probably reach around level 30 and maybe a bit further even after you complete every single quest in the game. You won't unlock all the abilities, or even get the best loot until you do. In fact, Borderlands 2 is more designed around co-op this time around because the best loot is only available with more players on board. The game is also extremely tough without someone playing with you. The game keeps enemies leveled up with you so that makes the game even more difficult than the last. One thing that I really loved were the badass tokens that would raise stats just a smidgen for completing in game challenges.This leads into the biggest complaint I have about the series: Respawns. You respawn at certain points, but you will die hundreds of times in this game. When you do you have to back track to where you died, and these maps are huge. Some maps let you use Catch-A-Ride vehicles, but most of them don't. This was just so frustrating when I would die 15 times while clearing an area, suffer through the long respawn animation, backtrack, and some times die in just one hit. You go into Fight For Your Life mode which allows you to revive with full shields if you can kill an enemy. This alleviated the frustration a tad, but if there are no enemies nearby to kill quickly you're screwed. On top of this, the enemy that killed you will regain full health if you die. That includes bosses. This is just so frustrating and made me just want the game to end. The second thing I really hate about this series is the constant enemy respawning. Once you leave an area and come back all the enemies respawn. This made doing missions annoying because I just run by them all. I understand they have to respawn in a game like this which is focused around large maps, but I personally fond it a nuisance.If you have friends this isn't so bad, but be warned when playing by yourself. Besides that, the game keeps the tongue-in-cheek humor of the last game with more characters and return of the past characters. You really get to know them more this time around with about ten times the amount of dialog. The story is decent, but has a pretty crappy ending. It is predictable and isn't anything special. Just know that you are here to kill everything, and I mean everything. I found myself entertained throughout the whole game with double the amount of areas to explore, more side missions, and just more of everything. I really wanted to see more change in the series, so in the end this game just feels like Borderlands 1.5.At least PC gamers get enhanced visuals with some nice touch-ups. Higher resolution textures, further draw distance, FXAA, and higher FPS which can be capped at 120. This is the superior version over the consoles because you also can't get pin-point precision while aiming with a joystick. I could snipe like I never could on a controller, and it made the game a tad more tolerable in terms of difficulty.I only have a few major complaints, but they are just staples of the series. If you can tolerate the monotonous trekking around, respawning enemies, and constant death then pick this up. Fans of the last game know what they are getting into so this is a warning for new comers. I recommend playing this with at least one friend because the game is brutal. Lots of enemies, lots of dying. I also didn't quite care for the constant micro management of all the loot. This is a great mix of FPS/RPG elements and should be played by fans of either genre.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2012"}

The maps seem to be bigger than other military shooters as well.  The sound, destructible environments, scenery, and music are all very well done. The use of vehicles really brings variety to the missions. The guns in this game were EXCELLENT! I like the way that once you found a collectible weapon you can mix and match them to use the combination of weapons that worked best for you in each mission.

The hype is totally gone and I was left with a terrible system. Luckily for me Nintendo refunded the thing once they heard that the 3D effect nukes my eyes, so I have $250. Because of the 3DS I'm not a mindless Nintendo fanboy anymore, I'm willing to give the competition a chance.

I guess \"once a fanboy, always a fanboy\" works with me)The reason for the negative review? The second 3DS slide pad add-on. It nearly doubles the size of the system, adds a few ounces to the weight, it takes a AAA battery to power and it should've come with the system from the start. Wait a year or two for the inevitable 3DS revision that comes with a second slide pad and a battery that lasts twice as long as the poor battery in the current 3DS model. The main reason Nintendo hasn't already released a revision is that they have to get rid of millions of systems before they can push out the revision model; they also don't want to piss off Ambassadors, but honestly Nintendo Ambassadors paid $250 to help Nintendo beta test a console release. In the words of the great Sonic the Hedgehog: That's no good!It has potential, but the current model is incomplete and flawed. Seriously, wait for the revision to get it or just go for a Vita, or just keep playing your DS systems during the wait for the revision model's release.

This game was designed for multiple playthroughs (i have started a new game 4 times now without ever finishing the story) its near impossible, if not completely impossible, to do everything in this game in one playthrough.but while all this is great fun, this game can be very frustrating at the same time. trying to help navigate survivors to the safety areas can be a pain as they are quite stupid. they tend to stand there and try to fight off zombies instead of running with you're character as you call out. which to me is frustration due to some bad game design and stupid AI, and not extremely difficult gameplay.

Although my cousin was too young to have a clue, I was at the age that I could enjoy quality gaming.  My brother and I borrowed Super Contra over and over again.  Unfortunately, we never got our own copy.Finally that oversight has been amended.  Not only can you unlock the original Contra (which I've never had the opportunity of playing) and Super Contra in this game, Contra 4 is an excellent game in itself.  Yes, it's brutally hard at times.  I see several reviewers complaining about this, so it needs to be addressed.  As hard as it is, it's not really any more difficult than Super Contra, IMO.  Anybody who knows anything about Contra should expect this kind of difficulty from a game with its legacy.  People should be happy that they allow you to choose your difficulty (even though Easy doesn't let you play through all the levels).  I appreciate the challenge, but if you don't want a game that you will die in A LOT then you shouldn't buy Contra 4.One of the coolest additions is the Challenge Mode.  You can unlock it by beating the main game on any difficulty.  There are 40 challenges (many repeat the same concept, but occur in a different level) that require you to make it through levels with limited ammo, at a certain speed, not shooting any hostages, etc.  The later challenges get extremely hard to the point that I thought some were impossible.  I eventually succeeded, however, through practice.  If you can beat the challenges you can beat the main game on Normal and Hard mode.  Really I consider the challenges to be training for the main game on Normal and Hard difficulty.  You will learn how to dodge enemies on the fly, destroy numerous enemies swarming you from all directions, and zoom through levels by finding shortcuts.  This also adds plenty of extra play time to an already beefy game.Multiplayer co-op is also an option, although I have yet to try it out.  I don't know anybody with a copy so I am unable to enjoy the fun of blasting enemies with a friend.  Also, one feature that I really like in Contra 4 is that you can carry 2 guns at a time (you switch between them with the L button), and if you get two of the same weapon it powers up (in Easy all guns come powered up).Take the time to die a few hundred times and you will eventually become Rambo in this game.  You'll be dodging bullets, blasting enemies, and making jumps like a pro.  Satisfaction will fill your senses as you effortlessly flow through mind-numbingly difficult levels.  What else would you want from a Contra game?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2009"}

It has a great yet crazy story that sends its characters on an emotional roller coaster, and puts you into a mind trip. It seems non-linear because throughout the game, you will be forced to make decisions, and these decisions have different results, and although the decisions you make may seem like the right ones, the results are as often negative (if not more so) then positive, but your team must push on despite their misfortunes. Because of this, I would best describe this game as an interactive military drama over a shooting action video game. Not to say that there isn't that much action, because the action is definitely there, and it's very unbelievable and unrealistic, considering the number of soldiers that attack you throughout the game by far exceed the 1 battalion that the story claims is there, but that's part of what makes the game....come on, how exciting of a game would it be otherwise.The multiplayer for this game isn't that great, but it's not that bad either. It looks to me like the same old multiplayer, but in 3rd person instead of 1st. With that said, you can definitely tell that the designers of this game were concentrating on the campaign, and added a multiplayer to satisfy what people want these days. Since I like playing campaign modes and treat the multiplayer more like an added extra, I have no problem with the multiplayer being substandard. In fact, I have been quite upset with how short the campaigns are for the latest Call of Duty games.To conclude my review, I want to say that until now, I have never played a video game that exceeded my expectations the way that this one has.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J4VQ","reviewerName":"Michael Laferriere","summary":"Sony should have released the slim first and then the cadillac fully featured phat consoles","reviewText":"I purchased this console as a replacement for a 60gb phat PS3 that had given the YLOD (Yellow Light Of Death) twice already. My main use for the PS3 is to run Gran Turismo on so this is a perfect upgrade especially with Gran Turismo 6 coming out soon!I was amazed at how silent the slims are compared to the phat style. I wasn't sure it was even for a bit until I felt a slight wisp of air coming out of the back.Moving the data from the older PS3 to the new one was pretty easy to set up. You just use an Ethernet cable (standard or crossover as pretty much all devices nowadays will auto setup) and then tab over in the menu and let it go. The PS3 kept saying it was going to take an hour but it was more around two hours to completely copy everything over. You will also want to deactivate your games and videos on the original PS3 as some of these purchased items will only run on the original console.Sony has decided to remove \"Life with Playstation.\" I used to like to run Folding@home with this. What is wrong with perhaps saving a life or letting your PS3 be part of a medical breakthrough Sony? Its bad enough the pulled backwards compatibility and cut the number of USB ports down, removed slots for flash memory and worst all removed the ability to run Linux on machines. Good machine, bad company. The newer crippled slims are VERY quiet compared to the older phat consoles.Pro's:Silent!Less power consumption than older PS3'shas an actual button to eject & power on/off instead of the older \"sensor\" buttonDid I say silent? Hard to tell this is on sometimes!Bravia sync works on the slims and super slims.Con's:No backwards support (Some PS2 games are still really fun!)No Linux (Yes, people did use Linux for a while and some universities used these for research)Not as stylish as the older ones, (I really liked the round cover and chrome front)Only two USB portsNo compact flash, memory slots etc.Was it worth it? At these prices, YES!As a side note, I purchased it through one of those Amazon Warehouse deals and it was rated as \"used acceptable.\" It came in the original box, with a dual shock controller, cables etc & manuals! The console had just a hint of dust which matched the outline of the cardboard in the box. The controller was likely not used or very lightly if at all. The joysticks both had NO sign of wear and the controller charged up just fine. The only indication that this had ever been used was the fact that it had the latest firmware.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0001ADAME","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyableReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"R.

{"product_name":"B00BGAA29M","description":"","reviewerName":"Jeffrey Owens","summary":"Nostolgic, Yet New","reviewText":"This game is a simple review for me, and won't be as long as my previous ventures. This game is amazing, and I think the critics were extremely unfair to this game.I can understand where critics come from when it concerns the story; the story took a bit of a backseat at times with some situations not fully fleshed out or explored, such as the relic temples that take up about a third of the game (specifically the end). However, that could also be because they might want to venture into a sequel in the future, and I hope they do (they should really expand upon the story themes and ideas that were questioned and brought up throughout). However, the story was simple, straight forward, and wasn't very confusing or convoluted, and again if anything had missed story elements that could have been explored.As for the gameplay, the game is actually quite fluid and easy to grasp, and yet difficult and requires precision and learning from your mistakes. Critics, again, were very unfair in terms of their reviews concerning how hard the game is, but really this game is not that hard if you have played previous platformers (I personally played Sly Cooper, Jak and Daxter, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, and Ratchet and Clank series so I was well versed going in). Really, again, it is a lot of timing and being extremely defensive; always be aware of your surroundings, how your enemy attacks, and when to use what dodges, jumps, ect. In short, the game teaches you as you go, and although the checkpoints are difficult, really they are nothing new when looking back on the type of genre it is from. The gameplay operates very simply, which actually is my only other complaint of the game, all leading back to this game having missed opportunities. To me, the controller for the PS4 could have been used so much more interestingly in terms of combat (the triggers and shoulders were not used, and I often wondered if they could have added a ranged attack beyond the super-powered range attack, or maybe defensive skills to use like a relic shield or something). Also, the touch pad was avoided, and I wondered if maybe the touchpad could have been used as a means of something in the game beyond the typical possibly gimmicky stuff (gathering the relics or sunstone pieces, ect.) I thought of the touch pad as a means of maybe directing the ranged attacks after firing, or maybe you can get a relic missile attack of some sort and can direct if that way, or maybe in a less combat focused manner it could have been used as a pop-up map on-screen of where you are, the layout of the area, and so on, and maybe in combat holding it down on an enemy could analyze them and find their flaws (especially useful for bosses). In short, missed opportunity, but I hope a sequel comes to really expand upon the story and the controller use.Lastly, the things you expect of next-gen systems. Looks beautiful, plays extremely fun and addicting, and although frustrating at times it never gets Demon Souls hard or anything like that. The music is extremely reminiscent of Crash Bandicoot, and even the color schemes are too (defiantly can tell Mark Cerny had a hand in the game making). The sound effects are all fun, and it was the first game that made me smile at the use of the mic in the DS4 (such an immersive feature, love it). And there is tons of replay ability; the main story alone will probably take about three takes to find all the treasure possible, plus there are two difficulties, time trials, and combat arena scenarios.Overall, a fantastic game that, at times, feels like it played it a little too safe and sound, but maybe that was for the best. But like every review I write, this is a personal and possibly biased view, and I both encourage a playthrough or rent to try it yourself, and also questions to myself of maybe things I missed. Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Rich Stoehr \"Idle Rich\"","summary":"Goes right for the throat and doesn't let up","reviewText":"Stephen King once wrote of two types of horror. There's the cerebral, subtle horror of things like the Twilight Zone, and then there's the gross-out factor, the gore-fest, the glee of splattered blood and rotting corpses.Make no mistake, \"Resident Evil\" is firmly horror of this second type, and it pulls no punches in its attempt to spill as much blood as possible. Particularly this Gamecube re-make of the classic game, in which the graphics and the sound effects have been lovingly re-rendered to highlight each and every grisly detail.To be honest, the original \"Resident Evil\" games never really captured my attention before. The graphics seemed choppy, the storylines cheesy, and the sound effects overdone. This version for Gamecube, however, has turned all of that around, and the game is better for it.The graphics are probably what did it for me most of all. Wonderfully moody and evocative lighting effects, dramatic camera angles, lush moving backgrounds, and of course, brutally gory splatter effects abound. I spent a great deal of my first run through the game just stopping and marvelling at the sheer graphic beauty of it. From the dust puffing up under your character's feet as she (or he) runs, to the wind blowing through the grass and trees outside, to the realistic reaction of a water puddle as you splash through it, to the shifting shadows thrown by a swaying chandelier...there's eye candy everywhere in this game. And, of course, we get to see the cracked skin and bloody lips of the zombies which lurch after you, the decaying flesh of undead dogs as they chase you down a hallway, and the bright flash of fire as a corpse is immolated in purifying flame. Put simply, the graphics of the new \"Resident Evil\" are one of the best features of the game, and I challenge anyone to not be impressed by them.Other aspects of the game have definitely improved as well. Sound is used far more effectively for the game, and the storyline seems to have been cleaned up quite a bit as well. In the game, you get to play as one of two S.T.A.R.S. operatives: Jill Valentine (a fan favorite) or Chris Redfield. Their missions are mostly the same, but the details of the story are subtly different, with different characters weaving in and out of their quest through the mansion and its environs. Gameplay, in terms of controlling the characters, is still a little more clunky than other similar games, but once you get used to it it's quite adaptable.One of the good things about \"Resident Evil\" is that it's not a simple shoot 'em up game. If you shoot everything you see early on, you'll quickly run out of ammunition and you won't last long enough to get to the really good stuff. No, the trick here is to conserve ammunition whenever possible, and if you don't like what you see...RUN. Trust me, you'll be doing a lot of that if you expect to survive. Strategy and thinking ahead are key.  You'll have plenty of chance to blast away at things as the game progresses, believe me.The game definitely has some replay value as well, as new modes, weapons, and costumes are introduced as you finish the game the first couple times. Real Survival mode is tricky, and Invisible Enemy mode (yes, you read that right) has to be played to be believed. And, I must admit, getting to see Jill Valentine in her camouflage pants and army-green tank top is worth the effort of a replay in itself. Something about a girl in uniform...There are some games in the survival-horror genre I love for their ability to set a mood and stick with it, such as the \"Silent Hill\" series. These are amazing games, and come highly recommended for good reason. The Gamecube version of \"Resident Evil\" also comes highly recommended, but for a completely different reason: \"Resident Evil\" is just pure, evil fun. I lost count of the times I caught myself grimacing and laughing at the same time as I discovered some new and surprising way to take out the undead creatures attacking me. The first time you're blasting away at a zombie in front of you while the one behind you tries to swallow your Flash Grenade and gets his head blown off for his trouble, you'll see what I mean.Even if you've played previous versions of \"Resident Evil\" and enjoyed them, there's more fun to be had with this one. Turn the lights out, lock the doors, get your shotgun ready and prepare to kick it when it comes at you. This one goes straight for the jugular.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2004"}

It has a sleek and glossy look to it. Most of all, I like its portability. It is so small that you can fit it in your front shirt pocket. Some complain that because it does not have the lid like the SP that it is prone to scratching but I have had no problems it being scratched up. I keep mine in my front pocket. I wouldn't recommend placing it in a purse along with keys which can scratch it like any other device.The screen itself is small but it is very much usable. The picture quality may be better than the SP because the picture has been ported into a smaller area. It is the same principle as when you play your Game Boy Advance on a big screen tv. The picture becomes grainy and horrible because it was not designed for a big screen. But if you port it to a smaller screen, it becomes almost like HD. I love the back light which allows you to see the game even in a dark room. In that sense it is much like the SP.I also do notice one advantage over the SP that no one seems to have noticed about the Micro. The battery life seems to be longer. I have used the SP and it seems that this one has a slight advantage in battery life. You can play your game a little bit longer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2011"}

The members of this enigmatic group are the ones who were trapped under the ruins of Midgar for three long years the Deepground soldiers. Vincent Valentine finds himself pursued by several elite members of the mysterious Deepground organization.

Then X-2 comes along and we get a continuation of a Final Fantasy story, a series first. Well apparently since then, Square got in an excited mode and released their plan for the \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\". First was Advent Children, the CG movie that was well-liked but had its detractors. There was also Last Order, an anime style short, then there's Crisis Core and Before Crisis. Next is Dirge of Cerberus, which focuses on Vincent Valentine. It's not that it's a terrible game per se, it's just that everything that's not the actual gameplay itself works.Story: Set 3 years after Meteorfall(when Sephiroth summoned the Meteor but was destroyed by Holy and the Lifestream), there's a new group of enemies known as Deepground and they seem to be after civilians. It's up to Vincent as well as some cameos and appearances by his friends as well as new ones and enemies to figure what's the connection between the disappearing civilians and Omega.Graphics: I'll simply state it: the FMV's are just simply gorgeous. Taking the lushness of the scenes from X with the fluidity and character detail of Advent Children and it makes a gorgeous background for the story. The in-game grpahics? Well not so much. While it's nice to see VII's locations in full 3D, there's a kind of blandness to it all. The in-game cutscenes though are nice and similar to X's look and feel.Sound/Music: It's a very um...pretty soundtrack. There's many tracks here that are really nice to listen to. There's no real One Winged Angel or anything, that instant downloadable track but they're fairly easy to listen to. The voice acting is slight hit and miss. Vincent personally sounds way too gruff and I've never liked Cid or Cait Sith's accents. It does however contain nice work from Christy Carlson Romano(yes the Disney girl) as Yuffie and Lucrecia by April Stewart.Gameplay: Essentially Cerberus is like a cross between Resident Evil 4 and Devil May Cry. You move Vincent around a 3D environment and pressing R1 will bring up a targeting area and you can use that to aim and shoot. Unlike RE4, you can actually run which seriously helps. Enemies pack quite a wallop, especially those machine gun wielding guys and your health can drain fast. You can turn into a demon using a Limit Break item and get more enhanced powers. The big problem is that the radar kind of sucks. Enemies have incredibly aim and they can easily nail you from a mile away and you can't tell where they are. The other major hiccup, besides the general stagnant feeling of the combat, is the items. Throughout the entire game, you're only allowed a specific number of items and you can easily drain your entire health meter before you even come close to another item vendor(oddly enough, it's a jukebox).Is it a difficult game? Well it probably feels easy at times but then you find trouble spots. Like I said, enemies can pack quite a wallop and your health can go down considerably fast and when you're only allowed to carry 2 hi-potions, it gets really frustrating when you're overwhelmed. Speaking of which, there's many times in the game where you take on at least 6-7 soldiers by yourself, and you feel like \"well that isn't fair\". What does get points is the story. Seeing old characters is always great and the story is kind of interesting. In particular, the backstory between Vincent and Lucrecia is wonderfully fleshed out, making her a bigger presence(plus she's so cute). Only problem with the story is at times it doesn't make sense while other times it feels like an extension of Final Fantasy X. Maybe it's the presentation but it didn't really feel like VII, it felt like VII using an X template, if that makes sense...probably doesn't.Should you buy it? If you're a HUGE Final Fantasy fan then go for it. As for everyone else, not really. It's a fine rental, which is kind of sad really.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2006"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Alex Krasnov \"ak\"","summary":"Good, spooky fun.","reviewText":"The good: Great shootouts, weapons, and gore.

{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Wright","summary":"Halo 4: Excellent gameplay, no theater mode","reviewText":"While it has already been publicized that Theater mode didn't 'make the cut' for release date, this is a huge problem for 343 (and they seem to be treating it somewhat too lightly). Part of what made Halo 3, ODST and Reach so much fun was that you could go back and review what you had done and share that with others.  In addition, you can review your strategy based on placement of items and determine the best course to take the next play through.  Without a working Theater Mode, this is just a fleeting game experience without any way to share your experience (other than recording the output with a DVR or something). 343, you need to get Theater Mode out.For me, half the game was reviewing my game after the fact.  Without this feature set, this game is only half as much fun. 343 better wake up and get the update out that they claim that they are working on.  And no, I'm not going to be happy if I have to spend $29 extra as DLC to add Theater Mode in on top of the Limited Edition price tag.If you are contemplating purchasing Halo 4 or Halo 4 Limited Edition, know that it does not contain Theater Mode for campaign play.  Since I haven't tested multiplayer yet, I don't know if it exists for that either.  So, when you play through Campaign mode, you cannot record it for posterity, sharing or any other reason later. That game you've just played is lost. If and when 343 decides to release Theater Mode, you will have go back and replay the entire campaign over again just to record it.Frankly, I'm considering stopping my play through of my single player campaign at this point and play it at a time after Theater mode comes available. While I understand the need to cut buggy features, they really should have warned people up front that Theater mode wasn't there and not assume that people who just 'live without it'.  Better, hold the game release until Theater Mode was ready.At this point, the lack of Theater has put a major crimp in the enjoyment of this title for me. So, I thought it would be fair to warn other would-be buyers that there is no Theater in this release. That doesn't mean there won't ever be, but it may end up as a 'for pay' DLC.StoryNot done playing, but will update this part after I've played through more.  Clearly, I'm only about an hour in, so I really can't say much yet.  So far, I've enjoyed what I've seen of it.GameplayThe gaming system feels much like most Halo games.  Although, the gun sounds ring just a tad on the hollow side.  I was expecting higher quality sound effects from the guns.  I'm playing on Normal mode and it's relatively easy to do away with the covenant on board the 'Forward Unto Dawn'.  As for much else beyond this, I'm debating about continuing with my game at this point or waiting until 343 gets Theater mode out the door (which, of course, could take months).GunsSo far, it's standard weapons both UNSC issue and Covenant.  Farther in, I'm hoping to get hold some even cooler weapons.Limited EditionWith the Limited Edition, you get codes to unlock various things (Male or Female avatar, full video access to live action movie 'Forward Unto Dawn' in Halo Waypoint, and some other exclusives).  It's got some reasonably nice small books included, but nothing I would jump for joy over.  The books are more for looks than anything else. It's got one silver pouch that you can rip open with a briefing in it and a zipper pouch containing the extras codes. I was actually expecting just a bit more from the Limited Edition, but I guess the game itself is enough. The game itself is two disks in a white metal case with the UNSC eagle logo on the front.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2012"}

Even if you didn't like Final Fantasy XII, however, Revenant Wings is so different that it's almost an entirely new game.  That also means that if you loved Final Fantasy XII there's no guarantee you'll like Revenant Wings.Vaan and Penelo are now full fledged sky pirates.  In this adventure they're helping the Aegyl people in the land of Lemure.  In truth, the story is a lot simpler than Final Fantasy XII.  It is also a bit more character driven.  This adventure is an all new one, though.  It takes place after Final Fantasy XII but even if you didn't finish the original game, it's no big deal.  There are a few familiar faces, and a couple of references to the storyline of the original, but you're not missing anything by not having played the original title.In terms of how the game looks, Revenant Wings stands tall.  The cutscenes are some of the best looking the DS has ever had by far.  Even superior to Square-Enix's own Final Fantasy III.  The game itself also looks pretty good.  There is a good deal of unique artistic design here.  Those who played Final Fantasy Tactics Advance will be able to recognize the art style instantly.  Its also very colorful looking and bright.  Revenant Wings also has a strong soundtrack.  Much of it being remixed from the original game, but it sounds wonderful nonetheless.Eye candy aside, how exactly does the game play?  This is where it becomes harder to judge Revenant Wings.  The game is a Real Time Strategy game that's not really made for the RTS crowd.  Needless to say, even if you don't like RTS games, you might still get into Revenant Wings.  At the same time, however, the game is a little over simplified.  Especially when compared to Final Fantasy XII.  Everything is controlled via stylus.  You can tap units and move them or you can trace out a box to select more than one if need be.If you're looking for a deeply strategic and challenging game, you won't really find it with Revenant Wings.  It has a lot of what you'd expect from a strategy game.  Such as characters who are better as ranged fighers, or better suited for melee.  You'll also find that each type has a weakness.  What it doesn't have that you'd expect, however, is a lot of strategy.  There's a strategic element to the game but you probably won't have to utilize a lot of it.  In terms of difficulty the game is incredibly easy.  While there will be some missions that'll take you a while, it'll mostly come as a result of the game speed not moving fast enough.  Your units move very slowly on the battlefield.  You can't speed things up much either.Along those lines, the game has been simplified a lot.  Where as Final Fantasy XII had a lot of complexity--especially with its gambit system--Revenant Wings doesn't offer a whole lot at all.  The gambit system has returned but there's not nearly as much tweaking and experimenting to be done with it here.  You can only assign one action to characters.  On the other hand, you'll probably spend a lot of your time giving orders manually anyway.Units get bunched up a lot as well.  Things can get pretty hectic on the battlefield.  But it's no fun when units get bunched up and you're only trying to select one.It's hard to judge Revenant Wings.  It is by no means a bad game.  On the other hand, though, its like comparing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance to the original Final Fantasy Tactics.  Final Fantasy XII was a huge game filled with a lot of complexity in its story and gameplay.  Revenant Wings sacrifices all that.  Perhaps simplicity is key in this case, but sometimes its hard to escape the fact that Revenant Wings, like Tactics Advance, could've stood to reach a little higher.  The story could've been a little deeper and the complexities to the combat could've been fleshed out and expanded more.  Regardless of that, the game is still pretty fun.Pros:+A bit more focus on the characters this time around+Very simple game to pick up and play+Beautiful game--especially the cutscenes+Good soundtrackCons:-Combat is slow-Forgettable story-Far too easy for a strategy game","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2007"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

It is great to be back - but you might expect a few more improvements than what you get.First, the basics. You are Commander Shepard, a male or female human character, the same person from game 1. You were slain but then resurrected by a group called Cerberus. Once again you build up a team of very unique characters, interacting with them through a variety of dialogue choices, affecting your relationships with them.The graphics are really well done. They have taken it up a notch from Mass Effect 1, and that's saying something. The audio is also well done, getting you to feel the emotions and motivations of the characters. Some of the dialogue is laugh out loud funny.They did make some improvements from the first game. Those incredibly awful slow moving elevators are now gone, and in fact the characters joke about it at times. Also, the ridiculously silly \"drive all over a planet in search of a spot\" resource gatherings are gone. However, somehow they came up with just as bad of a solution! Now you SPIN a planet (which doesn't make sense, shouldn't you in your spaceship spin AROUND the planet?) and you look for resources. Surely in an advance space-faring universe they would have gotten a computer program to do this with pinpoint accuracy. Why would they have a human watching the graph go up and down? Maybe Mass Effect 3 will finally get this right.Also, as much as I enjoyed Mass Effect 2, when I go back and play Mass Effect 1 the characters there feel so much more enjoyable. I really love some of their unique quirks. Maybe part of it is that Mass Effect 1 was so fresh and new when we played it. It's hard to tell. Mass Effect 2 just doesn't seem to have that same level of connection.Mass Effect 2 does encourage you to replay Mass Effect 1 because you can import your old characters and have an effect on the new game. So it is definitely worth your while to have several different fully built characters in Mass Effect 1 and bring each one in for a pass through Mass Effect 2. This is not a one-shot-and-done game. It's a game you'll want to enjoy over and over again. trying the different paths.I definitely recommend that anyone who plays Mass Effect 2 at least play through some of Mass Effect 1 first, if not all of it. There is a LOT of background provided in Mass Effect 1 which makes the playing of Mass Effect 2 all that more enjoyable.Some quite famous actors are involved here. Martin Sheen, Carrie-Anne Moss, Michael Dorn and others have over 25,000 lines of dialogue. You are really getting a full fledged movie experience.Highly recommended, but give yourself time to play through multiple times and enjoy the ride!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00004U55E","description":"It's been nearly 10 years sinceWolfenstein 3Dforever  popularized the first-person shooter, and at long last everyone's favorite Nazi  killer, B.J. Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done.

And if you shoot someone in another room they come in with their guns ready. The game is fast paced and runs very smoothly. The on-line play is different from any other. You attack from a beach and try to make it to the objective. Sometimes yu only capture flags. Other times you have to blow up a building and steal gold which you must then take to truck while many opponents try to stop you. This is the best team oriented on-line play I have ever seen. You have 4 choices of characters and each has it's own specialty i.e. an engineer is the only one who can set dynamite.It's the best first person shooter since Half-Life.

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Massive","reviewText":"Mass Effect comes from BioWare.  The creators of Knights of the Old Republic.  Because of that, it goes without saying that Mass Effect feels very similar in its RPG like approach.  This is no clone of Knights of the Old Republic, though.  Mass Effect is its own game and it's a very fantastic game at that.  This review is pretty long.  If need be, you can look to the bottom for a list of pros and cons.You're John Shepard.  The game takes place in the year 2183, and humanity has come to explore the Galaxy like never before.  You'll discover a series of races throughout the galaxy and there's a sense of injustice afoot.  Tensions between races are also high.  You'll come across people who hardly trust a certain character because of their race.  Just the same, a Turian (one of the many races in the game) named Saran has betrayed the Galactic council and its up to you to stop him and bring justice to the Galaxy.  Mass Effect has a pretty intriguing storyline that grips you from the moment you begin.  It's also well written with some fairly interesting characters.The storyline is told through fantastic cut scenes and some fantastic voice acting.  The quality of these scenes is movie like in its execution.  The game also looks fantastic.  Some of the character models look almost lifelike.  In terms of eye candy, Mass Effect is sure to delight.  It also sounds really good.  There's a lot of great music here.  Again, it sounds movie like.  Hardly any game sounds better.  The music always manages to fit the mood and situation at hand.You begin by making a character.  Much like Knights of the Old Republic, you're allowed to customize what he looks like and here you're also able to give your character a back story.  As the game goes on, you'll participate in several conversations.  These conversations have a direct impact on the storyline as well as shaping your character.  Most times they'll also have an effect on the outcome of certain situations.  Not always, but often they do.  There's also a light and dark attribute going on much like Knights of the Old Republic.In terms of Gameplay, Mass Effect is a pretty complex game.  It plays a lot like a third person Shooter, but at its core it is definitely an RPG.  As you traverse the field you'll have a squad at your command.  You control Shepard and can give orders to your troops.  Either you can send them ahead to attack, rally them or tell them to keep their distance.  You can give these kinds of commands any time you want.  Just because it plays like a third person shooter, though doesn't mean you treat the game as such.  Mass Effect is not a very easy game.  It is important to add strategy to a situation rather than go in with guns blazing.  Your enemies have some attacks that can take off a lot of health at any given time.  The AI of your characters is sometimes questionable, though.  For the most part, they help in battle, but sometimes you'll feel like a one man army.Throughout the adventure you'll also gather Medi-gels and Omni-gels.  Medi-gels heal you while Omni-gels are for using decryption or electronics on devices like locked doors or containers.  Speaking of locked doors, you'll come across some of those too.  As well as locked containers and other things you'll need to override.  You'll do it by entering a series of button presses.  This is actually a pretty annoying mini-game.  Screw up even once and you lose your chance to override and you'll have to result to using Omni-gels.There is also a lot of customization to take in.  All characters have certain talents.  Whenever you level up you can increase a characters rank in a talent.  In time they'll be able to do things like open locked doors with ease or be able to better handle certain weapons easier.  You can also customize weapons and armor or turn them into Omni-gels.  If you turn a weapon into an Omni-gel, though, it's gone forever.  For the most part, the game is pretty free in terms of what you can do.Mass Effect has a couple of glaring problems when it comes to gameplay.  As you traverse, for one thing, the game sometimes slows down.  So it doesn't always run smoothly.  While you have control over the camera, you can't automatically position it behind you.  You always have to swivel it around.  It's not a huge problem, but it is one that can get you killed when you're surrounded by several enemies at once.  It also doesn't help that the camera doesn't swivel fast.  Also, much like Knights of the Old Republic, there are a couple of bugs that hinder gameplay.  At some points you'll even have to reload or something because of them.  There was even an instance where the game froze entirely.  In short, the game is good, but there are a lot of little nit-picky technical things that keep it from being as good as it could be.  Technical glitches that shouldn't be in the game in the first place.Mass Effect is a strong game.  It's got all the qualities that really make a game good.  It's just too bad that it has a few problems in the technical department that keep it from being an overall fantastic game.Pros:+Strong storyline+Excellent voice acting and script+Very interactive story+Fantastic looking visuals+Good strong soundtrack+Simplistic, yet strategic combat+Deep customizationCons:-A couple of camera issues-Sometimes there's a slowdown in frame rate-A few technical bugs and glitches; sometimes these will make you have to reload your game... very annoying","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2007"}

Fun, scary and intense! Half the time Im so anxious looking for whats coming around the next corner. This game keeps you on your toes and weapons aimed ready because enemies come from all different directions. Different strategies/weapons for different enemies is refreshing, instead of just blasting away you have to take off their limbs. Great graphics, atmosphere and sound surrounds you and puts you smack in the middle of its eerie environment. The gameplay, weapons and upgrade system are done really well giving good replay value. Prob my favorite survival horror title second only to Resident Evil. Turn off the lights, turn up the sound and prepared to be scared!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2010"}

Huh","reviewText":"First off, this game has no installation and that made me very happy. A lot of PS3 games use a big chunk of space on the hard drive and I'm glad this one doesn't. The graphics are amazing, best visuals and textures i have yet to see on a game. The sound adds that extra punch the game that keeps you on the edge. The story isn't that catchy but it works. Pretty much your stuck on a space ship while 2 of your other comrades try to hack into the main system. Your two friends volunteer you to go on a cat and mouse chase and have you go all over the ship for different things. It's the usual go here, go there type of game. You'll do a lot of back tracking and collecting of different items (cash, health pack, ammo, etc). The \"alien\" aren't that much scary or detailed. The aliens are a flesh color and look like zombies with extra arms with hands as blades. I beat the first chapter and half way through the 2nd and the way the aliens look is staying the same, so far.

Vasiljevic \"Marko V.\"","summary":"Refreshing and a bit innovative RPG!","reviewText":"I just beat this game.Ok, first, is it a horror game, like 'M rating' imlies? The introductory movie is certainly what you might call horror or black humor. The first level is moody, and the second one is ... I don't know whether to call it a taoist scary tale or something that will make you laugh like crazy. It's something in between. There is one more ghost tale and that's it!!! Game continues with lot of humor and great characterization and NO  SPOOKY STUFF!!!System is like Persona and bit like a Materia system in Final Fantasy VII, considering Yuri only. Main character 'tames' demons and fictive beings and has ability to fuse with them (get their appearance and powers), just like you do in Persona 2, except in Persona 2 you don't become exactly that creature/persona. Other guys in game are typical, you have normal attack and special one, which drains magic points (think spells).People in game (except Yuri) are your typical fighter, white mage, mage, but they are well disguised by game designers in gun shooter, priest's daughter, old Chinese sage and so on. There is even funny female spy: she doesnt have spells but she always calls her friends on the phone and then you see funny animation, like drop of brick on opponent's head.What I dislike about game is that it goes linear with no backtracking required to progress , and after you defeat sub boss (after long stairs), who is really strong and after which you get movie, you need to do quests all over map at old places and read FAQs or guides, because last boss is really too hard.************************SPOILERS***************************************When you fight boss after large stairs, well that is just half a game. SAVE ITEMSI built Keith, Alice and Yuri up to level 70 and took out Alien Meta god easily, but I think you needn't do that. Level 51 is ok, because they will have ultimate spells, but again, more the merrier. For last fights, you need 10 tera extracts and just 6 7 pure roots. If your characters hit hard, 400 points or so, there is no problem, fight meta god with your melee weapon using third key and other keys IF YOU ARE AT LEVEL 70.Even if you miss some Gravestones in China and Asia, you can get them all in Europe after big fight that is not a boss fight but looks like one...What you CAN'T seem to get in Europe is get Erotic Book/'Shanghai angels' which you need to get best weapon and armor for Yuri. Pay attention about stone for getting fusion monster Amon , you need that for best fusion monster for Yuri, it's rock is in front stairs mentioned before.I must admit that some puzzles are ok and logical, but game designer made it hard and bit illogical after sub boss fight.**********************MUST READ*************************THERE IS EXTRACT SHOP IN PRAGUE AT THE END OF GAME. YOU NEED JUST 10-15 Thera Extracts and 10 Pure Roots for last bosses if you are 70+level.You HAVE to wait for Alice to get best magic , before it she doesn't have one good offensive magic before last one.BE SURE to have AT LEAST 3 crusifixes and three more bundles of Leonardo Bear, Cosmix and zodiac bracelet. Get 6 pocket watches, they are byable.If you want good ending, you have to read one of Valuable items/ a book about in which order you beat masks. Check FAQ for complete explanation. How do you challenge masks? Well, get malice to red and walk around, without going to graveyard to beat malice. Beat masks in order given in document. Since they don't come in that order, spare 90 minutes and: wait till you meet first one , run away from others. When you kill first one, wait for the second one and run away from first, third and fourth when you meet them.  The probability to meet all four in desired order is one out of 256 and thats why u run.If you miss order in first fights, kill all four in no particular order and then kill weakened versions in proper order. So, to get good ending, read book, kill masks and go to graveyard to read Alice's tombstone.*****************************CONCLUSION*******************************Fun game, in not so typical ambient for rpg,  with sometimes illogical side quests, but you can also build caracters in typical rpg fashion, find cave and battle it out till you get cash and exp. I ENJOYED IT !!!*****************************CONCLUSION*******************************After beating Persona 3, Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne,  Digital devil BOTH discs, I must admit, this game is real good and interactions between characters unforgetable!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2007"}

Sniper: Ghost Warrior certainly isn't without its faults, as it has many, however it's a game that offers something many first-person shooters don't offer. In terms of gameplay, it's mostly a game about sniping, which is both fun and rewarding since you have a really neat slow-motion effect that triggers whenever you get a head shot. The game does have some missions that are more of the run & gun Call of Duty variety, but they're a very minor part of the experience, and you'll be spending most of your time sniping your enemies from afar.The game's visuals are sometimes really nice and sometimes really mediocre. Sniper: Ghost Warrior uses Techland's Chrome Engine, which was used to power their titles such as the Call of Juarez franchise, Nail'd, as well as Dead Island, which uses the recent iteration of the engine. Like all Chrome Engine games, Sniper: Ghost Warrior has some nice lighting, detailed environmental texturing, and some overall beautifully crisp visuals. However, the graphics can often look mediocre and downright poor, like the jaggy edges due to poor anti-aliasing techniques, a lot of screen-tearing, pixelated shadows, poor looking character models and animations, etc. It's a game with many high and low points in terms of visuals, as well as overall gameplay, too.The positives of the gameplay experience are fun sniping mechanics, large and detailed environments, and just a lot of fun to be had. The negatives are things like a somewhat jerky frame-rate, some odd glitches and visual oddities, as well as some poor artificial intelligence that seem to have x-ray vision -- though this was slightly fixed with a patch.In the end, I think this game is a ton of fun and offers something a little different to first-person shooter players. The stealth and sniping gameplay is a nice change of pace.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J6KU","description":"","reviewerName":"Shane H.","summary":"Great game! Not perfect...","reviewText":"This is really a great game. Several reviews have covered the reasons why. Here are some of my pros/cons.Pros+The ability to climb onto creatures. This is just fun and different. To scale onto the back of a Chimera during battle to hack at the snake tails is something rarely seen in games. Nice touch. Try climbing onto an oxen. Its like mutton bustin'!+The pawns are cool. Interesting touch to know your pawn is being used by someone else.+Beautiful landscape+Variety of weapons and armor+fun combat (I hate God of War type combat)+fairly large open land to explore+decent amount of side quests to keep you busy+variety of monsters. Goblins get old but they have a great variety of levels of each creature and a variety of creatures. Big ones...that you can climb on to fight.Cons-Big one for me is the one character slot. You get the current saved game and that is it. I started a ranger and wanted to try a warrior instead. Erase everything and start over. This one knocked a whole star of fun out of the game for me.-Changing of current skills can only be done at the inn or specific places. Why? I understand the PS3 controller is limited. I get that. Let me reassign my quick use spells on the fly though. I find out I'm fighting undead? Let me switch things out so I can access my Holy powers since I had outfitted for Cold.-Fast travel is limited. I think a great way to add some fast travel to this game would be the Rift system already in use for hiring pawns. You are apparently already in this other plane of existence, let me come out at some other Rift stone in the game. It gets tiresome running through the same rocky canyon over and over fighting the same set of goblins that are always in the same spot. There is some fast travel via ferrystones, but they only take you back to the main city or to another stone that you can acquire.-Money system. What are these? Pennies? It costs 500 gold pieces to stay the night at the inn? Small rant but still couldn't they have knocked a zero off somewhere to make it a bit more realistic? I know, its fantasy...I waited for this to drop off the 60 bucks level and it is now well worth the money. Lots of game-play in this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SW8OS","description":"","reviewerName":"Alex Gomez","summary":"Great graphics, great gameplay, top notch voice acting... GREAT GAME","reviewText":"I'm a newcomer to the series with Golden Abyss having been my first exposure to Uncharted. Other reviewers have charged Uncharted GA with being a let-down for various reasons; a lack of epic set-pieces and innumerable touchscreen, gyroscope based min-games.Do these gimmicks detract from the overall experience and make Uncharted: Golden Abyss a game best avoided?Read the review to find out.Uncharted: Golden Abyss&#8217; first mission chronologically occurs later in the game, toward the end, but it was placed in the beginning to accustom you to the game&#8217;s climbing and shooting mechanics. Once you&#8217;re more or less in tune with the way the game plays, the mission ends halfway in (the real mission later on is quite a bit longer) and you&#8217;re taken back several weeks to the beginning of Golden Abyss&#8217; story.Gameplay: There are 3 elements to Uncharted Golden Abyss.1.) Rock climbing2.) Standard 3rd person shooting3.) Puzzle solvingRock climbing shares little difference with the kind of climbing you will find in something like Assassin&#8217;s Creed 3: Liberation. In AC3L, you merely have to hold the action button down and the game will do all the hard work (climbing) for you. In Uncharted: Golden Abyss, the only thing you have to do is press the jump button and you will automatically attach to a climbable handhold. Keep pressing the Jump button to proceed upward or downward. There are even a couple of platforming sections where you have to jump from rock to rock to avoid falling in a river, but these are more of a distraction than anything else. As previously said, the game will make the jumps for you. There is little challenge to the rock climbing or jumping, and never will you have to time a jump precisely for fear of falling to your death, unless you&#8217;re an exceptionally bad gamer with the aim of a blind sniper.Some Gamefaqs board users report a problem with Uncharted: Golden Abyss&#8217; aiming system, and that it makes lining up headshots unnecessarily difficult. In my time playing GA, I have experienced no such issue. In fact, the shooting mechanics are the finest of any game that I have played on the PS Vita and the PSP.The few times I had trouble with the shooting mechanics were during rope-climbing sections. A strategy that worked for me jumping on the rope, advancing until more enemies appear and then jumping back onto a platform and shooting from cover. Otherwise, if you try to take them out while exposed on the rope, you will be cutdown in a matter of seconds. Maybe that&#8217;s what the devs intended?There are only two complaints I&#8217;ve got about Golden Abyss&#8217; gameplay:1.) It isn&#8217;t unusual to find yourself temporarily stuck in certain areas of a stage. This is probably a standard complaint of most 3D games though.2.) The enemies in Golden Abyss, at least in the later difficulties are bullet sponges. You&#8217;d have to shoot an enemy about 100 times (not literally) before the guy dies.And finally, the touchscreen mini-games.I actually didn&#8217;t find these touchscreen based games to be much of a drawback. For those curious, this is what you&#8217;ll find yourself doing throughout Golden Abyss.1.) Rubbing dirt off of old tablets by swiping your finger across the touchscreen.2.) Moving objects around using the gyroscope.3.) Using the gyro to make sure Drake doesn&#8217;t fall during a balancing mini-game.4.) Swiping the screen to cut down plants that block the way to collectable treasures.5.) Battle bosses in cinematic fist fights by swiping the screen in the correct directions.6.) Solving puzzles to proceed with the game.If they were at all as unresponsive as the touchscreen/gyroscope gimmicks of Assassin&#8217;s Creed 3: Liberation, then the complaints would be well-founded, but they&#8217;re not. Only once did I feel frustrated during a touchscreen mini-game in Golden Abyss that seemed impossible even though I swiped the screen as commanded, but that ended up being a user error. I altered the method I used to swipe the screen, and voila, never again was responsiveness an issue. That by the way, was the 2nd to last boss fight. Well actually it was the first boss fight, seeing as how Golden Abyss surprisingly lacks any bosses until the final missions.The graphics: Uncharted: Golden Abyss is the best looking handheld game I&#8217;ve ever played, bar none. Early on, the developers treat us to views of the land in the distance as seen from the high points of the mountains you&#8217;re traversing.  These are the games best moments graphically. Later on you make your way through darker and less aesthetically pleasing environments.The voice acting is top-notch. The way Nolan North delivers his lines as Nathan Drake is unique among voice actors who specialize in video-games and anime. Nolan North is also an actor, and I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s able to become his character instead of just trying to be the character&#8217;s voice. There is a conversation Nathan has with Chase halfway in and in it, they&#8217;re arguing more or less about whether or not to continue the mission. Chase tells Nathan that it isn&#8217;t about the money. Nolan North as Nathan responds with, &#8220;it&#8217;s always about the gold&#8221;. The delivery and the emotion in North&#8217;s voice as he said that line was exceptional. I don&#8217;t usually praise voice-actors because honestly, I&#8217;m hardly ever impressed enough to rave about them, but Nolan North is among the best of the best.In conclusion:Uncharted: Golden Abyss is one of handheld gaming&#8217;s brightest moments in every category. If you&#8217;re an Uncharted fan, don&#8217;t hesitate to try Golden Abyss out if you own a Vita. If you&#8217;re a newcomer to the series or are looking for a game to keep your PS Vita from gathering dust, then you&#8217;ll be in for a treat.I definitely recommend this game to anyone who is even mildly interested in shooting games.Boss tip: There are two bosses in the game and in the latter difficulties (Hard, Crushing), they can seem impossible if you don't know what to do. But basically, just focus on doing it as QUICKLY as you possibly can. Forget about accuracy, speed will be your trump card.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

This adds a completely new dimension to sports, racing, fighting, and more games. Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience.

One is a spartan never cries out for some god to save him from getting killed on the battlefield by a better opponent no matter what , this clown cried out for Aries instead of Athena ? Athena is the patron of courage in battle , why cry out for a cowardly god like Aries who is the god of murder and cowardly arts of war? Spartan ? right. So it is one of the major issues i have this game that it isn't even close to what the mythos or history , instead it falsify all that is taught about it.

Then I flip the pouch where zipper is up but zipped, and turned on faucet full blast again for 20 seconds. The bottom is wet but none of the side walls are!

With the 3rd Street Saints, Vice Kings and the Carnales waging a city wide turf war for supremacy, there has never been a better time to visit.The game opens up with your customized character getting caught in the crossfire of a gang war. You are saved by Julius, the leader of the 3rd Street Saints, and are recruited into his gang in an effort to clean up the streets. The first couple of missions serve as a sort of introductory sequence that teaches you the mission structure of the game and introduces you to some core characters. The game has three different story arcs, one for each rival gang, for you to tackle in whatever order you would like.After each story mission you must build your respect before you will be offered the next one. There are numerous ways to build your respect, but the easiest way to do it is to take on various side missions located throughout the city. These missions range from drug trafficking to street racing. The activities get harder as you complete them, maxing out at level 8 and awarding you a prize such as unlimited shotgun ammo at your crib or taking less damage in car crashes.Almost all of activities are pretty fun, but the two most enjoyable are probably mayhem and insurance fraud. In mayhem, you are tasked with going to a certain area of the city and causing as much damage as you can within a certain amount of time. You are always given a few weapons with unlimited ammo and bonuses for destroying certain targets. Destroying everything in sight with a rocket launcher on mayhem's level 8 is one of the most enjoyable moments of the game. In insurance fraud, you attempt to throw yourself in front of traffic to collect money from lawsuits. You earn bonuses based on things like air time, hitting police cars, and the number of witnesses.Besides those side missions, there are a few other ways of gaining respect. Robbing any store you want will give you a small amount of respect. Tagging over other gang's graffiti will also net you some respect. To help you speed up the time it takes to earn respect, you can spend your money on clothes, jewelry, and tattoos for your character. These items give you respect bonuses when you complete missions. Overall, the side mission system works pretty well. It creates a good pacing for the game, preventing you from blowing through the missions in just a few hours.Besides allowing you to unlock new missions, as you gain more respect you will be able to recruit more \"homies\" (up to three at one time). \"Homies\" are friendly gang members which will help protect you by shooting out of car windows while you drive and following you around on foot. They do a pretty good job of helping you kill whoever is attacking you and hardly ever get stuck on objects such as trees. When they die, you have thirty seconds to revive them before they are permanently dead. At first this sounds like it would make the game too easy, but the \"homies\" are not overly effective, and don't take too much to kill. If you had to go find new ones every time one of them died, it would become pretty frustrating. So having 30 seconds to revive those that died turns out to be pretty convenient.When you are not building up respect, you will literally be taking back the city block by block. Completing a story mission in a certain area of the city will put that area under the control of your gang. Controlling areas of the city actually has some impact on the gameplay. You will see friendly gang members patrolling the streets, providing you a safe area to run to if you are being chased by police or enemy gang members. Controlling different districts also gives you money every day that you can get from your safe back at your crib. The more territory you control, the faster you gain money. You also get new save points as well. The game allows you to save whenever you want, placing you at the closest save point from where you saved when you reload the game. So controlling more save points is definitely nice. Sometimes rival gangs will attack territory that you control, at which point you need to stop whatever you are doing and rush there to help push back the attack. If you wait too long, you risk losing your territory. This is a nice touch, and makes you feel like you are just one small part of a larger turf war.The story missions themselves are pretty well designed and not overly difficult or annoying. There were many missions in Grand Theft Auto 3 and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas that I personally found extremely annoying and simply not fun to play. While the missions in Saints Row are challenging, I didn't run across any annoying missions like those in the GTA games. I always felt like I was making progress. The cinematic sequences for each of the missions are pretty well directed. The voice acting is great as well. The storyline turns out to be memorable and one of the highlights of the game.While playing the game, it's safe to say that you will be doing a lot of driving and shooting. The game features tons of cars, all with rock solid control. While none of them are real licensed cars, they all look different from each other and handle differently as well.There is a pretty good selection of weapons in the game as well. Most of what you would expect to see is here, including pistols, machine guns, rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and more are present. The shooting controls are vastly improved over those of Grand Theft Auto, allowing you to control the player like you would in a first person shooter. You won't find any lock on targeting here. This goes a long way in making the firefights much more intense and fun then those in GTA.The game features other big enhancements over Grand Theft Auto, the most important of which is the map system. At any point during the game you can bring up the map to set waypoints and locate new activities and missions. You can sort the map by stores, activities, missions, strongholds, and cribs to make finding locations very easy. The on screen minimap will show you the most efficient route to your waypoint or next objective, which makes navigating around the city a breeze. This is especially helpful during fast car chases.Another small but significant improvement is the ability to shoot enemies in cars through the windshield. So instead of having to fill the car full of lead to get it to stop, you can instead take out the driver with one well placed shot to the head. This is extremely useful while in car chases. Since you can drive and shoot at the same time, it's not that difficult to shoot the driver of the car chasing you through his windshield.Besides those gamplay enhancements, Saints Row is also packing some amazing visuals. The entire city of Stillwater is rendered in glorious high definition. Everything in the world is extremely detailed. The game also features pretty good looking lighting and real time weather effects. The cars in the game look excellent, especially the way they crumple on impact. When cars explode, they send pieces of metal and tires flying everywhere. The frame rate is mostly pretty solid, though it can take a dive at times when there is a ton going on. However, this never hindered my enjoyment of the game.The biggest criticism that you could have against the game is its lack of originality. In my opinion, there is nothing inherently wrong with a game copying another, especially when it manages to improve on its inspiration. The fact that Saints Row sticks pretty close to the Grand Theft Auto formula means that inherits many of the good qualities of the GTA series, making Saints Row a pretty good game in the process. Since it does manage improve upon GTA in many aspects, it's worth while for fans of the GTA series to play it. It's probably fair to say that if you liked Grand Theft Auto then you will enjoy Saints Row. If you found some aspects of GTA annoying, as I did, then it may turn out that you like Saints Row even more. In my opinion, Saints Row is the best game of its kind to be released. When GTA 4 comes out later on it may vary well topple Saints Row, but until then, Saints Row is the king of free roaming action games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYILE","description":"","reviewerName":"ahw","summary":"Lots to Do, But There Isn't Much Fun in Doing it.","reviewText":"GTA5 has a ton of content but not a whole lot of depth.  The main story-line is entertaining enough.  The voice-acting and dialogue is top notch as far as video games go.The story is ho-hum.  There are no memorable antagonists and it seems like Rockstar went out of the way to portray every single character (including the playable characters) as utterly unlikable--the game as a whole serves as a pretty damning indictment of Los Angeles/California culture, as every unlikable character in the game is a charicature of some Los Angeles stereotype.Despite the hype and the sales, I wouldn't peg GTA5 as game of the year calibre, as it suffers from bloat.  The scale and attention to detail comes off as awesome at first, but toward the end of the game it becomes a nuisance.  Getting around town, particular the remote areas, can be a chore, especially when one of the characters gets a house in the hills that is annoying to get in and out of.  There's a ton of side activities to do (tennis, golf, yoga, etc.) but a lot of them aren't very fun.  Plus, the game doesn't give you much incentive to complete the side activities or side missions.  The missions that unlock henchmen are really the only ones that give you a tangible benefit, but these missions are few and far between and there's no way of knowing which missions unlock new henchmen (unless you consult a guide).The excellent voicework and dialogue kept me playing, but after completing the game I haven't had any desire to play the game again, which speaks to the shallowness of the sidegames and missions.  At most, GTA5 is a game to buy, complete, and resell for fans of the series.The main missions eventually become repetitive and simplistic cover shooter missions and driving missions.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYILE","description":"","reviewerName":"Axle F. \"The Brutally Honest Critical Reviewer\"","summary":"Better than GTA IV in every way with only a few issues.","reviewText":"There are hundreds of reviews on how pretty this game is and music and story...I've played all the way through it now... So I'll make this short and sweet, and as always, compare it a bit between other games in the series. This is definitely an 80 out of 100 game. A few issues with certain Xbox systems drags it down a bit, including loading problems with installing both discs to the Harddrive. (This can be circumvented by using a USB 2.0 Flash drive with 10GB or above and installing the install disc on the HDD while installing the Play disc on the flash-drive. I had no problems with loading or too much texture pop-in or stuttering after that.)This game is many times better than GTA IV. I was seriously disappointed in GTA IV in nearly every way, especially after how amazing GTA San Andreas was. GTA V is longer, bigger, has better graphics, more customization options, better car handling, better gun play, more sandbox type stuff to do, absolutely amazing amounts of things to explore, and doesn't try to take itself too seriously (except for one part involving government agents in a warehouse.)Even though the map size is massively bigger than GTA San Andreas; there is just something about it that makes it feel smaller than San Andreas to me. Everything seems to be in close proximity to a road with traffic, so the wilderness feeling of being stuck in the middle of nowhere like in San Andreas is lacking (in GTA San Andreas you could get lost in the desert or forest areas, but not so much in GTA V.) That and there is only one big city and no San Fransisco or Las Vegas parody this time. The missions are great and the Heists are amazing, though they really missed out on a casino heist of some sort by not putting in an Indian Casino or Vegas/Reno setting. Here's hoping for an expansion or DLC that adds such things.The amount the main city resembles Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Long Beach, Hollywood, Malibu, the Pacific Coast Highway, and the outskirts representing a bit of Angeles Crest and the Salton Sea is amazing! There were times I would find things exactly where I would expect them to be if I was driving through LA including many landmarks or parodies of landmarks. They did an absolutely amazing job, especially at night when you look at the city from on top of a mountain.A few of my only gripes are: The garage system is seriously lacking; Each character gets one purchasable garage that can only hold 4 cars, and the garage attached to the player characters houses that can hold 2 cars often \"forgets\" or \"deletes\" cars that are parked in them. The vehicle damage models are a step backwards from the models in GTA IV and often take massive amounts of hits before showing any damage. Something seems to be wrong with the vehicle randomization code, as the same cars as you are driving are the only cars to show up, as if the type of cars that show up are based purely off of what you are driving at the time, especially after completing the main story. There are lots of different vehicles but they seem to only show up when driving a similar vehicle so you may only see certain cars once or twice for the whole game and never again, even cars that should be rather common. The flying vehicle controls are absolutely horrid; helicopters buck and pitch, and randomly twitch all over the place making flying them a massive chore, especially when needing to pick something up or land on a small spot even with maxed out flying skills. Airplanes also twitch and turn and are very sensitive to input and will often overreact to input. Really, that is about all I could find wrong with the game other than the usual open world game issues like occasional texture pop or rarely a vehicle driving halfway in the ground.Some of the things I love: A return to upgradable \"skills\" like driving, shooting, stealth, stamina, strength, flying, and such. Stunning visuals, even at 720p with the small amount of graphics memory the Xbox360 has. The land vehicle handling is wonderful and very familiar to people that play lots of racing games. You get tons of clothing options, upgradeable weapons, and customizable cars. I'm a total car nut and love to see all the bits of real life cars that show up in the vehicle design of GTA cars. There is plenty to do and explore. This game has a large amount of replay value and is definitely worth buying.If you are a fan of the GTA series, then this is a must have game.Cons:-Some install issues for certain people.-Way too much rap and hip-hop music and not enough metal, rock, techno, pop, classical or such.-Flawed and lacking garage system.-The map often does not \"feel\" as big as it actually is.-No purchasable safe houses or any other garages beyond the single 4 car garage each player character can buy.-Not enough purchasable properties or ways to get enough money quickly without either finishing the game first or forgoing vehicle customization.-Too many missions have absolutely no rewards what-so-ever. Including some of the big main missions, so get used to being broke most the time.-No gyms, driving schools, or ways to improve certain skills like GTA San Andreas had.-No way to save custom outfits for quick use.-Aiming reticles are sometimes very hard to see.-No option to change underwater inverted controls when using subs or scuba.-Vehicle randomization could use some serious work, as it gets rather tiring seeing the same 10 cars filling up the roads all the time.-The airplane and helicopter handling is the worst I have ever seen in an open world game, they randomly twitch, buck, and steer all over the place, even with maxed flying skills.-The police are way too aggressive, overpowered, and often appear out of nowhere; a 2-star wanted level can get you killed quite often and police vehicles have freakish acceleration, handling, and ramming abilities when A.I. is driving them even if you are in the fastest car in the game.Pros:-The best graphics that can be expected on an over 7 year old console system. Lots of \"Wow\" moments when up on hills, especially at night, or underwater.-One of the most immersive GTA games so far, well... Next to GTA San Andreas.-The color pallet and weather is stunningly realistic, like in Red Dead Redemption.-3 very unique main characters along with many other memorable characters that Rockstar is famous for.-Lots of popular culture parodies and jokes.-Tons of open world sandbox things to do.-Vehicle handling is much better than GTA IV and feels like a racing game instead of floating like GTA IV's horrible handling and is less arcadey than GTA San Andreas.-Vehicle models are amazingly detailed.-Some mini-games to play like golf, tennis, and darts. Though I miss bowling, pool, and the casino games other GTAs had.-Tons of car and weapon customization.-3 different configuration settings for weapons aiming: Standard GTA lock on style, Assisted auto aiming, and complete free aim.-Lots of different clothing options for each player character.-Special abilities that come in handy with each character.-The main city and outskirts feel very \"alive\"... Including animals and wildlife.---------------------------------------Bottom Line:---------------------------------------If you are a fan of the GTA series and sandbox games like Saints Row, Just Cause, Mercenaries, Red Dead Redemption, or racing games like Midnight Club, Need for speed, Forza, and so on; GET THIS GAME!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00007B77T","description":"We could talk about theSerious Sambackstory, but that would be missing the point, namely to commit carnage on a galactic scale. The smooth engine, multiplayer options, and fast pace make this game a solid choice for fans of first-person shooters.The interface uses the tried-and-true Xbox formula for shooters: the left thumbstick controls movement and the right thumbstick controls the angle of view. The extensive arsenal is something special though, with each weapon possessing a different efficiency so you have to find the perfect weapon quickly for each situation. For instance, the shotgun is a great weapon for up-close fighting among a crowd of enemies, but it's horrible at a distance or when you're stuck in the middle of a melee. The enemy list is also quite extensive. You will be fired upon, stepped on, stabbed, slashed, and electrocuted. Enemies will appear by land, air, and water.What makes this game stand out and keep you interested, though, is its irreverent, offbeat sense of humor. Serious Sam makes outlandish comments throughout the game, rides cosmic surfboards between scenes, saves progress at Dr. Who-like telephone booths, and pays homage to the Indiana Jones theme song. And you can change the blood splatters between red, green, and hippy (flowers and fruit). Our only major complaint is level design. Even when you believe you've cleared a room, enemies can pop out of midair and injure you. By not allowing you to seal yourself off from the onrushing masses in appropriate spaces, a major strategic element has been missed.--Eric Franklin","reviewerName":"ribcage","summary":"unrelenting","reviewText":"If you thought games where you had to go 50 yards or so under heavy machine gun or sniper fire were tough, wait till you play Serious Sam. The game has you going through various Egyptian-themed levels. Some of it is going around corridors in temples and things like this, but the real fun comes in the large, open areas. You have to run across a small stretch of desert, but wave after wave after wave of enemies come at you, dozens of enemies at a time in each wave. And they don't waste time with intelligent A.I. tactics. They just swarm you, and they're vicious and bloodthirsty, just like you should be.Of course, you're always fairly well equipped to go into these situations. Afterwards, you'll most likely be limping away only to run into another similar situation, which you get out of with barely any life left. Then you'll get some health and armor powerups, possibly a save point, and continue in the same way.If you're one of those suckers who needs plot, stealth elements top of the line graphics, or shifty A.I., this isn't the game for you. There is no sneaking around, there is no determining strategy to get the upper-hand over a crafty enemy. But that's fine. It's much more satisfying to clear out a level and get a cutscene of Sam wading through bodies, his name painted in bulletholes on the wall, than it is to experience a lackluster plot twist, or a contrived stealth move, or to finally get an enemey who was running around blindfiring on you.This game is for bloodthirst, random humor, and over the top amounts of violence, and that's what shooters should be all about.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2005"}

It has an endearing personality, has elements of classic RPGs, and the combat is reminiscent of Pokemon. I really wanted to like this game. I rarely quit games, but after about 17 hours into the game, I cannot go further.I&#8217;ll begin with the obvious strength of Ni No Kuni. The overall presentation of the game is phenomenal. The menus are slick, the music is top-notch, and the writing is witty. The game does come off as childish, but I thought it added much to its own personality.However, once the smoke clears and the reality sets in, I started to realize many of the games shortcomings. First, the beginning of the game is excruciatingly boring. The beginning is riddled with cutscenes, hand-holding gameplay, basic combat, etc. It isn&#8217;t until about 6 hours in until the game begins to pick up.The game has two glaring flaws, the story and the combat. The story begins as a heartwarming tale of a son trying to save his mother. Aside from that, there isn&#8217;t much meat to the story. The characters aside from your trusty sidekick Drippy are extremely bland and one-dimensional. The combat borrows much from that of Pokemon, but lacks any of the fun strategy elements of the Pokemon games. There is a lot of just mashing the attack button during the wild battles. Many of the combat&#8217;s problems are more noticeable during boss battles. While it&#8217;s nice that not two boss battles are alike, about half of the boss battles are very difficult because the game randomly spikes the difficulty forcing you to level up your characters, which ruins much of the game&#8217;s continuity. The combat has too many menus, so you&#8217;ll find yourself getting pummeled while trying to find that one attack. Additionally, your party AI is unbelievably bad. They don&#8217;t defend. They always waste their MP immediately even after changing Tactics. This can make the battles incredibly frustrating.The game&#8217;s fun comes from sidequests. It is fun to explore and their Merit System is one of the best sidequest systems I&#8217;ve played. You can use your sidequest successes to purchase helpful aids that will help in the main storyline. While the sidequests are fun, the main story is incredibly shallow. There is a ton of handholding and a lot of unnecessary dialogue.Overall, I found its flaws too much to continue and Ni No Kuni is one of the most disappointing games I&#8217;ve played in awhile.

Visually, it is the best firt-person shooter on the PS2.  Story-wise, it's nothing to write home about.  Action-wise, it's intense and unforgettable.  Control-wise, it's pretty much a breeze.  Depth-wise, it's fairly shallow, but forgiveable.  Now, if you haven't played this game yet, and you plan to, remember this:  enemies die a lot faster if you just shoot them in the head.  I say that because, after expending 15 rounds a piece, enemies usually fall, but one good round to the head will do the trick.  If they're carrying a shotgun, several rounds to the head will be needed.  And believe me, there are no shortages of enemies what-so-ever.  In fact, at points I got a little frustrated when they kept coming because I was either almost out of ammo, or cornered like a dog.  Either way, it's still a hoot!The levels are very linear, but you won't notice until you get close to the end of the game.  Since there's only eight levels in all, it's not a very long game, but the levels are literally huge and offer a nice variety.  The Enemy AI can be a little dumb at times, but not dumb enough for you to just joy-ride along.  There's no SOCOM stealth involved or Ghost-Recon teamwork.  Just you and your arsenal blowing everything out of the way, with an occasional friendly AI thrown in (and they actually help out with decreasing the population of baddies)There are several games I've played without blinking and this is easily one of them.  The action can be so intense at times, you'll actually feel submerged in the action.  That said, drink plenty of water and spare yourself a few days to even try this game.  For replay, I think trying to beat the harder levels is a must, but soon gets frustrating when you're up against thirty bad guys in a small room where you have little or no advantage points to fire from.  The weapons are well versed for combat.  The M-249, the M-16A2, MP-5, Glock 40-mm, RPG, UZI, Spas-12 shotgun, as well as many other automatics I'm not all that familiar with.  You'll get silenced weapons for a few sneaky kills.  You'll get grenades for hard to reach baddies.  You'll be able to blow up trucks, cars, explosive crates, etc with small arms fire.  And you'll be able to create chain reaction explosions to maximize some serious damage.This game takes the cake in my book for PS2 FPS.  I can't think of another one that has better graphics or equally intense battles.  My only gripe is the overload of enemies and the amount it takes to kill them.  Since it's cheaper now, it's well worth it.  I will be playing this one on and off for a long time, but only in short increments, because this game makes my eyes bleed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2007"}

I look forward to a game that is challenging, rewarding, and unique. The challenges in Deus Ex I find very intense, i can normally beat a level in 3-4 tries, but I am having to play each save point of this game 10 or more times, which I normally wouldn't mind, but the load speed on this game takes longer than usual. However, difficulty and time are lessened if you are not afraid to complete the mission with casualties.Now the very good: You upgrade much like the upgrade system in borderlands, only not all the upgrades seem as useful (to me anyway), so I am really only forward to about 10 or so upgrades that I think will greatly enhance my experience. You carry your equipment, much like Resident Evil games, so you have limited space, but at the same time, you can arrange them (like tetris pieces) to make room for more stuff, naturally expanding your space can be enhanced also). My favorite part of this game is the hacking, but it took me a while to get used to it and after a while, you begin to wonder is it worth it, all the leveling up points I had to use for such a minimal reward, a stopped turret and maybe a few extra experience points.THe bad: Actually, the game play is lame. The guns are difficult to aim (and I am playing on a 50' screen. The hand to hand combat becomes monotonous, because when you use an attack move, you don't actually do anything; you hit B and the game picks a random video of a take down, watching it the first five times was alright, but now it is boring and the scenes are mimics of any action movie you have seen in past decade. Really, I expected a lot more from the graphics. When I started playing, the game reminded me of Perfect Dark that I used to play on my N64. It's obvious not as much time was spent on gameplay, because you walk just as fast as you crouch, the grenades fly through the air like something from an 80s arcade game and shooting a gun becomes a loathsome chore in making sure you will hit the person in front of you.My higher rating for this game came because I bought it new for 35 dollars, a pretty good deal, and I think the potential is there. Maybe when I play through the second time, I will try some different enhancements and like the game even more, but right now, I am not sure if I will finish beating it a first time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2011"}

Arragh!","reviewText":"*** UPDATE 09.05.11 ***I've dropped the rating from 5 stars to 1. I originally reviewed the game at around chapter 9 long after the bitter taste of the first boss battle had disappeared. I was indeed expecting more bosses but didn't think they would be too hard. I was wrong and the second boss battle is 100% impossible without at least the emp/electricity aug and preferably the typhoon aug. I had none of them and no praxis points to spend plus I had no armor upgrades either so I die usually within 60 seconds. I do believe it is not possible to defeat this boss through normal play without those augs. I have unloaded every single shot from the heavy gun that's found in the arena into the boss and have tried I'd say 30 times to defeat her.Since this has rendered this game unplayable and I cannot continue nor go back to find more praxis points I consider this boss to be a game breaking bug and have adjusted my rating accordingly. My only choice, since I used the auto save, is to start again from the very beginning and lose around 25 hours of careful planning and extensive play.The only way to know about the preparation and augs that you need to fight these bosses is to read about them online in advance - you do not found out about the requirements to defeat them in game, and are not warned that you are about to be locked in a room with a boss until it happens randomly. It is unreasonable to expect a player to research the needs of a game by reading walk-throughs and hints pages before play. Therefore this game gets 1 star until such a time that the boss battles are removed or are made skippable.I leave my original review below unedited.----Anyone who's a fan of the original Deus Ex on the PC please raise your hand. Now if your paw is in the proverbial vertical then you'll love DE:HR. It has many of the same qualities of its much older father; there's hacking, sneaking, augmenting (with many old favorites returning) and of course pure killing should you so desire.The game begins in quite a linear fashion and these tutorial-like levels continue for quite some time. So long in fact that I assumed this was the game - corridors and bad guys walking in patterns which when timed correctly allow you to stealthily sneak your way through to the next room. A high tech game of Frogger if you like. Thankfully once you've traversed the opening chapter the game opens into city hubs which allow for some fairly large free-roam exploration. From there you can find voluntary sub missions as well as the main mission which drives the story. Through completion of missions, exploration of the cities and interaction with NPCs you gain experience 'Praxis' points which you can spend on augmenting or rather upgrading your character. Speaking of which, the main character looks exactly like Brett off HBO's Flight of the Conchords. Kind of jarring really!How you choose to play is up to you. The game clearly encourages covert operation over brute force and that's what I prefer, trying to avoid killing anyone and only subduing them where necessary. The game also allows for NPC interaction similar to the Mass Effect series but it's thankfully not nearly as verbose. To that end I upgraded the appropriate skill sets such as cloak, hacking, dialogue and enemy detection. I personally love the see-through-walls augment which was also in the original and laughed out loud after hacking a turret from afar and watching through the walls from safety as it mowed down everyone in the next room. By using a cunning combination of timing, luck and the right upgrades you can in theory complete the game without your character directly killing anyone or even being detected. With one exception.The boss fight(s). I cannot begin to express my displeasure with the end-of-level-bosses and it's unfathomable to me why they're in this game. It's the equivalent of enjoying a classic book only to find excrement deliberately secretly smeared on every hundredth page. It's very nearly ruins the game as one minute you're playing a cerebral game requiring planning and tactics and the next you're facing a hyper aware robot lumbering towards you and mowing down your very weak un-augmented body... and this happens over and over and over and over again. And each unsuccessful attempt comes with the penalty of a lengthy reload time which is unacceptably long especially given the frankly poor graphic set, specifically the almost 90s looking character and facial models. So unless you stocked up on grenades, powerful guns and armor upgrades you will be destroyed by the first boss fight many times. All I had was a stun gun and I could see through walls. It's ridiculous that they didn't include a stealth option to just avoid the boss for those of us who have actually moved on from Doom's gameplay. Sigh.But the game is so strong in every other area that for once I'm prepared to put aside. Deus Ex Human Revolution is one of those games that you think about when you're doing something else. You want to delve back into the world and find that next quest or amass enough XP to finally get that great aug upgrade. Even as I write this review I'd rather be playing the game... ahem, in fact let me wrap up by saying despite the terrible bosses this is definitely one for your collection.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2011"}

I enjoyed BLOPS as well as Battlfield or any other game. Unfortunately, BF4 is broken as a game and I wanted a shooter for the PS4. On boot up, it was clear this was a last gen ported to next gen and nothing more. The graphics pale in comparison to the other PS4 titles I purchased, in fact it is the poorest presentation of the 4 launch titles I own by a very wide margin.The gameplay is CoD with updated perks and weapons. I will say it seemed to run exceptionally smooth with regards to lag or stutters. That alone is worth three stars. The maps are also pretty decent. The online horde/zombie/monster mash, Extinction is very much like zombie mode. My 11yr old loved it, my 17yr old thought it was lame, I fall in the middle. Nothing revolutionary at all. There are some limited &#34;missions&#34;, but it is exactly what you would expect from that mode.CoD is like a sports game at this point. A yearly release with a few tweaks and upgrades, but still the same CoD. If it's worth it to you to pick it up for that reason, you won't be dissapointed.

So when I heard Sony was doing their own take on it, I was pretty excited.  After days of playing I can say that the similarities between the two are pretty much all on the outside.  Yes, it LOOKS a lot like Smash Bros, but plays nothing like it.  The core mechanics and strategies you need to use are worlds apart.  PS All-Stars is a completely different beast all together.I've had a great time playing through each character's story and experimenting with their fighting style.  A lot of people will find comfort with Kratos because he's so powerful and easy to use.  But I'm personally using Ratchet and Spike a lot.  Multiplayer is where a lot of people will be spending most of their time and I'm happy to report it works without a hitch.  Matches load quickly and there's no lag to speak of.  Although, on rare occasions, I will be assigned to a different character then I actually picked.  Hopefully a patch will fix this.My main complaint is that the Arcade/story mode is completely narrated by still pictures with voice overs.  Except your \"rival fight\" just before the boss battle...which is over pretty quickly.  It would of been epic if each character had a live action scene.  Or if they did like Mortal Kombat and had a story where you play through as each character.  The way it is seems lazy, but the core fighting is just so much fun I'm still giving it a 5/5.PlayStation fans and fighting game fans have no excuse not to pick this up.  It's a complete blast to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00009TW6R","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Better than the XBOX version.","reviewText":"First off let me just say, I originally got Halo for the XBOX and beat it many many times.  The only reason I even ended up with Halo for the PC is because it came with my sound blaster card.I just built a new PC because I wanted to get back into PC gaming.  I have always heard that with the right components, PC games tend to be better than their console counterparts.  The same holds true for Halo, eventhough I absolutely LOVE Halo for the XBOX.After finishing up my PC.  I installed this game and was almost immediately blown away for the crisp clean graphics and fluid movements.  Also I was impressed by the quick loading times in this game.  Even on my XBOX this game had to load levels, while general XBOX loading times are not nearly as bad as PS2.  Compared to Halo for the PC, XBOX loading times are SLOW too!  In Halo for the PC, the level loads virtually immediately.  This helps keep you in the game more than its XBOX counterpart.As far as the game goes its almost EXACTLY the same as the XBOX version.  Except with better graphics, quicker loading times, more fluid motions and VERY subtle level tweaks.  The keyboard and mouse set up allows you greater control over the master cheif as well, I guess this is why the game seems a bit easier on the PC, at least for me.  Eventhough this game is exactly the same as it is on the XBOX, somehow this feels like a brand new game.  I am playing it again from start to finish.The only advantage that the XBOX has over the PC when playing this game is that my BOX is hooked up to a 53inch HDTV.  Which is almost 3 times the size of my PC monitor.  Even still bigger is not always better, because even on my tiny 17 inch monitor, the graphics on the PC version are much better than the XBOX even with the HDTV kit for the XBOX.Another difference is that Halo for the PC has built it network support for multiplayer games.  I haven't used it yet, but may try it out in the days to come.  Eventhough I must say I don't really like online play because just about everyone online cheats.All in all I am very impressed with the game on the PC.  Same game as the console, but with better graphics; no grainess whatsoever.And just in case you were wondering here are my PC specs:AMD Athlon 64 3000+MSI K8N Neo PlatinumATI Radeon 9800 Pro1GB of Corsair PC3200 Memory200 GB 7200 RPM Maxtor HDSound Blaster Audigy 2 ZSSamsung DVD+-RWSamsung CD-RW","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2005"}

The production values were exceptionally high. However, it falls short of being great. This is mostly due to the inconsistent control response.Graphics: Graphics were pretty good. Some folks complain about the the frame rate. It does suffer at times, but it doesn't hinder gameplay. Some of the scenes and \"set designs\" are nothing short of epic.Sound: Although there is little talking, the made-up language is interesting sounding. Sound effects are great, and score is A-grade movie quality. I believe this where the game shines the most.Gameplay: This is where this game misses the 5 stars. When the controls respond the way they should they are tight. However, they don't always repond consistently for the same exact moves in the same exact area.Replay: I heard so much about the replay value of this game; but honesty, it's not there. I beat the game and the ending scenes and story were very good. However, when I went to play hard mode and got to the first colussus, it was just \"old hat\" and only a little more difficult to beat than the first time around. I couldn't see playing the entire game over again.All in all, this game has been given very high ratings by critics claiming it to be one the greatest games ever made; but I just don't see it. When I think of games that are truly great, I think of Ninja Gaiden Black, GTA: San Andreas, and Metal Gear Solid: Subsistence. With all of that said, I do still recommend playing this game. It is an enjoyable and unique experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2006"}

{"product_name":"B008GFZV6Y","description":"","reviewerName":"Jack Treese \"Jack\"","summary":"Nintendo Learns What \"Anniversary Collection\" Actually Means","reviewText":"If you're like me at all, you picked up (and were disappointed by) the Mario 25th Anniversary edition--which was essentially a ROM of Super Mario All-Stars on a Wii disc.  Nothing special.  Nothing extra.  Just a disc with a previously-released game, a CD soundtrack and an art book.  many long-time Mario fans felt betrayed by how bare-bones the Mario collection was.Now this year marks 20 years since Kirby's Dream Land made its rounds across the globe on the Game Boy.  Nintendo has decided to put out another anniversary collection, only this time they focused on the adorable little cream puff named Kirby.  Did Nintendo learn anything from the Mario mess-up?The answer is a resounding, triumphant YES!  Upon loading the disc, we're given a very cute intro sequence, followed by a menu with three options:  Bonus Challenges, Classic Games, and Kirby's History.  That right there already makes the bundle worth it, because at this point we realize Nintendo isn't messing around with this collection.The Bonus Challenges section is comprised of revised and revisited bonus stages from the last Kirby Wii title, Return to Dream Land.  Here, the goal is to use Kirby's different copy abilities to complete stages with as many points as possible, earning a medal at the end depending on how well you played.In Kirby's History, which is my favorite section of the entire disc, is extremely neat.  A complete timeline from 1991 to 2012 is shown.  Each year, we see trivia bits about world events (everything from Olympic events to Harry Potter is covered) and if it applies, we also take a look at Kirby's wide variety of games on different platforms.  For each game, you can check out each game's box art (with full 360-degree viewing options) and a video of the game being played, even if it's not on the disc.Another thing worth noting here, is their inclusion of three episodes of the Kirby anime, known here in the U.S. as \"Kirby: Right Back At Ya!\"  Whether you enjoy/enjoyed the cartoon or not, these inclusions are an awesome way to show off more of Kirby's graceful history.And speaking of games that are on disc, let's take a look at the Classic games section.  Obviously, this is the section that makes up the core of this disc--six excellent Kirby titles, preserved in their original quality, and all playable with just a Wii Remote!  Even the SNES and N64 titles play just fine without the Classic or GameCube controllers, though the options are there if you'd like to use those instead.The game selection is either extremely awesome or disappointing, depending on how you look at it.  For example, I already own all six of these titles, either in cartridge or Virtual Console form.  While I originally thought this would be a waste of money as a result, the games are surprisingly more fun to play via this collection.  The games included (with my score out of five next to each one) are:Kirby's Dream Land (4/5)Kirby's Adventure (5/5)Kirby's Dream Land 2 (4/5)Kirby Super Star (5/5)Kirby's Dream Land 3 (2.5/5)Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards (4/5)If you average that out, the game selection in general is a good four out of five stars.  However, the only game out of this collection I didn't like was Dream Land 3.  While a very competent platformer in a lot of respects, it's a disappointing game in general.  Maybe I'm being grouchy and need to play it some more on the Wii remote.  Might make it easier at least.  I personally wish they threw another one on here like Kirby's Dream Course, but I forgive them because this collection's excellent!Anyways... if you're expecting anything more than a fun-filled collection of amazing Nintendo games, that's your own fault.  Even with one sub-average game in the mix, Kirby's Dream Collection is a collection worth owning.  Kudos to Nintendo for finally getting their collections right.P.S.  The soundtrack and art book are both awesome too!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2012"}

Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"Much Better Than the First","reviewText":"This game holds up its slick style from the first with great music but also adds it up with new playable characters, different sabers to use, and with everything more streamlined. You don't have the sandbox theme of running around to reach different mini-games. This game has you got straight to it on the menu with the option to go to any mini-game (when they become available), hit the gym, your hotel, or the main objective. A great thing about the game is the mini-games being in 8-bit (except one) which range from delivering pizza, cooking steaks, fixing plumbing, and such. It has the feel of the game and they are silly and creative. They are fun little games that will give you cash to get new shirts, jackets, shoes, and such.The objective of the game has the same premise but instead of wanting to be the number 1 assassin. Your out for revenge against the number 1 assassin and to do that, you have to of course go through a wide range of them. Most of the levels don't have you plow through countless enemies to the assassins. You might at some points go straight to the next assassin. There was only a few portions where you had to fight many enemies. A couple was very lengthy but a typical length for any game. The game is very great and fun. Its is short though. I beat the game under 9 hours. Remember that if you want a long game and I have to say the ending sucked. You will enjoy the assassins which are very unique and different but your paying a price for the how short it is and there really is no reason why it can't be longer. You could actually find replay value in enjoying the mini-games. The experience was fun while it lasted.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003O6HDHA","description":"","reviewerName":"Justin Scott \"DikTator33\"","summary":"Another \"Silent\" gem.","reviewText":"I can no longer resist. Looking at all of these negative reviews, I just have to defend this game. I wont go into depth on the gameplay because so many others already have taken care of that aspect. Let me just say that I am very impressed and it is a real breath of fresh air since the last several Silent Hill games have been pretty disappointing IMO. Silent Hill once again scares the crap out of me and it has been a long time coming. I would ask you not to try and compare this new installment to SH2 and SH3 because that would be unfair and not do Downpour proper justice. Downpour is different and unique on its own merits while still maintaining that classic Silent Hill \"WHAT THE F*** WAS THAT/ JUST HAPPENED!\" creepy vibe and influence. A lot of the negative reviews will tell you that they are disappointed with the monsters in Downpour. To me its never been about the monsters first in Silent Hill but rather the town and its mystique. And believe me the monsters in Downpour can still be a little on the creepy side. No other survival horror game in the genre can give me the dreaded \"sixth sense\" hair raising feeling that only Silent Hill delivers. The last few Silent Hill games havent done that but Downpour does and thats how I know that its a good game. More negative reviews are stating that the combat technique is sluggish and lacking. This is simply not the case with Downpour. When I look back on the combat mechanics of SH2, SH3, SH4:the Room and even Homecoming those games are a lot more sluggish and nonresponsive when having to fight monsters/ creatures. I can honestly remember SH4:the Room really frustrating me, especially when fighting off those ghosts that would come after you dragging their toes on the ground. Fighting in Downpour is a lot more responsive but realistic making you take careful aim with whatever weapon you are carrying at that time. If you are swinging a metal pipe around at some creepy creature racing towards you scared to death your blows are not going to be 100% accurate. Downpour plays on that aspect very well IMO. Another plus with Downpour is seeing and feeling your character, Murphy legitimately become frightened and express it. Another thing that I like is how Downpour incorporates a few of the best quality features from previous entries into the mix. Such as being able to stomp on your enemies when they are down (key element taken from SH2). Also, the areas in the purgatory netherrealm when you are being chased by the Red Void of death and can throw objects down behind you to slow the entity down (key element from SH: Shattered Memories). I will now close by saying that Downpour is very good, creepy and returns us towards its roots.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2012"}

First of all, the style of game play, the extremely slow first few hours of play, and difficulty of the game (which increases consistently as the game goes on), will automatically put off a lot of players.Then there's another category of people who won't like it-- Origins fans who won't be able accept all the changes that have been made, let alone get past the first few hours and warm up to all the great things that come later in the game.But let me back up and tell you where I'm coming from:  I've been playing Bioware RPGs since Baldur's Gate, including Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, KOTOR, Jade Empire, Temple of E.O., Mass Effect, and DA:O, so I know my stuff.  Each of those games I consider to be total genius, all in their own way.  Well, after playing for over 60 hours, running three separate characters/play-throughs, I'm telling you there is an incredible amount to love about Dragon Age II, especially for serious RPG fans, and all in all it will be on my list of favorite games of all time.Dragon Age II gets off to a VERY slow start, and there are some serious shocks to the system for DA:O fans to get used to, and there are a couple of lousy things about the level designs using repeating environments, but after playing deep into the game with two different characters, I'm ready to break it down.COMBAT:First of all, I don't think DA II is at all what it is was hyped to be, a more action-oriented game you can play in \"real time.\"  That is just not the case.Yes, there is an incredible amount of combat, and yes, there are moments of button tapping, but this is NOT a move toward a more \"joystick/button mash/combos\" style of play, a la Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone, if you remember that one.  DA II is just as tactical, if not more so, than Origins.Boom, I said it.  Read on...Since the action unfolds on screen at ruthlessly fast pace, especially in comparison to Origins, you need to be prepared for a different playing style.  Rapidly switching between characters trying to micromanage combat by manually issuing commands to each as frequently as humanly possible was the way to go in Origins.  Here in II, it is a recipe for frustration and disaster!The secret is, you will need to spend lots and lots of time setting up your tactics on the \"Tactics\" interface screens!!  This gets exponentially more important the longer the game goes on, as the battles get infinitely more complex and intense.The good news, and a HUGE improvement over Origins, is that in DAII, each character has a generous number of tactics slots.  Furthermore, the tactics system is much more detailed, allowing for real precision control over your party's behaviors.  It is actually a challenge to fully explore and exploit all the possibilities of those Tactics trees.The more thoroughly your Tactics structure has been prepared, the more satisfying your combat will be.  If you set things up right, you will have a blast seeing the characters cleverly and responsively follow those tactics to the letter.  This gives you a lot of freedom to choose how you want to control a fight.One method for controlling a fight is to really work one character for a decent chunk of time, managing their every move in a particular situation where your hands-on control will make the difference, while the others largely follow their Tactics, with just occasional intervention from you.One of best reasons to use that method is because one of the innovations in Origins is a set of abilities called \"chains\".  These are sequences of basic hits that work best when manually executed by pressing the A button in rapid succession.  One of the coolest things is that there is a \"finishing move\" that can also be executed at the end of the chain, causing massive damage-- but as far as I can tell, this literally has to be manually executed on the controller at just the right moment-- there's not a way to set this up as a Tactic.So you can see, while you are manually executing your chains and finishers, the other characters better be doing something useful, and not getting themselves killed!  This is why Tactics are so crucial.  I can't stress enough how the more time you put in to managing your Tactics screens, the better your combat will go.  You will be tweaking your Tactics after every Level Up, and potentially whenever you change up your 4-person squad.  You'll tweak them after battles to get better performance next time.  You will tweak them after you bite the big one and have to fight the same battle over again, etc., etc.,So, as you can see, both those who are looking for some intuitive action, and those looking for the same system as Origins will both be in for a serious adjustment!  Psycho anal retentive OCD freaks will likely love this game, as the micro-adjustments necessary to your Tactics, and the detailed management of the battles WILL test your patience and your wits.This is a mental game.  Don't let a few repetitious taps of the A Button fool you, this game is a serious intellectual challenge when it comes to combat.  You can probably get up to level 5 or 6 by fooling around.  But by the time the real fun begins, if you don't know what you are doing you will be lunch meat..............[[TO BE CONTINUED...I'll be adding sections about the equipment, story, dialog/character development system, leveling and abilities, etc...soon!]]","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2011"}

Back then I was thoroughly impressed with the game's combination of exploration and puzzle solving gameplay. Now the Playstation 2 brings Lara Croft back for a new adventure and the results, to say the least, are disappointing.Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness' main problem is that it doesn't give you anything new. It's all been done before. Sure there are some stealth moves that are now incorporated into the gameplay. But all of Lara's patented moves are here, but they all seem rather passe' by modern game standards. Lara jumps, flips, and climbs with her usual flair but it's nothing we haven't seen before. The controls are often so sluggish you'd think that Lara was walking in mud when she was performing alot of these moves. It feels as if the game was rushed unessecerily to meet a deadline. The game had been in fact delayed since Febuary of 2003, but it seems that all that extra time in development did not help any.The graphics are standard &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. Lara still looks like the same old Lara. Which is somewhat of a let down. When you compare Tomb Raider: AOD's graphics to other contemporary PS2 games such as Metal Gear Solid 2, Splinter Cell, SOCOM:US Navy SEALs, and even it's explorer counterpart Indiana Jones, you feel that so much more could have and SHOULD have been done to beef up the graphics of a game like this. At the very least Lara's character model should have been updated to give her a more photo-realistic look. The streets of Paris are rendered nicely but the environment overall looks rather plain and sterile. You don't get any feeling that you're going anywhere special. The action often at times suffers from MASSIVE slow down. Which really hampers gameplay. Running at a steady clip is reduced to a veritable crawl.I could go on but suffice it to say that this game is a huge letdown on so many levels. The series is now in the midst of changing hands to a new developer, Crystal Dynamics. Here's hoping that they can breathe new life in this ailing franchise.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2003"}

BioShock immerses players into a war-torn underwater utopia, where mankind has abandoned their humanity in their quest for perfection.","reviewerName":"Nishi","summary":"Crazy underwater city","reviewText":"This changes things for a First Person Shooter, a good story with RPG elements. The gameplay is fun and it's pretty cool with the mix between gun play and magic attacks (AKA Plasmids). It's actually a good length game, and with the survivor difficulty it's a fun challenge. I also love the fact you can save whenever you want, be it in the middle of a battle or just walking around, I wish more games did this.A plane crashes and you're on it, being the only survivor you go into a light house which leads to a huge underwater city. Welcome to how Bioshock starts out. The story brings you along at a nice pace, and it's actually interesting. I wanted to know what was happening, and I was surprised with the twists and turns that happened. To also enhance the setting of Rapture you can find these audio tapes that has people talking into them before and during the events that happened years before you ever stepped foot in the city.For the time this came out, the graphics are pretty cool. The incineration has a nice fire effect, and when you melt things the puddle that come ups is simple, but ads to the effect your melting ice. The city looks cool, but some buildings in the background you can tell are CG. Some guns do look outdated after seeing them in other games, but when you modify them they end up looking pretty cool.Naturally being a FPS game you run around shooting things, but you get to use plasmids to electrocute, freeze, or so many other things to enemies along the way. You can take picture s of enemies later on in the game that allows you to get damage bonuses on them, or plasmids you can't get any other way.With the Premise of Little Sisters is creepy but ingenious as a choice to have them in a game with that type or moral decision. When you kill a big daddy you have a choice of saving them and getting a small amount of experience, or taking all the Adam out of them and killing them for a huge boost to your experience.With the addition to the Survivor difficulty (which is hard but fun), you can download game rooms to play through that have trophies associated with them. I haven't played these game rooms so I can't comment on how they are, but the fact you get them for free on top of the game is pretty cool, and even if they are bad, in the end it's free.The fact this game is both fun, and has a great story, I say everyone should pick up a copy, especially since its cheap now.Length: I think this took me about 20 hours to beat on survivor difficulty, but longer working on the trophies.Trophies / Achievements: To get a platinum trophy in this game is actually pretty easy. Since you can save at anytime playing on survivor without Vita-Chambers, so its not too difficult. You can go back at anytime you want before the final battle, so you can go back and work on getting all the little sisters or the audio diaries.- Written: Augest, 2010Positives:* Fun gameplay* Nice combinations provided with the plasmids* Great story* Save anytime you want* Little Sister premise is new to a videogameNegatives:* While some graphics are good, a lot are outdated* Some minor story backtracking","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2012"}

Director is a computer program that will control how many zombies you will face and control when and where you face off against special \"boss\" zombies.

Think of the action in this game as Arcade style a pick up and play game with little introduction and story.- The four player co-op mode is main game, but there is an eight player versus mode where two teams of four take turns being the survivors and \"boss\" zombies, one team will play through the main game while other `zombie' team will try to stop them.- The player characters are Francis (a biker dude with tattoos), Louis (an African-American office worker), Bill (Vietnam veteran who is a bit elderly), and Zoey (a female college student). Since the game is four player co-op one person will be each character.- The different types of zombies called bosses that you will face besides the normal weak human zombie types are: the Hunter  an agile zombie that can jump on and pin down players from a distance, the Smoker a zombie with a long tongue that can choke out and drag away players from a distance, the Boomer a really fat zombie whose vomit can blind the player and attracts more zombies to said player, the Tank a big muscular zombie that can beat the players to death, and finally the Witch who will sit in the players path crying but when a player provokes her she will attack with claws.- There are only three gun types you can use in the game outside of the (pretty weak) pistol (note: that all players start with a pistol which has infinite ammo later you can carry two), the gun types are the Shotgun (upgrades to Combat Shotgun), the Semi-Automatic Uzi (upgrades to Combat Assault Rifle), and the Sniper Rifle (with no upgrade versions).- This game only has four levels (which are short but can take a lot longer to beat on harder difficulty settings). The levels are No Mercy which takes place in city then hospital, Death Toll which takes place in small town then countryside, Dead Air which takes place in a city then air port, and Blood Harvest which takes place on in the woods and then on a farm.GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Resident Evil 5 (Xbox 360/PS3)- Halo 3 (Xbox 360)- Dead Rising (Xbox 360/PS3)- Gears of War 2 (Xbox 360/PC)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- All the Chapter levels have a movie poster mock-up about that level starting all four of the in game player characters.- A download for this game is out give a new mode where you're timed to beat a chapter in multiplayer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2009"}

Having recently finished it, I was left with a feeling of joy mixed with relief followed by that of annoyance that was a result of, a, the fight against Vader was the same thing over and over just on different platforms and, b, that the game could've been so much more of an enjoyable title had game play elements been fine-tuned.Graphics-Good, but not great, especially considering the sheer plethora of gorgeous titles that came out like GOW and Castlevania: Lords of Shadow (two of my favorite games released last year).  The CGI cinematics were rendered beautifully (as expected), but the actual game itself looked a bit dated, something I'd consider amazing graphics in 2008 certainly.  Facial caption was impressive, especially for Starkiller who is, himself, a pretty amazing character.Music-The score is brilliant.  It's everything you could expect from an epic Star Wars film.  Perfect.Game play-This is where The Force Unleashed 2 could improve upon.  The moves were repetitive and the upgrade system was confusing at times.  The most annoying element was the camera; this presents a problem during action sequences, as it pans all on its own in the most awkward of angles.  I can't say how many times I fell off a ledge or got killed in the midst of battle because it moved around so much.  I also found it annoying when in the midst of an enemy move I would block but since the enemy was already in the throws of its automated move I could not, and Starkiller would get an extra kick in his pants.Overall, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed 2 is a pretty great game, albeit with game play problems that hurt its overall enjoyment.  It's a worthy follow-up to the semi-enjoyable The Force Unleashed, but like its predecessors suffers from game play problems.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0014UGK8G","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"A Diamond In The Rough","reviewText":"Even after watching a few reviews which mentioned that this game had an open world, completely destructible environments, and leaned more toward the tactical side of things than to the run-and-gun side, I admit that I still wasn't sold. Having spent the last few weeks unwilling to take it out of my PS3 however, I really wish I would have opted to purchase this game sooner. It does almost everything right, and the cost is beyond reasonable. You'll be able to draw a few comparisons to other open world games straight away. In many ways, this game is comparative to Grand Theft Auto...on Mars, with kickass weapons, ceaseless action, missions that are always fun, and some amazing destruction modes as well.Although the game says it is only 1 player, the destruction modes actually allow 4 players to take turns seeing who can cause the most destruction with a given weapon loadout. So if you want to sit around playing with friends for kicks, that's still an option. And the online component is a lot of fun. But the game shines best in the single player campaign. Everything quickly becomes intuitive, the game is always throwing something at you to keep you from growing tired of any one thing, auto-saves are fast and happen at all of the right times. Dying in this game lowers the morale of the rebellion, but doesn't undo everything you've done since your last save. This makes the experience vastly more enjoyable overall. All of the vehicles feel great, weapons are accurate, and the upgrade system is structured in a way that lets you focus on bettering your weapons in a way which matches your play style. Plus, you'll have to work for everything in order to get any upgrades. Surprisingly enough, even tasks like mining don't grow stale very quickly.Since you aren't penalized too much by deaths, you can certainly run and gun your way through the game, if that's what you're into. But I highly recommend taking the more tactical approach. Wiring a building with explosives prior to alerting the enemy is extremely satisfying; especially when measured against the run and gun approach. And I have to admit that, when attempting to escape large numbers of enemies after taking out a heavily important fortification, swinging a hammer at an enemy's head never gets old.Your goals are to take over each hold on Mars. This involves taking on a wide variety of tasks in each hold; steadily increasing morale of the rebellion and decreasing the power of the enemy in that territory. It's never difficult to tell who's an enemy and who's a friendly. Trophies pop pretty consistently during gameplay; a nice change of pace for those of you who get 10 or so in the first hour of most games, then see nothing new for the next 3 hours. Traversing the landscape is awesome, thanks to the decreased gravity on Mars. And, unlike most games in which cover is slowly destroyed and replaced by nothing, the enemy here will eat away at your cover but you'll almost always be able to create more out of crumbling buildings, etc.This game looks typical of many open world or third person shooters when you haven't played it. But once you've laid your hands on it, you'll quickly realize that this game should have been so much bigger than it was when initially released. I know people who haven't even heard of it. And that really is a shame. Because this is a phenomenal experience. You won't find too many long, cinematic cutscenes here and your relationships with the other characters are never fully developed. But those are the only real drawbacks I could find. With this being as cheap as it is, there's simply no reason why you shouldn't be buying it right now instead of finishing with this review. Seriously, buy this game. You'll be glad you did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2012"}

Two years after Commander Shepard repelled invading Reapers bent on the destruction of all organic life, a mysterious new enemy has emerged. On the fringes of known space, entire human colonies are vanishing. As Commander Shepard, you must assemble the galaxy's deadliest team and stop the most terrifying threat humanity has ever faced.","reviewerName":"Jeff W. Shimkus \"Movie Manji\"","summary":"Total thrill package!","reviewText":"Mass Effect 2 for the Playstation 3 has everything: Gorgeous people and aliens, Cool weapons, Vehicles to go rampaging with, a great story, visuals that will impress you, and your unique choices trigger outcomes in the next installment coming out the fourth quarter of 2011 (something I wish Final Fantasy did). It takes a great deal of time to finish, and once you've come out on the other side, having witnessed the breathtaking ending, you can start over with bonuses or continue on with the game in order to flesh out your characters to your satisfaction. In one word: incredible.Your ship takes you to the far reaches of the Milky Way, through ancient Mass Relays built by a long extinct species. Humans never learned how to produce them, but thankfully you can catch a quick ride to important spots and help save humanity along the way. While playing, I felt as though I was a small speck in a much larger galaxy, with events that were way over my head.From the beginning, you are thrown into the mix, with your ship taking a galactic beating, and with only seconds to make some choices, clouded with confusion, you must make lasting choices. I loved the gravity that every choice had. I had to contemplate some choices with weight. My curioustiy peaked at what I had missed out on by taking the high road. Playing safe may not sound very fun, but the impact of this game feels very real, and you do not want to capriciously make enemies who could otherwise be valuable team members.The voice acting is the best I've ever heard. Just about everything is explained with good acting and charm to boot. There are some big name actors like Martin Sheen, who gives an unforgetable performance. If you're a Battlestar Galactica fan, Michael Hogon has a surprise role here also. There is a codex, which is a galactic wikipedia, filled with useful information about the aliens in Mass Effect and even the codex is voiced! There are only a couple of corny moments near the end, where Shepard gives a heroic speech, that I sortof snickered at, but it was still effective, and it pumped me up still.The battle system is fluid, and instensely fun. You can train your powers to hotbuttons and fly through battles with expert skill, but you can also slow things down, which is especially helpful in hard battles that would otherwise be overwhelming. You lock time with a shoulder button and give a good look around the terrain. Enemies can fly from everywhere, and it is important to assign your team in the most useful ways.I took my time finding as many crew members as possible and then making them loyal, and along the way I just happened to play the incredible levels from my Downloadable Content. The Shadow Broker is just epic. You fight your way across the hull of a gigantic and ancient space ship, with an atmosphere tearing itself apart around you. The nebulous atmosphere had the effect of awe on me. You navigate within the ship passing along the way the internal makings of the mysterious ship which were amazing in themselves. And I couldn't help but look outside a windown at the incredible clouds and lightning along the way! It really is one of the most scenic moments in video game history in my opinion.Exploring and interacting the characters of the game is one of the most rewarding things to do in Mass Effect 2. There will be characters that you find very interesting and will want to learn all about. If you finish the Shadow Broker level ( I should say when you finish) you gain access to some private information to most of the characters in the game. There are some really funny things in there to read, like what subscriptions a character has, and also some eaves droppings on some peoples conversations.Just a side note here, Mass Effect 2 Arrival is the last chapter to be released before the next installment comes in the fall. The Reapers are coming, and you feel the universe is unraveling in anticipation. This DLC comes out March 29 2011 in the US on PSN, and will cost around 10 bucks. It is very rewarding to have these action packed additions to play after you have beaten the game.Mass Effect 2 is an astounding achievement in video game making. It pushes the limits of the powerful Playstation 3, and the effect is uncommon to all my years of playing video games. The universe of Mass Effect is so impressive that Warner Bros. will distribute a film adaptation in the near future. Mass Effect has built up a strong fan base in a relatively short time and is an icon already! Every alien race is unique, and created with a lust for details and fans everywhere are extolling the greatness of this franchise. I am most impressed that all my choices and beloved encounters will live on with Mass Effect 3, and really, it would be a real shame if it only remained as memories. There is not much of anything that is lacking, and the imagination required to make this game is commendable. A must have for any gamer out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0037LVW9M","description":"","reviewerName":"El Loro del Fuego","summary":"Isn't worthy of the Tom Clancy brand.","reviewText":"I have always been a fan of tom clancy games.  There is usually a ton of polish to each one in terms of gameplay and visuals.  GR:Advanced Warfighter is probably the best example of this with the tom clancy name for me.Unfortunately, future soldier shares none of these characteristics with other tc titles.  Right as i got into the single player campaign I could tell that a few things were off.The visuals are very mediocre.  They aren't terrible but they are noticeably bland.  I really can't believe how the visuals took this much of a step back when past tom clancy titles from forever ago look a lot better.  Now a game doesnt have to be the best looking in order for me to say its a good game.  I can still enjoy a game with basic graphics.  However, some visual hiccups are less forgivable for me than others.  Pop-in in future soldier is a pretty big problem.  There were multiple occasions within just an hour of playtime when entire buildings would appear 20-30 feet in front of my character. This is a visual flaw that I can't get used to.  It kills the experience for me.  As you can imagine, this also means draw distances take a hit as well and in a shooter that's a problem.It doesn't help that the environments are very uninteresting either.  There is hardly any detail added to these levels.  They are pretty boring to play through.  Nothing exciting to see whatsoever.  Thankfully, however, that's not the case with the actual ghosts in your team.  Your character and your teammates look pretty good.  Each one has their own unique look and they look pretty cool.  I think all of the attention went designing them.I guess i could have looked passed the visual flaws if the game was fun to play.  Unfortunately, I didn't find the action very exciting either.  The firefights are basic and just end up being more get into cover, pop out, shoot, move up, etc.  This isn't really even the problem though.  The level design is very linear most of the time offering very little in tactical decision making.  There were plenty of firefights i got myself into where I found an alleyway that looked perfect for a flanking opportunity.  As I moved into it,however, I saw a indicator in the middle of the screen telling me that I was about to leave the battlefield or something and to return immediately.There are missions that do focus on stealth as well.  These do offer up something better than the firefight focused ones but they are still flawed.  There is some satisfaction in crouching to enable your stealth camo and taking out a guard from behind with a stealth kill.  Some of the satisfaction is lost, however, when you realize the enemy AI isn't very intelligent at all.  There were multiple occasions when I would take out a guard walking around a few yards a away from a group of guards chatting to each other and they wouldn't notice.  One of them would have a perfect viewpoint of the dead body and he somehow wouldn't see it.In some missions you wont have to try very hard at all to avoid the enemy all together.  There will be paths in some levels with very low to no enemy population whatsoever.  This proves to be boring.  There were 2 missions that I remember when I didn't run into more than two enemy guards.  I just crouched to activate my stealth camo and then ran through the whole level hardly having to stop to let a guard pass by.  Not my type of fun in a game.When you do have to take out multiple targets, however, you and your teammates are up to the task.  You can tag an enemy for each of your squad to take out, give the order to fire, then watch as each of the guards die in a synchronized fashion.I can't really say much for the multiplayer.  I bought the game used and I didn't feel like shelling out 10 more dollars for the multiplayer just to find that I didnt enjoy that part of the game either.  I did play the beta for it awhile back and had a decent time with it but 10 dollars is asking a bit too much from me.I was really excited for this game.  It has the tom clancy name on it so of course I'd be interested.  For me, however, it didn't have any of the quality I've come to expect from the tom clancy name.  If you want to try it to see if you like it definitely rent it first.  At least wait for a discount.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2012"}

After the first 10 minutes of play, I realized what a big mistake I had made, and COMPLETELY regret that decision!All the bad reviews are true. There is absolutely nothing entertaining about this game whatsover. Here is my take:- Modes - There is no \"campaign\" mode; it's really just a series of bot-driven missions with no real purpose. With PSN still down there is no way to even try multiplayer.- Mechanics - The basic mechanics of an FPS are simply not there. You have to dump an entire clip to kill an enemy, and the grenades don't even kill! They are like stun grenades that don't stun but rather just knock the enemy over! What's up with that??? Did someone really think this is \"fun\"?- Customization - Sure there are plenty of options but why bother? You can't even see yourself so it's a big waste of time and effort.- XP/Leveling - In the 3 games I played, I earned 3,000+ XP and ranked amongst the top players (bots) in campaign mode. I then found that all these points really amount to very little reward. You get one or two more \"perks\" to purchase but most of what you earn are character customizations which I don't care about one bit!- SMART system? Does it even exist? Never worked for me!- Controls - Sluggish as heck, which is further highlighted by the need to traverse all the way back to the objective after you respawn at the ORIGINAL spawn point!- AI - Very bad. In the very first mission one of the first objectives is to escort a friendly AI, who apparently enjoys walking blindly into a swarm of enemies! What's the deal??Alright enough is enough. I'm selling this game today. It all but took me 10 minutes to find out I made a bad decision.

Utility interfaces are really hard to use compared to for example Far Cry or AC.A new tendency in these AAA titles: there is no interactivity: several times I put down the controller to lounge on the couch while yet another long winded cutscene is shown until some icon suddenly pops up to make me mash a button before... you guessed it: another cutscene is shown.

It is a game we played together,a series we enjoyed for years before we parted. So imagine my surprise when my six year old came home from her dads, and when given the choice to select a game at the rental store, chose this new DMC selection.I am still in love with Dante, at how much his story has grown yet stayed the same. So many video games progress to the point they become too hard to okay through the years, but I love that my six year old can play this on the easy mode without becoming too frustrated. That was always my favorite thing about this game, it was a game I could play and enjoy and beat as well. My ex thought it was too easy, too short, yet I can argue that all these years later he is obviously still playing the series. And he doesn't rent games like I do sometimes, he buys all his.I really live the cinematics in this, and the new story arch was very refreshing, like being able to play along in your favorite movie. This is visually stunning, with much more background. Dante is stuck in limbo this time, trying to fight his way out, which is a very cool concept.Highly recommended!

Johnson","summary":"Too much to pay for only 8MB","reviewText":"$21.95 for 8MB of memory??!!  This is unacceptable.  8MB equates to around 500 blocks of space for the XBOX.  500 blocks would only hold one Splinter Cell save, there are some games (KOTOR) that you can't even save because the file is too big.  Sure the XBOX has a massive hard drive, but what about those of us who want to back up our hours of game play in case the XBOX has problems and require service?  You hard drive will more than likely lose all of your data after it returns from service.  What if your hard drive just quits on you one day?If you want to back up your XBOX data in case a catastrophe occurs, you have two options 1).  Purchase anywhere from 50 - 100 of these little Memory Units at $22 a pop 2).  Purchase a bigger memory card, like MegaXKey, or Max Drive for XBOX, that hold 4 times the space for only $10 more.  On top of both of these cards also allow you to moves your XBOX saves to your PC's hard drive and even burn them to a CD.  Because of the included USB to XBOX adapter you can connect these to both your PC and XBOX; this means you can back up all of your savable game files to your PC by only having to buy one memory card.  Better yet, use of these items do not require your XBOX to be modded in anyway. After backing up all of my data to my PC, I restored them to my XBOX and had no problems with the files although the Max Drive is a little more user friendly and also can go up to 64MB!XBOX's are composed of man-made mechanical items that will eventually fail or have problems.  No one wants to lose all of their data just because they are unable to back up their stuff.  It is too bad Microsoft forces their customer to depend on the hard drive only since they do not offer a cost-effective, efficient method of back up.  To add insult to injury, they don't even offer bigger memory cards!  8MB is the largest and ONLY memory card option they have!I love my XBOX, but Microsoft really needs to get with the program here and offer bigger memory cards and also an option to back up saved game files.  If other companies can do it, why can't they?  Unless you want to carry around a pocketful of these tiny memory cards, your best option for back up is something like MegaXKey or MaxDrive.Unless you are just using the memory card for saving small game files like rosters or settings, then I don't think Microsoft's memory cards are worth the money.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2005"}

In desperation, the Soviets created a time-travel device that they've used to assassinate Albert Einstein before he is able to develop the weapon technology the Allies later use to defeat the Soviets. Upon returning, they notice a new world, and there is a world war taking place between three groups for control of the world.Play As Three Different Factions for Varied game playIn Red Alert 3, you have the choice to play as the Allies, the Soviets, or the Empire of the Rising Sun. Each faction has its own story-line and distinct units with advantages and disadvantages that you have to master in order to win. The new faction to the series is the Empire of the Rising Sun, derived from Imperial Japan, with an all-new cast of units and characters.The three factions have many differences, exemplified by their wildly different types of units. The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas. As they've done with the series, EA injects humor into the game when possible, keeping a smile on your face as you wage war.Fight on Land, in the Air, and on SeaRed Alert 3 has land units, air units, and naval units, all integral parts of the game. Unlike most strategy games that don't bother with naval warfare, Red Alert 3 makes controlling the seas an essential part of the game. Controlling resources in the seas and mounting attacks from all directions are strategies that must be employed to achieve victory.Cooperative Mode Lets You Team Up with Your FriendsRed Alert 3 has a fully co-operative campaign mode where you and a friend can play together to achieve victory. This means that you have to develop a strategy together, as well as execute it in synch in order to win. If your friends aren't online, you can also choose one of several AI commanders as your teammate.Play Against Your Friends in MultiplayerWith the different units and play mechanics of each faction, you and your friends will have a great time playing against each other, perfecting different strategies to best suit the units you have and the maps you play on. And thanks to the balanced game play, no one will have an unfair advantage.For previous fans of Command and Conquer, Red Alert 3 will provide the same light-hearted game play, but with more units, more strategies, and more fun.

{"product_name":"B001IK5TJI","reviewerName":"M. Daneker","summary":"PS3 is the best console version, PC is best overall","reviewText":"Dragon Age: Origins could nearly be considered two games, the one for the PC and the one for the Xbox / PS3. Unlike other titles such as Mass Effect, Bioshock or Halo, the computer version of Dragon Age offers a unique and different experience than the consoles. Either version is likely to be considered one of the top ten games of the year as this RPG is more accessible to the masses than titles like Oblivion or Fallout 3 but just as rewarding and challenging to the hard-core RPG player.On the PC Dragon Age can look and feel similar to Diablo or Neverwinter Knights, but the structure more Mass Effect (another Bioware title) in fact, players of Mass Effect will find that this is very much that game set in a time a 1000 years earlier. The movement for example, for fans of games such as Final Fantasy or The Witcher, it may be off-putting to not have a world to wonder freely, for this game, like Mass Effect, gives you destinations on a map which you travel to while the area is loading, but you can't simply go walking about outside of each area. But, don't let that get you down, because each area will cost you plenty of hours, and hours, and hours. This game is huge.The PC version gives you the option of a top-down view, the characters become very small and graphically it now looks like Diablo, you have hordes swarming you, you can pause, direct your four players one command at a time and then watch them carry it out. Although some crave this level of control and strategy, others of us who want to finish the 100+ hours of exploring and side quest can find it daunting. The PC does offer an \"easy\" level for those of us who do our battling in real time, but be warned, only the strong survive and easy is not so easy.PC or Console, Dragon Age will force you to talk to everyone and finish a vast amount of side quest or suffer defeat after defeat after defeat in battle. Why? Because there's no world map to go out and level-up on! You have to get levels up completing side quest and get better weapons and armor through exploration and selling-off what you find but don't want. You'll also find that you have to talk people into joining the battle or when attacks come your small team will have not-enough-help and little things like clicking on some barrels to find out there's oil in them can later translate into a knight on the battle field you tell about the oil creating a massive fire barrier the enemy has to get through to attack. That's how this game works.Dragon age also gives you 6 possible origin stories depending on who you play as and how you customize them. The origin stories give you about two hours of different locations and plots before the game congeals into the basic monster that it is. Eventually who you are and where you came from are not that important, you're a Gray Warden and that's that, but early on it does make a difference. Now, just like in The Witcher, what you say and if you can convince people of certain things drastically changes outcomes. You want to save before important conversations as you may need to try over and over until you get the outcome you want. It also changes the way your party sees you, loyalties may falter, comrades may just leave if they don't like you, since some are honest and forthright, others are thieves or murders you've recruited -- and it is possible to completely miss party members along the way and never recruit them! -- so you really need to take a middle-of-the road approach keeping everyone happy some of the time if you want them to all stay.So PC Vs Console? Well, both if you can. The PC has superior graphics. The XBOX is grainy and weak, the PS3 better but the PC is awesome -- if yours can handle it. My rig is an Asus M3N-HT-Delux Mobo with a AMD Phenom Quad Core CPU @ 2.5 GHZ per core, 8 Gig DDR3 1066 SLI Ram, 2 Nvidia GTX250 SLI cards in 16X each PCI-E Slots (yes, my mobo allows true SLI at twin 16X speeds) and I run the game at 100% graphics at 1400X900 16:10 resolution with 60fps and no drops. The graphics are full, lush and you never see them render, it gives me full distance at full quality all the time.My PS3 looks like the PC graphics set at all Medium Quality. Grass is constantly growing before me as I move, the images are sharp and a little flat, not natural and well shaded like the PC, the distance view is never any further than your feet. Considering how amazing Final Fantasy XIII looks, this is a major let-down.However, playing on a console does have its advantages. Unlike the PC version, the console has no-drop-down view so tactical pausing isn't really desirable, though you can do it. However, it compensates with auto-targeting allowing a faster, if more hack-and-slash, playing model.In Conclusion, if you are playing more for story and exploration and want battles a bit simplified and less daunting, then the PS3 version is the best, and easiest way to view on a large screen as well. However, the PC offers vastly improved graphics (for the mid to high-end PC -- see my specs above) and a top-down view that pause-and-play gamers will want. There's also the option, if you can afford it, of doing both, I'm playing a game simultaneously on PC and PS3 and the experience is varied enough that I enjoy both -- though I only paid for the PS3 add-ons.Dragon Age: Origins is a MUST HAVE for RPG gamers, this is up there with the best Final Fantasy, The Witcher, Mass Effect, and for those of us who still remember the NES games, this is like those, on steroids.Updated:Just a few comments. Both the PC and especially the PS3 have unreasonable loading times. Some areas on the PS3 stop and load at every door. On the PC, with 8 gigs of ram, 2 gigs of video ram and a quad-core processor there shouldn't be so much loading either.I also recommend turning off \"persistent gore\" as the game is just as violent, except every battle doesn't leave everyone covered in unreasonable splatter until the next battle.On the PC the camera control is annoying. You can't use the mouse for it, you have to use the keyboard. So, if like me you are used to WASD and look-with-mouse, the option is not there. The PS3 / XBox version gives you camera on right stick, movement on left but no \"top down\" tactical view -- however it's more automated and fighting can be made far simpler on the console.I've also noticed some frame drop and screen split on the PS3 and I get none of this on PC.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2009"}

There is no way not to grin while listening to some of this bombastic music.  You can't not feel a surge of sick glee as you roll over a dog, a telephone, an old granny, a car, a house, even a rainbow, and all make sounds of distress as you do so.  It's hard not to snicker as the King of All Cosmos says the most hilarious things in horribly stilted English.That said, though, it's still hard to pin down EXACTLY why this is so entertaining.  By all rights, it should get old and boring in the first two missions.  By all rights, the music should be grating and cause you to want to pierce your eardrums.

As with most (if not all) Game-of-the-Year releases, \"Arkham City\" includes everything that's been released to date.  You get extra characters to use in the bonus Riddler's Revenge challenges.  You get extra costumes to use.  They even threw in the \"Batman: Year One\" movie for good measure.The big deal for most will be the inclusion of Catwoman (there are 4 episodes plus the option to free-roam for secrets) and \"Harley Quinn's Revenge\" (takes place after the main story).  For me, however, this is both good and bad news.  You see, because this DLC is permanently loaded onto this disc, there is no way to play through the main story without the Catwoman content.  For most gamers, this doesn't seem like a problem because they loved the Catwoman episodes.  However, I personally felt that the story added very little to the experience.  Don't get me wrong, it's a ton of fun to use her various skills and her unique combat animations, but her story feels like an underdeveloped tangent.  The fact that it's not optional once installed isn't cool for me.  Thankfully, \"Harley Quinn's Revenge\" doesn't have this problem.If you can get over the non-optional Catwoman story (or flatout disagree with my opinion), then by all means, get this Game-of-the-Year disc if you haven't already.

{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","summary":"Another Fine Game from the Golden Age of Square","reviewText":"I believe that Final Fantasy X is the last game from Square that is really, awesomely good.  It was all downhill after they joined Enix, in my opinion (I hope Final Fantasy XIII redeems them).  Even FF12 was only average, to me.  Anyway, this game is fantastic.  Why?  Well, let's find out!Graphics (score 10/10): The graphics are really excellent for the PS2.  I believe this game boasts the second-best graphics on the PS2, next to Final Fantasy XII.  Although FFXII has the technically better graphics, FFX has much more creative and unique environments, so it's more graphically impressive to me.  I guess it's kind of the difference between staring at a shimmering forest made out of crystalline trees and filled with iridescent swirls of light versus a big field filled with...grass...and just grass.  So, FFX makes very good use of the graphical capabilities that it does have.Music (score 10/10): Excellent, just excellent.  The music is really quite beautiful, with my favorite song being \"To Zanarkand\".  I even went and bought the soundtrack.  And yes, I even like the song \"Otherworld\", which I've heard some people hated.  Now, as for the voice acting...  I thought it was great.  Why do so many people hate on the voice acting for this game?  I really can't figure it out.  Other than the scene where Tidus and Yuna engage in fake laughter (it's cringe-worthy, trust me, but at least it doesn't last very long), the voice acting is top notch.  I really found no faults with it.  If you want to hear truly awful voice acting, listen to some scenes from the first Grandia game (on a side note, I got slaughtered with unhelpful votes for my review on that game; go figure).Characters (score 10/10):  Characterizations are excellent; everyone has a distinct personality and is well-portrayed.  I know that everyone likes to complain about Tidus being a \"crybaby\" and whatnot, but I don't really think that's the case.  To me, he's a realistic protagonist.  With Final Fantasy 7 and 8, you had protagonists who were already used to battle, and who already had military training.  It makes sense that they were used to dealing with stress (whether they actually handled that stress well is arguable, though, but that just makes them that much more interesting as protagonists).  Tidus is just an average guy who is suddenly thrown into extraordinary events.  In this light, I think his reactions (and subsequent narrations) are very realistic and appropriate for his character.  I mean, he was living the good life before (he was a star athlete and living well, for the most part); why wouldn't he be unhappy about getting thrown into a world, which, through his eyes, must've seemed very inferior to what he just came from?!  In fact, if he had immediately adopted a hung-ho, \"this is so much fun\" attitude, I would have found it very questionable.  That being said, if he had been excessively whiney, it would've been annoying, but I don't really think that he is.  As for the other characters, they all have subtle nuanced personalities, with the standout character being Yuna.  So much of the story has to do with her, and she is extremely well developed.  I love the fact that this game actually gives us a female character who is quiet, mature, and actually wears clothing that covers her breasts.  Seriously, I get so sick of game developers thinking that all female characters must show cleavage, so it's awesome that Yuna actually has a real personality and isn't just eye candy.  Not that eye candy is always bad or anything, it's just that I like to have some variety.  I really love Yuna though because she is such a strong character without being a stereotypical gun-toting bad-ass female.  She simply has a strong will and is dedicated to her morals and beliefs without being closed-minded.  To me, she embodies what a \"strong female character\" should be rather than what Hollywood thinks that term means (ex. Large busted, cleavage exposing woman who wields guns).  Once again, I have nothing against seeing that kind of portrayal once in a while, but there needs to be other kinds of heroines too.  Too bad they ruin the good thing that they have going here in X-2, the sequel (see my review of that if you want to see how they screw over these fine characters).  Whew, enough of my soap box.  Overall, I think the characters are excellent, and yes, I even loved Tidus.Story (score 10/10):  This game's story is just awesome.  It's one of the best RPG stories ever told, in my opinion.  At its core, it's about a group of people coming to question the things that they have always believed in.  I really enjoyed the themes of questioning traditional power structures and religious doctrine that is in place in the world of Spira, as well as themes of sacrifice, death, and hope.  I don't know if the developers intended this, but you could almost interpret this story to be critique of real-world religions.  The game even deals with the idea of prejudice in it's portrayal of the Al-Bhed.  On top of these fine thematic elements, the plot keeps you engaged with various twists, culminating with the biggest twist of all at the end of the game.  I'm not going to spoil that just in case you haven't played this game, but suffice it to say, it was so emotionally gripping that I actually cried at the end.  Well, the story is awesome.  What more can I say?Battle System (score 10/10): The battle system is pretty unique compared to previous Final Fantasy games.  Of course, I'm not talking about the turn-based fights; they're pretty similar.  I'm talking about the ability to switch party members in the middle of battle.  In previous FFs, you pretty much picked a party of three people and stuck to them, never using any other characters.  In FFX, they actively discourage this by making each party member have very specific strengths and weaknesses, and having a variety of enemies that require everyone's skills.  The fact that you need to switch people mid-battle to accommodate for different enemy types means that you really need to use everyone equally.  This is a nice change of pace from the older games, although I still like doing it the old way equally well too.Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Let's see...FFX is very well paced in difficulty level, the controls and camera angle are good, and there's a wealth of interesting sidequests to take part in.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.  My only small complaint would be that I wish there was a way to skip cut scenes.  It's annoying to have to sit through a long cut scene again when you have to re-do a boss battle.  Other than that, no complaints at all.Overall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  FFX is a fine and excellent game.  In my opinion, FFX is one of the best RPGs out there, and definitely should be added your collection if you're an RPG fan.  And for its (currently) cheap price, you can't afford to pass this one up!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"SleepyJD","summary":"Best Final Fantasy Ever?","reviewText":"No, but close.  Final Fantasy X introduces a multitude of new features, a new storyline, (obviously) and takes full advantage of the PS2's powers.  The only thing that disapoints me is the ending, and some of the annoying voiceovers.  Fans of Final Fantasy should not hesitate to buy it, while casual gamers should rent it and take it for a spin.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2003"}

But it doesn't compare to FORZA 3.  One thing I don't like about this game is how inacurate the difficulty is. When one plays in the easiest difficulty possible, the computer-controlled cars seem to be in hard difficulty. Also, I didn't like the fact that one has to get 100% completion in all regions (North America, Europe, Asia) in order to unlock all cars. I 100% North America and it took me a long time but there's no way I'm going for the other regions. Way to ruin the game!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2013"}

It is not only better than any console game I have ever seen, it is better than any arcade game I have ever seen. The sound effects rivals that of THX movies. It is clear the creators have spent a lot of time refining the details of this game.The action can be intense. It simulates the modern assymetric moderm warfare where one's enemy can attack from all sides and without warning. In almost all cases, the main character is attacked from more than one vantage point, so teamwork is more essential than in the previous versions.Also, you will end up killing a lot of German Shepards (they are more deadlier than the gun holding enemy!), which I am sure has promopted lot of emails to Activision.Two most enjoyable sequences are the camouflage scene and the last jeep chasing scene. The camouflage scenes allows the main character to infiltrate the enemy as a sniper where avoiding detection is as crucial as marksmanship. The Jeep chasing scene unfolds like a car chase scene in an action film, except you get to be the main character. It is very impressive.The length of the game is short, but it only leaves a lot wanting because the game is so enjoyable.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2007"}

Webb \"Trajedi\"","summary":"An addictive challenging masterpiece","reviewText":"Call of Duty 4 is going to leave alot of shellshocked gamers(I can hear the grenades tinking around me still).  It delivers a flawless Single Player FPS campaign experience throughout.  The enemies are ferocious if a little predictable in where they pop up.  The challenge really comes in when you notch the difficulty up and take off aim assist, as you have to spot them on your own without the minor lock on the game offers.  An experience that is both numbing and actually strongly anti war and nukes COD4 feels like a very real visceral military amusement park ride that offers a great variety of scenarios and environments.  Not that the content is taken lightly for the most part there is a strong sense of the absolute madness of war that exceeds that of past WWII COD titles.  Straightforward menus a robust online multiplayer experience and an arcade mode that allows you to shoot for the whole campaign or best your scores one level at a time, and a few unlockable cheats will keep you coming back as the main game is worth playing through on Regular and Hardened mode repeatedly.  Strongly produced and envisioned this is bang for gaming dollar in every sense of the word, just stay low and use your grenades as this is one of the deadliest firefights in VG history so far.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2007"}
