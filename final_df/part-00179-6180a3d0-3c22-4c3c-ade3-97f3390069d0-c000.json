{"product_name":"B000TVT8PI","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"Great system...but beware!","reviewText":"This system is incredible.  By now you either love it or hate it, so I won't go into details.  But here's a word of warning on the 80 GB model.  The backwards compatibility is very much reduced from the 60 GB model.  This is because the 80 GB lacks the hardware that previous models use to play PS1 and PS2 games (Emotion Engine).  Now, games from old systems run on emulation software.  While this works with some titles, others don't work right at all.  Sony promises to release patches with future system updates, but they've also said their priority will be with developing PS3 games and not spending time and energy on PS1 and 2.So if backwards compatibility is a big selling point for you, get the 60 GB model instead (while they're still around...remember they've been discontinued).  Also noteworthy is that hard drives on the 60 GB model are fully upgradable with any HDD drive on the market.Let me restate this, however.  The PlayStation 3 really IS the greatest console of this generation.  It's power and capabilities are just downright colossal.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2007"}

If you're a fan of God of War and God of War clones, don't bother listening to my review. If you're apathetic or ambivalent, then listen, I suppose.I'm no expert of this game style at all, having only played a few levels of God of War II and Conan (another GOW clone) and I can say this one was in absolutely no way remarkable in terms of gameplay. It's the exact same thing---run around rapidly, completely defy physics, and use a messy mix of magic and swords and such, button-mash X or Y to kill everything in your path, button-mash things in concert to do combos and the like.Rather than compare it to God of War, which would take up pages and pages, I'll point out where it's different.There's a woman as the lead character. She walks around on a very odd angle where her back is slightly arched, giving her butt lots of perk.  This serves only the purpose of fanservice.  Sure, some sexitude in games is fun, but when it's quite literally thrust at us like it's the main selling point of the game, then it's really easy to hate the game trying to substitute PG-13 porn for actual quality.What makes this game unplayable for me is the visuals. It's always a good idea to be creative with visuals, adding as many stylish flairs and colors as is tastefully possible. This goes way overboard in terms of visuals, to a point where there's so many colors, lights, and random stuff flying off the girl as she strikes enemies, that I cannot see the enemies. It's not a case of me being a befuddled old twit who can't handle colors or lights beyond the red, green, pink, and yellow of Pac-Man, this is a true catastrophic mess of flair. It's like that jerkbag in Office Space who wears a bunch of flair on his outfit. It's like an outfit made of flair.It's just too much. But honestly, it wouldn't even make a difference---just buttonmash and they'll go away eventually.One good thing I can and should say, though---the enemies die with great style, where flesh falls off from bone the more you hack at them, until they fully die.But hey---if you like the style, and you've never played God of War, definitely try it out!Or just wait forGod of War III! Good God, the timing could not be worse.Rather than whine about these other games, let me list off some other God of War clones upcoming:Dante's InfernoLord of the Rings: ConquestDarksiders","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2010"}

All I can say about the game is believe all the hype.  The Last of Us is deserving of all the praise and 5-star reviews that are being handed out.  While I could nitpick a few things about the game that bothered me, none of them are major enough for me to fuss about.  The graphics, art/level design, characters, game play, etc are all just downright beautiful and amazing (the \"giraffe scene\" is one that instantly comes to mind).  Would I call this game of the year?  Well it would definitely be in the running next to Bioshock Infinite, but I can't give a definite answer yet since two major titles (GTA V and Beyond: Two Souls) don't arrive until this fall, but I would probably put in first place for now (or at the very least tied with Bioshock).Again though, if you want to hear more about this breathtaking game, please read many of the other 5 star reviews.  I'm really just writing this to say how pleased I was with the \"Survival Edition\".  I don't normally go for \"special edition\" versions of games, for I never really care about DLC and add-ons, especially when they contain pretty useless stuff such as statues that I'm never going to do anything with, or \"themes\" and \"avatars\", but I will give credit to Naughty Dog for at least including the soundtrack here, even if it's just playable through the PS3 menu system (would have much preferred an MP3 download emailed to me - oh well).  The real value here is the hardcover art book (which will retail for about $30 on its own once it's released).  It's a beautiful well put together book, with plenty of large full color illustrations of concept art, level design, characters, enemies, and marketing posters etc.  I'm a huge fan of art books as it is, and for only $20 extra, I felt this was well worth the extra cost, and it looks great next to my other lovely video game art books.If I had waited and bought the book separately, I would have ended up paying at least $90 total, but for 10 dollars less, I got the two items I wanted most (the game and book) plus the soundtrack and the extra comic book, so I say this is one of the best valued \"special editions\" (err, \"survival editions\") of a game I've ever ran across.  I hope more companies make special editions like this.  Thank you Naughty Dog for a wonderful package and one of the best games of this entire console generation, it was well worth the wait.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2013"}

And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"Grace G","summary":"Mario Kart 64","reviewText":"Classic racing game.

{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"Video Game History \"Gamer 4 life\"","summary":"TOO DAMN HARD!","reviewText":"I love this game, but it's way too hard.

I enjoyed the singleplayer, but became addicted to online play. When BC2 came out, I played the demo constantly and got the game a few weeks after it launched.I like the interchangable weapons kits and the enhancements each kit can get. The graphics and game play are outstanding and more realistic. After playing single player, I went online and was dissappointed because I was getting destroyed at every turn. I went back & forth to BC1 & BC2 online so I could actually win some times. After about a week, I became familiar with BC2's online maps and increased in skill. I tend to like Rush over Capture, which was the opposite in BC1, but I'm sure this will change.One of the few things I like better in BC1 is the guided aerial attack vs. unguided in BC2. I like the knife use better in BC2, along with scenery and kit options. Different squad members also have access to some of the same weapons. Overall, I would say this is a must for most BC1 fans.

Now, Atlus has unleashed this director's cut of sorts of the game, entitled Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES.  The game is broken up into two separate parts, entitled The Journey and The Answer.  The Journey is pretty much the original game with many noticable tweaks, enhancements, and new features; while The Answer takes place after the events of the original title.  The game retains the look of the original, and it still looks good; while the dialogue, story, and characters are memorable as ever as well.  Even if you have played through the original title, FES warrants your attention because of the ton of new content, and The Answer mode offers up more replayability.  Not to mention that given the bargain price tag, this game is basically a steal, even if you already own and have played through the original.  Let it be known though that the game does offer quite a bit of challenge amongst all the variety offered.  Casual gamers or those who don't spend much time with RPG's are not going to get the most out of the game, where as more devoted RPG'ers or fans of the series will find much to love here.

Get your game on and play in freedom with this comfortable wireless controller.","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"One silly flaw in an otherwise great controller","reviewText":"This package is an XBox 360 controller with a wireless USB adapter that transmits a signal so you can play wirelessly.  In other words, while it comes with an XBox 360 controller, you can also use any other XBox 360 controller as well.  Using the simple setup poster and included software CD, you install the software, connect the USB adapter, and you're ready to play.The good news is, the adapter for this Wireless Controller will not only let you connect up to FOUR XBox 360 controllers at the same time, it will also let you connect other devices, such as XBox wireless headsets.The bad news is, there is one fundamental flaw that seems to have been completely ignored by the people who developed the software to support the XBox 360 Wireless Controller for Windows:You can't easily turn it off.On an XBox, you press and hold the controller's center button.  The software launches a menu and one option you can choose is \"Turn off Controller.\"  The documentation and the software's help files say nothing about turning off the controller.  Digging through forums uncovers that you can either set the controller down for 20 minutes and wait for it to turn itself off, or most people disconnect the battery pack every time they want to turn it off (which will eventually loosen it).  The center button does nothing if you're not in a game (and if you are, it doesn't give you a \"turn off controller\" option).  You can't \"eject\" the controller in Windows, and if you disconnect the USB adapter or turn off your PC while the controller is still on, the controller will  continue to look for a connection until the battery runs down.There is one sure-fire way that works:  you have to be playing a Games for Windows Live game, logged into your Games for Windows Live account, and when you're ready to quit, press and hold the center button for 4 seconds.  You will get a menu that will ask, \"Do you want to turn off the wireless controller?\"  Choose Yes, and you can continue exiting the game using the keyboard and mouse.UPDATE:  Amazon customer \"Kitten\" posts in the comments below that there is a system tray utility that will allow you to turn off the controller if you forget to do the steps above.  I haven't tested it yet but when I do I will come back here and update my review accordingly--her link is in the comments.That said, there is a reason I bought this controller, and that reason is that I really have come to enjoy the XBox 360 Controller.  I've also had some very annoying compatibility failures over the years with PCs and \"game pad\" controllers.  The XBox 360 controller--wired or wireless--has been the best.  It's literally plug and play and thus far I haven't had any button problems, or had the sticks fall out of calibration like some other controllers do.If you love PC gaming, but you need to use a console-style controller for some of your games, this is your best bet.  You can go with a wired controller and save yourself the power-down headaches, but if you really want wireless in Windows, the XBox 360 Wireless Controller for Windows is the best.  Maybe one day they'll finish the software--I strongly suggest they put a tray icon in with a menu to manually handle this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003DNH95K","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris H","summary":"Playing solo: Xbox 360","reviewText":"I've only played solo and using the Xbox 360. I've played Baldur's Gate DA 1 & 2, Champions of Norrath, Drakan, Dragon Age, Fable and so on... so this is my kind of genre.First the combat system for this kind of game is the best I've seen. It's fast, tight and exciting. I really hope future developers will follow through with this kind of system, cause the same ol swing your sword back n forth until he goes down gets boring. Not that it is much different except the added feature of critical hits and Hero mode. When you take down an enemy without getting touched you go into Hero mode. In Hero mode enemies cannot block you and every time you strike him will multiply the amount of XP gain before the critical hit. Many times it's better to use a weaker weapon for more XP gain. The animation of a critcal hit rocks. It's graphically brutal.The levels are very well done. Especailly Barrow-downs. Creepy and surreal. In normal mode this is a challenging game. If you don't reenter levels and grind it's (at least for me) a test of survival. Easy to get surrounding by many enemies. Hate to say this but pay no attention to pro reviewers saying the combat and enemies gets repetitive after awhile. If that's true in comparison with my experience the same can be said with just about every game out there, especially in an action RPG.Those who say think Baldur's Gate DA, well that's true except the camera angle is different (think Dragon Age) with a solid go-anywhere camera system. Unfortunately you can't jump either.Now the bad parts..This game relies on an auto-save system. The only way to save your game is when you see a spinning circle as you progress. Problem with this is it overwrites the previous automatically. Not bad. Fable 2 did the same thing. Except when you encounter a game breaking glitch. Then you're in trouble.I have never encountered a game breaking bug. I have played all 3 characters on all 3 levels. Maybe it's because I've played solo on the Xbox. I don't know, but I've read so many other players having big glitch problems. Mostly in Mirkwood, Urgost Lair and Carn Dum. Now I did have the game freeze on me once after probably 60 hours (many playthroughs different characters). Also in Heroic mode the critical hits stopped working. I ended game and found another save file to start again. Not bad but not cool either.Other than that no problems... but so many others had game ending issues I would say be carefull. Especially because of this auto-save system. The Xbox 360 has the ability to file multiple saves. I don't know about the PC or PS3. Playing solo on the Xbox I've been through this game back and forth, with little or no incident, and had a blast.I can't diss this game because of game breaking issues, simply because I've never experienced them. Because of that this game rocks. Big time!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2012"}

Then, my friend got it and kept saying \"you have to get this\" over and over. Finally, I downloaded the demo and based on that, decided I should play it all the way through.Now, I was really immersed into everything about the game - the world, the driving, the action, the METAL! Then at about the midway point, I was surprised to see a battle sequence ala DoW & Starcraft. I really am not a fan of RTS games, so these parts were a struggle to get through. Unfortunately, the 2 hardest and most annoying ones of these are back to back and at the end of the game. The plus side is, once you finish them, you get to hack and slash your way to killing the main bad guy and it doesn't end there. There's still a lot to explore and do on your map. Those that keep saying the game is too short probably haven't done much of the side missions, if at all. For me, those were some of the most fun in the game. Shoot and kill game, race your hot rod, ambush a bunch of bad dudes and even shoot at them from your car mounted on a rack.If you can stomach the RTS, then you might give this game 5 stars but for me, I wish the game had little to none of it.

Instead of always regenerating whenever you aren't being attacked...you do, but you have an overall health too where if you don't get health packs, you will die.

Whereas the REmake is probably my favorite so far, Code Veronica I could classify as my least favorite out of the main canon games. It's not that it's a bad game overall since it's RE as we all know it and love it and it's more progressive in its story than 3 was but at the same time, it just wasn't as fun to play as the others.Story: 3 months after the Raccoon City incident (depicted in RE2 and 3), Claire Redfield is captured after an unsuccessful raid at an Umbrella Headquarters in Paris and imprisoned at an Umbrella-owned island named Rockford Island. Teaming up with a fellow prisoner, Steve Burnside, Claire finds out the background behind one of the Umbrella founders and their family as well as the plot set by an old acquaintance.Graphics: I think it's very easy to say that Code Veronica is probably the blandest of all the games as far as graphics go. At least the Playstation games looked at least a bit colorful and while it did look polygon-deficient at times and other things were awkward, CV at times looks more impressive with bigger camera moves during gameplay, improved character designs and animation and 3D background uses as opposed to pre-rendered ones. However, the color scheme, with its dull grey-blue combo, just looks bland and the games doesn't have as vibrant a color palette as any of the games.Sound/Music: Whereas the series always had bad voice acting, Code Veronica doesn't stray from this with actors for Steve and Alfred just sounding awful and while Claire's voice fits her character, others have either unemotional or just awkward readings. The music as well is not that memorable and while some music is exciting and gets you going, it leaves your brain rather quickly and even the always dependable Save Room music doesn't really hit me.Gameplay: CV is the first RE I've played in awhile that doesn't bear resemblance to recent ones like Zero or REmake. Meaning that there's a noticeable difference in a few things such as zombies who die or get shot, the weird nonsensical puzzles (granted, they always had them but these at times felt vague) and a greater emphasis is placed on ammo consumption since you can easily find yourself sans bullet should you shoot everything. But CV, while a good story, just doesn't have the best presentation and the opening Rockfort Island section just didn't excite me like the mansion or the police station did.As far as the difficulty is concerned, the game is a little bit unforgiving at times since there's plenty of zombies who can take their fair share of bullets and when they can respawn after awhile, it gets trying to duck around them when there's not enough space to (not to mention their rather long reach). Puzzles as well can be difficult to figure out and it's hard to tell how to solve a puzzle since the second half is meant to solve the puzzle while you're looking all over trying to figure it out and plus, who builds stuff like this anyway?The story is interesting and it's always good to see the Redfields have their own game but Code Veronica is a game that needs a REmake-style overhaul since the game itself is just good enough to warrant a playthrough.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2007"}

{"product_name":"B002I0HAC6","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"Unfairly panned; Duke Nukem Forever is a fun and unpolished blast from the past","reviewText":"Duke Nukem Forever is a game that was first revealed in 1997. Later thought to be released in 1999, that never quite happened. It's become the joke of the industry. 3D Realms remade the game multiple times on different engines, delayed it over and over again, then it looked like it was finally going to be released around 2008, but 3D Realms went belly up. Looking like it'd never see the light of day, Duke Nukem Forever fell 6 feet below into its own burial spot, but then came Gearbox to save the day. Gearbox decided not only to bring Duke Nukem Forever to gamers, they also decided to buy the rights to the intellectual property. However, was this a wise move? Read on to find out.Positives:- It's Duke - Yes, I know, many people won't find Duke's brand of absurdity very entertaining in the current world we now live in, but I still find his crass and raunchy attitude to be very likable. I've noticed a politically correct movement in gaming today. I've noticed politically correct movements infiltrating every kind of entertainment and deeming something they dislike as \"offensive.\" Now, I'm not here to judge morality and what may offend others, but at the same time I know where to draw the line, as it's quite obvious that Duke is meant to be a parody of sorts. He's not meant to offend any group of people, but to offer the same brand of absurdity that he always has, and Duke Nukem Forever delivers on this front. Say what you will, I enjoy Duke. If that makes me immature, politically incorrect, etc., then so be it. Come get some.- Variety - Variety is the name of the game in Duke Nukem Forever. While it may let some people down who were expecting non-stop shooting, it'll satisfy those looking for a varied experience. I really enjoyed playing as miniature Duke. Getting in the RC car and racing around is a blast.- Story - Stupid, silly, fun; Duke Nukem Forever offers a story that doesn't take itself seriously. You're saving women from pigs and aliens. What's not to like? Duke Nukem Forever won't offer you a sophisticated plot like in a Bioshock, it'll offer you more Duke Nukem, more babes, more alien scum, etc.- It's Fun - Plain and simple, Duke Nukem Forever is just fun. It's a game that stays true to its roots. While the level design is more linear and restricted in comparison to Duke Nukem 3D, it's also a nice blend of action, puzzles, vehicle segments, turret segments, etc. This game isn't revolutionizing a single thing. What you see is what you get.Negatives:- It Took 14 Years? - Let's be honest, while it's fun and all that, Duke Nukem Forever reeks of misguided development.- Unpolished - Duke Nukem suffers from so many technical hiccups, i.e. super long load times, texture pop-in, unstable framerate, etc.Duke Nukem Forever isn't for everyone, but it is fun, and in the end that's what matters the most to me. Was it worth 14 years of hype? Nope, not one bit. But this one definitely isn't out of bubblegum. Don't listen to every naysayer, but don't blindly spend $60 either. It's not a 5 star game, it's not a 1 star game. Give Duke Nukem Forever a rent and see if it's your cup of tea.3.5/5Happy gaming!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2011"}

But for some, this is where they end up.","reviewerName":"coopertex","summary":"Battlefield & Chaos","reviewText":"Battlefield Bad Company is a FPS for the XBOX 360, This is an open world combat game similar to Medal of Honor Airborne and Frontlines Fuels of War. But most people feel that it must be compared to Call Of Duty 4, which of course is the best FPS on the 360.Playing the single player campaign in Bad Company has you fighting alongside a squad of three AI (artifical intelligence). Unfortunately, your AI sqaudmates are practically brain dead! They will stand out in the open and not shoot back at the enemies. The enemy AI are shooting hailstorms of bullets at you but seldomly attack the AI squadmates on your team. This shoddy programming takes away from the realism and makes the game feel cheesy and low budget.Since your sqaudmates are useless, that you will have to take it upon yourself to get into the combat and mission objectives. Many of the missions have intense firefights and are pretty straight foreward. The maps are very massive and open for the most part. This open world combat lets you devise your own plan of attack which is an excellent experience in itself. There are plenty of weapon pickups and checkpoints which automatically save your progress. If you get killed, you just respawn from the last checkpoint you passed.The levels use streaming technology which means no loading times when going from one part of the map to the next. The levels also are persistant which means that whatever destruction you caused or enemies you killed; they remain the same and DO NOT reset after you get killed. The best thing about Bad Company is the destructiblility. Trees, containers, vehicles, and walls can be destroyed. The graphics and sound effects do a good job of conveying the chaos from this destruction.There are two game mode type for multiplayer online. The mode called, \"Gold Rush\"  allows up to (12) players on each team. The defending team protects the gold crates, while the attacking team tries to destroy them by either planting a charge on the crates or simply shooting at them till they blow up. Gold Rush, is so much fun that it should be renamed to \"Head Rush\".Recently the game's developer, made Conquest mode available as a free download. Conquest plays like a cross between capture the flag and territories. It uses four pre-existing maps that have been modified to fit its style of gameplay. It is a nice addition to the overall package.Here's a small taste of what you should expect to see during the matches:Mortars shower from above, attack choppers dominate from the air, battle tanks destroy by ground, artillary strikes are awesome, air strikes have lethal precision. All the while lots of small skirmishes are taking place-Specialists running around with their silenced smg, Demolitionist blasting with their shotguns, Snipers killing from afar, Support providing suppressive fire and Assualt soldiers aggressively attacking everyone.Despite some of its flaws, the chaotic battles, destructive environments, and amazing sound effects make Battlefield Bad Company an enjoyable experience for FPS fans. It is not a perfect game by any means and it probably won't topple COD4, but Bad Company certainly is one of the best open world combat games available for the XBOX 360.Pros:+open world combat+destructible environments+massive levels+excellent map designs+ragdoll physics+jaw dropping sound effects+excellent controls+excellent vehicles+balanced weapons+intense firefights+conquest mode added recentlyCons:-brain dead AI in single player mode-It does not win over COD4","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2008"}

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements.

However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are Vital Suits that transform into other vehicles, and even some that hold up to three players and take multiple players to operate. Also, the grappling hooks that made the gameplay inLost Planeta true 3D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by quickly scaling buildings.Key Features4-player Co-op Action- Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4-player cooperative play.

{"product_name":"B000088KH3","reviewerName":"Anthony J Sasso","summary":"Show me the exit","reviewText":"I am very pleased that I rented this game instead of buying it. I'm not too big of a Matrix fan. I thought the first movie was great and I thought the sequel to be kind of a flop. The game Enter The Matrix, in my opinion, follows the second movie down the same dissatisfying path. To be fair, the graphics are great and the kung-fu\\gravity bending gameplay is unprecedented and fun to watch. The action moves you can perform play like some of the fight sequences in the films. Unfortunately, the action combos and the wall walking gets old really fast. After about an hour of doing the same martial arts combos and jumping over bullets I began to grow bored with the gameplay. I found myself doing the same thing over and over: Follow the trails, shoot the same guards, do the same moves. There is no variety in this game. You fight and easily kill dozens upon dozens of generic swat cops and security guards.  You easily get an auto-lock on your target, jump through the air and shoot them.... OVER AND OVER AND OVER, LEVEL TO LEVEL TO LEVEL. Gameplay is much too linear, and the lack of any sort of rush coupled with the same recycled orchestral music playing in an endless loop left me wanting more. The game didn't convey any real 'get up and go.' Just the same bad guys for you to kill in different rooms. In summary:Pros: Great graphics, great gun and explosion sounds, exceptional gameplay as far as manipulating the environment(wall walking, bullet dodging etc..), Agents are intimidating and fun to fight, clever interposing between gaming and movie clips gives you a better understanding of The Matrix.Cons: Poor lighting and shadows, TOTAL lack of variety from level to level, recycled enemies and recycled musical score resulting in monotonous levels of easy shoot-em-up gaming, Unchallenging combat interface: Enemies are weak and predicatble, lacking any sort of surprise tactics or skills equal to your own.If you're a fan of The Matrix and are just dying to get any sort of Matrix fix before the next film, then you will probably make this game work for you. If you're a first person shooter fan looking for anything to bridge the gap from now until Halo 2, maybe this title will keep you interested for a night or two. - It's no miracle in action gameplay. Allow the river of hype this game has generated to float to the wayside with the rest of the garbage. Worth the rent, not the buy.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2003"}

The graphics are top notched and the gameplay though overdone is okay. Yet the game is amazingly short. It seems shorter than the first Fable which I thought was too short. There is no climatic showdown with the main antagonist, you end up knocking him over without much effort and then you get 3 uninspired wishes based on one dinmensional morality choices. Oh and you get to start families in all the villages and have your little brats run around begging you for gifts left and right. Big Deal. X-Play gave this game the title for Game of the Year. They were being exceptionally generous or paid off. I suspect the latter. The expansion pack for the game Knothole Island will be coming out soon. It's sorely needed to add some depth into this game. I was hoping that Fable 2 after hearing all the hype from Lionhead Studios that it would be an epic experience on level with Elder Scolls: Oblivion or surpass it. It did neither. It has so far been a bright flash in the pan. After the novelty of the dog wore off and the continuous \"rescue slaves\" mission got dull, I popped in Elder Scolls: Oblivion once again though I've beaten the game numerous times, I needed a more substantial and satisfying fantasy RPG fix.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2008"}

Rayman Origins does an exemplary job in being all that's right about gaming.  I won't rehash what other great reviews have already stated about this game, the bottom line is that it's a perfect platforming experience without any flaws, whatsoever.  I would highly suggest this for PS3 and 360 owners who don't dabble in classic games or other downloadable games as there are very few full retail games like it on these 2 systems.  I always thought that Nintendo continues to do well because they welcome the fun and whimsical themed games, but if the PS3/360 audience can likewise welcome these kinds of games, all the better.The only note for people: This game is not easy at all, I got stuck for quite a while on just the third world, but for some reason I never felt bored on being stuck, it's a very addicting game that rewards good skills.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2011"}

Once you start playing it, you can't get off your computer until wee hours in the next morning. It is the best of Unreal series and whether you are FPS fan or not, you should definitly get this game or at least try the demo and see if you like it.Gameplay is pretty much the same as Unreal Tournament 2003 but this comes with the new Onslught mode that everyone's talking about. I won't tell you what it's about so you get more curious and buy it but it is GREAT.Graphics are same and so is everything else. There are new maps, vehicles and modes but it doesn't change much from Unreal 2K3. This is still recommend over Unreal 2K3 because it will have more people playing and it has the Onslaught mode.Requirements is a no problem. I tried it online on my cheapest computer which is the Celeron 900mhz, 256mb ram, GeForce 2 MX400, and DSL and it ran without any lags!!! But it was on lowest settings that you can ever think of. It was ran on safe mode so the game configured it by itself. Even though the settings were lowest, the game still looked good but not great. It looked better than first Unreal Tournament with the highest settings. Now, if you have a little better computer than my computer then you know that you will at least be able to play on low settings. If you are looking forward to play it on high settings, get at least Athlon XP 3200+ or Pentium 4 2.4ghz, 512mb ram, Radeon 9600 Pro or GeForce 5700 Ultra. Get a broadband too.This game is one of the best FPS that you can ever wish for if you are looking forward to have some fragging fun online.

Also, the puzzles were really not that interesting and just seemed to slow you down.

{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"mike","summary":"you guys are crazy","reviewText":"this game is hot.  scary as hell too.  don't hate just because it isn't halo 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2005"}

Also it makes you wonder,\"do they really have to add her in this?\"The game is fun no doubt, but unfortunately there is way too much: okay, here is the stealth part, or just go guns blazing. So far there seems to be less climbing exploration sections compared to the first two Uncharted games. Also it seems that even going guns blazing is questionable when you can go fisticuffs with thugs and take them out easily.But don't let these points discourage you from purchasing this or at least playing the game. There are sections where I could not put down my controller wanting to finish the next suspenseful part. I'll probably be the strange one and state I enjoyed the desert part. The game still shows off how Naughty Dog can make areas look strikingly real. So far I think the multiplayer has improved. There seems to be more customization options for your hero or villain. The addition of a split screen option is a very nice touch. I've always enjoyed how easy the Uncharted games play so I have 0 problems with wanting to play it with a buddy on the same screen.

It was only out of my apathy for the series (as in, I certainly wouldn't buy it, but I'd play it at a friend's house) that I gave this one a try.Is this 2004?  Hell no, boyos!  Yet playing this game, you'd think it was.Graphics are never a concern of mine when it comes to game enjoyment, but this time here, the negatives of the game just brought the graphical issue to the forefront.  It looks like a game released in 2004, it's just atrocious.  Maybe if they did it to handle more model types for zombies and the like, I could understand, but it's hard to stay immersed into the game experience when blasting open zombies with a shotgun reveals blood as red as monotoned and bright as paint and no real lasting gore.One of the biggest detriments to the game is the sloppy, almost nonexistant friction.  For some reason, every time you run/walk, you not only have no indication that you're moving up and down slightly, but you LITERALLY slide.  If you stop moving, you'll slide a few inches before coming to a stop.  This completely destroys much chance of very quick movements in tight action places where you need to avoid spooking a zombie hiding behind a corner or another room, and you end up skidding out into the open.Another massive detriment is lack of aiming.  You shoot with the right trigger, and melee hit with the left trigger.  You can only aim with a sniper rifle---everything else you essentially \"fire from the hip\", as you experience in Call of Duty games frequently.  It's hideous for aiming, and renders weapons like the pistol completely useless save for quick bodyshots when you have no time to reload.Playing online may be necessary, as singularly, the AI is atrocious.  My allies very frequently run into my gunfire, making it impossible to use many weapons for a long enough while without having to move out of the way of shooting your friends.If I didn't know this was a major game release, I'd honestly think this was some kind of low-budget online flash game or Xbox Arcade game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2010"}

In Chrono Trigger prepare yourself to journey into the forgotten past, distant future, and even to the very End of Time.The Worlds of Past, Present and FutureIn Chrono Trigger you'll journey back to Prehistory (65,000,000 B.C.) where humans and reptiles battle to wipe each other from existence. Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization. The Middle Ages (600 A.D.) is an era of swords and sorcery, a dark time when the armies of Fiendlord rule over the land.The Present (1000 A.D.) is the time period in which Crono, Lucca and Marle live. It is a bright and peaceful age. However, in the Future (2300 A.D.), an era of despair has taken hold with rogue machines ruling the world. After the day of the apocalypse in 1999 A.D., the prosperous civilization of humanity crumbled and the remaining people struggle to stay alive. And, finally, there remains the End of Time -- a place with no era to call its own. This confluence of time's streams transcends spatiotemporal boundaries. It is here at the gravitational center for all temporal flotsam that Spekkio -- the Master of War -- serves as your guide on time's treacherous roads.Battle Systems and gameplayThis game utilizes a revised version of the groundbreaking Active Time Battle (ATB) System. Chrono Trigger features exhilarating combat in which the clock is constantly ticking. Characters must first wait as the ATB gauges charge, and then perform an action.

DiSpirito \"mentored1\"","summary":"Not a game for everyone","reviewText":"Greetings!  If you love this game, good for you--I'm not here to bash it or anyone who loves it!  I just couldn't find much to enjoy in this one.The controls were sloppy and counter-intuitive, in my opinion; I'm basing that off other 3rd-person games that had much more responsive and easy-to-use control schemes (Arkham Asylum or Just Cause, for example).  It's not at all clear, even early in the easier parts of the game, what buttons or combination of buttons to use to accomplish a task; sometimes using items or powers requires control actions that are not shown at all.  I'm sure it can be figured out, but controls should be something simple to pick up and easy to use, not something that becomes a challenge itself.The camera was out of control and felt like someone with a nervous disorder was filming the game; it moved way too much and the angles were poor, at best.  I'm sure you can deal with it and play the game, but it got in the way for me and I don't want the perspective to distract from the gameplay--that's a basic requirement.The story was disjointed and non-sensical.  It reminded of some of the obscure japanimation movies where strange things happen all around you and there's no explanation or no logical connection to what you're doing.  A lot of players really enjoyed the &#34;story&#34; to Dark Souls, but even after reading blogs and reviews, I'm still scratching my head.  Compare this game to something like Arkham Asylum and you're left wondering if there's any narrative cohesion at all.It's tough for me to call this a role-playing game.  I grew up playing a lot of RPGs, both on consoles and PC, and this has little in common with any RPG--even table-top pen and paper gamers might struggle to unravel the convoluted RPG mechanics at work here.  Character progression, saving, stats, items, and so on are poorly organized and presented, making character management another challenge that distracts from gameplay.If you loved this game, I'm glad for you--truly--but I'd be very wary of picking this one up based on reviews.  It's not going to be for everyone and I suspect it'll be a love/hate thing for most gamers.  I enjoy games where the controls, camera, and character progression are simple to use and don't get in the way of the game (Skyrim, for example); if you feel the same, be careful with Dark Souls.  I also require some cohesion and logical progression to the story which is absent here; if you're looking for a good story that makes sense and connects with the player's actions, you may want to stay away from this game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2013"}

Since the new PS3 slim only has two USB ports, it is kind of hampered in what it can charge. This station is the best way and most convenient to charge the move controller(s) (if you have two) without having to leaving the console on. In my experience, it takes about 4 - 6 hours for initiall charge, then about 2 - 4 afterwars depending on how dead the controller is. Overall, it is a great item to have coupled with the navigation controller or move bundle. Definately worth, however, I should note that 3rd party developers are making charging stations that can charge up to 4 controllers at a time, so that might be something of interest for those who may have multiple controller (i.e a family).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2010"}

{"product_name":"B006P5RW3M","description":"","reviewerName":"H. Le","summary":"CD Projekt Red Did It Again","reviewText":"In this day and age, it is quite remarkable that a game developer would rework its game, add new contents, and then offer it to Customers for *free*; but somehow, the rogue Polish developer CDPR (CD Projekt Red) have managed to do just that...twice.Since I believe that most Customers already know that there is more than one version of TW2 available for PC - namely the EE (enhanced edition) and the OV (original version); and that the additional contents of the EE can be downloaded for free; and since I own both PC versions (and also the Xbox360 version), I think it'd be helpful to offer a brief comparative review of the package contents and features to start (of course, any adjective included is merely my opinion):ENHANCED EDITION (published by WB)- True to CDPR's pledge to fans and Customers, the EE is 100 percent DRM free right out of the box. There is no internet connection requirement whatsoever, no key codes, not even a disc check.  Thank you to CDPR and WB for respecting their Customers.- All EE contents included- 2 game DVDs and 1 soundtrack CD are all in the same case- The game guide includes walkthrough for the EE contents- Better cover art- Standard DVD type slip-on cover.ORIGINAL VERSION (published by Atari, or Namco Bandai for the Euro version)- Comes with limited online activation DRM scheme.  However, please note that the DRM can easily be removed by patching or upgrading to the EE altogether (to deployed Military Members, please be aware that either way, a solid internet connection is required)- EE contents not included.  Please note that this is not a patch or a DLC; rather, the entire game - reworked with the EE contents - needs to be downloaded (free of charge), which is about 15GB.- The game DVDs (2 ea.) are in one DVD case- 1 bonus materials DVD and 1 sound track CD are in another DVD case (separately from the game DVDs)- The game guide has better binding, but walkthrough for EE contents is not included.- The map is slightly longer in length by about 2.5 inches and contains 1 additional illustration on each side.- The origami-like paper craft and the story-related \"A Hog Named Henselt\" pamphlet are included (not available in the EE version)- Thicker bookcase-type cover.- As the description for the OV indicated, there is also a Temerian coin included. However, since I moved a couple months ago and can't find mine right now, I can't confirm this.As for the additional EE contents in specific, here are the improvements that I noticed:- Additional cutscenes for the intro, in between-chapters, and post-credit to improve narration.- Better sounds overall. Eg. Geralt's voice volume is now higher (he seemed to be whispering in the OV), and additional sound-offs like \"Oorah\" or \"Hooah\" can now be heard throughout the military encampments, exercises, and operations (just like the source novels, TW2 is full of anachronism - 'this I like.')- The additional side quests in Act 3 for both Roche's and Iorveth's paths.- The side quest \"Little Sisters\" in Roche's path is now much easier to follow.- For those who dislike QTEs (quick time events - I call it sequential button mashing) now there is an option to toggle it off in boss fights.- You now can actually see the full impact of the major decisions made in regards to Temeria, Kaedwen, Vergern, and the sorcerers/sorceresses as shown in the end of Act 3 in Loc Muine (in the OV, you only heard about what happened)- and also in the epilogue as narrated by Dandelion.- Just for those who must know, there is now one additional possible sexual encounter in Iorveth's path.  New total: 3 possible encounters for Iorveth's path vs. 1 possible encounter for Roche's path.Note:  For those who already played the OV and now just want to play the additional EE side quests, after downloading and merging the EE pack, load up a game save at the end of Act 2, and the side quests will be available and properly loaded in Act 3.To the game itself, if you are not aware of it by now, first and foremost, TW2 is a game designed from the ground up specifically for the mature Gamers.  Indeed, please keep the children away and out of both visual and audible range - because there are scenes and references of profanity, nudity, sexual intercourse, rape, torture, mutilation, and violent death here - even more than in TW1.As an action RPG, TW2 is very good.  Similar to TW1, leveling up is well timed; that is, as you progress through the story, you are leveling up at the right time and the right place.  Thus, there is never a need to grind to level up (unless perhaps you are playing on \"dark mode\" difficulty, which is extremely challenging combat-wise).In terms of combat, unlike TW1, TW2 is now a full-out action game that requires precise timing and hand-eye coordination.  As is, it is definitely not easy to grasp for the novice or casual Gamers.  However, if you keep in mind that there are always more than one way to overcome the challenge in combat, and you are willing to experiment, then it will be very rewarding when you discover your own way to success and domination.For me, the highlight of TW2 is the story elements that make it stands head and shoulder above the rests. In addition to the aforementioned unflinchingly mature themes, TW2 is one of those extremely rare games that offer true branching story paths.  To be more precise, depending on the choice you made at the end of Act 1, almost all of Act 2 will play out differently with a different story and in a different location. In addition, about 1/3 of Act 3 will also be different. Needless to say, the replay value is way off the chart here. And in order to see and to appreciate the scope of the whole story, you will want to play both paths.Last but not least, the complex and layered story of TW2 is firmly set in a world saturated with different shades of gray.  Thus, the decisions to be made - which, in conjunction with your own logic and morality and along with the half-lie and half-truth that you gathered - is neither right nor wrong ... There are only consequences. And regardless of where you stand on the notion of 'the end justifies the means', tread carefully, because you may need to do just that.In general, in spite of which version of TW2 one chooses to go with - whether the OV or the EE, it is still an excellent game.  In particular, TW2EE earned 4.5 stars in my book - to which I rounded up in appreciation of CD Projekt Red.  Thank You for reading.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2012"}

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesHunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone. Hunt together with up to 4 players online or take on arena quests with 2-player split-screen action. In single player mode, you even have the ability to hunt with AI-controlled characters named ChaCha.Communicate Online- Because communication is key in coordinated huntsMonster Hunter Trisupports Wii Speak and text chat.Monsters with Unique Abilities and Attacks- Monsters have unique and dynamic personalities, abilities and defenses, increasing in complexity as the player progresses. They camouflage themselves to ambush hunters, but will flee or call for help if outmatched.Immense Living, Breathing World with Ecosystem- Monsters interact amongst each other in a living breathing ecosystem, complete with food chain.

Yes its just another FPS but its FPS done right especially from the pioneers of the genre.The story looked cool from opening but feels half baked as you play more and more. Your a survivor of a aftermath that has left the world a wasteland after an asteroids pretty much tore the earth a new one. Your somehow special because you were locked away in a capsule before suffering this fate. You awake in mad max sort of world with other survivors roaming and inhabiting the wasteland. You do missions after missions with no real reason but only to gain favor or get through areas so you can beat the game. Like I said the story could of been interesting but in the end your an errand boy, just with guns.Gameplay saves this game,first of all the shooting is excellent. Very responsive right down to having a aim down the sight that modern FPS incorporates. The Guns are varied enough that you'll want to try all of them to see which enemies are most weak against which weapon. The wingstick and crossbow are very fun to use and will probably be your favorite when you get tired of lead shooting. Driving is another focus, You can do races and travel on custom buggies and one ATV. The vehicle's can be upgraded by winning races and can be equipped with armor and weapon by just buying from vendor. The driving and vehicle combat is easy and quite fun once you get a ton of weapons. You also find scraps and other nick knacks which you can use to build helpful items such as turrets,bots and health boost. It has rpg elements but there isn't anything extreme like grinding and farming, its a neat gameplay addition that will come in handy when you need extra supplies in tense situations.Rage looks amazing and runs amazing, the game runs smooth with no framerate dips from my 30 hour playthrough and I did everything there was. The detail on the characters look really good and there are very cool claustrophobic environments that really show off lighting and shadows really well. Its a solid 60 frames per second, this is evident when you have enemies especially groups all moving lightning fast and dodging your bullets.I really enjoyed rage, I still haven't played the co-op or tried the online multiplayer. But the singleplayer was a great action packed run through that will entertain you for hours like it did for me. It is a shooter but its a shooter that experiments with different genre's and technical wise its a well polished you can tell a lot of care went into making sure its glitch free. Its really cheap now and I'd say its well worth picking up now. Enjoy","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2012"}

Starcraft II, the sequel 10 years in the making. I thought Mike was going to explode. The suspense started the day before yesterday. He kept checking on the order status (pre-ordered with release date delivery from Amazon) and was staring to panic because at 6 that evening it was still pending shipping. At this point, he is lamenting that fact that he pre-ordered from Amazon and just knew that he was going to get the game late. By the next morning, it had updated that it was out for delivery via UPS. All is well, or so we think.UPS packages are normally waiting for me at the door when I get back from work around 5. Every now and then we may have to wait until 6 or 7, but that's pretty rare. Well, of course, when I get home at 5 there is no box. When Mike gets home at 6 there is no box. When we finish eating supper and catch up on yesterdays TV at 7, there is no box. He is quite annoyed at this point. \"Why does this always happen to me? Why isn't UPS here? Do you think they are going to deliver my game or are they going to deliver my game? I hope they don't decide it's too late and try to keep it until tomorrow! Why did I pre-order from Amazon?\" This goes on and I convince him to play Super Mario Galaxy II with me. We play a few boards, and around 8 his phone rings. He looks at it, kind of like it did something wrong. \"That's Jaret. He's called to ask me how the new Starcraft is, AND IT'S STILL NOT HERE!\" So he answers the phone and leaves the room. Well, a little while later, I hear him say he sees the truck and has to go.So, I walk into the living room and take a peek out of the window. There it is. The big brown truck. I swear, it's like the UPS guy has a sense of humor and knew how badly Mike wanted that box. We live on the corner of the first street in the subdivision. There are maybe 6 houses on the entrance street. Two of them had packages. So, Mike is sitting at the window watching the UPS guy slowly bring out boxes. Then, into the truck, and swoosh! Right past our street. He runs to the side door, in the hopes that maybe he will drop the box off there. (I'm not sure why he would think that, they always leave our boxes on the front porch.) No luck, the truck just passes the house by. At this point, I'm really having trouble not laughing at his frustration. Finally, the truck comes back up the road and turns down our street. He's standing at the window, and I open the door and told him to just meet the guy at the truck, it will save him the trip up the driveway. So he walks up to the truck and I swear, it seemed like forever that the guy was in the back looking for the box. But at last, it's in Mike's hands and all is well! Well, sort of well. He's still annoyed that it was 8:30 before he was able to start installing the game, but at least I don't have to call Amazon about our release day delivery being a day too late. Release day (or actually night) delivery, achieved!As for the game, he must really like it, because he has disappeared into the computer room. But everytime I see him, he is smiling. I guess I'm going to be a Starcraft Widow, at least until story mode is complete!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"Veil_Lord","summary":"StarCraft 2","reviewText":"The original StarCraft arguably the greatest real-time strategy game ever made. Sure it had a couple of quirks, like the Guardian's pathfinding bug which made them move into close to turrets when they didn't have to, but overall you had a perfect balance between the three races and an extraordinary campaign. Realistically, you're never going to make everybody happy with a sequel because it can never live up to the perfect game that people will be imagining it will be. So when I say that this game is very similar to the original StarCraft a lot of ways, it's not a bad thing.I was extremely into StarCraft a year or so after Broodwars came out. I got it in that big battle chest thing with the two strategy guides include. I spent countless hours playing the game with friends, on my own, and played the campaign two times through completely. The original had this on mode where you could get other people to try out the game by joining your games and it was a lot of fun. It also lacked copy protection and was pirated mercilessly. As a consequence, blizzard has gone 100% in the wrong direction. The copy protection StarCraft two is stifling. It give you an idea, let me tell you, install process went. Remember this is using the disc and not the digital download.I put in the disc and let the program install the whole 12 gigs. A nice touch, they've put a bit of back story in the installer so you hear a little bit about that previous game to get you started while it's installing. They're still waiting for quite a while, but it's a large game who can fault that? It also asked to activate on battle.net. So I log into my web browser and try to go there,and naturally all my old StarCraft accounts are now invalid. Hooray. So I set up a new account and then go to play my game. But wait, the installer has to run and optimization will take between 15 to 60 min. this is after the entire install from the disc. So fine, I wait for it to do its little thing and then it starts downloading patches conveniently telling me that it has a certain amount time to go before the game is playable, but I can play before it's fully patched. So apparently to aid in copy protection prevention they don't include the whole game on the disc. So now I'm waiting even longer until it can download the freaking installer. Fortunately you can play before the entire patch has downloaded, but still expected to spend more time waiting.If you're on an AT&T; internet account or anybody else with bandwith caps you need to know this.  By default the installer downloads some data via P2P.  So not only are you downloading the patches (as of this writing about 1.57 GB) you're also losing bandwith as it UPLOADS on your own connection without informing you first.  To Blizzard's credit you can disable that feature from the installer's options at the top, but I personally felt stolen from because it was done without my consent.  Ask me first Blizzard if you're going to be too cheap to use the bandwith from your own servers!  Maybe I'll be cool with it for speed, but not asking isn't right.So I finally get the whole thing downloaded and happy and I'm prompted to enter my battle.net password and username. It seems I have to enter this every single time I log in. There's no remembering my password so I have to type it every freaking time. Not only that, the game requires a constant Internet connection unless you want a play as a guest. Even then, you're only allowed to play your own game for 30 days between activations. This level of copy protection is freaking ridiculous.  Oh, and per their terms they make it very clear that you don't own anything they're only licensing it to you.  Again, to their credit they have very prominently how you can return the game for a full refund if you do not agree.The game includes only the Terran campaign. Personally that's my favorite race anyway, but it seems like they're trying to make a cash cow to separate the game at into three separate parts. Each game is priced higher than the normal freestanding game, but on the other hand there's free online play which you have to factor is built into the price. If you're paying any kind of monthly fee to play online with people you would easily go over the cost of the game so don't find the high initial price all that disturbing.  I should note, you do have guest passes that apparently let you have other people try the game as sort of a demo, but they have to download the 13+ GB full game to do so.Gameplay is quite similar to the original game, but somewhat faster paced. There are naturally more units and everything looks great. The movies in between levels have been improved drastically. Everything looks more lifelike and I have no complaints. That said, after playing it I've just sort of felt like it was just there. I don't have the same emotional attachment and feeling of excitement I had playing the old game. Somehow, I doubt I'll get around to playing the campaign again. The best way I can describe it is like a sequel to a movie that's technically better in nearly every respect, but has all the heros wearing Pepsi logos on their outfits and the theater usher is checking your ticket stub every 10 minutes.Even with all the extra stuff, I had such good feelings about the original that if this game and come out say year or two before it did I would've bought a new computer just to play it. As it was, I waited until the game was on sale for about one third its initial cost before even considered buying it and even then it was iffy. Blizzard, you kind of lost me guys. I find I'm much happier playing theWarhammer 40kgames.  Not nearly so much headache.  Not planning on buying the next one.Update #1With the current patch you CANNOT play offline.  You're stuck with the same always on tether certain other games have.  I've read some posts and it may be a glitch, but this is intolerable for me.  I can't have my connection up constantly.  I truly regret purchasing this game.Update #2 12/3/12Just FYI, Battle.net will install itself and it's cache on the C: drive even if you install the game on another partition.  The installation has added a bit over 200 MB to my primary partition.  I won't bore you with details, but it's somewhat irritating to me because it increases the size my periodic backups need.  One reason I tolerate Steam is that at least it plays nice where I installed it; also it's offline mode works.  SC2 offline mode is still broken as of today.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0IIPY","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"The first wholly great console Sonic game in years","reviewText":"IfSonic Unleashedprovided a blueprint-like glimpse at how great Modern Sonic could be, andSonic Generationswas the truly finalized entry delivering on that promise, then Sonic Colors is in the middle, acting as the first prototype to employ the concept well. What that means in retrospect is that when you play this game, you're getting an experience much better overall than Unleashed's half-n-half dual quality, but not quite as refined and perfected as Sonic Generations' iteration of Modern Sonic. That been said, it's more than worth the price of admission. Indeed, this is the first Sonic game sinceSonic Adventure 2that I personally consider a \"great\" Sonic title. That says a lot, I think.The story in Colors goes like this: Eggman (or as I prefer to call him, Dr. Robotnik) evidently grows a conscience and in an apparent act of repentance, builds a massive inter-galactic amusement park for everyone to enjoy. Of course, Sonic and Tails are more than a little suspicious and investigate. Of course, they find out the good ol' doctor is indeed up to no good, chaining and enslaving the planets connected to his park in order to gain the energy of their alien citizens called Wisps. The Wisps respond to Sonic's heroics by giving him their energy, enhancing his abilities throughout his adventure. It is very silly and lighthearted in comparison to some of Sonic's most recent outings, but is actually much better for it.The art design and graphical execution in this game is excellent. It's incredibly flashy, colorful, and creative. One level is a massive space fleet meets carnival with a vibrant holographic pathway for Sonic to sprint across. Another is a beautiful, alien world being deforested by Robotnik's forces. Another is a thrilling space elevator. Those are just some examples of what the level themes of this game contains. The imagination is through the roof in this game, and the graphics really deliver. Despite the Wii's limitations, this game delivers excellently on the promise. This is one of the prettier games on the system.The sound design is just as cool as the visuals. Of course, the traditional sound effects are all here, no surprise there. The music is absolutely fantastic, the best Sonic has seen in years. There's also a surprising amount of music here too. A lot of work went into the soundtrack, and it shows. Plant Wisp is my favorite. Awesome stuff. Also worth noting is the voice acting present. This was the first game the new voice actors made an appearance in, and they do a very good job delivering their lines. Not only that, but the writing is decent too, offering a very lighthearted scrip with a lot of humor.The gameplay in Colors is everything that you'd ever want or expect from a Sonic title. For the first time in years, this game delivered a non-stop Sonic experience. No distractingly boring characters like Big the Cat, Amy, or even Sonic... the Warehog, taking up time with boring, slow, and cumbersome gameplay mechanics. It seems with Colors that Sonic Team finally learned that Sonic games don't need adding unnecessary, annoying elements/concepts/characters for the sake of injecting variety that nobody wanted or asked for. No, all anyone wants from a Sonic title is being the fastest thing alive, navigating a massive obstacle course of loop-de-loops, springs, turns, and speed boosts in their own flashy playground. Colors has all of these things in spades, both in 2-D and 3-D, non-stop. There's a boost function that makes Sonic run so fast the outside music and sound distorts. Now that's fast, and exactly what anyone would want from a Sonic title. Epic set pieces are frequent, emulating that \"holy crap!\" feeling of the killer whale chase ofSonic Adventureand the death truck chase ofSonic Adventure 2. Boss fights are long, engaging, and are as speedy as the rest of the game. Great job Sonic Team! See how simple that was?The newest addition to the gameplay is in the form of performance enhancing wisps combining their power with Sonic when he frees them. Some turn him into a beam of light, shooting like lightning and bouncing off of surfaces at angled trajectories. Others turn him into a pink spike ball that speed along walls and ceilings. Others turn him into a blimp that floats for a limited time. These wisps are awesome additions to the traditional Sonic gameplay, and add variety to the experience without taking away from the speed-focused platforming that makes the game so enjoyable.So is there anything not too great about Sonic Colors? Well yeah, there are some problems. For instance, there are difficulty spikes at really random times and when it does it spikes hard, to the point where you'll want to chuck the controller across the room. It's really frustrating, and you can't progress until finishing these parts. The game is also a bit short for my taste. There are incentives for replaying, but it's not as extensive as Generations' offerings. Too bad. Also, while the gameplay and control mechanics are quite good, you can tell that Sonic Team was still trying to get the hang of how Modern Sonic should control. After playing the perfectedSonic Generations, it's pretty evident that they were still working on how everything should work. The game is still a blast to play and it controls well even still, but it's still worth noting.Overall though, Sonic Colors is the first genuinely high-quality console Sonic title to come out in years. If you haven't played this stellar platforming game yet, I'd highly recommend it. If you're hesitant because of the poor reputation of Sonic console games of the past 7 years or so, while I totally understand the trepidation, I'd suggest you reconsider. If you give Sonic Colors a chance, you'll be treated to a very fun, very true-to-form Sonic title that sticks to the simple yet timelessly fun philosophy behind Sonic the Hedgehog: Being the fastest thing alive. Buy it, speed'n'dash through it, and enjoy playing through your very own intergalactic amusement park.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2011"}

It gave me a quality of experience that I never thought I would feel in a Batman video game. The combat system is fun and fluid. The exploration aspect is genius in allowing you to find riddles that scattered throught the game which can be found even after beating it. The game is set up in a Super Metroid style way to have to have new tools to be able to get to new locations. It is nice looking game fulled with easter eggs which many being related to the riddles you have to find and the presentation through the cut scenes are done extremely well with great scripted voice acting with many of the Batman's villians such as (obviously) Joker, Croc, Bain, and more.

When I started playing this game, I whispered under my breath...\"this game is sick\".  I realized at that point, how awesome it was.  It had contorted my vernacular into that of a pimply faced teenager...I was transported to the first time I played whatever ground breaking game I was playing in the mid 90's.I seriously can't go into much detail, but to say that this is the greatest handheld racing/driving game ever.  For the record, Wipeout 2048 is a very close second.When you fire this up the first time, the graphics and the speed of those graphics will blow you away.  It's simply beautiful.  The open world feel really works on a handheld, because I can spend five minutes just driving around finding new stuff.  When I have to do that on a console, I feel like I'm wasting my time.  But here, exploration is rewarded.  I will just sit down and start driving without a concern for progression, get into a few battles with the cops, and be done, and feel completely satisfied.Controls are tight.  I use wheel and peddles pretty much exclusively for consoles, so getting used to the stick was a challenge.  It can be a little too tight at times.  But after about 20 minutes you start to figure out what's what.The AI racers are brilliant.  Both the cops and the competitors really don't seem to like you very much...which adds to the ambiance.I am having a hard time coming up with a bad thing to say.  I've played everything on the vita so far, and this is my favorite game yet.Yet another reason to buy a vita.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000H96C9M","reviewerName":"Nakkiel","summary":"Expensive, time consuming, and not fun","reviewText":"First of all I played this game from classic until Firelands raid, which was released in Cataclysm. I wish I had quit sooner, but kept hoping they would release content that was fun again. It is worth noting I have done quite a bit of progression raiding, had 11 level 85 characters, and had most achievements completed on my main as well when I stopped playing.You pay for the game, the expansions, and basically pay them for the full cost an expansion again every 3 months of subscription fees. And then they do things like leave intentionally low population servers open so if you can't find a decent guild on your server it is another $25 (per character, so if you have alts you want to bring it is more) to transfer servers which doesn't actually cost Blizzard anything... This game is completely designed around bleeding the money out of your pocket.Once you are max level the game wastes as much of your time as possible on repetitive tasks such as daily quests, daily instances, farming materials, achievements that require grinding rather than skill, etc. Raiding requires either a lot of materials or a lot of gold. One great addition was cauldrons to reduce the need for farming once your guild level was high enough to give it more uses and whatnot, but they do still take a lot of materials.The daily quests and instances (I think the instances are weekly now, but require you to do an average of 1 per day) are also somewhat necessary for progression raiding for quite awhile after content releases because of the rewards they give. Running the exact same instances that you have cleared countless times with a random group every week is not only mind numbingly boring and time consuming, but you also get stuck with either horrible players, jerks that que'd together with the intention of screwing everyone else over, or a group that already kicked someone and has afk members. (If you leave you get a half hour debuff, if you don't you can't get rid of the afk people.)Finally there is raiding. This used to be what made WoW a great game. I remember in classic killing a new boss was actually an accomplishment. Raids had 20-40 people in them which made the fights much more complex, but fun. The content itself was also much more difficult and more fun. After classic they switched to a 10/25 man raid format. Since Cataclysm they made the gear in 10 man exactly the same as 25 with easier bosses in 10. They also took the lazy way in instance design by making the higher end raids heroic modes of the same exact instance and bosses. Most good guilds beat normal content within a week of it's release... meaning the rest of the time until next content release is just repeating the same content on a higher difficulty. To me that is very boring and just lazy on Blizzard's part. Even the gear models stay the same, all the items look the same on higher difficulties but have higher stats. They used to release multiple raid instances and once you beat one you would move on to the more difficult one instead of just repeating the same thing.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2012"}

BANGSNOT \"C.G.\"","summary":"Better in Many Ways, but Lacks Creepy Atmosphere of Predocessor","reviewText":"I gave this tittle four stars for fun because it is a blast to play. I gave an overall rating of four stars because it while it surpasses its predecessor by giving you more to do and more ground to cover, the storyline and atmosphere fall a little short.WHERE ITS BETTERThe game improves upon its predecessor in  a number of ways. Simply put, there's more to do in Arkham City. The side-missions are every bit as fun and interesting as the main story missions.  When you beat the main story mode, chances are there will still be plenty to do.After I'd beaten the game and the credits rolled, the Riddler, Hush, and a host of  other baddies from Batman's rogues gallery were still on the lose! And stopping them is every bit as fun as the main story mission.I especially loved how  The Riddler's role is expanded in Arkham city. In the first game, Edward Nigma was just an annoying voice who popped up from time-to-time to taunt Batman during his quest to find a bunch of puzzles. Finding the puzzles in Arkham Asylum was fun, but a villain who makes you solve puzzles isn't exactly threatening.In Arkham city, the Riddler sets a series of death traps that Batman must beat in order to save a hostage.WHERE IT ISN'T QUITE AS GOODI appreciated the addition of side missions, but didn't like the way that some of them ended. For example, tracking down and  finally confronting the evil arch-nemesis Hush was engrossing and fun. But when Batman finally comes face-to-face with him, Hush simply turns around and walks off as Batman tells Oracle, \"I'll deal with him tomorrow.\"Huh? The guy just butchered a LOT of people, and he's just  barely gotten out  the door. Why not go after him?How far could he have gotten?  How could he escape such a heavily fortified place on foot?Secondly, one central premise of the game is a bit kooky.The inmates are no longer on a lonely, remote island that looks like something from a Gothic horror novel.They are in a walled-off area of a major city that is more like a vision of urban decay in  a dystopian future.It's violent and dangerous place, but it's not particularly scary.There are no genuinely disturbing moments like the scenes with scarecrow in Arkham asylum.The island in the  first game was very much cut off from the outside world. Raving inmates who could not form whole sentences ran loose.  Without warning, you would suddenly find yourself having dark and disturbing hallucinations.Arkham City, by contrast, is not disturbing and scary: just violent and brutal.Minor gripes aside, this is a great game for your collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2012"}

Risk Everything. Trust No One.","reviewerName":"ceLeon","summary":"Still waiting for the return of the perfect Burnout","reviewText":"I would say that this game is a very good remake of Need for Speed Hot Pursuit in HD and some revamped features. I wish the PSN connection had been more reliable all night but I guess with everyone trying to download games and everything I had so much trouble downloading it from the PS Store.They way I see it, there are two types of racing games, the fine-tuning, very realistic simulators like GT and the do-whatever-you-want, crashes-look-amazing, drive without barely seeing what passes right next to you. Both are fun if you're that type of racer but I will judge this game for what it is.A/V -8/10: I'm not saying the graphics are bad giving them an 8, they are definitely beautiful! But I think that the development of the game for next gen as well as the current one, prevented the team from focusing on enhancing the experience only for next gen consoles. Hopefully the next entry in the series improves this. It's such a thrill to boost through the road in the middle of the rain and other cars and buildings. The open world is gorgeous and I've only seen very few instances where the objects look out of place because of bad graphics. As for the sound in this game, It's just what you would expect. I wasn't blown away as the first time I've played some other games. They do make a difference in the way you drive and feel the rush of trying to get away from the cops and not lose your score.Gameplay -9/10: I have to focus on the feature that I enjoyed the most which was the seamless integration between single player and multiplayer races. You can just be wandering around the city, enjoying life while some player driving as a cop, decides to start pursuing you. It might sound frustrating but it's a very different way to experience an open world game like this and the change of pace will definitely get your heart racing (see what I did there) while you try to make it to your hideout and keep the score you were building by completing events and losing the cops so you can get newer cars. The downside to this is that, you guessed it right, whenever you have a higher score, the cops will try even harder to get you. Think of it as the number of stars when being chased in GTA, you reach the maximum and you'll have the most badass cars after you.The thing that made me stop playing Need for Speed: Most Wanted was that there was no challenge in getting new cars, as long as you found them around the city they would be yours, turning into a complete waste of my time and investment in the game. Thankfully, they fixed this issue with Rivals.Wether you choose to be a cop or a racer I guarantee you'll have fun. Both sides have ways to counter the other team with shockwaves or jammers (I can't wait for some of the elements in &#34;Blur&#34; to make it to this series). It's a little frustrating when they get you with one of these attacks that make you lose control and crash your car, but I guess it's part of racing games (Blue shell in Mario Kart?)They have some issues to fix with this single/multi player approach they have but they do not take away any of the fun. I don't know about the X1 version, but I don't expect any differences at all between the versions, graphics or gameplay wise.8/10!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2013"}

Risk Everything. Trust No One.","reviewerName":"L. Sun \"Sun_Jot\"","summary":"Feels a bit short of racing","reviewText":"I consider myself a fan of the new NSF series (hot pursuit, most wanted etc..). My favorite is hot pursuit and tht's why I purchased Rivals which is supposed to be the successor of the previous cop-racers feast. And best of all Criterion was involved in the production (the team that made hot pursuit and most wanted) which got me really excited. So... here are a few things why I am giving this game 3 starts instead of 5.1. The cop-racers events are not as exciting as before. It feels more pushed and rushed, that after every race your heat level rises and you are chased by cops. And the heat level rises so fast that you have to keep running before tons of police cars and helicopters get you surrounded. What's worst of all is that you are carrying your points earned from previous race and if you get caught you lose them all.. so i find myself constantly going back to hideout and this really killed the fun.2. Lack of rigidity. The game is not hardcore on racing. You are not racing on an equal base with all racers. For example at the start of the race all other cars rush pass you from behind and you are literally miles behind them trying to start your car. and in 1 min just using a single Turbo (pursuit tech) you race your car up to 200m/h and lead by miles. It's just not racing any more. It does not feel like Hot pursuit and it feels too casual for me. I really enjoyed the racing events in NSF: Hot Pursuit where you have some casualty but overall you are racing which should be the most important thing here.3. The lack of setting adjustment. There is no setting to control the day and night or any other elements. The night racing is too dark and I am personally not a fan of racing in night and it's too dark.. You are forced to experience the weather changes and day/night shift which alternates so frequently that sometimes I just want to say , give me a break. I want to race!4. The cops are annoying, yes they get in the way when you don't want them to. The hot pursuit events in rivals (there are five type of events, hot pursuit being one of them) are not that well designed all you have to do is to use turbo and race through the end line. Where in previous NSF hot pursuit game events are more competitive between racers and cops you need to dodge the tech traps well and racing becomes more fun and exciting. The new Rivals needs to balance better5. The graphics. I am a little over the fence here. The environment looks very believable and the details are outstanding. But the lighting and overall design could have been better. There should be more shortcuts and more exciting jump-over the bridge or seeing the sunset by the sea line etc. . Everything happens so fast and random that I believe I race in dark night more often than anything else.6. The career mode feels a bit short and unexciting. People criticized the mode in previous games where you have to drive to every racing start point but now the hideout/cop station brings in tons of loading time, cutting short of driving experience (again if you don't return to hideout you are facing the risks of losing all your racing points if get caught).Okay I have said enough bad things about the game. They are not necessarily bad. Maybe it's because i had high hope for this game as the first new-gen racing game. Criterion is behind this project but I can see they are only providing the support and new team Ghost does most of the work. Well a lot of things look still need improvement i hope the next NSF game is better. Thanks for reading.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2014"}

Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A wonderful experience you won't forget","reviewText":"I'll never forget the first time I played Odin Sphere. I had endured a nightmarish six months where, in seemingly endless and rapid succession, I endured one horrific experience/circumstance after another, culminating in the loss of two loved ones very dear to me in death. I was stuck in the darkest time of my life. After weeks of utter despair and depression, I downloaded Odin Sphere off of PSN, booted it up, and for the first time in weeks, I started to feel hope again. It was the turning point. It may seem silly to say this, but while playing Odin Sphere, food started to have a taste again, I started to care about things in my life again, and while the loss and painful memories of the recent past still hurt, my life started to seem a little better each day. Odin Sphere was a magical experience that lifted my spirits, cleansed my palate, and helped me appreciate how beautiful and joyful of a gift life really is. I'll never forget the wonderful experience it has to offer. Why did this game have such a profound effect on me? Let me try to explain...The story in Odin Sphere is actually the tale of five different characters interwoven into one mosaic of destiny, depicted as story books read by a girl named Alice in her attic's library. The land of Erion is embroiled in war as two different kingdoms vie for a tool that will grant them supremacy, while others nervously watch from the sidelines (but inevitably end up involved too). Each character you play as has their stakes in one kingdom or another, either by choice or through obligation, and some are loyal only to themselves. A character you came to love as the protagonist of one story may be an enemy in another tale, and a character that was once an antagonist that you hoped to defeat all of a sudden becomes a much more sympathetic figure when you see the story from their perspective. It's very difficult to weave several stories with all their various offroads and intersections into a cohesive whole, but Odin Sphere does so with aplomb. There's a helpful place in the menu where you can see how each timeline matches up to each other in the overall scheme of things. Make no mistake, the story of Odin Sphere is not a bright tale where everyone gets a happily ever after (although some indeed do), and I think that's what I love most about it. Despite all of its fantastical whimsy and imagination, the world of Odin Sphere is very true to life, full of tragedies on a scale both personal and vast. Battles ravage the land, pointlessly cutting short the lives of countless souls, and some truly good characters meet tragic fates while evil ones get off seemingly scot-free. It's very realistic. However, even in a world ravaged by war and tragedies, there are bright glimmers of hope that make life worth living. Every character has a very unique story to tell, some of personal salvation, others of duty to nation-before-self, and even an incredibly touching story involving both redemption and love. It's a very complex and touching tale that Odin Sphere aspires to tell, and I have to give credit to the game for not only telling one story incredibly well, but five of them. Bravo!The art and sound in the game definitely compliments that story really well. Vanillaware has become famous for their instantly recognizable art design that focuses on gorgeous hand-drawn characters and painterly backdrop settings. It's a style that just lights your imagination on fire. Every character is so cool looking and instantly recognizable, and that extends from the main five characters to almost every major player in the story. Seeing the massive, almost celestial King Odin, or the way the Shadow Knight Oswald transforms from gentle-but-composed warrior into a nightmarish beast, is just unforgettable. Same goes for the settings, each of which is a joy to visit, and that's a good thing because every character will visit the same general locations. Thankfully, each locale is so cool, you won't be bored to go back.  Visually, Odin Sphere is one of the ultimate cases to be made that art design and vision is far more important to the visuals of a game than trying to push the boundaries of ever-aging tech limitations. The sound is also well done. The voice acting in this game is exceptionally well done, in my opinion, featuring some top-talent voice actors to fill the roster. They all do a very good job bringing the characters to life. The very distinct, distinguished soundtrack from Basiscape is suitably whimsical, dramatic, and fantastical. The presentation overall is just wonderful.At its core, Odin Sphere is a beat-em-up action/adventure RPG. A mouthful to be sure. Like the story and presentation, Odin Sphere's gameplay is both immediately satisfying and also satisfyingly deep and engaging. Each character promises a very different gameplay experience, as each character plays totally differently from one another, requiring you to change up your general strategy each time you start a new campaign. For instance, Gwendolyn, the first character you have access to, is the most balanced, making it easier and enjoyable to get used to the game's combat system. The others all play differently, Oswald is highly mobile and can transform into a powerful beast, Mercedes is weak but can fly and her attacks are ranged, Cornelius is a canonball fighter, bouncing all over and avoiding hits, and Velvet is a high-chaining character with long-range chains. At its core, most of your time will be spent beating up and tearing through hoards of bad guys, all of whom will differ in variety and abilities depending on your location. This is where the depth sets in...When enemies fall, they release lights called \"phozons\" that you can vacuum into your special weapon, called a \"Psypher.\" OR, you can plant seeds from a massive variety of plants that will automatically vacuum the number of phozons required to grow their \"fruitage.\" This is where one of Odin Sphere's main quirks lie. Phozons are used to upgrade the level of your weapon, increasing your offensive capabilities, BUT you also gain levels for your health by eating items that replenish health. There's also a really deep cooking system in play where you can create more complex dishes to eat. The more complex your dish, the higher HP you regain when eating and also the higher health XP you earn. Add in a really deep, nuanced alchemy system that encourages mathematical thinking and strategy for crafting special potions you'll need to survive and you get a very deep gaming experience indeed. It's so interesting and I love that. Odin Sphere takes an immediately satisfying gameplay style and adds mentally engaging, nuanced facets that makes this a game that will challenge and engage you the whole way through. And make no mistake, this game will challenge you. It is HARD. If you don't employ proper planning and strategy, this game will kick your arse six ways to Sunday. Some may not like that, but I do. Add in awesome boss fights and you get a game whose gameplay is as memorable and exciting as its story and presentation.Odin Sphere is such a whimsical masterpiece, it's really hard to encapsulate its greatness and beauty in a short review. Vanillaware has gone on to make several wonderful games since this one, such asMuramasa: The Demon BladeandDragon's Crown, but for my money, Odin Sphere stands as their Magnum Opus. It is such a complete game, where every aspect adds to a cohesively masterful experience. From the moment I started playing Odin Sphere, I truly escaped into the storybooks right alongside Alice sitting in her attic, into a whimsical world of pain, loss, tragedy, but also healing, hope, and love. Odin Sphere is a wonderful game I shall never forget, and if you play it, I guarantee you won't either. Give it a chance, stick with it through the challenging learning curve, and I guarantee you will cherish this game too. So buy it (only $10 on PSN!), get lost in the story of the land of Erion, and see this tale of fate to its epic and hopeful conclusion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2014"}

In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City.

Completely open free roaming world. Kind of has the Assassin's Creed type movement where you can basically climb anything with no problem. The controls are VERY easy to learn and use. You can save your game at anytime so if you just want to hop in for 20 minutes and then save, no problem. I think this game is pretty mindless to play and doesn't really require much strategy or thought to get through. Enemies pop up and you just blast away at them. If you get into a jam, just climb your way out (or run away) to heal and recharge, and then get back at it. There really isn't a consequence if you die, and you start right back close to where you died so there's not much back tracking. There are enough weapons to use and you can upgrade each one too. Your \"ammo\" is pretty much endless as you can recharge from basically anything in the game. The action never really ends, which is why I think it's so much fun. I have played Skyrim, Borderlands, BioShock 1&2, and Mass Effect 2&3. If you enjoyed any or all of these games, then I'm pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. I have actually put Borderlands on the back burner to concentrate on inFAMOUS and inFAMOUS 2 because it is that much fun. One word to describe this game....FUN!!! I bought the inFAMOUS Collection and I think it is well worth the money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2012"}

I will at some point, but at the moment, I'm not much into online gaming.  But as so many people have pointed out, Team Fortress 2 is widely acknowledged as one of the most enjoyable multiplayer online gaming experiences around, so I don't see how its inclusion here could do anything other than make this already-stellar package even more appealing.REVIEW:The Orange Box is a collection of games from Valve, arguably the most admired and beloved video game developer around today.  Given the sheer amount of content given here, The Orange Box offers perhaps the best value purchase on the PS3.  Not only is the content quite voluminous, but it's quality is absolutely stellar.Half Life 2 has become my favorite single-player first person shooter of all time.  Over 10 years ago, back when I was still in college, I remember being absolutely blown away by the revolutionary shooter for the PC known as Half Life.  Stepping back into the Half Life universe after a decade was not only a comforting blast of nostalgia, but a reminder of how the merging of craft and brilliance can take something that was already so innovative and groundbreaking, and make it better in every way.  Half Life 2 is a near perfect game.  Looking back on the games different chapters, it's astounding how diverse and varied the game is.  The game is enhanced by the way it tells its somewhat simple yet intriguing story.  The battles, NPC interactions, and plot storylines all unfold in the environment around you, just like if you were transported into the game.  There are no cutscenes, and your ability to fully interact with your environment during every moment you play the game makes Half Life 2 one of the most immersive video game experiences you can have.  The action is intense and furious, yet requires constant thought.  I quite simply can't find anything bad to say about Half Life 2.  Around every corner, and in every step Gordon takes from being a fugitive on the run to becoming a revolutionary iconoclast, you can see and feel Valve's brilliance and how much of a labor of love this game was.  Games like this are rare, and this is why in 2010, six years after its original release on PC, Half Life 2 still puts all the other single player FPS's out there to shame.Upon finishing Half Life 2, there's no need to get depressed, as also included here are the two expansion packs, known as Half Life 2: Episodes 1 and 2.  Each expansion adds around 6 more hours of gameplay that continues the story immediately after the events that conclude Half Life 2.  Episode 1, while still very enjoyable, doesn't quite reach the heights of the main game, but Episode 2 does.  Episode 2 is absolutely amazing and will leave you clamoring for the moment when Valve inevitably releases Episode 3.And if all this wasn't enough, there's Portal.  Released to much fanfare, Portal is deserving of the hype and praise that has been bestowed upon it.  A spin off of the Half Life universe, Portal is a puzzle game disguised as a first person shooter where you use a portal gun to navigate rooms/levels full of obstacles.  It's an extremely creative brain teaser that is full of surprises.  Not only is it loads of fun, but it has a wildly wicked sense of humor, a few surprisingly emotional moments, and even an air of mystery.  I have never played anything quite like it before.  Despite its somewhat short length, its one of those games you won't soon forget.With all this said, it is somewhat disappointing that there is a downside to all this.  When Valve decided to bring The Orange Box over to the PS3, they gave duty to Electronic Arts to do the PS3 port.  Unfortunately, EA didn't give this package quite the care that they should have, and the end result are some non-game-breaking, yet somewhat annoying, technical glitches that snuck past their quality control.  I experienced probably 10-15 in-game freezes in all my time with the Orange Box (25+ hours on the Half Life games, plus 6 or so more on Portal), most of them occurring during Portal.  Not terribly bad, but still, an annoyance nonetheless.  More annoying is an audio glitch that adds a horrible, static hiss to the in-game audio.  This wasn't a constant problem, but would occur approximately once every hour while playing, and would last anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.  This is inexcusable on EA's part, and the lack of this bug would have easily warranted a 5 star rating in my review, as the game freezes didn't occur frequently enough to be a major problem.Overall, even though I must deduct a star for the bugs, I still wholeheartedly recommend The Orange Box to anyone with a PS3.  Half Life 2 is one of the epic action games of all time, and Portal is an event that should not be missed.  Together with Team Fortress 2, this package delivers exceptional value and quality gaming of the highest order.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0002CHJAA","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","summary":"The Weakest Entry in the Series, But Still Worth Playing.","reviewText":"Well, here we are, the second game in the Xenosaga series.  If you've played the first then you were surely intrigued enough to pick up this game.  Is it just as good as it's predecessor?  Let's find out!Graphics (score 9/10): If you just finished the first game and then popped this one in, the first thing that you would notice is that the art style is different.  It's not that it's bad or anything, but coming right after the first game, the difference is jarring.  The first game looked a lot more anime in style with characters having the big eyes and whatnot, but this entry goes for a more realistic look.  As I said, it's not bad, just a jarring change.Music (score 9/10): The music is just as beautiful as it was in the first game.  Absolutely stunning tracks that lend great emotional depth to the scenes they are featured in.  As for voice acting, all of it's good - well, with one exception: Momo's voice is really irritating.  It's just high pitched and annoying.  This is unfortunate, given what you'll find out later...Characters (score 10/10): The same cast of characters from the first game make a reappearance here (Shion, KOS-MOS, Jr. Ziggy, Momo, chaos).  They are just as compelling as they were the first time, and they get a lot of great development too.  Our favorite scary villain Albedo also returns to haunt our nightmares.  I like that in this entry, you get a lot of back story on him which really helps flesh out his motivations as a character.Story (score 10/10): Don't even bother trying to pick up and play this game if you haven't played the first one.  Suffice it to say, the story is very confusing if you haven't played the first game.  It's even more complex than the first game's storyline, and features many disturbing and heart-wrenching scenes (perhaps even more than the first game).  This game definitely focuses on Jr. and Albedo's backstory moreso than anything else, and I'm not unhappy with that as it's very interesting.  If you're new to this series (you really shouldn't start with this one) just know that the story features space, artificial lifeforms, aliens, higher-dimensional planes of existence, and Nietzschean philosophy.  That's really all you need to know, huh?Battle System (score 6/10): Well, combat's where everything kind of goes downhill.  Battles are really irritating due to the break system.  It seems like it takes ages to break an enemy, making battles really tedious.  You're also now forced to bring Momo if you want a reasonable chance of success.  She's about the only one who has a weapon that can damage certain enemies reliably so you're pretty much forced to bring her.  If that weren't enough, she's also the only person who can heal the party when they are in E.S. battles - another reason you're forced to bring her.  Remember earlier in the review when I said her voice was really annoying?  Yeah, isn't it lovely that the one character you need to bring has the most annoying voice?  So, basically, character balance is not fantastic in this regard.  Couple that with extremely tedious battles where you've got to break every single enemy to do any decent damage, and you've got a big dent in the enjoyability of this game.  In fact, out of all three games in the series, this entry has the least enjoyable battle system for me.Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Well, menus, camera angles, all the standard stuff is fine.  One thing of note here is that there are no random battles.  Yep, everything is totally wandering around on-screen waiting to kill you!  So, people who hate random battles will be very pleased.  On the other hand, the cutscenes in this game are just as long as unrelenting as the first game's.  If you're one of those gamers who hate long cutscenes, this whole series is not for you!  I, however, didn't mind at all.  There is one thing left I should mention - this series continues the same button layout as the first game.  The O button selects things and the X button cancels.  It's backwards to most other PS2 games, and it can take some getting used to.Overall (score 9/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  The battle system of this game makes it feel very tedious at times, but the story, characters, and music are still fantastic.  Plus, you really need to play this one to get to the third game in the series, so I'd still recommend it despite it's flaws.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2012"}

The majority of the game takes place in a matrix-like-world, where you have the ability to do such things.  And since you can jump/fly all over the city, there's little reason to explore every nook and cranny like before.  It's just one mess of dimly-lit buildings.  Cars are irrelevant.  You gain neat super-powers, and some of the boss-fights can be challenging, but overall it's not really that difficult and therefore, not all that much fun.  You zoom around, do some things, upgrade stuff, that's it.  They say you can upgrade your weapons, but it's so costly and the difference in effectiveness is barely noticable; it wasn't until I beat the game that I could \"upgrade\" all of my weapons.

{"product_name":"B006WQR3OM","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"The extreme difficulty will turn most players away","reviewText":"The Good: Lots of unique and interesting upgrades and research, cool alien designs, intense battles, great UIThe Bad: Maps repeat too often, extreme difficulty nearly breaks the game, camera can be screwy, losing soldiers permanently makes the game even harderXCOM was a popular turned based strategy game back in the 90&#8242;s and everyone was surprised how well this game turned out. Enemy Unknown keeps the series vibe and atmosphere while updated to today's standards. Enemy Unknown is one of this year's best strategy games, but there is one reason why most people will never complete this game: It is too damn hard. Not the fun and challenging type of hard, but the kind that makes it impossible to move on no matter how well equipped your soldiers are.The game does a very good job introducing new things to you as you move on. The UI is very simple and uncomplicated but pretty deep. You get to see a cut-a-way of a military base and you can click on each department. Research is where everything starts. By gathering all intact materials from missions you can research new things like weapons, armor, satellites and various other things. Engineering is where it is all made and upgrading as well as keeping track of other buildings. Workshops, laboratories, generators, hangars, all these things determine how fast you can upgrade and how you become more powerful. The barracks are where you can equip your squads loadout, upgrade soldiers, hire new ones etc. Finally there is the situation room and the command center. Here you can advance the days until you run into missions, trade alien parts on the black market, and view how in distress the world is. It is all very simple and an almost revolutionary design because most strategy games are Excel sheet based and are pretty complicated and hard to navigate.Once you assign things to engineering and research you can advance the days until you run into something such as a UFO sighting. When this happens you scramble your jets and depending on how good the equipment you gave them is they'll take it down. Most of the time you will run into abduction scenarios where you eliminate all hostiles or have to rescue someone. When this happens you get a choice as to what country to help. Each one gives you a reward such as money, scientists, engineers, or other items. Usually you pick the one that's in distress the most because if you don't they will remove themselves from the XCOM operation, and if they all withdraw it's game over. Once you go into battle this is where you see how hard this game gets.Each soldier gets two moves. The area around them is blue which means that's one move, and yellow means it takes both moves to get there. Performing an action takes one move, and that is usually shooting alien scum. All soldiers start out as regulars with assault rifles until after their first mission and they rank up. The class is chosen randomly which I really hate because you can be stuck with 5 snipers and just one assault guy. When you are ready to shoot you will see how accurate your shot is. Once all turns are taken it's the alien's turn. This back and forth is normal for strategy games, but the objectives you are given, or the difficulty of aliens, is absurd and completely unfair. You will shoot down some small greys, get through a few thin men. Maybe you will lose 2 or 3 guys in the process, then four freaking Mutons will show up and wipe the rest of you out in one turn. Or don't forget the damn spider things that can turn your squad mate into a zombie in one hit. This gets frustrating because every mission is like this. I rarely got through any unless it was on an easy difficulty mission.This would be ok if it were during main missions and you could go back and grind a bit to get better equipment, but you have to do that with EVERY single mission. You fail almost more than you succeed, such as losing so many soldiers. Once a soldier dies they are dead forever and won't come back. Once you lose a fully ranked soldier you have to stat from scratch again with a new guy. Completely unfair in a game this difficult. Most missions you will be lucky if you get out with 2 or 3 guys, but you are probably thinking that's because I suck at the game. I would restart and try all different strategies and nothing would work. The whole point of the game is to take cover and NEVER be out in the open. Once you advance and are just standing there you're dead. The fog of war doesn't help when you run around the map trying to figure out where all the enemies are. Forget rescue mission where you have to save a certain amount. Saving 5/25 people is a lot harder than it sounds. All 20 will die before you get to your third guy. This game is just a nightmare and not in a fun way.That doesn't make the game bad though. There are a lot of great research projects that make a huge impact on everything you do. You have to decide carefully about what you want or you're screwed. You get a very limited amount of money every month and you have to stretch it. I found this a bit unfair as well because there's no compromise. Even if just one element was easier it could make this game more tolerable. As it is I had this game for over a month and barely got 25% through the game before I gave up. Spending 45 minutes on a mission and then dying at the end is just ridiculous. Reloading quick saves doesn't always work either because you realize you forgot to equip someone with a medkit, or you need to be more accurate on certain missions and forgot to equip scopes. This game is just a pain.The production values are at least nice with great looking aliens and some decent voice acting, but overall this game requires extreme patience more than skill or brainpower. The game is well done with intense battles, but maps repeat often, the camera is screwy where it zooms out of buildings, and the graphics are a bit underwhelming. The main thing is the extreme difficulty which practically ruins the game. I have never played such a hard strategy game before, but there's someone out there who will like this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}

Playing this game is like playing a mashup of Bioshock and Assassin's Creed. You can either take a full out approach and barrel through by creating more and more chaos in the world of Dunwall or you can be uber patient and sneak your way through the levels.  I have no patience, or not enough because every time I try to be stealthy, I fail miserably.

It takes a special type of player to not only find the creative solutions all the time, but to also do so in a totally non disruptive way to the ideas of the game.  I may not quite be it.  I still enjoy Dishonored since it allows some level of free roaming, and I will work my way through it multiple times since the first playthrough has been more about getting the lay of the land.

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"I ain't afraid of no ghost....honest","reviewText":"In a strange way, I kind of feel sorry for Fear 2: Project Origin and its appeal and recognition. Naturally any game that becomes a massive hit becomes the standard, the true pinnacle of the genre that every other game has to be either like it or it's just disappointing. What Fear 2 does is not reinvent but refine; to get rid of excess, to streamline and to improve on the first game. But naturally people will say despite the graphics, it doesn't hold up to Killzone 2. Multiplayer? Call of Duty IV does it better. So just play Fear 2 on its own merits, its own turf and you'll find a really fun game...in the single player that is.Story: Taking place minutes before the explosion at the end of the first Fear, you play as Michael Becket, a Delta Force officer, who is brought in to put Genevieve Aristide, president of Armatech into protective custody. Only things don't go as planned and the explosion wipes out the Auburn district of the city and you along with other team members have to found out the secrets behind Project Origin, Harbinger and the young girl named Alma Wade.Graphics: It is an oft-made complaint about the first Fear: too many offices. It literally was either hallways, catacombs and sewer areas or warehouses. While graphically it looked best during the big firefights, it wasn't a very diverse game. Fear 2 changes all that with improved graphics all around. Environments are more open-ended with a lot more detail and structural damage compared to the cleanliness of before. Effects from gunfire looks cooler, the spectre and ghost effects look awesome and lighting's been improved. But when you compare it to upcoming Killzone 2 or other known FPS' then it's not as technologically impressive but it certainly works well.Sound/Music: Typically in FPS sound mixes, they go for an all-out assault on the senses. Explosion, gunfire, yelling, bullets whizzing past as you run for cover are frequently found in shooter games. Others however like Bioshock, the Fear games or Monolith's own Condemned series are all about soundscapes and creating a tangible-yet-abnormal world. Weapons have a great kick to them, that satisfying \"AAH!\" when a Replica's killed and the louder setpieces (piloting the Powered Armor, which I'll get to, is intense thanks to sound design), the sound design works incredibly well. Also since it's a horror game we get creepy whispering, atonal dissonance and ambience so this isn't really a \"loud\" game per se but it's certainly an immersive one.Gameplay: Not much as changed from the first Fear. You still control a mute character who has access to a 4 weapon wheel, grenade types and the like. And of course the popular Slo-Mo is back. Pressing Y instead of LB like before will put you in bullet time where you can lay the proverbial smackdown on your foes and seeing thrown grenades wipe out your opponents in half the speed never loses its fun. One suggestion is to play on Hard mode since normal mode is a bit too easy while Hard mode will give players that challenge the first game had (although even then some might say the mode's too easy anyway so go figure).One of the major additions is a few sections where you pilot an Powered Armor and became an all-out enemy killing machine. With powerful missile and cannons available, you become nearly indestructible. I say nearly because if you take too much damage you'll have to eject where the machine will self-repair prompting you to ditch and hopefully find cover if there's enemies around. While it doesn't look like it makes sense in a horror game, the intensity and genuine fun with a capital \"F\" these sequences bring makes them instant highlights. Weaponry is also cool to use from body-melting lasers to flamethrowers and personal favorite Hammerhead which acts like a high-velocity nail gun that can pin enemies to walls. You'll still stick with your trusty Shotgun (not as uber-powerful as before but does the trick) and Assault rifles or Submachine guns but having variety helps spice things up.Multiplayer is becoming one of those weird evils with games nowadays where people will complain if there isn't any then complain that it will feel tacked on or not as better integrated as a Halo or Call of Duty. Fear 2's multiplayer is functional but not really addicting to me personally. Some lag issues, getting booted out of servers, enemy teammates that don't die from full-on gunfire yet a few rounds from the same gun and you're toast and it's one of the few multiplayers that just doesn't feel as balanced to me but some might disagree. The modes are fun such as Blitz which is like Capture the Flag only the flag is a leaking canister that acts like a punctured paint can on a car to Armored Front where a team member gets to ride a powered armor and go after the other team. They're fun modes but spawn points are kind of ridiculous at times and not to constantly compare this to Modern Warfare but I like being TOLD when I level up, reach new ranks and stay in the multiplayer menus. After every match, you're dumped back to the main menu and have to do it all over again as opposed to other games where you stay in multiplayer menus until you quit out. And naturally most of the achievements are in multiplayer so hurray.Now we come to the end and the question becomes...Is Fear 2 scary? Well, sort of. It certainly keeps you on edge thanks to sound design, Alma encounters and new enemies and some levels like the elementary school are downright creepy; however, that being said this isn't like say a Fatal Frame or Silent Hill where you're going to lose sleep. Fear 2 is basically a fun rollercoaster with high-octane firefights and eerie paranormal encounters. It's worth a playthrough but hopefully this won't get buried because Helghast are more popular.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2009"}

This will make a great gym bag.License Plate:  Not as hard as the real license plate, but still sturdy enough to put on your wall or hit somebody with it.Safe Deposit Box(with 2 keys):  I'm very impressed with this item!  I expected some cheap, easy-to-break deposit box, but it is very sturdy and hard to get into.  I wouldn't trust my valuables with it, but its a nice box to use in your room to keep sensitive items away from other eyes.  Somebody with a screwdriver and some time on their hands would be able to pry it open eventually, but still very stylish and modest safe deposit box.RockStar keychain:  3-D letter \"R\" logo of Rockstar, which measues about one square inch.\"The Art of GTA\" handbook:  a very nice cloth hardcover booklet that shows how the game was made.  Very interesting material inside.\"The Music of GTA4\" CD:  16-tracks on this CD that comes with a carboard sleeve.1 Free Month of XBOX Live!  This wasn't listed as part of the offer, so I was surprised to see this.  It is NOT A TRIAL and you can go to your Live account and simply add a month of XBOX Live Gold to your paid time.Bottom Line:  If you are a fan of GTA and have some money to spend, this is definetely worth an extra $30, especially with an extra month of XBOX Live included.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00B3PDHBU","description":"","reviewerName":"Angela Streiff","summary":"The best Turtle Beach headset yet","reviewText":"I've owned a few Turtle Beach headsets over the past few years, and also a few additional headsets from other brands. So my comparisons to features and sound are against my other sets, such as the Turtle Beach Ear Force XP300, Corsair Vengeance 2000, Turtle Beach MW3 Ear Force Bravos and the TRITTON Pro+ 5.1 Surround headphones. Up to this point, my go-to set was always the Turtle Beach Ear Force XP300. Even the Surround Sound of the TRITTON Pro+ series wasn't enough to make me give up my XP300's. They were just an all-around better set. However these XP510's have finally given me a reason to put away my XP300's.Right out of the box I was shocked at how similar looking this XP510 set was to the XP300. Short of the neon green quilting on the head piece, it is almost identical to the XP300. Same weight, size, color, everything. Same cushioning in the top of the head piece. Same comfort for wearing during long gaming sessions. The initial set up is different. Both sets use Bluetooth for their audio. This lets you chat and hear game sounds completely wirelessly. But one big difference between them is the transmitter. With the non-Surround Sound headsets like the XP300 and the MW3 Ear Force Bravos, the transmitter is smaller than a deck of cards. With the surround sound sets, they have a much larger transmitter, similar in size to a wireless router. Also, rather than using AV cables from your TV to your transmitter, you're using a digital optical cable from the transmitter to your PS3/xBox.Where this set really blew me away was the in-game sound. I'm a pretty dedicated COD player (multi-player), and while I play all kinds of other games as well, I've found one can usually get a good idea at how well a set will perform when using it while playing a FPS. I'm familiar with what games like Black Ops 2 sound like in Surround Sound, since I've played it using my TRITTON Pro+ set. I assumed this set might sound similar. To my surprise, I found the XP510 sounds even better. Turtle Beach has done an awesome job of taking all their best features from sets like their XP300, and put it into this XP510, then adding the Surround Sound. While the sound from the TRITTON set was good, it just wasn't great for first person shooter games, like this set is. When playing RPGs or very music oriented games likeJourney, the TRITTON set is great. But within few seconds of the first round of online play, I could tell this set was made for gamers.There are a number of sound presets in this headset, so you can scroll through them to find the best sound for the game you're playing. You go through them by pressing the option buttons on the side of one of the ear cups. The presets vary quite a bit in their settings, so you can easily find one that works well for your game. In addition, if you find you're not a fan of the Surround Sound in some of your games, you can easily turn it off and use this set in stereo.As usual with Turtle Beach, the mic works well and tends to be the clearest of my sets when talking online with others. Because the mic is Bluetooth, you can easily answer calls from your Bluetooth enabled cell phone. There is a dedicated answer phone button on the side of the set for taking calls. However my favorite aspect of the Bluetooth is using my MP3 player with the headset. Often times I like to listen to music from my iPhone or tablet while playing online with this headset. With the Bluetooth turned on, I can sync my phone with the headset, then turn on my music to play in my phone, and it plays both my music and I can hear game sounds at the same time through the headset. This also makes things easy when I have an incoming call. My music shuts off and the game sounds shut off, and with the press of the answer call button on my headset, I'm able to talk to the caller right through the headset, without needing to stop my game (an invaluable feature for those who play live online multi-player games, where there is no such thing as pushing \"pause\").The rechargeable sets are so much more convenient than headsets that require batteries. I can play through multiple several-hour gaming sessions before I need to recharge this set. If you're not using the Bluetooth the whole time or every time, the set lasts many hours longer than the technical specs say it will. When I have the Bluetooth off, the set seems to stay charged forever. There is an auto-off feature as well, so if you forget to turn the set off, it will go off on its own.After using this set for some time now, I realize why I like it so much. When I first compared the XP510 set to my XP300 set, I wondered what would be different about them, since they seemed so much alike. I then realized that its similarities to the XP300 that makes it a great set. The XP300 is an awesome headset, and Turtle Beach took that set and found ways to improve it. The added Surround Sound in this incredible.I would also suggest this set over other Surround Sound sets such as the TRITTON Pro+ for anyone looking to buy a headset for kids, teens, or anyone else who may not enjoy trying to find just the perfect sounds settings with the Surround Sound. Some sets, like the TRITTON Pro+ don't use sound presets. They are designed with a series of button settings that you adjust up and down to control the front, back, center and sub speakers. These are great for those who enjoy being able to adjust every detail of the speaker settings for their gameplay or movie watching. However they aren't as pick-up-and-play friendly as sets like this XP510 are, with built in sound presets. I can spend an hour adjusting every last setting on my TRITTON set, and can't get the sound as perfect as I can with the press of a button on this Turtle Beach set.If you're interested in this headset, but find the price is too steep, I'd suggest checking out theTurtle Beach Ear Force XP300set. It's got most of the great features that this set has, just without the Surround Sound, and at a much lower price. But if you're looking to buy the best of the best, I'd say this XP510 is definitely it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2013"}

The Story is more in-depth, Why are the Jedi the way they are?  Why are the Sith the Way they are?  What does it matter to people stuck in the middle?  The voice acting is excellent and the gameplay is wonderful for the most part. HK-47 also makes an apperence which is always a plus.That part is good.  The rest of the game isn't so goodWhere is all the playful banter from the first one?  Most of what keep me interested in the first one was the bickering between Canderous Odo and Jooli Binjo .What good is an influence system when the chances to use it are few and far between?30 Hours of Gameplay????????  I mean yes I bought the game at 19.99 but 30 hours in Knights of the Old Republic 1 I had just made it off Taris.  Why cut out half the game for early holiday release if it was only going to lead to unstable product with large plot holes?For example `m not going to raise the Telos fuel supply issue because that's been dealt with but if you go dark something funny happens.  When you as Hanharr kill Mira the next cutscean you see is Kira giving Hanharr the same lecture as she did had you decided to go dark.  Would it have been to much to ask that they try to cover up glaring idiocy like this?  What's a gamer supposed to do?  Not notice these things?  Now Lucas Arts is not only robbing me they are insulting my intelligence.Overall-I don't have a problem with the game itself I have a problem with the way it was marketed and managed.

{"product_name":"B00027CXEM","reviewerName":"H. Le","summary":"Great sequel - if one can either look past the story or look deeper into it.","reviewText":"In retrospect, Osidian did a very good job with this game (compare to Neverwinter Nights 2 - which was rushed big time for Xmas delivery). True, KOTOR 1 has a better, more epic plot.  But then again, if you have played KOTOR 1, you'd probably agree that not even Lucas himself can ever top a story like that.In its own right, however, Osidian deserve much credit for an interesting story of their own in KOTOR 2. The story is now more personal, and it takes the morality issues of the light and dark sides thing to a whole new different level that is far beyond any Star Wars movie or books out there - probably too deep that, for some people, actually takes lot of fun out of the game.As for me, I found the character of Kreia to be one of the most complex characters in any story.  For those of you who haven't play the game, Kreia is the mysterious jedi-like figure that you meet very early in the game.  And I don't think I'll give any plot away by saying that almost immediately, you know that she is not one of the good guy, but rather one of the bad guys who's simply on your side. The only thing I'll add here (spoiler alert - maybe)is that she was a Jedi who has fallen from the light side, and eventually, fallen from the dark side as well; she has fallen so deep that she almost remind me of Mr. Kirk in Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\" (or Colonel Kirk in Apocalypse Now - if you prefer that version instead. Really, I could not help but feel like Mallow pursuing Kirk rather than an outcast Jedi going after Kreia).  Therefore, the story, at least for me, is all about the anticipation that leads up to the final confrontation with Kreia; everything else is mere subplots (end spoiler).I figure this out early in the game so the story is excellent for me.  Otherwise, all I'd do is wandering around the planet systems doing menial tasks - and this is why some people find the game to have dumb plot.Other than that, the gameplay is very similar with KOTOR 1.  Combat is fun, especially with light sabers and force powers.  Music, sound, and voice acting is great.  Those who played KOTOR 1 will immediately feel at home with the UI.  My gripes: The new feature where you can craft items (why  Obsidian loves this feature so much I have no idea) is rather useless.  Beside light sabers, it's not much use to craft anything else that you can get by either buy or beat up someone - because chances are, in the first place,  you still have to buy or beat up someone to get the parts that you need to craft any item. Romances are poorly attempted. Either do a job that is on par with KOTOR 1 (or other Bioware games) or don't do it at all. (Spoiler alert)Also, the great scene where all the Jedi Masters are present to judge you - I'd love to get the option to fight them before Kreia can step in (end spoiler).Other than these mionor issues, KOTOR 2 is good sequel and an excellent game in its own right.  In fact, the KOTOR series is one of the best games out there whether you are a Star Wars fan not. Higly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0065NP39E","description":"","reviewerName":"Nishi","summary":"Definite Buy, even at 60 dollars.","reviewText":"This game takes what made Fallout 3 great and makes it even better. While the main story doesn't have as much going for it as F3, it still brings you along. I really enjoyed playing through this game many different times and I think I have clocked more hours on this game than I have on Fallout 3. Majority of this review will be talking about this games improvements over New Vegas.Gameplay wise this game Improves on a TON, including Iron sights, Better Perks, Better starting area, More and better sides Quests, Tons of locations and more. The map itself is smaller, but its packed in with tons of fast travel areas that have a bunch of things to explore and most have a building or two to go through and isn't just like a park or something.Hardcore mode really vamps up the game by making you have to focus on eating, drinking, sleeping and taking care of broke limbs. My initial playthrough of the game I didn't bother using Hardcore mode since I felt like it didn't really add anything to the game, but it really does. Now that I'm replaying the game it makes it feel much more involved and makes you feel like your living off the land, without it becoming too much micro managing that it gets annoying. Definitely my go to mode in Fallout 4 at the start if they decided to feature it.Sound track still has the main theme from 3 with some minor stuff added. What really changes the music is the newly added radio stations and there's more than two this time. Also at New Vegas you have singers doing a gig and some of the songs are really cool, with my favorite being Home on the Wastes (Really recommend looking up the song on youtube or looking up the ultimate edition trailer). The DLC add some radio stations, but its just a message telling you to go to X area.Ultimate edition includes the following DLC (All add 5 levels, with a max level of 50):Dead Money - which is about you going to the Serra Madre casino and someone taking you captive and taking all your stuff away from you (You get it back at the end). You have to find people and survive in an area that has harder enemies and Hardcore Mode takes away health from you the entire time your there. You also can't sleep.Honest Hearts - This DLC has you heading to Zion National Park and it feels like its one of the very few untouched locations in the wastes and actually looks amazing. Tons of materials, weapons and enemies to fight here as well. The perks that get added that you can pick while you level up actually help on the main game itself while also affecting the enemies in Zion. The backstory on the Mystery character is really awesome to find out and helps pace the way through the next DLCS.Old World Blues - Kindof of a mix of crazy 50's style inventions with the humor of Mystery science theater thrown into a world with crazy powerful enemies gives an idea what this DLC is. The story part of it is your get your brain stolen and you have to get it back while getting the story on what happened here learning more about the characters. Hardcore just makes the enemies even more harder since they can easily break your limbs even more so than the Mojave desert enemies.Lonesome Road - A DLC I was waiting for the longest time to play when they first started releasing DLC's. This concludes a Big side story that ties into the main game (With adverse effects as well, depending on your choices) and has you going after a certain character that you learn about throughout the game. Enmies here hit the hardest out of all the DLC's and can make hardcore a pain if your not the right level or not prepared. Has one of the greatest endings for a DLC I have played in a long time.Gun Runner Arsenal - Just adds a bunch of new weapons, mods, challenges (One of them called \" Would you Kindly?\", to give you an idea) , ammo and a perk that you get while leveling up. The vendors have a chance to start selling these new items right at the start of the game and the Chainsaw helps new hardcore melee character builds. The new stuff has (GNR) added to the Name of the items.With all of these and the main game itself this game is so worth the asking price. I have lost hundreds of hours to this game and even find myself playing through it again from time to time since so much can change playthough to playthough. It was recently on sale for like 5 dollars on steam during the summer sale, so if your iffy on getting it you could wait. Either way its worth it for every person who likes an in-depth RPG or just a light shooter with RPG elements that will give you hundreds of hours throughout the experience.~ Vaultnishi. 08-13","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J998","description":"","reviewerName":"F. B","summary":"Rest assured xbox 360 owners, Mortal Kombat is fantastic!","reviewText":"I have just finished the story mode and have spent about 10 hours with the game, it is fantastic so far!  More to come soon...  I mainly wanted to get this up quickly because of the one star reviews popping up so early complaining about the xbox 360 version.  NOTHING is wrong or off about the xbox 360 version, it is fast, graphics are great, and no hiccups.  I am completely satisfied with this purchase thus far.***Official Review***(04/25/11)Mortal Kombat, what can I say, it's a great fighting game.  I've never been much of a fighting game type of gamer but I have had my xbox 360 for about 4 years now and don't have a fighting game in my inventory, so it was about time I got one.I have childhood memories of watching a MK game go down at the local movie theater arcade, Cyrax shooting out his green net making his opponent an easy target, then I saw, \"Finish Him\" and a fatality took place, it blew my mind.  Naturally, I was a bit intrigued when I first heard they were taking MK back to its roots with a 2D set up focusing on MK1-MK3.  More and more videos came out and the moves, characters, backgrounds, extras all looked fantastic so I stop reading up on the game because I knew I was going to buy it, and here we are.I did get suckered into thinking Ed Boon had a treat for xbox 360 players from his interview with GiantBomb.com (fantastic gaming site by the way) with a new character and/or background, which he hasn't delivered on, but alas, the game is amazing, so good in fact that chances are you won't miss an additional character.The single player is huge in this game.  The story mode alone took me about 10 hours from start to finish (2 nice unlocks upon completion).  It's done in such a way that creates a seamless fighting experience.  You're watching an in-game cinematic and when the fight is about to start the camera zooms back and viola, the fight begins, once that fight is over, the camera angle changes and the story continues, seamlessly.  Once you're done with the story mode you can play the traditional arcade format where you move up the ladder of fighters until you fight the boss, or you can practice different fatalities, or just practice against a dummy opponent in practice mode.  There is Test your Might, Test your Sight, and Test your Luck.  If that wasn't enough, there is also tower to climb consisting of 300 stages!  (apparently it's worth it to beat stage 300, something \"special\" happens)  I'm on stage 62 and the difficulty seems to be a bit sporadic.  For example, stage 44 is harder then stage 57.  And yes, some of the stage's are downright annoying and not fun, like fighting an over powered scorpion that can dish out damage to you whenever he wants, but you only do damage to him while he's under a spot light that rotates around the map!!!  Or like fighting Liu Kang who has normal stats but every time you hit him your hit damage decreases by 5%, etc.  Completing all of the single player events will help you earn special koins which you can use to unlock things from the Krypt, most valuable things being additional fatalities and alternate costumes.  Every character seems to get two fatalities and two different costumes.I have only tried online play a couple of times.  The `King of the Hill' mode seems to be the most popular amongst players.  It's a pretty cool set up.  You enter a lobby and it's set up movie theater style where everyone waiting to fight watches the current two fighters duke it out.  Once the fight is over you can give the winner of the fight a rating from 1-10.  I know these ratings add up to an overall score for the fighter, but I'm not sure if there are unlocks associated with it or not, or if it's just bragging rights.Anyways, you get the idea, it's a good fighting game, pick this bad boy up!***(05/04/11)A Heads Up Regarding the Challenge Tower***I have beat the 300 level challenge tower by actually playing the various stages and paying (via Kombat Koins) my way through others.  It was an awesome idea to allow the player to actually pay their way through if they wanted because it does get tedious and not that fun quickly, so that was a great design decision.  What was not a great design decision was what you get when you complete the 300th stage, very very lame.  It was mouth dropping in lameness.  I'm not gonna spoil it for you, but believe me, it is not worth going through the 300 stages.  If you are attempting the 300 stages because you're enjoying the variety each one offers then by all means have fun, but if your'e grinding through just to get the surprise at the end, don't bother, it sucks.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2011"}

Afro has set out to try and avenge his father's murder by a man named Justice. Justice murdered Afro's father to claim the 'Number One' headband, giving himself the chance to rule the worldAfro Samurai is based on the popular and stylistic anime of the same name.View larger.with powers akin to a god. The only one allowed to challenge Number One is the person with the 'Number Two' headband, but unfortunately for Afro, the current owner of the headband, anybody and everybody can, and does, challenge Number Two. But never fear, as this new title includes brand new material and background for fans of the series and newcomers alike to enjoy.Loads of Stylized ActionAfro Samurai brings gamers a balanced experienced, with stylistic combat and acrobatic platforming combined with the ability to dynamically slice and dismember enemies in unending ways. While gamers can hack and slash their way through many foes by combining heavy and light attacks with just two buttons, accomplished players will master moves like the Deep Throat Killer, where they pierce their opponent's neck and rip everything loose in a crimson splash.Players will also need to learn the Focus maneuver with its bullet-time effect. This allows the user to slow down time and designate a specific strike zone, which with the right timing and skill can allow Afro to cleave an enemy in two or slice a limb completely off. And since characters are not pre-rendered you don't just get a canned scene when you cut through your enemy, giving you endless ways and means to cut your enemies down to size. This ethos is applied game-wide, as Afro is allowed to interact with anything and everything in his environment to help him on his journey.Star-Studded Supporting CastSamuel L. Jackson reprises his role as both Afro and Ninja in the game, and the same striking art style that made the anime series so popular provides the unique look and feel across beautifully animated open environments. And for those of you who are wondering, developers Namco Bandai let Jackson ad-lib a lot, so be prepared for his branded vulgarity and the M rating it helps the game earn.Meanwhile, Ron Pearlman and Kelly Hu continue on in their roles as Justice and Okiku, while RZA of Wu-Tang Clan fame has created all new tracks for the hip-hop inspired soundtrack. And thanks to an innovative gameplay system, the enemy AI and tone of the game are affected by the beat of the musical score, for a truly immersing experience.With its visual stunning graphics, and fluid and graceful movements, Afro Samurai will provide hours of entertaining, balletic action. Add to this ground-breaking elements like health that is represented by the blood on your clothes, or your enemies', and you have a game that simply can not be passed up.Slice and dice your enemies in a glorious number of different ways.","reviewerName":"Viper","summary":"Bloody, mindless, fun","reviewText":"If your looking for a hack and slash Kill Bill simulator and are worn out from Ninja Gaiden 2, then you've came to the right place. This game isn't groundbreaking but it's very fun and although I never saw the TV show, I had a good time with it. The graphics very much resemble an anime and don't try to be cutting edge. If your looking for cutting edge graphics, look else where. The gameplay is very fun, I have to say I enjoyed hacking through dozens sometimes hundreds of enemies at once. I felt like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. Lastly parents, do not buy this for your kids. This is truely an M-rated game on par with Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row. There is bloody violence, limbs hacked off, bodies chopped in half sometimes with internal organs exposed, constant profanity(of course if your kid goes to public school, they probably hear this language already), sexual references, and nude strippers and prostitutes.

However, I understand the bad reviews when it comes to the installation. Even though I had Windows Live for years I still had a hard time signing in and getting everything straight. I had to register for the social club although I have no intention on using it, I then had to register for Xbox Live for some reason I really don't care about. Then I kept getting asked to do this gamer tag thing. All I want to do is play the game on my own so I wish these programs were optional.It takes a few minutes to get the game running because I have to log in to Social club, but I guess it's no different than having to sign in on an MMO. However, exiting the game takes forever! I click quit and the screen goes black and takes several minutes before the game finally shuts off completely and I have my computer back. With the installation, never ending registrations to stuff I don't care about, the log in and long log outs aside. Once I actually get in the game to play it's nothing but a fun ride, the graphics are great, everything feels realistic. I'm using an Xbox 360 controller so it's hard for me to make Nico run or walk without him zigzagging all over the place, which is extremely annoying. Maybe I can get in options and do something about that. otherwise it's a really great game, but the installation is a pain in the rear even when you have Windows Live.

The combat system is flawed. I wouldn't have even really noticed it except that it showed itself about half way through the game, right after you leave New York. it only showed itself for one chapter and then it was gone but it lasted just long enough for me to never enjoy combat as much as I did before. What was the flaw you ask? It doesn't work in close quarters combat. When you have 3 mechs pounding away at you on a narrow cliff and you can't get away then the game stops being fun. I died so many times in this one spot that I gave up and tried again later. This only happens in that ONE CHAPTER but it was enough to slightly stain the combat for the rest of the game though. Combat in general though is fun if not simplistic however this makes it easier to enjoy the other parts of the game and not think about the combat all the time.I liked the platforming but is was also a bit simplistic. Think Uncharted and not Prince of Persia. It's incredibly easy and I never had trouble with it. It got a little more involved in the last two chapters but for the most part you don't have many timed jumps to deal with.The rest of the game is perfect. The story, graphics, voice acting and everything else is just top notch. There are chase scenes both chasing and being chased which i thought was cool. no quick time events THANK GOD! Fun boss battles and not too many of them, just enough the satisfy. I loved the cloud(think hoverboard from Jak2) sections, they really showed off the beautiful environments. The ending was great, I won't spoil it for you but it's not at all what I expected and it was trippy as hell!TIP to avoid this unpleasant experience I had...Level up your stun blast so that it affects multiple enemies' as soon as possible.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

Not for RPG fans from ME1...","reviewText":"Many reviewers have already said it... THIS GAME IS LACKING when compared to Mass Effect 1. They have taken nearly all the RPG, exploration, and story elements out and replaced them with the bone standard 3rd person shooter fare. Sure you can, mostly, choose where you go, but every level is very linear, (a.k.a. Point a to point b only.)There are only 3 or so guns in the 4 or 5 categories for weapons, no more grenades, no more crouching, no more unlimited ammo, no more Mako (before you cheer, realize they replaced the Mako with a uninvolved planet scanning mini-game, that feels more like watching grass grow than a game.), no more inventory, no more massive levels, no more planet exploration, no main bad guy, no more awesome movie like ending credits and feel.I could rant on and on about this game and why it is not as good as the first Mass Effect, but I wont.To sum it up... This game is just not as EPIC and massive as the first Mass Effect felt. I mean it is very fun, but it is very forgettable like so many other 3rd person shooters.It was honestly disappointing to me... Imagine playing an awesome game, and not wanting it to end... And right when you get to what you FEEL is just the half-way point... The ending credits roll and it's over!It just feels like the typical EA game... Rushed to release, half finished, to make profits... Expect the third Mass Effect to be even worse, because EA has already set a release date, and the script hasn't even been written yet!It is fun... But just not EPIC.Hopefully Bioware will release some fallout 3 sized expansions or DLC to fix the problems people are having with how short and small the game seems, because when it was in development, there was supposed to be so much more content in it.Check out some of the reviews in the collectors edition page here.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2010"}

But, it isn't a game for everyone. Someone who want's to break out the heavy artillery and hack away from point A to point B, will likely be dissapointed. Granted, you can do that in Oblivion, but it isn't akin to say, Diablo.This is a game for someone who doesn't mind actually spending hours hunting deer for their meat, and using it in your potions. That's how immersive this game can be. You can literally spend hours doing nothing and have a blast.Harvesting ingredients for potions, exploring caves and dungeons, go diving to hunt for treasure, all the while not touch a single quest whatsoever. But when you are ready to give yourself some direction, the sheer amount of quests, miscellanous quests, and main story quests are staggering. I've spent 40 hours on this game and have only barely touched the main storyline.Combat in Oblivion is fun. I remember playing Morrowind very briefly, the combat relied on a dice roll and was very stilted. I played Morrowwind for all of a day and uninstalled it. COmbat has changed in Oblivion for the better,it's basically a first person shooter, with swords and shields. It may not sound great on paper, but it's implementaion is immersive and works really well. You attack with left click and block with right click, a very intuative system that other RPG's could follow. Something I thought neverwinter nights could benefit from that would have given it some interaction, instead of click, attack, click, run, click click click. The swords, maces, axes and bows are all very well modeled and depending on the magic affects that you can create in spell shops, theyll glow accordingly. You raise your skills by actually doing the things youre trying to raise, like you raise your skill with a blade when you use a blade, and skill with block when you use block.The world is immersive, the characters engaging, the combat system great. But it has some flaws that can be jarring and slap you out of the whole experience. For one, there are literally about 10 actor voices in the entire game. Every NPC speaks, so do the math, 10 voices for literally hundreds of different characters gets extremely monotomous. The main quest characters are voiced by known actors so that's not so bad, but if I hear that annoying british guy's accent one more time im gonna go crazy. He voices literally every charatcer in the game with the SAME voice.Secondly, as huge and as lifelike as it tries to be, little inconsistancies can be harsh. For example, I killed a beggar in the middle of the street where there was no one watching. A few seconds later someone comes around the corner and literally passes right over the guy's body, and they say narry a word but \"Good day to you\". There's a dead body on the road and they dont even give it a second glance. Also, days will go by and you'll come back and he'll still be there in the exact same postion. No decay, he's not moved, nothing. You'd think after a few days they would have moved the body and disposed of it or at the very least, some decay would happen.Most of the NPC's have sleep/work cycles, which is nice. They dont just stand with STARE syndrome, like they are seemingly awaiting for your arrival. They do things like go to work, come home, eat, sleep. That's nice but some things with that are a bit unrefined. FOr example, all of them sleep with their day clothes on, and you know this because NONE of them get under the covers. I know that may have required a little extra programming perhaps, but at the very least there could have been a \"covered bed\" state, and an \"uncovered state\". It seems like nagging, but once you really get into the game and expeirence everything firsthand,little things like that take away from it.Also, the NPC's are very stilted. Meaning you can tell they are just computer pieces following their programming instead of life-like characters going about their daily duties. NPC's will interact with other NPC's but will say the same thing they said to a previous NPC. They'll shoot the breeze about odd things, and go up to random people that they wouldnt converse with in real life.It seems like a lot of nagging about something that's already great, but when you play the game and that comes about, you think what could have been and how great it would be. To have a real living and breathing world where you are truly apart of. It's still better than most things out there, and interaction between people serves it's purpose, but when you get to the 50th person who acts and behaves virtually the same as the last, you'll be wishing the same thing too.Another issue which isn't about the game, but the power that is required to run it. You will not be able to run this on a midrange PC. I have two computers with 3 ghz processors, one 512 RAM, the other 2 gigs, and both cant run the game at all. The graphics card on both are midrange and run games like  guild wars and unreal perfectly, but this game you can barely create your character, the mouse barely moves. Say if youre a parent buying this for your kid you have no idea about system specs and what not, most would expect that the game would atleast run on low settings, but they dont. You need a high powered video card to run this. I have a 6800 Ultra and the game runs great, but even then the framerate isnt as high as unreal and guild wars. Granted Oblivion is a much more demanding game graphically, but like i said you should ATLEAST be able to run it on LOW settings.Bottomline is, if you have the computer to run this game, you will NOT be dissapointed. This is an engaging game, the best I've played in years. When we see Elder Scrolls 5 and 6, I think we'll see some of the most immersive games ever.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2006"}

I remember hearing about 6 months ago hearing about how the new soulcalibur would have Darth Vader(the ps3 version anyway) I was convinced I had to get a PS3 from that moment on.  It was a difficult hunt since supplies were limited (not as limited as the Wii thankfully) but I got my hands on a PS3.  Then I played the waiting game.  I got several cool PS3 games but all the while I was waiting for the big day to come.  Well, now it has arrived.Getting to the actual game, I think it was quite worth the wait.  The core gameplay really hasn't changed too much but I enjoy the tweaks like armor damage where you can shred your opponents gear until they are standing in nothing but their skivvies.  A major new element is the inclusion of skills, abilities that make your character stronger.  But the real heart of the game lies in the customization.  Being able to tweak the abilities and appearance of the main characters is quite fun.  You can develop different builds.  For instance you can make a Power Mitsurugi or an Impact Mitsurugi etc. etc.  Probably the only thing I didn't like was that there was no rpg type mode in this game like 3 had.  That might have been my favorite part of that game.All in all I think this is a great game and it kicks butt.P.S. Darth Vader kicks butt, too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2008"}

Although the PlayStation is no longer the fastest machine on the market, it does boast the broadest selection of software. Some of the hottest console games available today are created exclusively for the PlayStation, including several modern-day video gaming classics (Metal Gear SolidandCrash Bandicootto name a few).The Sony PlayStation truly shines with 3D-rendered action games, such asTomb RaiderandSyphon Filter. These and other 3D-based titles place players in the middle of elaborate gaming environments that take full advantage of the system's ability to render up to 360,000 polygons per second. The PlayStation also has the capability to display 16.8 million colors simultaneously and can support full-frame video playback at 30 frames per second. In addition to impressive graphics, the PlayStation also offers CD-quality sound. Each PlayStation disc has the capacity to store up to 650 MB of data--significantly more information than can be stored on cartridge-based games. As an added bonus, the PlayStation will even play your favorite music CDs (accompanied by a selection of cool graphics).Additionally, the PlayStation now comes packed with Sony's impressive dual shock controller, which allows players to feel every punch, kick, and rumble during gameplay. The controller features dual-analog thumb joysticks and round rubber grips for improved game control and comfort. Separate accessories that could enhance the PlayStation experience include an additional controller--allowing two-player action--and a memory card so players can save their progress in a game.--Brett Atwood","reviewerName":"\"neomurtle\"","summary":"Great games, durable controllers...but it overheats!","reviewText":"I wrote this review to educate all of the hardcore gamers out there...especially those who love long RPGs.  Don't get me wrong, the Playstation has a lot of great games, and the the controllers are quite durable and well designed.  The problem with the Playstation lies within it's hardware.  If you play games a lot (especially role playing games), be ready to invest in a new Playstation about every 7-8 months.  I use my Playstation about 1 hour a day...sometimes more when playing through a role playing game, and I've had to go through 3 Playstations in the past couple of years.  There are several factors that contribute to the breaking down of the Playstation.  Overheating, the track wearing out, and the CD chuck under the lid that falls apart after a while.  The overheating problem can be aleviated by investing in a cooling fan, but there is not much else you can do for the other problems. Typical signs of overuse include skipping, longer load times, and freezing. Don't bother turning the system on it's side or upside down, doing so will only further ruin the Playstation and your disc and is probably also a fire hazard. My only advice is keep your Playstation out of hot places, away from lots of electronic equipment, do not put it on top of a VCR, and always unplug it after use (the AC adapter device is internal, therefore causing the system to heat up even when not in use if you do not unplug it). Hopefully Sony will learn from this and the Playstation 2 will be a lot more durable.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2001"}

I am able to run the game on max settings, my high/low fps are 77/42. You should be able to compare my system to yours and get an idea on what to expect.The graphics are comparable with WoW on max settings and the interface is similar. If you have played WoW, Rift or Warhammer you should not have any difficulty adjusting. The graphical detail of the Star Wars universe is impressive and I have enjoyed walking around to check things out.The gameplay can be summed up as WoW with lightsabers with some interesting twist. First, all NPC characters are dialog rather than text and you can choose what you say during the dialog.  This is an interesting because you are rewarded with light or dark side points depending on your options. Not sure how this will play out in the long run, but the dialog is a step forward for MMORPG.  The other thing that stands out is you can have a crew of NPCs. You can choose to use them as companions or they can farm/sell items while you do something else. The feature I like the most are the in-game maps,questing is much easier to follow.In the end, I am enjoying the game. I think this game has the potential to make a huge splash in the market. However, at this point it is 75% the same MMORPG format and about 25% innovation. The game is in its infancy and I hope future patches and expansions will up the innovation.  If you are a Star Wars fan like I am and have the system to support the game, purchasing is a no brainer. It really does add to the expanded universe.I will update my review in the near future with more details but I wanted to get some basic information out to everyone before launch.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"really misses the mark in several areas","reviewText":"Update- July 21, 2013I'm playing this game again after many years and oh my, what a big disappointment.  It doesn't hold up at all!  A big name Zelda title is supposed to be the greatest day next to Christmas.  Wind Waker admittedly does a lot of things right but the trade off is that it does WAY more things wrong.  Where to begin with this mess...Let's begin with the dungeons.  All of them are boring and colorless in appearance, unnecessarily overlong and confusing to figure out.  It's not like in the 2D Zelda games where sword cutting action is combined with creative puzzles- THESE dungeons are 80% puzzles and 20% action.  Having to run through gigantic nearly-empty rooms with eerie music in the background doesn't qualify as epic either.  Nice try Nintendo.  The two dungeons that are most unforgivable are the water dungeon (Tower of the Gods) and the one that involves having to babysit... er, team up with a female bird lady character named Medli and help her through the dungeon (Earth Temple).  Even though Link and Medli work together, it still feels more like babysitting.  While the dungeon puzzles are honestly thought-provoking and you will feel a great sense of accomplishment upon figuring them out, these two dungeons are the reason I'm not going back to this game ever again.  Do you *really* want to persevere this kind of torture again?  These aren't the kind of puzzles you ever desire to repeat.  Not when they take forever just to get through.  Even if you were to attempt a speedrun through these dungeons, the tedious nature of grinding through puzzle after puzzle assures you won't be speedrunning at a pace you'd prefer.The water dungeon is probably the worse of the two, but then again, maybe not.  I wasn't stuck on it nearly as long as the Earth Temple but on the other hand, the obstacles I faced were probably a lot worse.  The best way to describe the dungeon is like this- the first half is occupied with flooded rooms where the water raises and lowers approximately every 10-15 seconds, and the second half is all about a series of tedious statue-pushing puzzles.  When I say the water goes up and down I mean exactly that- you have to *wait* for the water to rise or lower because Link will then be able to swim to a platform or room within reach.  This is all totally required on the part of the player if you actually want to complete the dungeon and of course, that's why you're playing the game.  You *have* to deal with the moving waters.  In one unbelievably horrific room, you have to light a torch and jump across a series of perfectly lined up crates floating on top of the water.  Oh but that's not all.  If you miss you'll jump in the water, which means your flame will go out and you'll have to re-light the torch and attempt to move across the crates once again.  And you have to line up the crates when the water temporarily recedes so there's a proper and accurate path for Link's jumping.  If not for Ocarina of Time's water dungeon, this would unquestionably be a STRONG contender for the worst dungeon ever made.The other dungeon I mention involves the female bird lady character (Medli) where you have to do a series of tedious tasks that involve lifting her up and carrying her around or she'll get stuck behind.  She's also often needed to pick up and fly around Link to high or faraway platforms/places, and the main theme seems to be taking your shield (or Medli's shield) and reflecting the light that shines through ceiling or wall cracks in order to break open more passageways, chests or secrets, giving you access to the next area.  Your shield is basically used as a weapon in these instances.  At first it seems creative but you have to do this same task over and OVER again, and since each room serves more as overlong puzzles, you'll be stuck in this castle for hours.  I guarantee it.  Wouldn't be so bad if the enemies (such as those high-pitched screaming skeletons that freeze Link in place) were more abundant instead of scarce.  The one thing that REALLY annoys me is that you have to play \"melody commands\" to activate Medli a certain way.  You have to do this so many times, not just here but throughout the game, that it totally overstays its welcome after a while.  It's out of place in a Zelda game.  Just because Link played the flute in the 2D games does NOT give Nintendo the right to stretch out this unbearable mini musical story for all its worth in the sequels.  Overdone, boring and unnecessary.  In the Wind Temple, you have to guide a little mechanical propeller-lifting chicken-like thing called Makar (at least, it *looks* like a skinned chicken don't you think?) to higher areas/platforms to activate blocks and other things.  The fun wears thin when the realization that you have to do this same task over and over creeps in.  A poor attempt at designing dungeons Nintendo.  Shame on you.You already know the next problem I'm going to mention since it's been said a thousand times by now.  The actual sailing to get from one island to another takes forever with little in the way of doing anything interesting along the way.  The sail boat moves incredibly slow, and even though sometimes you might talk to a helpful fish for advice and discover treasure chests full of rupees, trifocre charts/shards or heart container pieces along the way (and even a boring rupee-collecting mini game involving a boat race later on) none of these things make up for the tediousness of waiting... and waiting... and falling asleep!  and waiting some more, until your boat arrives to your destination.  Ugh.  You can control the boat anywhere you want but it's not like there's a whole lot to do.  I realize a lot of people dislike the bird flying in Skyward Sword because it takes a while to arrive to your desired island in that game as well, but at least it's more heroic, soaring and adventurous watching Link riding a bird and closing in on an approaching island.  Here... with a sail boat... it just doesn't deliver the same kind of excitement.  Though granted, the peaceful serenity of the nighttime sailing is pretty cool especially when you glance at the moon and stars above, and I even like when danger occasionally occurs (such as swarming sharks and cannonballs later on) because it adds a bit of suspense.  I mean you're on a mere sail boat and here comes danger!  This isn't as threatening of a situation as you might be thinking, however.Several of the errands you do in town are so bad it makes me crings just thinking about them.  Having to snap photos of a man and woman when they're together or when a man is putting mail in the town mailbox?  REALLY annoying.  Starting up a ferris wheel?  Delivering love letters to characters who don't even deserve to be loved?  Chasing school children in a hide and seek game so you can impress the school teacher who's nothing but a snotty high and mighty, unappreciative nobody?  She only cares about money and being glamorous and is someone that in reality I'd avoid like the plague!  The picture rearranging games you sometimes discover on the walls of one or two rooms are really annoying too and not worth the reward for completing them (50 rupees if I remember).  There's a few other instances of errand-related annoyances, some of which are requirements.  The one where you have to crawl through a series of crawl spaces in maze-like fashion is confusing since every room looks exactly the same but thankfully this area is short, and the other one where you have to figure out which doors with a flame above them leads to your prize at the end feels like yet another waste of time but, again, it's short.On the flipside, I can name three mini games that are awesome.  The auction bidding is the most noticeable one.  It's fairly realistic and pretty fun too, especially the tension you feel after you make a high bid and you nervously count down the seconds anticipating if anyone's going to top your bid.  The battleship mini game is really fun.  I could probably spend 30-45 minutes on this game alone.  The guy in charge of the battleship game is the worst human being I've ever seen in a Zelda game.  Completely unfunny.  And the leaf parachute game where the object is to float across the water and strategically use the tornadoes to elevate your height so you can reach the finish line is the best of the bunch.  These are really entertaining games.The boss fights are alright though most of them are quite easy to take down.  In fact other than Ganon, they're *all* easy to take down.  Maybe the strategies were fairly complex back in 2003, but these bosses are too simplistic and boring these days.  The one where you have to battle a gigantic bird on a rooftop is WAY too reminiscent of the Ridley fight from Metroid Prime.  Even his attack and flying patterns are similar.  The only difference is that you're using a sword instead of an arm cannon obviously since this is a Zelda game.  Ganon's first battle at the end of the game is basically a 3 dimensional version of the Moldorm worm from Link to the Past but a much faster and harder way of damaging.  This part of the fight offensively requires luck to defeat- just hope you'll be standing near Ganon's weak point ready to strike when he speeds by.  A final boss fight should always be strategic instead of lucky.  The cel-shading graphics were the topic of conversation back in the day but now they look sort of dark, uninteresting and overbearingly cutesy.  Link and Zelda have ugly eyes and heads, and their bodies aren't pretty either.  Some of the characters such as the pirate named Miss Tetra are really awesome, but fail in comparison to the greater variety and diversity that Link to the Past and Skyward Sword's character selection presents.  The Miss Tetra storyline takes a drastic horrible turn later on when... ugh.  I can't spoil it.  All potential pertaining to the pirate storyline falls apart once *this* happens.The enemy combat usually consists of being able to walk up to most armored guards/blob creatures (and a few others) and slash them to death with your sword.  Some of them require the leaf, bow and arrow or bombs to destroy however.  Even though dealing with them is really easy, we can't overlook that it's also *really* darn fun.  Usually the guards (Darknuts) don't pose much of a threat, but sometimes you will have to prepare to move Link out of the way of a lunging sword attack.  This is usually in the later half of the game.  It gets especially dangerous when there's 3 or more Darknuts on screen.  You may have to execute some stellar sword trickery to escape.  I LOVE that one super spin attack that enables Link to spin around with his sword like a hurricane for 10 seconds and basically eliminate a room full of problems, or at the very least severely damage everything in sight.  It's awesome.  Like I say above, the melody (button) commands are awful due to this being a requirement WAY too often.  You HAVE to do this in order to change the direction of the wind so your sail boat can reach the island of your choice.  Having to frequently command a melody to steer your sail boat to another direction/location gets boring after a while, and as I say above, doing it in the castles gets especially tiresome and reduntant.I like some of the items and weapons Link uses.  The rope is a nifty way of swinging across branches to reach high or faraway areas, and the leaf parachute offers a similar function.  I LOVE the impactful beauty and effects of launching ice and fire arrows at a target as well.  The bow and arrow is a dangerous weapon as you'd expect since it's Zelda where the bow and arrow has always been crucial for survival.  This weapon is especially helpful and frequent in Wind Waker it seems.  These items and weapons really bring out the adventurous surroundings.  The game is overall very generous with the rupees as well.  You'll be collecting them by the bucket load.  They have yellow and purple rupees which adds up your amount rather fast.  Silver rupees hidden in chests under the water can reward you with 200 rupees, and orange rupees give 100.  Red rupees are back (worth 20).  Blue and green ones too.  Insanely generous.  Unless you haven't been collecting them, you'll probably have close to 5,000 by the final dungeon.  The swinging of the sword flows remarkably well.  There's no confusion in how you want to attack an enemy either.  Your sword won't ever let you down in the heat of a battle, nor will Link's movements.  The game encourages you to walk right up to enemies and slice 'em up.  If you don't, well, they seem to back off and wander around the room for a while giving you plenty of time to make preparations for another attack.  Simply put, enemies usually aren't as relentless as YOU are which may be a good thing since it means the game is hardly ever overly difficult.What I HATE however is the overlong fetch quest concerning the triforce shards and the charts.  You have to find BOTH the charts and the shards in the open water which can take several hours of searching.  You'll be sailing around for a while, but an even bigger problem is that it's unnecessary to even *have* such a quest after all the hours of boat sailing that has already taken place by this point.  This entire quest is overkill and I despise it.  I'm not too crazy about having to re-fight the bosses again at the end of the game either.  This time the colors on screen change to black and white perhaps a way to make the adventure feel more intense, and when you land the final blow you're simply transported back to the dungeon to take on the next boss.  It's... strange to say the least.  There's no feeling of satisfaction when you defeat them once again.  Then again, like I say above, there's no feeling of satisfaction anyway due to the bosses being easy overall.  Though I suppose it works in a \"reminiscing over previous encounters\" kind of way which illustrates how far Link has come since his sister went missing/introduction of Miss Tetra near the beginning.Wind Waker encourages more exploring than sword combat, so be prepared to spend more time exploring for items and treasures and less time fighting.  This means exploring many and I mean MANY empty islands with nothing but grass, high cliffs and trees everywhere.  Many of these islands contain caves or holes where items and chests are hidden, some of which provide decent atmosphere I admit.  After all falling in a big hole and landing near streams and being surrounded by high mountains is a unique feeling of adventure.  However there are two particularly offensive rooms near the end of the game where you keep falling through hole after hole (about 30 of them total) fighting 90% of the enemy varities you've already encountered which may be cool and serves as a nice combat-oriented mission, but feels like a clumsy way of making up for the lack of combat you experienced up to this point.  Like Nintendo just tacked this section on to make up for the distinct lack of combat throughout the game.  I'd bet anything that these two parts of the game contain more than 50% of the enemies in the game overall.  Why not spread these enemies around the dungeons and the islands?The music however, is INCREDIBLE!  Perhaps the best soundtrack ever in a Zelda game.  The soothingly beautiful credits theme is amazing beyond description, but my favorite is the fast-paced Jethro Tull or Renaissance like theme music that plays whenever you arrive to a mini boss.  It's diverse enough to be classified as a progressive rock song, seriously.  Just LISTEN to how awesome it is!  Other songs are really melodic and fit in appropriately and excitedly with the heroic theme of the fairy tale locations the Zelda series is known for.  Oh and perhaps my favorite part of the game- the dramatic and uneasy music you hear whenever you encounter an enemy.  It's suspenseful and makes you feel paranoid, threatened and overwhelmed by the upcoming danger.  It's *awesome*.  There's even some perfectly utilized sound effects while this particular theme is playing giving off a feeling of mystery and uncertainty.  I don't particularly care for the annoying sounds Link makes though.  He should have remained silent.  At least we can breathe easy knowing the one ice section later on is short because Link sliding around sounds like a baby animal being massacred by a group of wild barbarians.  Oh and speaking of which, these ice and fire dungeons shouldn't technically be considered dungeons since they're only one or two rooms long.  It literally only takes 2 minutes to complete them.Overall, go with Skyward Sword for a better 3D representation instead.  That game better represents the Zelda formula on all counts especially graphics, storytelling and overall epicness (but not music though- Wind Waker takes the crown there).  Wind Waker just doesn't provide much in the way of substance or pacing.  The triforce chart/shard quest is a big, extremely overlong letdown almost making you not want to finish the game.  How many times have I wanted to give up on a Zelda game due to boredom?  Never before.  The islands should have been closer together too.  This would have helped trim down on the unnecessary length of the game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2006"}

It is basically what the nunchuck controller on Wii, which you needed for playing games like Metriod Prime Trilogy with motion controls, but it has a few more buttons and you don't have to wire it to the main Move controller a big plus, I always hated that cord on Wii. It works decent as getting around XMB and a DVD/Blu-ray controller since it is smaller and can be controlled in one hand, only problem it doesn't have a triangle button which isn't used that often but sometimes you need it but I like using it for basic movie watching functions.

While I did enjoy the gamecube-mk7 mario karts the were always just a bit to chaotic and more lucked based. All the mario karts are of coarse luck based and this on is no diffrent when it comes to that however its more balanced and even though small amount of luck is needed prepare to practice your driving skills as well you will need it online and on mirror mode.Hardware wize this game looks amazing for being on the wii u and i'd say surpasses most ps4/xbone games. I say this because the graphics keep the game running smooth while looking absolutly beautiful at the same time. The game is truely a work of art. The sound on this game is great to I recomend playing on surround sound if available. Surprizingly the karts sound like actual gokarts, mopeds, etc, even more so then most driving simulation games have done so far. As for the soundtrack its really good the more jazzish soundtrack on a few of the tracks flows very well with the races.Of coarse when it comes to mario kart none of that hardware and sound really matters as long as the game is fun. Which is where this game really shines. As mentined earlier the game is a lot more balanced you will see more green and red turtle shells then you will bullets, blue shells, other items that effect everybody in this version and its also slightly easier to dodge the red ones as well you have to be close up for a gurenteed hit. Of coarse you will still see plenty of items that effect everyone to so blue shells still cost races occasionally. However if you have the new item the super horn you can dodge it if you use it correctly. Also As usual there are 16 new coarses and 16 coarses from older games. The new tracks are amazing in this game as are *most* the older tracks. Most ofThe older tracks in this on are changed a lot so the feel new I like to think of it as new tracks inspired by the older onesThe newest thing about this game is the anti gravity mode which turns the world of mario kart upside down. You will be driving up walls on ceilings and everything which really shakes things up. When your in this mode if you hit someone it actually speeds both players up so it leads to intresting things. Of coarse there is also new power ups such as the pirhana plant, superhorn, and a few others that replaced older ons that are sadly missing such as boo, fake question blocks. Also returning from Mk7 is underwater and hang gliding which was the best part about that on.With all that being said there is a few things wrong with this version of mario kart. Most importantly the battle mode is broken no more battle coarses instead you fight on regular coarses which is just plain lame and lazy on nintendos part. Also some of the n64 coarses are barely reconizeable toads turnpike has 4 lanes of traffic with them going in diffrent ways which competly kills the challenge of the original on mirror mode. Yoshis valley also tells what place your in which even though originally it was supposed to it was more fun not knowing.However don't let those minor nitpicks change your mind unless your big into the battle mode, the racing and multiplayer is the greatest mario kart has been in years and if you dont have a wii u you need to get on for this game along with 3d world. Also before july if you register this game on club nintendo you get a free game","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2014"}

White \"Dragnilar\"","summary":"Enhanced season mode does not make up for poor CAW","reviewText":"Despite the greatly improved season mode that the game offers, SD vs RAW still does not offer up a good CAW. The CAW (Create A Wrestler) mode has features that date back to the past two smack down games, and all of them are cumbersome. It takes way longer than it should to create a wrestler, and the outfits that the game offers are rather limited despite the amount of mixing and matching you can do with the layer control and paint options. It is great for making undetailed characters such as your run of the mill Bill Goldberg, but it doesn't work very well when you want to make a more detailed character such as Ultimo Dragon or even a ninja like Scorpion. Also the move animations, entrance animations, and all the rest do offer a lot of customability, but it gets to be a point where it is more of a hassle and you just want to use your wrestler, not tweak him until the wake of dawn.The wrestling game itself is easy to access and fun as usual, but it is now getting to be redundant and it makes one wonder when THQ is going to ever use a new fighting engine. The one in use has become a little out-dated despite it's advantages.The other thing that bothers me is the redundancy of the robust Season Mode. While it does offer voice acting and a better feel of actually watching an episode of SD or RAW, it comes off as 'cookie' cutter no matter which wrestler you use. The voice acting is actually really bad because most of the wrestlers sound like they were just reading scripts and were under time constraints or whatever caused them not to put any effort into recording their sound bytes.Despite it's short commings, SD vs. RAW is a good update to the already existing SD series, but as said before, it is starting to feel dated and the next version needs to add something to give it a fresh start.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2005"}

The voice acting was great, especially Michael Ironside.  The storyline was interesting.  The missions were very varied and the graphics were really good.My only beef is with the nature of the game in spirit versus execution.  You're supposed to be a spy who goes in covertly, steals stuff, kills guys, and various other sneaky things.  That's great.  I love games like that. (the Thief and Hitman series come to mind)  But SC:DA doesn't really make you do that.  With the exception of a few key characters you can go in guns blazing and bring the house down.  There are consequences for this but it doesn't feel real enough.  If you're going to the trouble to create such great openended missions, the consequences of your execution should also be equally well crafted.

{"product_name":"B000GPVUOY","reviewerName":"Joey Pimkowski","summary":"Way Underrated.","reviewText":"What you have here is an amazing game that never gets any fanfare. In stranglehold, you are tossed into the shoes of Chow yun Fat and then you use those shoes to kick all sorts of ass. Many games have tried to mimic John woo's style but none of them really bring you into his signature stylish gunplay quite like this. The action in this game is constant and designed in such a way that you rarely ever get a moment to settle down and that's the point.So how is this game different than all the rest? Well, for one, you have tequila bombs which act like little power boosts when your meter fills up. You have one that's similar to a health pack, the second is precision aiming which follows the bullet right to the bad guys, barrage which is about twenty seconds of invulnerability, and the final ability lets you spin in a circle shooting everything in sight while doves soar above you. All of these powers are useful in different situations and are essential to finishing the game.Oh, and that's not all. Most of the environment is interactive, you can slide down banisters and glide across tables while you blast everything in your path. Believe me, everything in this game is either destructable or useable and once you get the hang of the relativley simple controls, you'll swear this is the closest you've ever come to being in an action movie.If you've never heard of this or you really want to get your adrenaline pumping, give this a shot. The cinematic shoot outs are awesome to behold and this thing is lying around in just about any bargain bin. My only complaint is that this game is pretty short and some of the graphics seem kinda plain, but don't let these qualms keep you from missing this trip through Tokyo.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00DC7G0GG","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"A great platformer on the Wii U","reviewText":"One of the most iconic characters in video game history has to be Mario. From the traditional side scrolling games to other ventures such as puzzle and RPG games there is nothing this plumber hasn&#8217;t been in. Now a new title is going to be released on the Wii U called Super Mario 3D world. But is this going to be a great successor to the franchise or should you just pop in the original Super Mario Bros?The game starts as Luigi, Mario, Toad and Princess Peach are exploring the Mushroom Kingdom when they come across a pipe. The pipe isn&#8217;t the traditional green one it is clear and while inspecting it a green fairy creature pops out. It introduces itself as a Sprixie but before learning more about this creature Bowser shows up and kidnaps it and jumps into the pipe. Mario and friends jump in after Bowser as they are now in the Sprixie kingdom as they are search for her and her companions.Playing the game is similar to the other 3D games as you can wander around freely but each of the characters have different abilities. You can jump higher and fall slower as Luigi, Mario has average speed and jump height, Peach can float in mid air but not run as fast, Toad runs really fast but cannot jump as high.Powerups are a real important part of any of the Super Mario games and this one has loads that you can use to your advantage. But there are new powerups such as a cat costume (that has it&#8217;s own attacks and allows you to climb walls), double cherries (that allow you to create a clone of yourself) and Goomba masks that allows you to blend in and not be attacked by enemy Goombas.Also one player can use the Gamepad to not only touch the screen to hinder enemies and aid players but to reveal hidden blocks and items. This game also supports Off-TV Play so you can take this game with you on the small screen.This is a wonderful entry into the Super Mario universe and if you have a Wii U you need to purchase this game. With tons of new powerups, great controls and new worlds to explore this is the game that fans have been waiting for.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2013"}

If you were one of those who grew insanely addicted to Tetris then this is the game for you.  This is, by far, the best and only must have game for the PSP at launch.  If you own a PSP, go pick this game up.Like Tetris, blocks will fall from the top of the game and it is your purpose to get rid of them.  Blocks fall in a 2X2 block with varying patterns of two different colors.  You have to make at least a 2X2 square of one color for it to vanish.  A bar sweeps past the screen slowly and as it passes the same color blocks you've created, it makes them vanish.  Now comes the insanely addictive part.  To rack up points, you want to cause combos by having more than one set of blocks vanish in a bar sweep.  The more you get rid of, the higher the combo and the higher the magnifier.There will be a moment when you hit your groove and things are moving naturally.  The colors will change, the skin will change, the music will change, things will start to move faster.  And, that's when you might notice that every time you rotate the block, move the block, or put the block down there is a musical note etc that adds to the soundtrack.  Soon you will be moving blocks, hearing the music and it just fits.  Never before has a game mirrored music with gameplay so perfectly (with the exception of Rez which was created by the same company).Then there's the 2 player mode which is a blast.  It sets up two areas on your screen, one for each player.  It starts with the areas having equal area, but as one person gets more combos than the other, the winning player gets a larger area and the losing player gets a smaller area until one person takes over.  It's a blast, frantic and exciting to play.A good handheld system should have a good time-waster; something to keep you busy and that you can pass so much time playing that you forget things around you.  This game does just that.  It's deceptively simple to begin, but the depth in it is amazing.  It's like Tetris, easy to play, hard to master.  I think the best compliment I can give this game was that I was at an airport the day after I got this game and I didn't care that the plane was delayed an hour+ because I was having too much fun playing Lumines so I could play one more game.Bottom Line: if you own a PSP and like games like Tetris, you need this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2005"}

Utilize everything you can find to fight off the flesh-hungry mob and search for the truth behind the horrendous epidemic.","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"Pokes fun at Resident Evil - a very good game!","reviewText":"Dead Rising brings to mind memories of other ambitious games that tried to expand the survival-horror genre (like Blue Stinger on Dreamcast back in the day). It has all the hallmarks -- new play styles, a decidedly different pace from the Resident Evil franchise, and (in theory at least) next-generation graphics. And while it suffers from some typical early-generation pitfalls, it's a feverishly inventive game that triumphs over the very shortcomings that threaten to hold it back.Those missteps are immediately evident in the uneven visuals. For example, there's nothing particularly bad about any of the character models, but they don't really look next-gen. Yes, they sport higher polygon counts, but you get the feeling that that you're looking at characters for the Xbox 1.5 more than for the 360. The flip side is that you're seeing dozens and dozens more of these NPCs and monsters onscreen than you would on any other hardware platform. Still, with the exception of the highly detailed cut-scenes, it comes off as a bit too sanitary. The too-clean objects against the expansive backgrounds lack the visual impact of, say, Resident Evil 4.The odd game structure leads to more head-scratching moments. Dead Rising takes place in \"real time,\" but not really. Playing as Frank West, you plough through \"case files\" (read: chapters) while meeting certain primary goals, with optional side missions. While this sounds fine in theory, in actual practice, Frank (who levels up as if in an RPG or action-RPG) is rarely suited to the task the first time around. Probably not coincidentally, Dead Rising follows a structure much like Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter (a few Dragon Quarter dev team members are on Dead Rising's team). It intends for you to replay each chapter, while retaining the experience, stat boosts and attacks learned in preceding playthroughs. Clearing the first chapter, for example, is much easier the third time through: Not only do you know where to go and what you can do, but you have a stronger attack rating, faster speed, a bigger life bar, an expanded item inventory, and a longer throw distance.An awkard save system bogs down your progress more than the repetitious play. You have the limited options of either save points, or recording your statistical progress and restarting the level entirely. It feels like an artificial way for the dev team to extend the replay value of the game, but when you have as large a playing field as Dead Rising provides, you begin to appreciate the method behind Capcom's madness. Take the initial shopping mall setting as a fine example of just how easy it is to find yourself waylaid by the game's endless invention. The languid halls of the Willamette Parkview Mall stretch on seemingly forever, filled to capacity with movie theaters, food courts, bookstores, lingerie shops, toy stores, music shops, sporting goods merchants, and pretty much anything you can think of that would appear in a mall. Now consider that each one of these stores contains a weapon, food item, instruction manual (to help you learn new moves), or clothing item.Whether you utilize a coat hanger, baseball bat, guitar, mannequin, lawn mower, or Servbot head (of Mega Man fame) as a weapon, the results are almost always entertaining. Every item has its own animation and style of attack. While you may bludgeon a sole zombie with a park bench and its corresponding single slow attack, you'll find that a guitar not only has a space-clearing 360-degree arc, but that it hits multiple times. Then, while you may expect a mild result from clubbing a zombie over the brain with a giant yellow Servbot head, you might just laugh out loud when you unexpectedly plant the foamy object on a zombie's head, which renders it harmless, content to walk into walls as if blind, deaf, and dumb.One of the best things Dead Rising has going for it is its sense of humor. While the setting and consequences of Dead Rising are dire, the characters are caricatures, and the development team took every opportunity to mix hysterics in with the hysteria. When Frank runs out of weapons or ammo, pulling the camera in to over-the-shoulder shooting mode (RE4 style) while pressing the attack button will cause him to hawk loogies at incoming zombies. It's such a laughable and pathetic move when you first see it; it's amazing that the developers saw fit to let you spit in this game. But it's even more surprising when you eventually discover a smoothie you can whip up in the food court from found ingredients lets you turn that goober into one of the game's most powerful attacks.It's also ironic that this Capcom survival-horror game, one that doesn't take itself too seriously, features some spot-on voice acting (as opposed to that of more serious efforts like the early Resident Evil games, where the voiceovers have been inconsistent at best). Listening to Frank speak doesn't make you want to skip cut-scenes, and instead encourages you to watch them in their entirety. Even obvious caricatures, like one old lady in the beginning of the game who is intent on saving her demonic-looking poodle, have competent voices behind them, making them all the more believable. One thing to watch out for, though, is the subtitles, which look fine when viewed on an HDTV or VGA monitor, but are practically unreadable on a regular television.The controls are customizable depending on your camera-swiveling preference, and are generally responsive, as is befitting an action-adventure that's more free-form than Resident Evil. But less agile gamers should keep in mind that the standard third-person controls give way to a new set of controls when you go into photo mode and shooting mode. And then there are the other controls for things like cycling through items, using items, picking up items, dropping items, checking-your-watch-then-picking-up-the-item-you-dropped (because-you-checked-your-watch), and so forth. Simply put: Dead Rising has a lot of commands. Not so many that it's unplayable, but it's occasionally counterintuitive, and certainly enough to keep you busy at all times, especially with hordes of zombies closing in.The end result is a relentlessly inventive game worth the price of entry. With more than enough first-person shooters, racing games, and other cookie-cutter filler swamping the 360, it's encouraging to see such an original title land on the system. The experience is flawed -- some might say hampered -- by the save system and curiously designed game structure. But whether you 'get it' or not, Dead Rising nevertheless provides a wealth of secrets and mysteries for both eager gamers and the adventuresome. With each repeated play through a stage, Frank becomes stronger, better able to uncover the mysteries behind this allegorical horror adventure (we'll let you discover what really makes zombies zombies), and the experience becomes richer for it. While there's plenty of room for polish and finesse in future iterations, no hardcore gamer should miss the wholly unique experience provided in Dead Rising's debut.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2006"}

Way back when, I remember being in college and running out to buy my PSone after seeing the original 'Resident Evil' for the first time.  Since then, the category gained a great deal of popularity and we've been treated to the birth of terrific franchises like Silent Hill, Fatal Frame, and now Dead Space.One of things I was impressed by the most was that the game play itself is outstanding.  You can see a very defined purpose for every object, every room, every weapon, and every tool in the game.  It isn't like there are weapons and ammunition just wantonly scattered all over the place.  This is a mining ship and crew, so 90% of everything you use in-game is related as such.  Your weapons are repurposed mining equipment (a saw, a cutter, a bolt shooter, etc).  Most of the ammunition you use will be stored in lockers, closets and storage cubicles.  Each part of the ship is completely unique.  For example, you'll never wander into a room and get the feeling that you've been there before.  That its just a room that's been re-skinned to look different.  The camera is the same over-the-shoulder style that 'Resident Evil 4' used and anyone that played that gem (and if you're reading this, you should have) should immediately feel familiar with the controls.I love that everything is done in real-time.  Do you need to check your inventory, hit the store, or double-check an objective?  All of this is accomplished via a pop-up holographic projection that your mining suit creates directly in front of you.  So if you need to do anything, you better be sure you're in a cleared room.On top of a beautifully rendered ship, the tight hallways create an unnerving sense of claustrophobia.  You'll find yourself just creeping down every hall with your tool-of-choice drawn, just waiting to see what's lurking around each corner.  The low-lighting and mangled equipment will have you double checking every shadow for movement.  You have a 'sprint' button, but (trust me) on your first round of the game you'll hardly ever use it.  You truly never know when something is going to leap out at you.The 'Necromorphs' are relentless too and 'Dead Space' made the way you kill them completely original with the introduction of the 'strategic dismemberment' system.  Since these creatures aren't human and just reanimated dead tissue, head-shots don't make a bit of difference.  In fact, in some instances it just makes them angrier.  The way to stop them, is to selectivly seperate their legs and arms from their bodies and tear them apart.  Each creature is a little different too, so what work against one won't necessarily help against another.What I felt was the best part of the experience though (and I'm not sure it gets enough credit) is the sound.  Whether its the sound effects from the equipment, the functionality of the room, or the distant screams of the few remaining crew, if you have a 5.1 surround set-up then turn down the lights and pump-up the volume.  The sound will have you totally creeped out and jumping out of your seat.Although it's just an outstanding game and I can't praise it enough, 'Dead Space' might have one or two areas where there's a little room for improvement.  The first is when you finish the game and unlock the 'Insane' difficulty.There are two things related to this.  The first is that, if you start an 'insane' round, you need to start from scratch and you can't carry over any weapon upgrades or equipment that you may have earned from a previous session.  I would have made this a little more flexible.  Myself, I know I would have been a little more likely to have played on 'insane' for my second game if I could have carried over all my tricked-out rig and gear.  This would have allowed me to continue chasing down several of the achievements that eluded me on my first run-through.  The second issue with 'insane' is that the ONLY time you can start an 'insane' round is immediately after finishing the game.  For example, if you choose to restart a game on the difficulty you just finished (to keep the items you just earned) you'll have to finish that second game before 'insane' unlocks again.  Again, I think if they were a little more flexible here, it would have made the replay value a little higher then it is.Occasionally, there is a small bit of back-tracking within the ship and the feeling toward the end of the game that you're just on a series of 'fetch quests.'  I would have maybe tried to include a little more personal choice in the game that might affect the outcome in some way.  It would make the gamer feel a little more personally invested in the experience and (again) jack the replay value up a little bit.In the elite crowd of 'Bioshock' and 'Gears of War', 'Dead Space' is probably one of the best games I've played on the 360 so far.  The story is as intelligent as it is engaging, the action is extremely violent, the design and graphics are frighteningly beautiful, and the atmosphere that's created is genuinely scary as hell.  If you're a fan of the survivor-horror genre this is one that you owe to yourself to check out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2008"}

But having said that, I was not shocked or offended. Let's face it, there are many movies and books that are far worse than this game.What I liked about GTA3 is the free-roaming ability. You can go anywhere, interact with anybody (or rather kill anybody), and complete missions for money. The missions are similar in style to \"Driver\", and the earlier GTA games. There are cinematic scenes between missions, and you can appreciate the full range of vioce acting, which sounds like an episode of \"The Sopranos\" (actor Joe Pantoliano plays the voice of crime boss Luigi, who givesyou jobs). Everything that represents the decay of society, from youth gangs to hookers, to pimps and crime families are in GTA3. Considering what you probably know from the earlier games, and the hype surrounding this one, this is not suprising.The graphics are nicely done, with the intricate detailing of the cities, the various facial movements of the characters, and the overall look of the game. The music and sound is where this game really shines. Unlike \"Driver\", where the music is in the background, you have the radio blasting as you are cruising down the street, and the voices of the people are shockingly life-like. I seriously recommend hooking your PS2 up to a stereo, as this is the only way to appreciate the sound. The control is also excellent, and easy to grasp from the first time playing.But all the warnings you read are true. This is NOT a game for kids, I would even hesitate to say teenagers. The blood aside, the carnage, and the malicious killing of innocent people and police officers that is depicted in this game are not things you would want your kids exposed to. The \"M\" rating is there for a reason, keep it in mind when you are buying the game. Sadly, it is always the game you will not allow that your kids will want the most, so use good judgement when checking out this title in particular.The violence and carnage didn't offend me at all, so I can appreciate more of the story and excitement, which involves a lot of violence.

When I finally got it, an extreme feeling of excitment came over me. I knew I was in for something extrodinarie. Before I continue, let me just say I wasn't wrong at all in thinking this. After completing the game about an hour ago, i feel as though I have made friendships and also lost several. The men of Fox Company 502nd regiment of the 101st airborne come alive in Brothers in Arms. They aren't dumb ai bots running into walls and getting killed for not returning fire. They are smart, almost to the point of creepiness. Level after level I was continuely worrying about the welfare of my men. Not because I couldnt survive without them, but because I didnt want to survive without them. I wanted to see all of my men through to the end. Sadly not all of them can be saved and your always wondering who is going to die next. As you get closer to the end of the game you begin to feel that the rest of your \"dozen\" has a chance. The game's opening scene is intense with violence as well as profanity. It is brutal and sets the mood for the scene that follows. Don't go into Brothers in Arms thinking its another \"Americans win everything\" game. Many of the levels are sad and some moments are downright scary. If you've viewed, no, experienced and enjoyed the film Band of Brothers, this game will appeal to you. The story is so gripping I literally played it for 24 hours straight until I beat it. The gameplay in Brothers in Arms is solid enough to get use to fairly quick and both the game's sound and visuals are top notch. The weapons in Brothers in Arms are true to life weapons that feel more real than ever before. You need to be precise in your aiming, be careful where you take cover, and think like a soldier because two well placed shots is enough to drop you.

{"product_name":"B0038TT8QM","description":"","reviewerName":"Brendan Ross","summary":"Streamlined and fun","reviewText":"Let's get this out of the way right at the outset:  if you're the kind of Civ player who just loved micromanaging everything in Civ IV, you probably won't care for Civ V.  Firaxis decide to take the game in a more streamlined direction, and so most of the non-Steam related complaints you'll see about Civ V are generally coming from the heavy micro crowd.If, however, you like the macro game much more than the micro game, you'll probably like Civ V.  Much of the city-level micromanagement has been trimmed to managing things on an empire-wide level, making each turn more manageable for the average player.  This allows you to focus on the broader strategy without getting bogged down in micromanaging city-level happiness and so on, as was the case in Civ IV.The streamlining has also had the impact of removing some elements that were liked by many in previous iterations, such as the impact of religion, on the one hand, or the capability to trade maps/techs (which made quite a few games very easy).  This is mostly made up by increased military tactics due to no more unit stacking, two-hex attack range for ranged units (and cities), and the overall low unit cap relative to the prior system of the \"stack of death\".  Definitely the design seems to be away from micromanaging at the city level towards micromanaging at the unit level, and overall the game feels more like a \"war game\" than previous iterations in the series.The game could use some more polish, which will hopefully come in a patch soon.  Unit automation is a bit clunky at the moment, and the AI could be better.  However as a new platform for future mods and further development, Civ V is a step in a new direction.  Whether you will enjoy that new direction or not depends mostly on how attached you were, if at all, to the previous version's city-level micromanagement scheme.Finally, there's been a lot of hysteria about Steam here.  Yes, you need to activate the game through Steam.  You can then, if you like, play it offline by setting that up within Steam.  We can expect that most future *big* PC game titles will have online verification required that ties the license to a specific user, prevents transfers and so on -- this is the way things are being done, now, and it is merely the software companies enforcing the licenses that they always had for the software.  It's understandable that people who routinely violated the licenses in the past are now upset that the licenses can be enforced, but that's just how it is going to be (SC2 was the same).  I do think, however that discussions about Steam and similar platforms (which tend to stir up as much passion as Mac vs. PC) should be separated from discussion of the merits of the actual game itself.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2010"}

Journey as the prince in an expansive quest uncovering the mysteries surrounding the Sun Rune, the civil unrest and the dark intent of an unknown power in the greatest Suikoden saga yet!","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Brilliant Game","reviewText":"If you're an RPGer, and you're a serious one, Suikoden V should be one of the RPGs on your list this year.  It's fun, long, and showers a lot of replay value.  The game just all around shines, and it's easy to see why.  Suikoden IV was nothing special, but if you lost faith in the series after it, allow Suikoden V to restore that faith.In the Queendom (yes, Queendom) of Falena, villagers are beginning to question Queen Arshtat's motives.  Her form of justice was torching a village and it's countryside.  As the Prince of Falena, you're sent in to investigate the matters for yourself.  It soon becomes easy to turn your back on the Queen.  There's a reason for her mor wicked actions, and after a while you're not going to be used anymore.  You're going to investigate.  The story begins kind of slowly, putting you to the task of running errands for most of the beginning, but once you get past that, the game really takes off.For what it's worth, Suikoden V has a great story, and a brilliant cast of characters.  Throughout the game it's great to watch your characters grow, including the Prince.  There are tons of characters who you can get to join your cause, and all of them are very well developed.  There are 108 characters in all.  In most RPGs with an unrealistically large number of characters, the character development is terrible.  This isn't true in Suikoden V.  Each character is distinctly their own.  The array of characters that join you is also interesting.  You'll have just normal civillians.  Chef's, detectives, ordinary peasants who are willing to fight for your cause.  The way at which you obtain them is also interesting.  Some will join based on what you say, others will join you depending on who is currently among your ranks.  Some won't join you until you've got A LOT of people.  This also works out to manipulate the ending of the game itself, as well as certain story sequences.  The bulk of Suikoden V is actually getting all these characters, and it is perhaps the strongest part of the game.The battle system is pretty cool too.  You'll have six characters in battle at a time.  You can set up your characters in battle in a way that you earn certain bonuses.  There are formations that allow you to up your attack power, magical power and plenty more.  It's awesome to tinker around with, and makes battling more interesting.  The only thing that bogs down battling is the load times before it, which over time become pretty annoying.Alongside the normal, everyday battle... you'll be able to duel as the story moves on.  The duels aren't especially challenging.  They way they're done is similar to Pokemon in a way.  You can attack, use a special attack or defend.  It's like Rock, Paper, Scissors.  Everything has the potential to lose.  For example, you can't defend against a special attack but you can use a regular attack to offset it.  Those you're dueling will usually call out what they're going to do, and you'll have somewhere around three or four seconds to decide how to offset it.  Dueling isn't especially hard, but it has its moments.There are also army battles on land and sea, and to be honest, they're no different than the duels.  You'll have to move closer to the enemy, but they pretty much play out in the same way.  However, this is where the bulk of your 108 characters come into play.  They are, essentially, your army.Graphically, Suikoden V is good.  Good, not especially great.  Most characters are pretty detailed and the enviroments are colorful.  The PS2 is capable of better, but in all honesty, Suikoden V is NOT by any means a bad looking game.  It's a good looking game, just not as good looking as others that have set the bar.  Soundwise, the game sounds great.  Mixing classic music from the series with other tunes.  The new tunes are used perfectly when setting the mood of certain scenes.Suikoden V is full of good voice acting.  It isn't always perfect, but it works out just right.  Some characters sound perfect, others you're scratching your head and wondering what the deal is.  You won't find yourself questioning the voices too often, though.  Most of the voice acting is good, and the voices that matter you'll be proud of.Suikoden V is a gem.  It's got lots of replayability, and tons of well developed characters.  It's one of the most exciting RPGs of the year, and any RPGer would be proud to have it.The Good+Great storyline+Tons of characters+Well developed charactes+Fun battle system+Overall good voice acting+Good graphics+Great soundtrackThe Bad-The load times for battles-Duels and army battles aren't really all that difficult","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2006"}
{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Gargus","summary":"Worst entry in the series.","reviewText":"I'm not here to rip on ME3 just for the sake of doing so or because its what's cool to do on the internet like so many others.Basically ME3 is the worst of the series in every way possible compared to the other 2 games because it doesn't build or improve anything. It simply just tries to hurriedly finish the series for the sake of a cash in on the title.1- There is no sense of exploration. The game as efficiently as possible holds your hand every step the way and has you actually being on the ground doing things the least amount possible. Side missions are carried out by quickly scanning a planet ala ME2 and then firing a probe. That's it. You don't explore, you don't get to check out uncharted worlds simply for the sake of curiosity or anything. Scan, shoot probe, side mission done all without even leaving the galaxy map. This tactic accounts for the majority of side missions. ME1 you could explore the galaxy drive around in that horribly handling buggy and had a sense of discovering things, ME2 you could land on planets and explore doing side missions with some not even firing a single shot like the crashed cruiser balanced on the mountain peak but all of those things are gone in 3. The game just holds your hand and ushers you from mission to mission.2- You don't get to actually chose anything, everything is pre determined for you. Even if you chose the renegade or paragon path you get the exact same result and no one treats you differently and you get no alternative paths depending on your karma scale which makes it all incredibly pointless and just window dressing for the fact the story is entirely linear and so is your character.3- The characters are all the same ones, only less compelling. There are a couple new characters but they are highly disposable and not even worth messing with. James for instance is basically just a guy who talks 90% of the time like a generic white guy, 10% of the time he throws out some Mexican phrases like saying \"loco\" a lot in his generic white guy trying to impersonate a Mexican guy and he looks like he was taken from the show jersey shore. When a old character returns you can see it coming a mile away. For instance you go into a area where the mission briefing talks about geth then you can see 45 minutes before which old character is going to come back. All the characters themselves seem hollow and rushed, they lack the personality that made them endearing in the other games and most are there only long enough to be overly obvious in a very specific mission or they simply show up for 3 minutes of camera time practically winking at the player with a nod and then are gone.4- The story compared to the others sucks. The other games had side stories, character stories, side missions with their own short stories and so on. ME3 on the other is basically this \"Everything is going to be destroyed\". That's pretty much it because no matter where you go or what you do it's always about the war specifically and nothing else. I also got sick of hearing phrases like \"we're here to save lives\", \"we're doing this to save lives\", \"this weapon will save lives\", \"we need to stick together to save lives\", \"billions of lives are on the line and were here to save them\", etc and after about 8 hours I was sick of hearing about the war and saving lives.5- The game play was basically just one big shooting gallery and hiding behind chest high walls. Every single fight is basically you hiding behind chest high walls to peak out and fire a few rounds only to hide back behind said wall. It was incredibly boring and has been done to death in dozens of other games. The combat was mindless and mediocre. It felt like they put absolutely no effort into the combat at all and rushed you through it in order to get to the next scene of hearing Sheppard say \"saving lives\".6- The ending was atrocious. This is a series that prides itself on story, characters and dialogue. We all spent over 100 bucks playing all 3 games and spent over 100 hours playing all 3 games but bioware seemed to say \"This is the end of the trilogy so who cares about the ending\". The ending is the most important part of any story of any kind because it's the very last thing you leave the person with and it's supposed to be a reward, the climax to everything leading up till then, basically the ending is the most important part of any story. But the ending of ME3 was over in just a minute or so despite the dozens of hours of dialogue, cut scenes and story in the rest of the series they got lazy at the end. It gives no satisfaction at all. I can honestly say it is the laziest segment of the series. I did like though they had the balls to do what they did with Sheppard, but the ending still sucks and doesn't make you glad to have finished the series.All in all if you played the other 2 games then you'll obviously want to play this, but I wouldn't bother with it until it hits 20 bucks.And stay away from the collector's edition, I was stupid enough to buy it and I felt like I wasted my money.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2012"}

Mega Man 6 was the last NES game released in America and it was not all that worthwhile of a game (although it is necessary to complete any Mega Man collection).  However, for the Super NES, one of the last few games ended up being a great classic: Super Mario RPG.  Combining the world of Mario with the designs of a classic RPG setting, this game is not only a great game, BUT a landmark game in the RPG genre.This game uses a simple RPG system to introduce newbies to RPGs, but at the same time, it captivates veteran gamers with a great story and interesting characters.  The biggest irony is that Mario doesn't speak, which is intended to be classic because a lot of RPGs have main characters that never speak.  This will surely please even the jaded RPG gamer.Since it came out near the end of the Super NES (at least in America, anyway), this game is very hard to find.  Nevertheless, it is WELL WORTH YOUR TIME.  The music is very good, the characters and story well developed, and the OldSkool-style battle system is very pleasing indeed.  Plus, Mario and Bowser actually fight side-by-side.It's a shame that Squaresoft and Nintendo didn't do any future joint projects together because this is a gaming feat.  Perhaps they will now that Squaresoft is releasing past games on the Game Boy Advanced (Super Mario RPG for Advanced anyone?), but that has yet to be seen.  My advice for you is to GET THIS GAME.  The difficulty factor is rather easy, but do yourself a favor and engage yourself in a superb RPG.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2003"}

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7I","description":"","reviewerName":"Francisco Cortes","summary":"The action may not be better than Stranglehold but is THE BEST MAX PAYNE EVER!!!","reviewText":"This game is pretty similar to John Woo's Stranglehold. Is a third person shooter with LOT'S of action, explotions, blood and cool control movements that will keep you addicted to the gameplay. One thing is for sure, Max Payne 3 is a great improvement of the previews games. Here is a list of the pros and cons:Pros:* MORE action and violence than ever!* MORE bad guys to kill!* MORE settings!* MORE outfits for Max!* MORE naughty words!* MORE movements and stunts!* MORE cheesy dialoges!* MORE special effects!* MUCH MORE weapons!* COOL cheats to unlock!* COOL helicopter, boat, bus, and car chase shootings!* New multiplayer mode.* Great graphics.* Superb storyline.* FINALLY! Great voice acting.Cons:* Sometimes you can't skip some of the long cutscenes. Is very annoying!* The new haircut looks a little dumb.* The controls are not exactly the same as the previous games.* The slow-motion view can be blurry.* No hand grenades.* Less dark settings.* The soundtrack is pretty good but some songs are a little annoying. (personal opinion)Like I said, the gameplay is very similar to Stranglehold. I must admit that Stranglehold has more action, violence, and stunts than Max Payne 3. But I stick with this game because is longer, the story is better, there are more settings, more chases, more weapons, better multiplayer, better graphics, and better sound. If you want the best Max Payne game then buy this right away! Now, if you are looking for a better action improvement of Stranglehold or Wet then search somewhere else, but at least give it a try.Adios.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2012"}

It has Rockstar's signature sandbox formula a la Grand Theft Auto, yes, but it's set in the Wild West!  RDR is definitely a unique game in its own right for that reason.  The cutscenes are plentiful and beautifully rendered.  The storyline is decently good, too, with a large cast of characters.  There's also PLENTY to do in this game, from main story missions to side objectives to hunting & gathering.I decided to give it 4 stars because the controls at times could be a little clunky....I thought that activating Dead Eye could be a little less troublesome.  When you have to switch weapons on horseback and then go into Dead Eye, that can pose a problem and it cost me a few deaths in the process.  Also, I didn't like the fact that if you're out hunting & gathering, every single animal/herb collection is completely lost if you die in between main missions.  They could have at least put in an auto-save feature after each collection, like they did with Demon's Souls.  So the control scheme and the loss of items definitely warranted a one-star deduction from this game.Keep in mind that it will take you at least a month to really complete this game.  I personally did not finish the game (i.e. achieve 100% completion), but I feel qualified to post a review for it based on the fact that I completed the entire Main Story missions.  All Amazon reviewers for this game should have at least accomplished that before posting their reviews.  I'm going to put this game on my shelf and come back to it later after I beat 10+ other games I have left to play.  When the time comes, I'll go for 100% completion and also buy the Undead Nightmare pack.I can't comment on the multiplayer portion of the game because I never tried it.  I'm more of a single player type of guy than multiplayer, but that's just my own personal thing.This game knocks 'em red dead with 4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2011"}

Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide.

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents.

Here's my outtake:Pros -Fun to create character(biggest draw for me)open world3rd person view optionSoundPick up items/stealfight anybodyCons -combatinteraction with others (too stiff, I know RPG)No direction, meaning easy to veer off the main storyline.I expected the combat to be a little bit better than wild swings of the sword hoping I get you before you get me, especially after seeing all the combat trailers. The stiff interaction of the characters didn't help at all either. Good dialouge, but simply dull. I love deep story campaigns, character customizations,etc., and this game has that, but it was still missing that excitement.No offense to the people that love RPGs, and I appreciate the high praises for this game but its just not for me and this would've been my first RPG purchase.

David Swan","summary":"Best mini game ever","reviewText":"`Yoshi Touch and Go' was developed from a DS technology demo and it hasn't strayed far from its roots. The fact is that YTG is a radical change from any game I've ever played and that's definitely a good thing. Forget any of the buttons; the entire game is controlled using the stylus. Even Yoshi himself is completely autonomous as he inexorably moves forward. The point of the game is to clear a safe path for our diminutive dinosaur protagonist. Players can draw clouds to span gaps, encircle enemies in bubbles and shoot eggs by tapping the screen. If you don't like the clouds you drew you can blow on the DS to blow them away. I won't spoil the surprise on how that is accomplished. The game is fun and frantic as you feverishly draw all over the touch screen. The control feels very good, the graphics are excellent and the designers made good use of both screens. Most of the action takes place on the bottom screen but the top has prizes that can be gathered by spitting eggs at them.The downside of Touch and Go is the fact that it plays like an unfinished game. The game play is all there is. There is no story. There is no opening. There is no ending and every time you play the game you start over from the beginning. The only goal is the satisfaction of getting a high score and todays gamer may find that that's not enough. One thing that reduces the repetitiveness is the fact that the game seems to have semi-random level designs. If you play the game twice it won't be the same each time. Repetitive game play isn't completely absent from gaming, sports games are designed this way but it's quite unique for a 2D side scroller.I'm still waiting for the first great game from the DS but `Yoshi Touch and Go' certainly shows a lot of promise for the future.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2005"}

It's great graphics, (for the time) wonderful story, and its fun gameplay made it a hit!GAMEPLAY: You are Solid Snake, and you have to infiltrate through a huge terrorist base threatening the US for money and Big Boss's remains. You have to be sneaky and stealthy, for if a guard catches you, a hoard of enemies will come and try to find and kill you, so be careful.You will also get some cool weapons, like the Socom, which is a powerful gun, and the Nikita, a remote-controlled missile launcher.Boss fights are fun and unique, from the gun-duel with Revolver Ocelot, to fighting a tank and helicopter on foot, to having a fistfight with a robotic ninja, the bosses are awesome.In the game you will get a camera, which allows you to take pictures and discover ghosts. But you need a block per picture.If you ever get stuck, contact your buddies on Codec, a cool communication system that allows you to talk to people like the General, Mei-Ling, (who saves your game) Master, (who looks like Wesker off Resident Evil) and more.One more thing, the torture event. You have to tap circle rapidly to restore your health. You can submit, but if you do, Meryl, the hot, tough, woman that Snake loves, dies. Ocelot says if you use auto-fire, he'll know. He's lying. Turbo controllers are safe and are necessary for this part.GRAPHICS: Well, it looks like standard Playstation graphics. Polygonal and grainy. But it was good for the time.MUSIC: The music in the game is very suspenseful and catchy. Especially the boss music. Better than the remake's.SOUND: The voices are very well done, and the sounds are pretty great, too.STORY: The story unfolds through cinema-style cutscenes, (Which were new for gaming at the time) and Codec calls. The story is very rich and greatly crafted, if not a bit confusing.OVERALL: One awesome game which is a must have for your collection. Also, get the sequels and the remake, The Twin Snakes.

Why do they always ruin every game box with that stupid green bar on the left telling people its a greatest hits. Mabye they will make more money, wrong...Anyways, the actual game is my 2nd favorite of all time. Not easy to get onto my list but this game does it. I was playing Metal Gear Solid 2 the other day and realized that it can never compare with what this game has achieved.You are Snake, the operative who must go in a nuclear testing facility held by terrorists. Snake goes in by stealth, and must fight numerous villians. All the villians in this game are extremely well done with voice acting and great personalitys. I can't find big complaints at all with the game.The game is so good that they are making the remake for Game Cube, and possibly other systems. Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes. Anyways, the game has music that probably for me basically tops final fantasy 7, just because it is original and fits the mood perfectly. Every character has perfect voice and personalitys, so the voice acting never gets old. I've played the game like 8 times, and I loved it every minute.The bad point is the backtracking, but it is really short and is always for a reason. You backtrack usually with a goal in mind. And you will usually backtrack like a mofo on halloween. Meaning really fast to get your candy. And every time you do it(like 3 times in the game) you will get to listen to juicy codec calls that unravel more story bits and liven it up.I love calling Cambell(who is a great character) on the codec to see what he has to say. It always seems to be different and intellectual. He can also give you hints, and the other characters on your codec play major roles.The best part about this game is the story. Honestly, RPG's have the best storys, but this game can top almost any rpg in story. We learn about 2 snakes, and how they believe things. Liquid Snake.... he talks about being a flawed snake and such, and whenever he talks it's always interesting to the point where I want to hear it every game.With story comes philosophy. This isn't the matrix where we have a man called morpheous talk about philosophy in some crazy underground rave. This is Solid Snake and others being honest. Solid Snake has some of the best views on life. He's like a rebel without a cause. His lines are thought provoking and are probably things that someone could base their life off of. Live life is probably the best message he tells and can give, and this philosophy is rare in video games today.The fighting is cool, and bosses offer challenges and fun. I would reccomend this game to anyone. You will get your moneys worth from this game, and I hope you enjoy it. But one more thing, lets not forget what you must do. Buy the game for playstation not computer. On computer they like changed the skins around or so ive seen in screenshots. Solid Snake looks alot younger, and alot less vigilante like and stuff. Get it on playstation to truly expierience it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2003"}

{"product_name":"B000BWZY7Q","reviewerName":"Bilbo Baggins \"mighty hobbit\"","summary":"Stick up the butt!","reviewText":"Before I get into the meat of this review let me explain the title.  Early on, after getting the game me and my brother began playing the game as Draeni.  We were excited about the new race mainly because they spoke with a Russian accent.  After a half hour or so of playing our blue skinned giants my bro commented that they ran like they had a stick up their butt.  I can only assume that means they run with a very erect carriage, in other words very stiff.  We stopped playing the Draeni and have not picked them up since.The main addition in this game is the introduction of the outland and the raising of the level cap to level 70.  The outland is a pretty interesting place with different types of terrain.  Marshes, plains, desolate burning steepes like plateaus and forests abound.  The only thing missing is a snowy realm. (Though I'm sure if you want snow you'll get plenty in the next expansion)  With the new levels come an increase in gear.  The green or common items(technically uncommon if you read the manual) are often better than the epic gear you got before the expansion.  Not the high end stuff but the more easy to get epics(not that any epics are easy to get but some are easier.)  Even though the gear is good you may have reservations about dropping your hard earned epics for random greens that look like crap.  I have a dwarf warrior that I started early on and got to 60.  He is still at 60 because I don't feel like replacing his pvp gear so I rolled an orc warlock for the expansion and now he is 70 and saddled with his own set of 70 pvp epics ('welfare epics' is a slang term for these reasonably easy to obtain items) will I roll another new character for the next expansion?  Maybe but who knows?The second addition is the two new races.  As I eluded to earlier these are the Draeni and the blood elves.  The Draeni, aside from their uncomfortable looking movement, seem the more hastily slapped together of the two races.  They have a weird backstory involving spaceships and demonic corruption.  The blood elves, on the other hand, are the more well known race.  They were an integral part of the early warcraft games (as the high elves) so they are more familiar (if generic) to gamers.  I personally think that the inclusion of the blood elves has shifted the balance of power towards the horde side.  When I journey in the wild I seem to see a lot more horde about but that's just my opinion.  Things obviously vary from server to server but no one can deny that the inclusion of the blood elves has boosted the horde population.  The people like those pretty, pretty elves.  The butt ugly horde have a new poster boy.With the new world to explore there are also some new dungeons.  Though I have not explored the harder more epic dungeons I am aware that there are no longer any 40 man epic dungeons.  The cap is set at 25 which is a more realistic crew to assemble.  I don't have a whole lot to say about that topic.Anyway, this game is a great addition to the series.  I can't wait for the next expansion.  Too bad there aren't any plans for new races.  I have a hankering for some ogre action.  \"Arrgh!Me smash (fill in character race)!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2008"}

That's not really saying much though, since you don't see too many of them anymore.  Once the technology got to a point that quality 3d games were possible, the genre went on the decline.  It hasn't disappeared completely though, thanks to games like Rayman Legends.  The art style is bright and vivid, giving you the feeling that you are living in a cartoon world.  The levels are varied, and are grouped together along certain themes or settings.  The games visuals should make it appealing to kids, and the game keeps things simple enough that they should be able to figure out what to do a little trial and error.  The Wii U version of the game has a few levels that make use of gamepad's touchscreen, and those levels really are designed with the touchscreen in mind.  They haven't just pointlessly added some touch commands to conventional levels like some games have done.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00004U55E","description":"It's been nearly 10 years sinceWolfenstein 3Dforever  popularized the first-person shooter, and at long last everyone's favorite Nazi  killer, B.J. Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done.

The gameplay is not only fun as hell but very interesting as you go through Hitler's obsession with the occult.The only flaw I can find with this game is maybe that it's just too hard, but maybe I just need more practice.

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"F. Jury \"dsunglasses\"","summary":"The Best game I've ever played.","reviewText":"This is quite simply the best game I've ever played. I really enjoyed it, and have played it through four times already. I'll break down my review into multiple categories.STORY- EXCELLENT. The best story I've ever seen in a game. Its a deep immersive story that draws me in right from the start each time. Its full of plot twists and other unexpected developments. It is believable and well thought out. The story has an excellent ending, something alot of games lack, and its conclusion also lends itself well to the already announced trilogy.CHARACTERS- EXCELLENT. An rpg isn't very good if it doesnt have well developed NPC's. This one does. Each character has a deep back story, their own personality, and you really get to care for them. I like rpg's where your party characters have their own personality, morality, and agenda, where they will argue with you or each other, where they will join you or leave you based on your actions, and help you finish quests or try to stop you, and maybe even die. This game has all of that.  Some might complain that the number of party characters is somewhat limited in this game, however given the quality of the party characters and the fact that this is part of trilogy and will grow, I think the number was perfect.CHOICES- EXCELLENT. This is where Mass Effect really shines. Every good rpg game give you lots of choices. You have multiple choices for the main missions, but also for many of the side quests which unlike in alot of games, can be just as fun and immersive as the main quest. Your character actually speaks in this game, and you have multiple responses and ways of handling things. The best part is that Shepard doesn't simply repeat the line you choose, but says or does something along the jist of it. So you never really quite know what he or she's gonna do. This is unlike any other game on the market and really adds to the fun. Also the choices aren't always clear cut good or evil, in fact sometimes, its hard to figure out what the which choice is good or evil. Like real life there are difficult decisions to be made and they are complicated by many shades of gray. The varied choices also allow for some great replays of the game.ANIMATION- EXCELLENT. Some of the best graphics I've ever seen in a game. facial expressions and body language are detailed and precise. The characters and scenes look so real you forget you are watching animation.MUSIC/SOUND EFFECTS- EXCELLENT. The music is original and well done. It has its own theme, and is perfect for the game. It is well edited into the game. Likewise the sound effects are top notch.VOICE ACTING- EXCELLENT. This is another area where Mass Effect really shines. The acting is superb. Every character, not just main ones, but even side quests characters get first rate voice acting. In fact, the main character, Shepard, gets voice acted twice, depending whether you play as male or female, another first for a game.LEVELING UP- EXCELLENT. Every good rpg allows your characters to grow and become more powerful as the game progresses. There are plenty of leveling and powering up choices to choose from, as well as numerous weapon and armor choices.ACTION/GAMEPLAY- EXCELLENT. This is another area where this game improves over my previous favorite rpg KOTOR. You actually do fight alot in this game, both on foot and in a vehicle. its not the automatic fighting you seem in some rpgs. While first person shooter fans mught not be impressed, I thought the fighting and cover options were well done. The only improvement I can see being made here, is to allow the use and change of abilites and weapons without having to pause. But considering this is an rpg first, it is not an issue to me.BUILDINGS/SCENARIOS- EXCELLENT. The main storyline's buildings and backdrops are original, detailed and well designed. Absolutely no complaints. The side quests maps and building are unfortunately a bit repetitive. Considering the sheer number or side quests, and the fact that they are all optional, I cannot fault them for reusing similar backdrops and structures. However this is probably one area that could use some improvement in future games. Another con includes repetitive maps for exploration in the mako.If you like rpgs with immersive stories, compelling characters, and multitudes of choices you should love this game. Some other Great rpgs include, Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR), (which is my second favorite game) KOTOR II, Jade Empire, Neverwinter Nights II, Mask of the Betrayer, and Baulder's Gate II","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Elevators ... in ... SPAAAAAAAACE!","reviewText":"When I first playedKnights of the Old Republic(KOTR) I was enthralled.  Here was a Star Wars game that was better than the latest Star Wars movies, full of engrossing characters, interesting plots, and aliens true to their roots from the Star Wars universe.  At the time, one flaw popped up that really bothered my wife: talking to the aliens ad nauseum meant that certain sound bites were repeated by certain alien races over and over.  So you had a lot of \"ooka shishka jedi\" stuff going on that, while it didn't bother me too much, certainly annoyed the heck out of anyone having to listen to it over and over as I talked to everything that was willing to carry on a conversation. Then I boughtJade Empireand to my horror, discovered that it was the exact same game engine.  It's the same engine used for Mass Effect. And all that dialogue is starting to get old.Allow me to deconstruct the myth that Mass Effect is a supreme role-playing game experience.* SCIENCE-FICTION ROLE-PLAYING: PERFECTED.  The setting is a combination ofStar Wars' exotic worlds,Star Trek's ship interiors, andBabylon 5's battle to establish human dominance in an alien world.Mass Effect uses conversational pathing.  Generally speaking, the top choice is positive, the middle choice is neutral, and the bottom choice is negative.  So if you want to be a jerk, you can always pick the rude bottom choice, and if you want to be a nice guy, you can always pick the positive top choice.  Or if you're in a hurry, you click the button and move to the next chat menu.  This is not role-playing, it's a game of multiple choice, and the majority of the time the choices are obvious.This game has more in common with KOTR than the game engine. The customizability of equipment and characters, the level up system, it's all the same.  So instead of the Force we have \"biotics.\" You can also customize your character's appearance, which is neat. However, Xbox's new interactive menus allow the same thing - avatar customization.  It hardly makes this a \"perfect\" role-playing game.The equipment improvements come down to: Fire Ammo IV and Laser Rifle VII.  There is a whole pile of scrolling text you can read about the history of the weapon, but the short of it is VII is better than VI which is better than V.  You could get those kinds of power ups in a game ofDiablo.* THE VASTNESS OF SPACE BECKONS.  Like KOTR, you have a ship that you can fly all over the universe.  This is like the world's worst sandbox - it's hard enough to figure out what to do and where to go in a small city.  Yes, there's lots of content, but it's not necessarily relevant or interesting.  Almost all the quests involve \"go here, get widget, return it to me.\"Then there's the MAKO, a dune buggy-type roving cannon.  Exploring the surface of worlds primarily involves shooting at giant crab things that you can run over.  In this respect Mass Effect is reminiscent of theFinal Fantasygames.* LOSE YOURSELF IN A LIVING GALAXY. The graphics are amazing, the voice acting top notch, the character expressions just as nuanced as promised.  It has Seth Green as a voice actor, which rocks.But for reasons I will never understand, there are long elevator sequences. In the world of science fiction, where ships can travel through space and alien races intermingle, we have not yet invented a means around elevators. EVERY time you get in an elevator, your characters freeze, face forward, and you listen to the sci-fi equivalent of elevatorMuzak.  The only thing you can do is spin the camera around the characters while they stand there.  You can't reload, check equipment, or anything else.  It's useless downtime.For some reason, the highly advanced civilizations still like to keep their belongings in boxes.  The boxes can be hacked; I'm a sucker for these mini-games, so I confess I enjoyed them.  But really, boxes?  There might be other interesting ways of finding equipment, but since this is the same game engine as KOTR, boxes are everywhere.There is also the romantic subplot.  This subplot involves choosing between a sexy blue alien (reminiscent of Zhaan fromFarscape) and a pushy human racist woman. It's pretty clear which woman the game would like you to hook up with (or man, if you play a female character, but the alien female retains her faux gender). This is hardly a deep romantic plot, and the ruckus raised over the intimate scene between the two characters is unwarranted; it's far tamer than anything on the Internet.To save on memory, the majority of aliens are the same bodies duplicated multiple times, in the same way Star Trek tended to have every alien be humanoid since that meant less makeup was required.  There are a lot of the blue female aliens throughout the game, and they all look similar.  There's not a fat person among them.  Even the ship's doctor, a much older woman, is a silver fox with the body of a twenty year old (where was the romantic subplot with HER?).* LEAD YOUR SQUAD IN INTENSE, REAL-TIME COMBAT. Although your best bet in beating this game is as a soldier, Mass Effect is noHalo.  The third person perspective is difficult to follow, especially when you fight many enemies at once.  What this means is you're constantly pausing the game to give your squad commands, which completely ruins the \"real-time\" combat element.  There isn't the nail-biting thrill of trying to reload a weapon perfectly like Gears of War, and the ability to use terrain as cover isn't nearly as smooth.Mass Effect isn't a bad game by any means.  The graphics are excellent and if you have the time, you can wander the world interrogating every single alien, reading and listening to every path of dialogue, and looting everything on every planet.Mass Effect is ultimately a giant sandbox that's somewhat different from KOTR, only with none of the cachet of Star Wars.  The main plot line, the one in which you save the universe, is a lot of fun and makes for an interesting game. But you'll have to sit through a lot of elevators to get there.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2008"}

I am a big sci-fi guy and this really hits the spot.

I recommend playing through with the two alien chicks, their powers are awesome.The game play and combat is great and there is plenty of gear to be had, the quests are good and usually always involve some form of combat. Driving around in the Maeko is also a good time. My only complaint is that the side quests get kind of repetitive but only if you do nothing but focus on them, either way it really does not tarnish the overall experience.Everyone that I work with played this, gamers of all types, and they loved it.

{"product_name":"B002I0H79C","description":"Gears of War 3","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Easily the best in the franchise","reviewText":"Breaking their 2 year cycle, Epic Games announced that the finale to their Gears of War franchise would finally be released and as much as I hate the word, intends for it to be the \"definitive\" Gears experience. The engine's being pushed the hardest, the multiplayer's the most balanced and there's enough features and things to unlock that this game can literally be the only thing you'd play just from sheer volume of stuff it has. While the game isn't re-inventing the wheel gameplay-wise and it still has the odd dichotomy between explosive-bromance-testosterone-blockbuster and emotionally-charged character-driven epic but if you're a Gears fan, chances are Gears 3 is probably the best one that they've done. But I do have complaints but I would easily recommend buying this game provided you can tolerate some annoyances.2 years after the sinking of Jacinto, humanity's spread out and the COG has disbanded. Some of the Locust are being corrupted by the substance known as \"Imulsion\" and have become mutated versions of themselves dubbed the \"Lambent\". While on the ship Sovereign, Marcus Fenix receives news that his father, Adam Fenix, is alive and has a weapon that can potentially destroy the Lambent and possibly the Locust as well. So with buddy Dom Santiago, fellow COG buddies Baird and Cole, Anya and a new Carmine, Marcus heads off to locate his father and attempt to stop the Locust and Lambent threat once and for all.Written by frequent Gears' novelist Karen Traviss, she does a much better job personifying the characters and she delves more into who they are. While it still has the typical action junkie \"**** yeah, take that!\" type dialogue, the story has a bit more weight to it. Well as much weight as you can give muscle dudes in heavy armor with chainsaws on their guns. While the set-pieces are still as grand as ever, I felt some of the pacing lacked as well since for all of its go-for-broke tendencies, Gears 2 was perfect in this regard. And while I hate to use the word \"filler\", there's parts of the game that feel extended or lengthened which sacrifices the flow. But then there's a mid-game cutscene that packs a huge emotional wallop and there's some impressive moments in the campaign that'll be fun to replay. It's just too bad the gap between those moments is a bit wide.The core gameplay is still the same: take cover and fire shots into enemies until you hear the \"all done!\" sound cue but there is some minor tweaks. You can mantle kick into someone if they're on the other side allowing for quicker kills, the entire game carries 4 player co-op whether through standard campaign or the score-based Arcade and some new weapons come in such as the Digger which launches a grenade that travels underground as well as the controversial Sawed-Off Shotgun. Not to mention you're constantly rewarded such as headshotting enemies, doing successful active reloads and the like. It's not revolutionary but rather fixing the leaks and improving on the strong parts of the franchise which makes it a more satisfying whole.The standard Versus mode returns although some gametypes have been dropped. Gone are Submission and Guardian and in its place is Capture the Leader: one player acts as the \"flag\" that must be captured but the Leader is able to hold LB and highlight not just your allies on the HUD but enemies as well which encourages communication. Also new (yet familiar) is the industry standard Team Deathmatch although there is a twist as your team has a shared amount of lives and once it reaches 0, everyone only has one life and upon death, they must wait until round's over. Although you will most likely see horrendous spawns and frequent uses of the Sawed-off, it's a fun mode anyway.The 2 big draws are the return of Horde and the new Beast mode. In Horde mode, it's still up to 50 waves however Epic has added a tower defense-ish structure where you can purchase barriers to slow enemies down, automated turrets and manned turrets, buy grenades and additional ammo and decoys which distract the Locust. It's just as addicting as it was before however in later waves, it gets remarkably difficult and boss waves can be a tad overwhelming so expect many quitters or re-tries. Always wanted to take on 20 Locust plus a Brumak single-handedly? Now's your chance.The new mode Beast is also a fun albeit a tad fleeting experience as you control the Locust themselves with unique abilities as you try to kill the Gears heroes and COG soldiers. It starts off simple enough as you use the bomb on feet Ticker or huge Butcher but pretty soon you can be a giant spider, a long electric centipede and even a berserker with distorted vision. It can get pretty frantic as the timer constantly ticks down which encourages speedier results yet at 12 waves, it's all too brief and unless you're being the absolute best on your team, you likely won't even unlock the last tier until towards the end.When they talk of replay value, Gears 3 has an abundance of it although that depends on whether you actually want to tackle it. Gears rewards ribbons for completing certain challenges (3 headshots in a row, the most executions in a round etc) and also medals which are huge milestones such as completing x number of Wingman matches are getting x number of kills with a certain gun. But let's just say if you want to get all of them, you're going to be here a while: we're talking 6000 kills for each starting weapon, playing in 3000 matches of each gametype and executing your nemesis 500 times and there's a lot more that I haven't even mentioned. Want bang for your buck? Gears 3 has it but it could possibly backfire as you might decide the new Seriously 3.0 achievement might not be worth it considering how ridiculous the requirements are but it's a lofty goal to be sure.Like Resistance 3, the extra year of development definately paid off as top to bottom, a Gears fan would be quite happy with the end product. While you might have some grievances (overpriced on-disc DLC, that damn Sawed-off and bad spawns and that ridiculous achievement), those looking for an alternative to military shooters can't do wrong with Gears of War 3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005ME6O","reviewerName":"steven","summary":"A Masterpiece in Interactive Storytelling and Art","reviewText":"\"Silent Hill 2\" is about James a man who is searching the demonic town Silent Hill for his dead wife Mary. He doing this because he received a letter from Mary telling him she waiting for him in Silent Hill but as you play, you encounter James's demons and you must discover the true reason why he came to Silent Hill. The game is somewhat similar to Dostoyevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" as in you don't know why the protagonist did what he did till the end.  It's one of if not the best story's I've ever seen in a game.It's the most well designed game in terms of atmosphere, story, enemies and horror. Almost every little detail has a meaning and is relevant to the story.  All the enemies in Silent Hill are based on James's personal demons. So I don't spoiler anything I'll just say that you will run into other strange things relevant to James's life as you search for Mary.The gameplay is similar to the old school \"Resident Evil\" style but with melee weapons, as a traditional survival horror game,  so you can run past most enemies, and you spend most of your time searching for item's or looking the next object or location. This works great because of the great atmosphere and enemies. Some people complain about the clunky controls and lack of freedom with the camera, but Silent Hill isn't an action game, it doesn't want to reward you for fighting and the camera makes it seem like you're watching a movie.The game has the best soundtracks in any game. The sound effects and music match the great atmosphere perfectly, and adds to the horror element. I music so good that I actually have a playlist on my phone. Look up \"Silent Hill 2 Promise\" and \"Theme of Laura\" and your see what I mean.\"Silent Hill 2\" Does not use cheap jump scares or gore to scare you. Instead it creates tension and suspense so you will be scared even when there are no monsters around, it use's psychological horror instead of a few cheap jumps.You will meet several human characters in your journey through Silent Hill; all are some of the darkest and most interesting characters I've ever seen in a game. Sometimes they will affect gameplay. Sometimes one character, Maria, will accompany you is a sort of escort mission and there's other things other characters do that I won't spoiler. As their stories unfold it will make you more interested in how James's story will end.The game has multiple endings all of which are satisfying. Instead of giving you in game dialog decisions like most game with multiple endings, it analyses how you play. So if you run away from most enemies your get an ending more suited to your playing style then if you were to be more aggressive. It also keeps track of whether or not you do a good job protecting Maria or if you examine certain items will also change the outcome.  Plus there are a few joke endings for fun.Silent Hill 2 is my favorite ps2 game, my favorite horror game and one of my favorite games over all. It's a masterpiece in interactive storytelling and in my opinion is art.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2013"}

Howards Conan character.  I am a big fan of Conan, be it his adventures as penned by Robert E. Howard, the gorgeous artistic depiction of him and his world by the gifted artist Frank Frazetta and the entertaining and competent Arnold Scharzenegger films.  One area I had not yet seen Conan in was Video Games so I was immediately interested when I heard about this game.  There have been Conan games before, such as the MMO Age of Conan on PC (but you don't play as Conan) as well as Conan: The Dark Axe on Xbox (only released in Europe unfortunately), but this would be my first Conan gaming experience.  My reaction is mixed but in the end I have to say this is a pretty fun game and all Conan fans would do themselves a favor by picking it up for a mere [...]I went into this game not really knowing what to expect.  The reviews were mixed ranging from good to average to below average.  I really didn't care what other people had to say, I just wanted a fun Conan adventure.  The title screen was a good start where I was met with a pounding orchestral score which captures the essence of Conan perfectly.  I was immediately pumped and ready to make enemies eat my steel.  The artwork is not Frank Frazetta caliber but pleasing to the eyes nonetheless and seems to have a similar style to Frazetta, the greatest Fantasy artist to ever exist.The gameplay itself got off to a fast and intense start as well.  You will find yourself in a dungeon or temple of sorts hacking away at enemies and pulling off some rather impressive moves with ease.  You can make use of three different weapon classes: Single weapon with or without a shield, Dual Weapons and Two-handed Weapons.  There are swords, axes, scimitars, Sabers and other weapons all with various styles and forms you can use.  Pretty much any weapon an enemy is carrying, you can use for yourself.  In this beginning stage I was having a blast destroying everything in my path and paying very little attention to the tutorial which would pop up hints every now and then.  I was experimenting with different button combinations and discovering my own combos, it was great.  I was worried that a long list of combos would be intimidating and scare me off but the button combinations are surprisingly intuitive and easy to remember and pull off.  A simple combo would be hitting X three times while the more complex ones would throw in a Y and then a B at the end or start off with four presses of the X button and then two of the Y button or consist of four presses of X and holding it down on the fourth press.  The back button pulls up a list of all the combos and may intimidate you at first but you will get the hang of it and have a good time learning as you go.  I was spinning Conan around dishing out damage to multple enemies at once, decapitating foes in a delightfully gruesome manner, hacking off limbs, body slamming and suplexing weaklings, heabutting, punching, elbow smashing, high kicking, shield bashing, cleaving bodies in half, removing heads with an upward thrust of my shield, charging, ripping out hearts and even stealing an enemy's weapon and beating him to death with it.  I picked it all up very quickly and I don't play many hack and slash games these days.  Conan himself has cat like reflexes, is easy to control and every bit the warrior you expect him to be.  You will feel unstoppable.At the end of this first stage, Conan is searching for riches and bashes open a statue or container (I forget exactly what it was) and accidentally releases a Dark Wizard who had been imprisoned.  Good job Conan.  This Wizard isn't all that thankful for his freedom though and casts some type of spell that sends Conan flying through the air where he ends up floating in the sea.  This is where the story and real game begin.  The Wizard stripped Conan of his armor and used the pieces to empower creatures of his creation.  Conan must now track down the pieces of his armor, killing each creature and then put that pesky Wizard back where he belongs.At the beginning of the next stage Conan is washed up on to shore after having been adrift for days, according to the narrator (he was apparently floating face down according to the cut scene, but we'll ignore how he managed to breathe that whole time).  It is here on this beach where you start the real game and you will soon realize that you don't feel quite like the bad ass you were in the tutorial stage before you let the Wizard escape.  All of the impressive and brutal moves and combos I had access to have now been locked and I must unlock them one by one by gaining experience points.  The first stage was just a taste of things to come.  Pretty cool to get that taste, but I felt a little frustrated losing certain moves in particular.  According to the story, Conan was suffering a slight case of amnesia so he has to remember how to fight as he once did and what exactly happened in that temple.  Whatever, it's not important, let's get to killing.Conan can gain experience points to unlock moves by killing enemies and finding treasure chests.  He can also increase his health bar by activating runes as well as a \"song of death\" berzerker like ability and his magic bar (yes I said magic, more on this later).  Fighting consists of combos, rolling to dodge attacks, blocking by holding down the Left Trigger and parrying where you hit the Left Trigger at just the right time as an enemy strikes and deflect his blade leaving him open for an instant kill execution style.  These instant kills are fun but deflecting attacks can be pretty tough as the enemies get tougher later in the game so enjoy them while you can.  As mentioned before, Conan can use different fighting classes: single wield, dual wield, two handed wield.  Each one has its own combos that must be learned.  After unlocking a certain attack you can then \"master\" that attack by using it succcesfully a specific number of times to achieve a bonus at the end.  These bonuses consist of extra life power ups, experience points or magic power ups.  The combat system is pretty deep, flexible and fun to use.  Not every combo or weapon class will work against every enemy as effectively so you may find yourself experimenting which helps break up the monotony often found in a hack and slash.  Thankfully, Conan is not slow, he is surprisingly quick with his rolls, his jumps and when single wielding and double wielding.  There is a delay and lagging effect when he wields a two handed sword though and it can get frustrating.  Otherwise he has cat like reflexes.The camera in Conan is fixed at all times.  This can be both a good and bad thing.  In general the camera does its job well but there are times when you will be screaming for at least a zoom button so you can see where that off screen enemy is without having to approach him or get a better view of a platform jump you will have to make.  Not being able to move the camera can feel restrictive but it also adds an old school type of feel to the gameplay.  Like a 3D Golden Axe where you progress through a linear stage and kill enemies and open treasure chests for goodies.  Speaking of goodies, there are also bare chested maidens you can rescue on your way.  I don't see much nudity in games and don't really care one way or the other but it certainly fits in Conans world.  If this sort of thing offends you, I suggest you play a Harry Potter game or read a Politically Correct Anne McCaffrey novel which will come across as less degrading to women because they rule the world and talk to animals.  Conan lives in a savage and unforgiving world full of all forms of oppression, misogyny being one form.  Slavery being another, Conan himself was once a slave and forced into hard labor.  The gratuitous violence and nudity fit in well with the Dark Fantasy world Robert E. Howard gave to us.What does not fit in well with the Conan world is Conan using magic.  Conan hates magic and seeing him using it is like watching Superman play catch with a ball of Kryptonite - it makes NO SENSE.  Hopefully if there is another Conan game the developers will respect the lore a little bit more.  Having said that, the magic proves useful when needed.  A Conan game can be excellent without magic being needed, but we are forced to use it here and might as well.  You can temporarily turn enemies into stone, which works great on tougher enemies.  You can cast a plague of Ravens to attack enemies surrounding you (I only used this a couple of tmes, sometimes it worked, other times it didn't).  You can cast a meteor shower which kills anything in your immediate area and you can cast a void spell which sucks in all enemies around you (I actually never used this one, I tried to limit my magic use).  Magic does not effect bosses though.  You'll have to rely on your reflexes and steel for them.Bosses are pretty impressive in this game.  They are large multi-part bosses which have specific patterns you need to look out for.  My favorite was a very long battle with a very large Dragon early on in the game.  It felt like something out of a Zelda game and was quite intense.  Some boss battles are more frustrating than entertaining but all of them have some real thought put into them.  To kill a boss you need to look out for Quick Time Events (QTE's) which are flash prompts on the screen telling to press or tap a certain button at a certain time.  I hated when these were used in Prince of Persia but in Conan they are much easier to use and more rewarding as a result.  It is fun to watch Conan perform an elaborate execution on a boss when performing following the QTE's.The graphics in this game are a mixed bag.  ost of what you see looks rushed and rough around the edges but there is also plenty in the game which looks pretty good.  conan is not a bad looking game at all, it actually looks pretty good but there are constant graphical glitches and too many ugly moments which can be distracting.  The cut scenes are the worst offenders here where the 3D models lack detail and are incredibly stiff in the way they move.  Conan could have been a great looking game if more time and money was spent on it.  Nihilistic is a more than capable develoepr to do this.  My guess is THQ, not the richest of Publishers, limited their resources which is unfortunate.  Prince of Persia has a gorgeous art style which mixes in cel shading with traditional 3D graphics.  If Conan had used a similar system but with more of a Frazetta influence, it would easily have been the best looking game on the Xbox 360 console.  What we have here in Conan are mediocre graphics with some nice effects and pretty good art.  All of the bosses look great though and the combat looks good too.The sound in the game is pretty darn good.  The sound effects are visceral and a delight, the music is done by the same guy who did the music for God of War and is of a high quality which rivals the awesome soundtrack of the movies and the voice acting is competent.  Ron Perlman (Hellboy, Sons of Anarchy) voices Conan and does a decent job.  Perlman is a great actor and his voice fits Conan perfectly, at least compared to Arnold.  The problem with the voice acting is it sounds like they were just reading from a script, got paid, and left.  But it is not terrible and it's not like you'll be paying much attention to the rather lame story anyway.I don't even remember enough about the story to talk about it here.  basically, you accidentallty free a Dark Wizard who steals your armor and uses it to create creatures to wreak havoc on the world.  Early int he game you run into a female adventurer (not topless, and perfectly self sufficient) who helps you on your journey (she doesn't want the world to end either you know).  As you gather pieces of your armor, you gain a new spell.  Conan does not like magic but he figures he has to use the magic now in his armor so he can battle the Wizard he set free.  He doesn't like using magic it but he got himself into this mess and now must get himself out (a sorry explanation for his use of magic).  The story is lame.  One could only hope a future Conan game actually follows one of the actual Conan stories written by R.E.H. himself.So the game itself is good hack and slash fun.  The story is garbage, but the ending is pretty cool.  The graphics look like they could have been special if more time was put in but instead we get a mixed bag of rough and glitchy visuals with some eye candy.  The enemy A.I. tends to glitch now and then as well but the boss battles are definitely impressive and it's nice to see large multi-part bosses back in games these days.It's a decent game well worth the [...] you can get it for these days.  Nihilistic is a talented developer and Conan is an awesome license.  THQ should have put more money and time into this project because they could have had something special here.  It reminds me of another Hack and Slash I played on Xbox a couple years ago, Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance.  Gladiator was actually a better game in terms of graphics and combat mechanics but it was too short (Gladiator took me 6 hours on hard, Conan took me almost 11) and the bosses were nowhere near as impressive as those found in Conan.  God of War is an obvious influence on Conan but that is a highly polished and heavily budgeted game (If only Conan got that treatment).My letter grade for Conan would be a C+","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2009"}

Naw, but it is damn good","reviewText":"After reading reviews that Dead Space was the second coming of the original Resident Evil, I decided I'd give it a try. Review sites were claiming it to be \"the scariest game evar!\" Hell, when I picked the game up from a local store I was boldly told, \"within two minutes of gaining control of your character, you will jump out of your skin!\" Eagerly, I rushed home, ready for my next jolt of adrenaline. So, it was with a pair of rubber underwear (I kid...or do I?) and some excitement that I set out to see what dark terrors Dead Space would contain.Turns out there's not much here we haven't seen before. No, I didn't jump two minutes into the game...and in fact the first chapter felt pretty tame. Monsters pop out of vents or can be seen in the distance, usually followed by a loud \"DUN!\" from the soundtrack. Maybe I've grown so hardened from my years of playing horror games that the thrills in Dead Space don't amount to much. I'm also wondering who these reviewers are. If Dead Space is so terrifying to them, I'd hate to see what'd happen if they got their hands on F.E.A.R. or Condemned, for example, two games that have made me jump out of my skin.Things improve as the story continues, though, with some disturbing images (usually involving a crazed survivor) and some stick with me, even now. The game does improve on its terror level, the further in you get and there are some shocking moments, both in terms of graphic depictions but also in a \"holy crap, I'm being dragged by a tentacle\" way.  But, as a personal opinion, I've never really been fond of the silent protagonist. And here we have not only Isaac, the mute, but Isaac the faceless since he's always holed up behind some mask. Sure there is a personal story here for him, what with his girlfriend stuck on the ship somewhere, but it never really clicked for me simply because Isaac felt like a doll and not a real person.This isn't to say Dead Space is a bad game, just the opposite! I had an absolute blast playing it because what it does, it does exceedingly well. The weapons are never your cliched space marine-type fare, which brings a fresh feel to the game. They can be \"leveled up\" via work benches, and you can really design both your suit and your weapons to fit your play style. Dead Space also controls amazingly well and you'll never feel like the game is hampering you by horrible movement. The graphics are pretty damn awesome, especially in terms of the grotesque monster designs (which remind me of The Thing) and the animations. The concept of \"strategic dismembering\" is also a fun little twist of the genre, as you'll find yourself blowing the hell out of their limbs, just to keep them from coming at you.I also appreciate how each level feels completely different from the last and EA has truly made the Ishimura come alive. When I first heard that the game took place on a ship, I was worried. Usually that means the same old corridors and bad level design, but here it means a fully realized space ship. Breaking up the action are sections taking place in zero-G areas, which are great, and some puzzles that require you to utlize the environment.All in all, and even though I don't share the opinion that it's the scariest game ever, Dead Space is a terrific game. The plot is very intriguing and pulls you along, but it's everything else that really adds up to making it what it is. In the end, Dead Space feels more like Aliens than Alien, and that ain't shabby.Definitely recommend a purchase.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0044SA70M","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"A Beautiful Fantasy Romp","reviewText":"Role-playing games are often deep and immersive, however rarely do they offer combat mechanics that are fluid and fun. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning changes all of that, though. 38 Studios and Big Huge games have somehow made something darn near perfect when it comes to blending role-play mechanics and action game mechanics into one package. It's quite a feat considering how easy it would've been to mess this all up, as many developers have promised this far too many times before, but this time it's finally worked out, and we're left with a fantastic game that handles both the \"RPG\" and \"action combat\" parts so well.The gameplay is definitely more on the action/arcade side, as it's not stilted or slow. The combat is super fluid and fun to partake in. However, it's also totally possible to stealth your way through slowly in some scenarios and take out your enemies. All forms of play are good from what I've played. I'm using magic most of the time, which looks and plays incredible. Beyond the combat, you have NPCs to talk to, lots of loot to collect, and so much more to do and see in the world of Amalur. It's really a pleasure to roam around and play in this world, and you'll be doing that for a very long time, as this game's quite a lengthy adventure.On the graphics front, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning looks beautiful. To be fair, it's not exactly pushing any technological barriers as far as realism goes, but instead it sets out to create a more whimsical and colorful world that is an absolute joy to wander around in. Forget dull and murky environments, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is lush and colorful. This game's graphics are a true delight if you're at all interested in art direction that's a bit more colorful and vibrant.Honestly, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning took me by surprise, as it's a far better game than I expected it to be. I'll be playing this for a while to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2012"}

Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Matt Mabry","summary":"What the....Only $36 that's Absurd!","reviewText":"This is the BEST game EVER (Triple Underline that). Yeah, I said it, this is THE BEST GAME EVER!!! Better than Jak, Better than GTA: San Andreas, even bettere than HALO. Wait, rewind that...even bettere than HALO...Huh, I guess I did say that.But truthfully all of the other PS2 games shouldn't be within 3 feet of this game. Yeah, there are some really good games out now, but this is THE game for the 4th Quarter of 2004 Hands down. I'm so sure you'll like this that I'll personally pay you $50 if you don't like it...then slap you in the face for being a complete moron.The Insomniac games company has come up with another gem. Over the years Insomniac games has come out with some of THE premier games, from the original Rachet and Clank, to R&C;: Going Commando. But by far, this one takes the cake. Not only because it is more evolved than the others, but it just has an all around 'complete' feal.But you just can't understand how great this game is. I mean the graohics are the same as the previous games by keeping 1 step ahead of the competition, and it still has the cutting- edge look.But the weapons this time are unbelievable. Yeah, they were good in the 1st and 2nd one, but these weapons are just off the wall insane. All of the weapons are more powerful. You start off with a massive blaster cannon that beats the snot out of most of the guns you got in the last game. Also you've still got your crazy guns, like 'The Sucker', It's like a warped hoover vacuum cleaner that sucks up your foes and can use you're hoovered up enemies as missles and launch them into other bad guys. Then you have the plasma Whip, which is mike a flaming whip that Rachet can crack in the face of foes. Very lethal and powerful. Next up is 'the infector' which spits out a big ball of 'snot' that infects and enemy and turns them agains their 'friendlies' before they ultimately die. There's so many more, but if I named them all you'd never finish.Also now the whole plot to this story is that Rachets home planet of Veldin (You remember this planet from the 1st one...don't you?) And Rachet feels oligated to go back and save his home planet. The coolest part of the game is that you are always fighting alongside a 6 man 'team' of Galactic Rangers. I say 'team' because it always seems like 2-3 of them get blown away on the freefall into battle and the rest of them run away at the first sign of danger. But still tis makes for some solid, all out frantic gunfights. It gets really caotic and is tons of fun. Also this game is more based on strategy, you're pretty much outnumbered all throughout this game, So you have to hid behind an obstacle, the pop out and frantically take out as many guys as you can.The character animation and voices are spot on. This game lives up to the hype because of it's deep storyline and also just because it's hilarious. No difference from the rest here, it still remains a top notch job. In fact our favorite Insane Superhero, Captain Qwark gets yet another repreval and he's just as funny.And now there's online, which is a Riot to play. It's tons of fun to battle with your buddies or even against them. It's all like a huge cartoon war. It's like SOCOM, with warped guns and crazy characters. Enough Said.Here's a little Rundown of the Game:Fun: 12/10 Blasting hundreds of baddies with some of the most warped guns ever created, How could it get any better, I ask?Gameplay: 10/10 same old Rachet and clank mania.Graphics: 15/10 1 step ahead has become a stardard for the whizzes at Insomniac.Difficulty: 13/10 This one is MUCH harder than the others...but, out numbered with limited ammo is just the way I like it. have I mentioned this is a HARD game?Overall: 50/40 Wow, what a rush, this game is a BEASTAs I've said before, this is THE prremier game of the year. Forget all of those other games, like GTA and even HALO, those games are miles behind this game. They're not even in the same league. If this game was rated in football terms, All other games are like a High School football game, and this one is like the Pro Bowl. It's honestly that good.Buy it, No need to even try it first, this game is THAT good.

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVUA","description":"","reviewerName":"RJ","summary":"Was very doubtful but was won over","reviewText":"So I like most had no intention of even giving Microsoft a chance. I got my PS4 and am happy with it. However I on a whim decided to give MS a chance. So I bought an Xbox One and I have to say I'm glad I did.First off the good:The HDMI input is amazing. It really has changed how I watch tv. It's nice to be able to be watching tv and immediately jump into any game I have loaded in the disc slot or on the HDD. The ability to turn on my tv, cable box, and console with a simple push of my controllers button or with my voice when I come in from work is nice.The games look great also and run well. I have decided to go all digital on my Xbox One this generation and it's been fun. Every game at my fingertips. No fussing with cases etc.At the same time blu-ray playback is fine. It's bare bones but I don't really care because I just want to watch the movies.Now the downsides:Kinect voice control is 50/50 at best. I've gone out of my way to set it up properly and yet only half the time does it still recognize what I'm saying. It's just faster to use a controller most of the time. This brings me to another complaint. Microsoft for the love of god please release a media remote for this console. Sure I can use my controller but this isn't as good as having a media remote would be.The install times for games before you can even play them is a bit on the long side. With PS4 I can play a game after a couple minutes. With the Xbox One it can take 30 minutes plus before I can start a game and then I can't play some parts of it. This is one area MS needs to improve. At the same time the menus and operating system of the console takes some steps back. Everything is basically an app within the OS. This results in a very clunky experience. I click to go into friends and I get a loading screen. I click to go to messages and get a loading screen. I click to go to the store and loading screen. Seeing a trend here? Also I would like to see notifications when friends come on and go offline. This simply isn't there.  It isn't all bad though. I do like how MS allows you to pin the apps and games you want to a section right to the left of the home screen. They however need to work on a way to sort it. As it is now that is very clunky. It's like with the 360 where you move an item to the front. It's in a square grid though. I'd like to be able to sort from left to right in alphabetical order. Instead it has items up and down from right to left.The last thing is that there is absolutely no option to sign you in automatically without Kinect and no management of your storage on the console.Overall though the console is a good console and I've had a lot of fun with mine. I just hope that MS can make some improvements to their OS. I'm honestly glad I bought the console and have no problem eating crow.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

But it had obvious shortcomings, the main one being that, as with any system, you can't please everyone. What is a plus to one person is a minus to another. With that in mind, the Gamebody Advance SP sets the standard for handheld systems with it's unique and intuitive design.The most obvious improvement is the backlight, which can be turned on and off. It evenly and brightly lights up the screen, making the games playable under any condition. My biggest qualm with the original model was the fact that a light was not an option, and all the light peripherals (like the &quot;UFO&quot; light) were garbage. The SP is crisp, clear, and makes gameplay less taxing, especially on darker games like Castlevania and Metroid Fusion.My favorite improvement, by far, is the folding design. My older GBA (glacier) got more than a few dings and scratches on the screen, just by general use and abuse in my bag. The SP folds neatly, thus protecting the screen. The keypad is still the same, but it can be cumbersome on the first play, since all the buttons are together below the screen, instead of either side.Also adding value is the rechargable battery, which will save gamers loads on replacements everytime the battery runs low. It takes a while to charge, but it provides more than enough time to enjoy your games in one sitting.The flaws are minor at the worst of times. The biggest one being the lack of a headphone jack, which is bad considering that I have always enjoyed the nastalgic SNES music. The long charging time is also a flaw, but not enough to make it a big inconvenience. Overall, the flaws are few and far between.I bought the GBA SP the first day it came out, and I couldn't be happier with it. I can now play anywhere, at any time, without squinting my eyes, or tilting in order to see better. It was a great idea from Nintendo, and the SP will likely be the standard by which all handheld systems will be judged in the future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2003"}

I wish I hadn't.  ETM's plot runs parallel to the events of the Matrix Reloaded.  The gameplay in this game I thought was very fun and exhilirating but soon got a little repetitive.  What really brings this game down are the numerous bugs and pathetically designed driving and flying levels.  Some of the many bugs include echoeing voices during cutscenes (making it virtually impossible to understand what they're saying), players actually can get stuck in one place, all because of a glitch.  There are some parts on the game that actually freeze (everytime you get to that point) making it impossible to even complete the game, on some retail copies that is.  The enviroments are lacking texture and depth.  The levels are dull and unimagitave.  The driving and flying missions are just horrendous.  The driving physics are all out of wack; when you hit a bump you go flying in the air and normally land on your side or hit a wall.  The flying mission lacked any kind of ingenuity.  It was extremely easy and boring.  After a time (on a normal mission) your health regenerates automatically making the game very easy.  Although this game does have its upsides.  It has nearly an hour of actual exclusive movie fotage, a cool cheat/hacking system, and awesome looking but easy to perform fighting.  It took me about 4 hours to beat it with each character.

I got very mad because the enemy turned around and killed me. The maps are distant but need better maps like more big area or big space. Everything seems to close for the players.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Steven Rinck","summary":"A disappointing end for Solid Snake","reviewText":"I've been a fan of the series all along (you can view some of my previous reviews), so keep in mind this review is someone who has been a fan of the series all along.  I have played every canon metal gear game up to the point of this one's release (ie every MSX/playstation/PSP release except the acid series), and even some that weren't.  It's hard for me to say this....but this game is not that good.GRAPHICSNothing wrong here.  In face, it's some of the best I've ever seen.MECHANICSThis is my major gripe.  Metal Gear is a game focusing on stealth.  Traditionally in the series, you get past enemies by either avoiding them entirely, or separating them and taking them down before they're aware of you; Aka direct combat is usually either a set-piece / boss battle, or punishment for screwing up.  This game punishes the hell out of you.- Camouflage is 100% useless.  Even with a 95% rating, lying prone and unmoving you will constantly be spotted by guards from far away.  If they have line of sight to you (and they all have about about 270 degrees of sight), they will spot you instantly, even from a great distance.- Most means of evading enemies once spotted don't work (ie lockers, cardboard box etc).  I tried utilizing them 100s of times (not after being spotted; ie when they find a dead body three rooms over), and NONE OF THEM EVER WORKED EVEN ONCE.  All enemies make a Bee-line for your current position (even if you're not spotted, but they see a clue like a downed body).  Usually changing areas or crawling into a vent unnoticed are the only means of escaping detection.  When detected in most areas, enemies will spawn and attack you indefinitely; no such thing as cleaning out the area.  Cardboard boxes didn't even help me evade detection when I wasn't in a caution/alert mode and was tucked into a corner with other actual cardboard boxes.- Enemies are very frequently scripted to do things when you're getting close (not because they detect you, but merely because you're at a certain point in the game) like modifying their patrol routes, checking out the passage you're coming down etc.  In order to get by undetected you usually have to know the change in their behavior is about to happen so you can trigger it and immediately move to a place that avoids or counters their changed behavior.  Reacting to the situation in progress without coming to blows is almost impossible, excepting if you are very quick with the mk22 tranq pistol (which I was, but see below).- While the game may look like multiple paths exist...they really don't.  Almost anytime there's a branching path, every path but one has an infinite enemy-respawn at that point.  This either leads to a never-ending battle, or the ridiculousness of having DOZENS of sleeping enemies (if you go the tranq route and are a quick shot) because one, two or three immediately run around from the corner the instant you eliminate/tranq a guy...until they all start waking up...and then you've got the never ending battle again.- You can be trying to hide in the ranks of an advancing militia, but the moment *you* fire a shot (even if you kill the guy and no other enemy has line of sight to you) the entire PMC goes into alert mode and starts spawning enemies to come after *you*.- I frequently found it easier, even on the higher difficulties (that's right, I played it again...I really, really wanted to like this game) to just run through crowds of enemies instead of making any attempt at stealth.In short, the gameplay is lousy.  The worst in the entire series except for Portable Ops (and that is lousy mostly because of the limited PSP controls).PRESENTATIONMost other reviewers mention the cutscenes.  Metal gear has always been long-winded.  The series has always been wordy (even the early MSX games had pages of dialogue in an era where most games had 1-2 sentences). but this takes it to ridiculous levels.  I still can't tell if the ending of the game is a parody or not; in one scene a dying man appears to pass away no less than 10 times during a 45 minute monologue, only to start talking again.  The game will spend a 30 minute cut scene to give you 10 seconds of information.  Even skipping cutscenes (just because of the loading between each one) can make you spend upwards of 10 minutes between gameplay sequences.  This game took me over 40 hours on my first playthrough, and less than 6 on my second (harder difficulty) playthrough where I skipped cutscenes.PLOTI thought it would be hard to get worse than MGS2 in this department.  The game does finally explain away many plot threads it's been hinting at for 10 years (and by hinting I mean hammering you in the face with, but with critical bits conflicting or incomplete).  The plot in this one is unbelievably dumb.  I mean that in the literal sense.  You know how in some games enemies do stupid things like stock large amount of clearly-labeled barrels of high-explosives for no reason and then use them to take cover behind in a fire fight?  Stretch that level of stupid out into a 25-hour narrative arc and you've got the main plot thread for this game.  Many of these revelations are disappointing and feel pulled out of thin air, but at least they're resolved.  Well, most of them are.  I still can't fully understand what the whole Liquid-Ocelot story is.  Many of the character motivations are completely screwy at the conclusion, not to mention one character's in particular is in complete contradiction to events at the finale of the game.  Without spoiling the feature-film length ending: the game (I mean entire Metal Gear Series) teased at the ending it deserved, and then blew past it to ruin it.To reference previous games in the series...I had high hopes for the ending of this, especially after the Masterpiece that is MGS3.  Sadly, this game took *everything* that was wrong with MGS2's story, pumped it full of steroids (or should I say nanomachines?) and ruined every good thing about the gameplay it had been developing since the first playstation release.  A Terrible entry into one of gaming's best franchises, and an extreme disservice to one of my favorite videogame characters for over 20 years.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0000A0MDV","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"The \"Real Driving Simulator's\" legacy continues...","reviewText":"Whether you love, hate, or could care less about racing games, the Gran Turismo series deserves respect. Since its inception in 1998, the game has gone through four iterations on two different consoles and sold over 35 million copies worldwide. Countless photos have been shot, hours of engine revs and tire screeches recorded, all in a quest to create the most realistic driving simulator on the market. As far as realism is concerned, the game has certainly made its mark -- even Toyota and BMW have used it to show off their new toys in a \"virtual test drive.\" Now, after countless delays, Kazunori Yamauchi's Gran Turismo 4 is here. It's lost a few formerly touted features (online mode), and gained a few others (the B-Spec manager mode), but in the end, it fulfills nearly all our expectations. Once the title screen graces your monitor, two options immediately present themselves: arcade and Gran Turismo mode. The initial selection of vehicles is limited, but when you consider the game sports more than 700 cars (including special editions, prototypes, and model variants), \"limited\" is not a term that befits the overall game. In addition to the single race and time trial options, arcade mode is also the hub for multiplayer action. Gran Turismo 4 supports two players via split-screen on a single PlayStation 2 or up to six players via a local network. Online play is not officially supported -- Sony is planning to release an online-capable version later this year -- but those who aren't afraid to muck with their computer can perform some networking black magic to race online. The trick is to use tunneling software, such as the completely free XLink Kai -- it's not as elegant as proper support, but it works. The real meat and potatoes is found in the Gran Turismo mode. It's here that you can easily lose yourself for hours (literally, some of the endurance races can take hours to complete), building up your car collection by purchasing and winning new vehicles, as well as tuning the ones in your garage to perfection. This is also where you'll unlock new cars and tracks for play throughout the game. Much like earlier releases in the series, players will need to pass a number of license tests before they're allowed to race. While somewhat frustrating, the tests serve an important function: getting you accustomed to the game's physics engine and control setup. Changes made to how the cars are modeled mean even masters of Gran Turismo 3 will need a refresher course in handling. In terms of control, Gran Turismo 4 offers three ways to get behind the wheel. There is the standard Dual Shock 2 controller, the Logitech Driving Force wheel (otherwise known as the GT3 wheel) and the Logitech Driving Force Pro (specifically for GT4). Playing with the Dual Shock 2 will not require any configuration, but if you plan on using a wheel, tweaking the setup options is a necessity. Of the three, the Driving Force Pro offers the most realistic method of control, complete with a full 900-degrees rotation (2.5 turns) -- just like a real car. The wheel also offers a reasonable level of force feedback, helping the player to judge approximate speed when taking a corner. If you're too friendly with the accelerator you can actually feel the wheels slip as you power around a curve. On the downside, all of the cars in the game are more squirrelly with the wheel than with the Dual Shock 2. This means you are more likely to spin out until you learn the limits of your car. Once past that initial learning curve though, the Driving Force Pro is the definite controller of choice. With a first license under your belt, it's time to run races. The more races you win, the more money you earn to buy cars and mods. Some mods are purely performance tweaks, while others are prerequisites for races -- for example, you cannot race on an off-road track until you purchase a set of dirt tires. Owners of Gran Turismo 3 start with a bit of an advantage, assuming you didn't delete the prior save from your memory card. Up to 100,000 credits can be transferred to Gran Turismo 4 -- not bad for buying your first car. Competing against the game's artificial intelligence is a mixed bag, because the virtual drivers have been tuned to keep to the racing line at all costs. This means that the AI players will have no issues with slamming right into your car if you happen to get in the way. They also don't hesitate to cut you off by passing right in front of your car, and then immediately slamming on the brakes. This is something of a departure from the series' tagline \"The Real Driving Simulator.\" Another point of frustration is the AI's ability to \"learn your play style\" and react accordingly. The idea is that if you drive aggressively, so does the computer. The problem is the computer can misinterpret beginner errors as aggressive driving -- accidentally hit them and soon you'll have cars bumping into you to cut short the apex of a turn. Get behind after crashing and you'll need to give up hope of finishing first. As an alternative to directly driving the car, Gran Turismo 4 offers the B-Spec method. Similar to the \"coach control\" in sports games, B-Spec puts a professional driver in the car and gives you the role of team manager. From your vantage point on the track, you issue strategic commands, instructing him on when to pass and when to play it safe. B-Spec isn't for everyone, but it can be entertaining and convenient -- especially when running an endurance race. Tell your driver to keep it steady and come back in an hour to check on his progress. In addition to the event type races, players can also enter car specific competitions at the dealer of your choice. Think of them as car club races, where all the owners of a particular model get together for friendly fun. It makes for a nice change of pace and can be a good way to learn a track. When the original Gran Turismo first debuted, its visual impact was huge. Gran Turismo 4 shows us how far the series has come by including tracks from the original game, fully rendered in its shiny new engine... and the comparison is night and day. But for all its glitz, the visuals are more a step-up from Gran Turismo 3 than a revolutionary jump in quality. To be fair, this is more due to the PlayStation 2's limitations -- Polyphony has clearly used every trick in the book to coax the last ounce of horsepower out of Sony's aging hardware. Each car is comprised of more than 5,000 polygons, allowing for plenty of detail in the models. You can actually see the weight shift as your car brakes or takes high-speed turns, from both cockpit and follow-cam view. Nighttime races don't feature the overabundance of lighting effects as seen in the likes of Need for Speed Underground 2, so they're a little underwhelming. But the daytime tracks are absolutely gorgeous -- especially the outdoor environments such as El Capitan in Yosemite National Park and the Tahiti maze. Replays allow for both a traditional playback as well as a music-video styled presentation, complete with jarring camera angles, oversaturated lighting, shifting white balance, and enough quick cuts to would make MTV proud. For the budding photographer, a virtual photo mode allows you to take your own shots from within the game. 64 cameras present every conceivable angle, and each can be moved, rotated, zoomed. You can also add options like shutter speed, white balance, F-stop, and saturation. Photos can even be saved to the memory card or USB stick and then ported onto a PC in standard JPEG format. For the truly technically savvy, Sony allows you to connect select Epson printers via the USB port and print photos directly from the game. It's geek-tastic! In addition to the replay photos, a \"Photo Travel\" option allows you to setup a photo shoot in one of 15 locations around the world. While not an action shot, you do have more control over these posed images. Despite its overall good looks, Gran Turismo 4 has a few flaws in its glossy exterior. All of the tracks (including the off-road rally tracks) have an impenetrable invisible barrier at the edge. It's impossible to slide off the track or cut a turn by clipping a plastic fence -- modern rally games have long since solved this issue. And the retro \"cardboard cutout crowd\" phenomenon is also present. In the end, Gran Turismo 4 is one hell of a detailed racing simulation that promises to steal as many hours of gameplay as its predecessors did. It may be short on innovation, which is surprising with close challengers like Konami's Enthusia and Microsoft's Forza in the pipeline, but racing enthusiasts won't be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2005"}

You need to stop letting Black Box develop any more installments to the Need For Speed franchise.

I forgave Black Box for the disastrous Undercover when it was released, but now I'm not willing to give them another chance.Unless Black Box really get's their crap together and starts making quality games for the series, they should be fired immediately.

{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Party Down","reviewText":"There are just so many delightful game Nintendo has been able to create for one of the most successful game systems ever, the Gamecube. Arguably, to create a smash game that was brought up from the Nintendo 64 era is quite amazing. That has happened with the successful Mario Party franchise from the N64 era. It was one of the surprising games ever developed back in the 90's. To do it again for the Gamecube was quite a surprise. While so many additions have been added, the Gamecube debut was very well put. It just added on so much from before, nothing but the roll of the dice was missed.Mario Party 4 for the Nintendo Gamecube, the Gamecube debut consists of so many outrageous boards, and games to uncover. The game also adds some new details including a tougher story mode, and a whole bunch of new features, new boards like Bowser's Party, new mini, and mega mushrooms, and 50 great mini-games to unlock, such as Mario Speedwagon. The graphics look much better than they did for the N64, and the gameplay has improved nicely. Yet, with all the hype, there are a few disadvantages the game has. One of them is the games take a little longer to load up, unlike the N64 versions which were a instant. Another disadvantage is that it might not seem as challenging for Gamecube players, as much as Mario Party veterans have matched before.Still, Mario Party 4 makes a great virtual board game feel for anybody who wants to roll those dice on the Gamecube. While you can right now only find this game used, it is still a great purchase for anybody wants to play. It doesn't add up solo, but if you're playing with others, it is a real party to match.Graphics: B+Sound: B-Control: A-Fun & Enjoyment: B if you are playing solo; B+ if you're playing against someoneOverall: B 1/2+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2005"}

For example in the first game when trying to reach a ledge or the edge you had to use flap flip which for the first game it was impressive but in some cases that was a pain, so it's improved in the second game allowing Banjo to do so and grab an edge and then get up onto whatever and wherever he was trying to get. Egg shooting is also improved allowing for a airborne egg aiming and for a sniper like feel to it and allowing you to focus on the target your shooting. The advanced moves do really help, even some of the cheats you get in this game help like honey back, allowing health to come back overtime, and fall proof so you don't lose health falling from high places. There all kinds of different things that can be done in this game. its amazing. The bosses are definitely difficult, compared to the last game, and while the witch was difficult to beat in the first game, its even harder in this one as her health is even higher in this game, and she is twice as powerful.

Now, for the first time, players can see true depth of their environment without the need for special glasses. Super Mario is a 3D evolution of classic Mario platforming featuring new level designs and challenges.","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Mario Mania","reviewText":"There is no question about Mario. He has not only been the most influential video game character of all time, but has had honestly the most definitive impact on how we play great platform games that have never lost their luster. Over 25 years after Super Mario Brothers debuted, people still love to go for the flag, and try to knock Bowser off his perch all to save Princess Toadstool from the claws of the king. The game franchise has never honestly gotten old, and has stayed just as strong today for every Nintendo era. The last Mario platformer for the go handheld was New Super Mario Brothers for the Nintendo DS. It really was fun and entertaining for the DS, and Mario's Wii games like Super Mario Galaxy have changed the way we play with Mario in zero gravity. But now with the Nintendo 3DS which came out just last Spring, they haven't yet had a definitive Mario platformer. Well, they are about to have one now, and a little treat for the fans young and old of the past 25 years too.Super Mario 3D Land, is a new and exciting Mario game that still shows how amazing the Mario games have never gotten old. The game brings in a new twist on the classic 2D platformers by bringing back some of the amazement from the classic Super Mario Brothers 3. Just like what New Super Mario Bros. Wii did by bringing back the forgotten Koopa kids and giving them a hard-hitting challenge against Mario. This time it is the beloved tanooki racoon suit returning to the mix from Mario 3 returns, as shown in the story of the game, as well as the classic foe Boom-Boom. As Bowser not only captures Peach, but steals a bunch of tanooki leaves giving Bowser, and his cohorts tanooki powers to try and stop Mario from his wrath on the Mushroom Kingdom. It is challenging as characters like the classic goomba and Boo now can go against Mario with tanooki racoon tails to try and swat you. But that isn't just it alone, Mario also has new elements of power at his side too: including the tanooki leaf, the classic mushroom, as well as the new Boomerang power-up, which Mario can throw boomerangs at his foes and they will come back to him at his side, just like the classic Boomerang Brothers from Super Mario 3.The gameplay takes all the elements from the classic Mario games in both 2D and 3D like Super Mario 64, and giving them a 3D twist by having you race against the clock trying to make it to the goal before time runs out. There are also classic items to be found including the bonus coins, and warp pipes, as well as a few new treats as well. The gameplay is very addictive from start to finish, and has shown that they haven't gotten old. The controls are also very simple and easy to master on each level, as you leap from block to block, and hopping in pipe to pipe, all trying to make your way to the goal. The sound is also classic Mario as well, by not getting old, and remaining distinctive as before. It takes timing and a lot of guts to master this new adventure, but honestly die hard Mario fans will definitive love this new challenge, as well as new ones too.All in all, Super Mario 3D Land is a definite must buy game for the Nintendo 3DS. It truly has shown that no matter what the gaming universe has to come around, Mario has still been a great constant in the gaming universe that continues to evolve and be just as fun today as it did back then. I definitely love the challenge this game has, and I know this will be a great game for you to play on the Nintendo 3DS (and only available on the Nintendo 3DS.) There haven't been a lot of definitive games for the Nintendo 3DS since last Spring, but this is definitely one of them that I absolutely recommend.Graphics: A-Sound: A-Control: AFun & Enjoyment: AOverall: A-","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0030HM2WO","description":"Amazon.com Product Description","reviewerName":"teejay","summary":"Better than the movie games, not better than Transformers (Armada) for PS2","reviewText":"When I first heard of this game, my overall reaction was \"meh\". Although I'm an old school Transfan going back to my childhood,  I never really expected this IP to get a decent treatment after the horrendous Bay films (the first one was OK, but the second one was just depressing).  Upon seeing the first trailer for this game and realizing they were going G1 (after a fashion) however, my curiosity was piqued.So I went out and got this game on release for the PS3. Picked up the GS preorder for the Shockwave unlock.  My first impression was \"it takes 5 minutes to verify the build EACH TIME the game loads? uhhhhh not good\".  You read that right. Each time you start the game, before you get to the main menu (but after 3 different FMV videos), the game does a self-check that takes 2-5 minutes to complete. EACH TIME. So that sucks.  OK, so how about the game?So lets get this out of the way first: Peter Cullen: great, as usual. As far as I can tell, no other original voice actors were involved, but in general the level of voice acting was pretty good, and they even went so far as to properly vocode Soundwave's voice.  In general, the characters all felt right, when we saw them on screen during cutscenes. Which, by the way, are the best part of this game.First take on the single player campaign - ok we get to choose from three different transformers each level - level one gives Megatron, Brawl, & Breakdown. I think the choice here is obvious. Megatron is a tank in this game but feels just a wee-bit underpowered for his namesake, but overall, not terrible, although the low max ammo for his fusion cannon was irritating.  2ND stage was decepticon seekers,  Starscream being the obvious choice here, and this time the character felt more appropriate. 3rd level gave the chance to play Soundwave, which felt underpowered again, but this time moreso than Megs - soundwave is a \"scientist\", which gives him a (useless for single player) healing gun, and a weak rifle for his weapon loadout. Fortunately we can pick up different weapons as the level progresses.  Each character has a special ability or two as well, but most of the time it felt like a lost oppurtunity.  Soundwave, for example, could deploy a \"drone\" that is basically a floating machine gun turret.  Obviously, if this had been a cassette robot, that would have been much cooler and could have more or less satisfied the same game mechanic.  Megs' special is a life-sucking attack which would have been cool except it's really hard to judge if you have an enemy in range for it or not, and if you miss, you still expend a charge.  Other characters have completely useless force-push attacks, or marginally useful cloaks.  The hovering ability is useless as it basically locks you in place and makes you an easy target.The transformations here also seem a bit uninspired.  Obviously there is precedent in some choices (making Megatron a tank, for example), but some just feel shoehorned in to fit the gameplay.  Soundwave, for example, turns into some generic hover-vehicle, when it could've been a lot more interesting if he turned into something more creative.  In the cartoon, when he was on cybertron, you saw his trasnformation into something that looked like a streetlamp, but that left a lot to the imagination. Was he some kind of spying device(probably)? what could he do? perhaps he could transform and be rooted, but blend into the scenery while controlling one (or more) cassette robots, or hack defenses, or provide intel.  Sadly, all he does is turn into a cybertronian truck. Blaster doesn't even make an appearance, nor do any of the combiners (in combined form, at any rate). Oh well, there's always next year...And that's about how the game continues.  The banter between characters is entertaining but not anything we haven't heard before, if not for the fact that it does sound fairly authentic.  The problem is for the most part it feels detached from the game itself, like some audio track from an episode of the cartoon semi-randomly overlaid on otherwise silent gameplay.  Speaking of which, the gameplay itself is fairly generic 3rd-person shooter fair, although with a vehicle/transformation mechanic thrown in. It works, but it's not great. The complaints you're hearing elsewhere (generic levels, lack of cover-sticking, infuriating lack of ammo, and my personal pet peeve, unlimited hordes of enemies that don't stop until you advance, which works with low-ammo problem to become even more irritating) are all totally valid and what really keep this game from being a AAA title.  I'll say right now I haven't played the multiplayer too much because frankly its hard to find people playing. The game lobby said each time I was on that there were about 6200 people online, but all the game lobbies were empty.  I had some more luck finding a coop campaign level playing, but it seemed like I was just randomly dropped in some guys level, which I kinda wasn't thrilled with. I'd rather start a level from scratch.So how do I feel about this game? It's OK. Not great, but OK.  A buy for Transformers fans, definately, as the treatment of the source material is the best part about this game (there are a lot of easter eggs for those who know the g1 series well).  It easily ranks as the 2nd best TF game behind the 2004 PS2 game, but if you strip the TF skin, the game is a fairly underwhelming shooter.  While not quite ready for the primetime, there IS a lot of potential here, and hopefully High Moon will get to make a sequel and polish the rough edges.Definately worth a rent, probably worth a buy if you're a big Transformers fan.  Better than the last two TF Movie based games, but not better than the fantastic Armada based PS2 game, whose only flaw was the mysterious lack of humans on Earth.  FYI that game, titled simply \"Transformers\" is $5 on amazon - and you should go play that immediately if you like this game, because while this game is OK, the PS2 Transformers game does all the same things better, with an additional mini-con (power-up/weapon) collecting meta-game thrown as well.  The only thing War for Cybertron has on TF 2004 is the multiplayer.3 generic robots out of 5.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2010"}

Arriving at the hospital, the boy is sucked into a Vortex Field, into a dark mirror-image of his world. When he learns our world is ending to make room for this new one, he'll do what he can to get back home and (hopefully) stop the Apocalypse.","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"A very dark and very addicting RPG","reviewText":"This RPG is rather unique in several ways. The story is original, the characters are complex and multidimensional, and the gameplay grabs you and doesn't let go. The story follows the main character (who you name) in Tokyo, and he and his two friends visit their teacher in the hospital. Strangely, the hospital appears deserted. After finding his teacher, Yuko Takao, and a strange man named Hikawa, the main character is informed that the world will soon come to an end so it could be reborn through a process known as the Conception, and everyone outside the hospital will be killed. Then... the world comes to an end. In the process, Tokyo becomes a Vortex World, circling in around itself so that instead of seeing sky as you look up, you see more of the Tokyo landscape. In the center of the Vortex World is Kagutsuchi, a giant ball of light that goes through moon-like phases, which affects the behavior of regular enemies (they become more aggressive during \"Full Kagutsuchi\"). The game is kind of ambiguous/vague on whether this strange occurrence happens to the whole world in general or if it's just Tokyo. After the Conception, a mysterious young boy and his elderly caretaker fuse the main character with a Magatama, a demonic parasite which grants demonic power to those who ingest it; as a result, the main character is transformed into a special kind of demon known as a Fiend, of which there are very few (the main character is technically a Demi-Fiend, with the heart of a human and body of a demon). In this new Vortex World, all humans have died and become either wandering souls or have new human-like clay bodies and became Manikins. All the other inhabitants of the Vortex World range from fairies, trolls, gods, angels, and of course demons (the game generally classifies all creatures as DEMONS, to keep things simple). There are well over 100 demons in this game, and not including certain unique or boss demons, pretty much all of them can be recruited by the main character to join his party, a la Pokemon. Up to eight different demons can be in your party at once, and you can kick out whichever one you want to make room for others. However, it's usually better to fuse demons to create more powerful ones to serve you. You can choose two or three demons in your party and fuse them to create a more powerful demon with the abilities and skills of the previous ones it was \"born\" from, and you get to choose which abilities the demon comes with.Each demon can learn up to eight skills, which can be either physical attacks, elemental magic attacks, instant kill death/expel attacks (which have rather low percentages of success), healing/status renewal spells, status raising/lowering spells, and immunity skills. The main character can also learn up to eight skills, but has a lot more to choose from. There are 25 Magatamas in the game, and each time the main character levels up (the max level being lvl. 99) he'll learn a new skill from whichever Magatama he has equipped, and each one has around eight skills to offer. The equipped Magatamas also offer certain benefits: one could make the main character invulnerable to fire, but weak against ice, while another could boost his physical attack power and offer no special immunities. It would have been nice to be able to switch Magatama mid-battle, especially when facing challenging enemies who can attack you with abilities you're weak against. Alas, you can only switch Magatama outside of battle, which is this game's only real flaw. Choosing which abilities to keep or discard for the main character and his allies requires careful consideration, as the many enemies and especially bosses offer great challenges and can kill you quickly if you've got a certain weakness that can be exploited. There's no way of knowing your enemies' weaknesses until you've started battling them, so even if you're fighting a group of lower level demons they can still rough you up or even kill you if they manage to find out what you're currently weak against. This goes double for certain bosses who will require more than one try to defeat, but thankfully most bosses can be beaten on the first try if you round out your characters' skills and immunities so that not all of them are weak against the same types of attacks. The Fiends in particular will require extra caution and strategy to defeat. There are 10 other Fiends that eventually have to be defeated in order to fully complete the game, 9 of which all have skeletal heads and are as tough as they come.There are other aspects of this game that make it better than most other RPGs out there, at least in my opinion. For one, the max number of hit points (HP) and magic points (MP) the main character and enemies can have is 999, so this is definitely not one of those games where every character and enemy has thousands of HP points and takes an eternity to die; instead, this game relies on smartly exploiting weaknesses and knowing the right time to attack and when to use support spells to offer a more strategic challenge. The bosses of course do have a few thousand points of HP, but still not as much as you would expect in an RPG. Even the stronger and final bosses top out at around 40,000 HP, as opposed to over 100,000 HP like in most other RPGs. Also, spamming attacks is generally not a good idea, since even using specialized physical attacks drains your own HP, much like how magic attacks drain MP. Don't worry, the same rules apply to enemies, which helps make even bosses with a lot of HP not take so long to defeat. The combat itself is turn-based, with at least four moves available for each side. However, exploiting weaknesses and landing critical blows could effectively double the amount of moves available for each side, yet another reason to play smartly and use attacks that really damage your enemies. Another interesting thing about this game are the many different and interesting characters, and their specialized goals. There are select characters who have the chance to remake the Vortex World into their own image, whether it be a world ruled by the strong and where the weak are slaughtered, a world of stillness where all is at peace, at the price of all individuality being erased from existence, or a world where everyone is left alone and lives in their own personal shell. You get to choose to either align yourself with one of three possible Reasons (as they are labeled) or you can go \"Neutral\" and do what you think is right, or become a real demon in heart as well as in body.The inclusion of Dante as he appeared in Devil May Cry 2 was a big selling point for me in particular. Being a demon hunter, he actually fits pretty well into the game and becomes a recruitable character and very welcome addition to your party towards the last quarter of the game. You'll of course have to fight him first, since he is the one non-skeletal headed Fiend in the game. The game's music is very catchy, mostly of an alternative rock and rave variety. The game also has many philosophical and religious overtones in it, blending elements of Catholicism, Zoroastrianism, Norse mythology, Greek mythology, and so on, to create a compelling and character driven narrative. The graphics are cel-shaded and give the game a very \"anime-ish\" appearance, and many of the character designs are very creative and innovative. The designs of certain demons are quite... \"suggestive\", with certain private areas being in full view for all to see, so stay away children. With all this character and party customization, as well as the exploration of a large number of labyrinth-like dungeons with all kinds of hidden items and secrets, this game really eats up your time. The game also has 6 different endings, all depending on which Reason you aligned with or if you went neutral, so that helps with the game's already high replay value. This game can easily take you over 100 hours to beat, and fans of RPGs everywhere will love every minute of it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2011"}

Fulkerson","summary":"One of the best headsets I've ever used","reviewText":"I've used several Turtle Beach headphones as well as Tritton, Creative Sound Lab, and Monoprice, and the XP Seven is one of the best video game headsets I've ever used.  Everything from the presentation, to the build, to the comfort, to the options, and of course, the sound, is well above average.  The price may scare some away, but you'll be hard-pressed to find another pair that are better than this.  I'm going to try and create a general overview, but also touch on a few things that others have not.The first thing you'll notice with the XP Seven's is the immaculate presentation.  They come in a thick box which stores the headphones and components with a touch of class.  You'll look forward to using these each time you crack open the fancy box.  These headphones also come with all the cords you'll need to hook up to whatever system you'll want to be using.  A lot of headphones out there won't do you this favor, so this alone makes the few extra bucks you'll pay worth it.The setup is extremely easy and hassle free.  These headphones are corded which is really my only minor complaint, but Turtle Beach aren't hiding the fact, and these presented the least amount of hassle I've had when hooking up a corded pair of headphones.One issue I've had with every headset I've ever used is comfort.  I guess I must have a grossly misshapen head because every time in the past I've used a pair my ears will beging to ache because of the constant and unadjustable pressure I feel from the ill-fitting headphones.  The XP Seven's are not only comfortable, but after two hours of use I forgot they were even there.  They adjust to any sized head, and do so with ease.  It's extremely satisfying to put these on and not dread it as I have with every other pair I own.  Comfort is a huge factor in my opinion, and these are just awesome in that department.One of my favorite attributes to this headset is the amount of options you get with the settings control.  It's a bit perplexing at first, but once I checked the website and got a more detailed run down of how to manipulate the controls, I was simply amazed in how well these sounded (and sound).  You can save a particular preset to a particular game, and this is by far the coolest thing I've ever seen with a set of headphones.  I tested these by playing on Bioshock Infinite on the Xbox, Tomb Raider on the PS3, and Skyrim on the Mac Mini.  I spent a good amount of time setting up my preferences with each game, and when I came back to each of them, they were all loaded back to their individual presets.  Very very cool.  Getting to this point is simple through the settings and controller as well, and I never felt like I was fumbling around and searching for things.One thing I have noticed about these is clarity they possess.  They don't seem to get quite as loud as other sets in this price range, but WOW are they clear.  There is absolutely no clipping or distorting, and you hear every little detail imaginable when you finally find that perfect spot within your settings.  I usually only wear headphones to not distract others when playing, but I've been playing with these on just because they sound so great and are so comfortable.As I mentioned before, these are wired, which is the only negative.  It seems that these could easily be wireless, and Turtle Beach offers other pairs that are comparable to this that are wireless, so I guess it comes down to whether you'd rather spend another 20 bucks to get the wireless.  Wired headsets aren't a deal breaker, but it definitely sours the deal with what is otherwise an astounding pair of headphones.This one minor quibble aside, you will not be disappointed with these headphones.  It really has everything in one pair of headphones (comfort, ease, sound), and at this price point, you will not find a pair that is better.  Buy 'em!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2013"}

Monroe \"Life, is a state of mind.\"","summary":"Voice Functions are great, system is very slick!","reviewText":"I purchased my system from local GameStop and I have had no issues with it so far. Very surprised at how well the voice features are working. I had expected Kinect to be gimmicky, but rather, I've ended up enjoying them quite a lot. I expect though that some people might not enjoy the voice features, those people should be happy to note that the Kinect isn't needed for normal use and may even be turned off or simply unplugged. I have found, however, that the Kinect features have greatly improved the average game and movie experience by allowing me to pause, resume, or check other Apps all without ever touching a button - which is great while having a snack or away from the controller.Sometimes I have noticed that Kinect may be a little hard of hearing if I am not within seating distance on the Kinect, and though it always hears me when I am within range it still has some trouble with commands if you do not use the exact wording. This was not an issue however once I used a voice tutorial for Kinect (doh!), I realized I had been using the wrong commands for some features. Despite some minor hiccups with the OS and Kinect - the experience has been positive thus far and things have greatly improved with the recent patches/updates!Games I have purchased thus far are Battlefield 4, Just Dance 2014, Killer Instinct,Dead Rising 3, & Assassins Creed 4: Black Flag. So far all the games play great, run smooth, and look wonderful. I did watch a friend play Ryse: Son of Rome and the game was absolutely stunning to watch, very beautiful, combat was ok, reminded me of the Batman games - but I digress. I'm sure Titan Fall will be one of the best when it comes out as well! :0)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2013"}

M Quiggins \"Sole_Fish\"","summary":"One HALO of a good time.....","reviewText":"O.k., in a nutshell, this game is similar to 'Command and Conquer- Renegade' in many ways. The colors used and the shading used feels almost precisely like it was inspired by Renegade. Even the structures and the graphic 'smoothing' of the edges of most objects. Musically, it's just silly. The music sounds just plain cheap. While there are moments of suspense that the music truly delivers on, most of the time, it's not even worth listening to. As far as overall length, this game has got it. Absolutely huge game levels, and there are PLENTY of them. Surprising for a 1.4 gig game. It all fits on one cd before installation. I actually played this on a duron system with 1 gig PC 133 ram and a geforce 4 4800 video card, and it ran very well. I have heard complaints about a lagging mouse. I have that a little on my duron, but when i switched to my ALIENWARE system with the ATHLON XP the problem went away. I can only assume, for that, that maybe the processor speed is affecting the mouse. SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** Quite a ways into the game the 'bad guys' turn into the 'not-so-bad guys' , yet you still have to slaughter them mindlessly. Then they become human-like and at that point you just feel sorry for thier deformed painful existance. I know it's just a game, but why must you continue killing those guys after you find out that all they were ever doing was defending themselves. Just a gripe on something i did not like in the game. Lastly, just after you discover their secret, you better have plenty of ammo and patience. The game, for a short time, becomes almost impossible. Extremely hard. Overall, while the game seems lacking for the first few hours of play,it does, much like Jedi Knight 2 did, pick up to a much more interesting pace and offer up some excelent environments later in the game. Look at the first few levels as training levels. Use them as that, you'll need them later. Trust me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide. WithThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has come up with an all-consuming adventure title that will provide days of engrossing gameplay.--Eric FredricksonPros:Best single-player video gameFreedom to explore a rich, complex worldHelpful fairy guide gives hintsCharming, humorous, lighthearted, yet challengingCons:Some puzzles can be frustratingOnly one saved game per player--don't save when you're stuck!Much more fun with Rumble Pack","reviewerName":"Charles H.","summary":"A dark time is approaching...","reviewText":"What can be said about Ocarina of Time? I still remember that commercial from the late 90s. It told us that a \"dark time is approaching.\" My interest was piqued. Then I realized it was a Zelda game. As a huge fan of A Link to the Past, I thought \"ZOMG that looks awesome! I need to get this more than I've ever needed to get anything!\" I remember reading about it in GamePro and obviously being interested, but that commercial sealed the deal. I knew I had to have Ocarina of Time, and that Christmas, my mom got it for me. Cheers!A lot has been said about OoT over the years. It has been referred to as the \"Best Game of All Time\" by some, and the \"Most Overrated Game of All Time\" by others. I'm not really in either camp, but I lean closer to the former group, I suppose. If you haven't played it yet, you should. It's out on a variety of platforms and there's even remake of it with better graphics, but I would still recommend the N64 version if you want the same experience people had back in the 90s when OoT was THE GAME you needed to play.Story:You are Link. The Great Deku Tree, guardian of the forest in which you live, has summoned you. It's revealed that you must visit a far off castle and meet a \"Princess of Destiny,\" and doing so brings you square into a struggle for the fate of Hyrule -- nay, the world -- itself.Gameplay:To complete your quest and save Hyrule, you must boldly enter into many dungeons which are filled with fierce skeletal warriors, human-sized spiders, horrible ghosts, and... immobile venus fly traps! Completing a dungeon gives you an item for the main quest, and completing all of the dungeons will allow you to face the final boss. There's much more to it that, but I'm trying not to spoil storyline specifics for those who haven't played it.Hyrule is a vast world. One of your in-game guides tells you that \"You can go wherever you want.\" That's true, to a point. There's a lot of exploration in Ocarina of Time. The game is always trying to point you toward a certain place, but whether or not you go there is often up to you. In an interactive world such as Hyrule, you can do many things. Why go see what's on Death Mountain when you could pour water into all of the soil patches in Hyrule? Or why go play the Shadow Temple -- which does not have any attractive Gerudo women -- when you could go to the Spirit Temple, which does? The exploration is one of OoT's best features, and it's probably better than any Zelda which came after it.Controls:They work well enough. You don't have the full on camera control that some of the later Zelda games give you, but personally, I never found it all that essential to the process.Ocarina of Time introduced a \"Z-targeting system\" for aiming at enemies and talking to non-playable characters. What you do is get near an enemy/NPC, press or hold Z, and then press a button to talk to them/attack them. The system pretty intuitive and well made, so much so that its successors have yet to really improve upon it.Music:*90s gripe* Where is the classic Zelda overworld theme? Oh, we can hear it for like five seconds in the Hyrule Field theme? ARE YOU SERIOUS? But seriously, the music is pretty good. The Hyrule Field theme which I just mentioned is a good theme. The music does a good job of fitting the areas which you visit, for the most part.Some later Zelda games use too much ambient music in the dungeons. OoT is guilty of this too, but only to a small degree. Apart from the Water Temple's melody, there's nothing that makes me want to relax and do some meditation or whatever while hearing it. :POh, and I'm sad to report that the \"OoT Commercial Music\" is not in this game... :(Replay Value:It's pretty massive. You can do some Temples in different orders than you did your first time through, or you can use different items to progress through the Temples. I summed it up in a sentence, but there's hundreds of hours of replay potential there in just finding all of OoT's possible variations.Like in the original Legend of Zelda, you can do the \"Three Heart Challenge,\" which means you can complete the game without any of the health upgrades from beating a dungeon. Essentially, that's playing Hard Mode (although it isn't really that hard).But if the Three Heart Challenge wasn't enough, OoT lets you tack on additional stipulations to make replaying it even harder! There are technically unnecessary items which let you breathe underwater and resist intense heat. Not getting them limits the amount of time you can spend in relevant areas. On top of all that, you could even as far to skip the health upgrades which halve your damage.______If you call yourself a gamer and have not played Ocarina of Time, what are you? Some undercover non-gamer sent in to infiltrate us!? Go play it now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2013"}

Yet, all you strategy gammers, this is a great place to jump into the Total War seriesThis game is great as an individual, but in the Total War series, it falls a little short of what was expected.Graphics 9/10Gameplay 10/10Sound 6/10Presentation 7/10Stability: No problems on medium to high end PCsScore 8/10 - Good","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2008"}

Kill.","reviewText":"Haze is an innovative new take on the First-Person Shooter:  instead of temporary power-ups or massive weapons with limited ammo, you are given the bonus of a sensory boost that you can control...with the downside that you may overdose (which makes you lose control and start firing wildly).Haze is a very good game.  Not only are the graphics simply stellar (they remind me of Crysis), the weapons are well balanced and fairly effective.  It also gets a boost from trying to inject a little depth into the story.  Like \"Blacksite:  Area 51\", you start to realize that you're not doing the Good Deed you thought you were.  You progressively learn more behind the propaganda and decide to take on the side of Might to set things Right.Haze also gives you a chance to balance the scales:  while Nectar soldiers are powerful, they don't think much.  You can lay traps for them, harvest the drug off their bodies and use it against them, or play dead until they pass by.The only real con to this game is all the other characters.  Enemy AI is often stupid, and whomever is on your side is usually worse. Your own troops will run in front of you, often inches away.  Your comrades will often need you to run back and rescue them, only to have to do it again before you get back to where you left off.  They often die as you're reviving them.  I spent a lot of my time trying to run ahead of my team, get everything done, and then backtrack and revive whomever is left.  They're *that* inept.The driving is also rather bad--it's harder to control than the Grand Theft Auto series. You'll often veer into a ditch or run up a tree.Last, there are bugs.  Vehicles disappear and respawn elsewhere, enemies get stuck in the map or stare at the walls, and your teammates sometimes  stop running and nag you to keep moving, only to get shot in the back because they don't turn around when ambushed.  If it weren't for these drawbacks, Haze would be a 5-star title.If you want a First-Person Shooter on the PS3, with great graphics and innovative ideas, Haze is a good title.  Just don't expect any team-based help from the AI, and you'll have a lot more fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001989B4S","reviewerName":"iHyphy","summary":"Fight Night Round 4","reviewText":"Fight Night Round 4 is FINALLY HERE!!!First and foremost i didnt pull any of this information from any site these are explicitly my opinions from what i received since owning the game.  With the exception of the acheivements list and roster break down (which i already sent credit to) everything is my opinionThere has been a lot of controversy whether people wanted to buy this game soley based on the controller configuration for the game.  If you no stranger to the Fight Night series then you must know this before deciding to purchase...The game currently only offers the Fight Stick configuration (Sorry all you button-mashers but as of right now theres no button configuration for any of the punches) right now you use the left thumb stick to manuever the boxer around and the right thumb stick to direct and coordinate all of your punches.  I'm telling you at first i wasn't to sure if i would like this idea, but the concept had me intrigue because it makes me feel like i have more control over the boxer and in some way puts me into the game a little bit more then just pushing a, b, x or y buttons to punch...this issue here has been a deciding factor for many on whether they buy the game or not, but just look at it this way1. yes it may be a little bit of a learning curve for some but think of it a challenge to overcome its actually pretty fun fighting this way.2. EA sports is definitely talking about releasing a product update via xbox live that includes a button configuration for people who would rather use the a, b, x and y buttons instead of the fight stick (it hasn't been confirmed but it is being talked about, and in my humble opinion if they want to increase sales they should release it..but then again if they want to build off of this idea of theres then they should just keep it the way it is..) i love the fight stick now and at first i didntas far as the legacy mode goes you began by either choosing a current character from the roster (listed below) or creating/importing a character or using the photo game face system (which you need the xbox live camera or upload your pictures to the ea.com site) if you opt to create one the old fashion way there is around 100 customizable templates that you must pick from at the begining and adjust/customize them from the template characters.this game has a difficulty setting so you can adjust the fighting to your liking..i currently have mine set up at the default setting of pro just to start off and later on ill adjust as i see fit to keep my game tight lol! one thing i have noticed on this game that i didnt notice as much in the other fight nights is that the simulation of boxing here is more realistic then ever before...for one i heard people complaing about the boxer's perhaps blocking to much or running around or dancing to much making it hard to hit people, etc etc etclong story short this is not a ROCKY movie where there is no blocking involved and its a 5 minute slug fest..each boxer is different in there own ways depending on there style, skill, power, speed, reach, and so on..your punches are different depending on close or far away you are, if your leaning in or out or from side to side, and your punches are even effected or different depending on what your opponent is doing as well also.Before i forget to mention since i just thought of this--there is a demo available via xbox live i highly suggest you download and play the demo for few hours up to a few days to see if you can get the feel for the game and whether you like the controlling, if your not totally convinced then i would suggest renting the game first...trust me if you are and were a fan of Fight Night Round 3 or the series in general you will be a fan of this game as well just adapt and overcome the controlling it really isn't that hard hahaha!Let me also comment that the graphics on the game are amazing! by far the best out of all the Fight Nights and amongst the best on the xbox console in general they really pushed the limits on the 360 with the graphics its an amazing fluid performance through out.  a few things they added that i heard some yay's and nay's about was how they added these different camera angles and motions of the camera when counter punches are performed and succesfully initiate...there is a confirming sound of a small explosion somewhat and a flashing light which im guessing kind of signifies what a real hard punch would look like if you took one to the face hahaha..there is plenty of tutorials in the game to help you with getting used to using the fight stick and to help you practice getting better at practicing so you can max out on receiving the max amount of performan/strength/skill upgrades for your character.  this time around its even more in depth then before where you get twice as many training options which focus on several different series of areas.  your punches can be strengthened, toughing your body or head, up your stamina or heart or damage rating, improve your blocking or movement skills, etc etc etc and lots more.  there are about 6 or 7 different practice modes ranging from sparring, weight bag, heavy bag combos, maize bag, and more (can't remember all of them off hand) but as you focus on certain parts of your body, or your punches or strengths, some of your other parts of body punch, skills or strengths could be effected as well..during the actual gameplay your HUD shows you your health, stamina, and blocking..all are pretty self explanatory but if you run your stamina down to quickly by doing things like punching too much or like crazy it will drain your stamina making you slower/sluggish and more susceptable of being hurt more..the lower your stamina the harder it is to block and fight back..the punches thrown at you receive a more devastating effect as well triggering more health loss for every punch landed on you.  counter punches deal more damage then if you throw the same punch normally and can even cause flash knock downs or knock outs..you character or your opponent will have an immediate flashing health meter signifying that there more easily prone to getting knocked down if they don't block more, hug the opponent, or avoid the next series of punches.if you get knocked down the new way for getting back up is this balancing technique you do with the left and right thumbstick you have to balance your character by a teeter-tottering meter left to right in the center and once you stabilize it you hold up on the other thumbstick to bring your character up..the better you do in each round the more points your corner man receives to help you deal out between rounds where you can use towards gaining your stamina back, getting your health back or taking away some of the dealt damage.The new legacy mode beats any other career mode fight night had before its more in depth then ever before you dont just fight to reach the upper ranks, theres certain challenges of all sorts you must acheive to retire at certain titles like G.O.A.T. or Ring Legend, or Superstar, or Champion....so on and so forth from Bum to Prospect (theres like 10 or more titles total) during the legacy mode you are even given the option to retire whenever you would like, or jump ranks, you can even design your own roster of create-a-characters so they are generated into your legacy some how some way and you play them during the amateur days into the pro days..you have a popularity rating, winning percentage, etc things that are effected by the way you manage your fighter...because if you don't manage right and you constantly fight with out training or resting up efficiently or if you dodge the challenge fights that pop up every once in awhile...things like your rating, popularity, win percentage, etc can be effected..during the gameplay during different challenges that are acquired like maintaining a high connection percentage or win percentage or receiving a high rating or high popularity goodies like new trunks/gloves/shoes/robes/etc are awarded to you as well..lots of things to keep you bizzy and more into the game now more then ever!  you can't just move up the ranks to quick because if you do you wont have enough experience to compete at the level or with the higher tiered fighters and you will have more to lose then gain if you challenge them, fight them, and then lose...you need to pick on the lower end fighters for awhile to build up your fighter and to build up on your skills in general for the game..this game forces you to fight strategically instead of mashing you buttons away to victory..if you get tired of fighting cpu's just go to the online mode where there is tons of offerings and guaranteed to keep you bizzy..if you fight incorrectly for the type/style/skill of the fighter the commentators will constantly remind you..and its realistic to because if your not an inside fighter and you try to fight that way it can effect you more because you wont be more productive that way....always keep your guard up because you can be knocked down with out notice or just simply said a flash ko!  long story short if you have a reach advantage then you should try to fight from the outside if you don't have the advantage fight from the inside but then again those are more character traits each character may or may not have which you can decide from character customization whether they are orthodox/southpaw, boxer/brawler/unconventional/slugger/wild/speed, whether there inside/outside, whether there confident/focused/etc...all in all i am not dissappointed with my purchase at all..the only negative i have about this so far is preordering the game from gamestop..and thats because people who ordered it from ea.com or gamecrazy received there games a day early!ill keep up with updates in the future so stay tuned for that, but if you ask me you should stop reading already and go test out the demo, rent the game, or go buy it and try it for your self!Roster Line-Up:\"Iron\" Mike TysonMuhammad AliRicky Hatton\"Sugar\" Ray RobinsonThomas \"Himan\" HearnsMiguel Cotton\"Sugar\" Shane MoselyJake Lamotta\"Marvelous\" Marvin HaglerRoy Jones Jr.Carlos MonzonJermaine TaylorKelly PavlikManny \"Pacman\" PacquiaoPernell WhitakerJulio Caesar ChavezGeorge ForemanJoe FrazierLennox Lewis\"Sugar\" Ray LeonardJames ToneyRoberto DuranMarco Antonio BarreraAmin AsikainenPaulie MalignaggiKermit CinteronEddie ChambersArturo GattiCorey SpinksTommy MorrisonSergio MoraFernando MontielJorge Armando ArceArementaAnthony MundineEmanuel AgustusVinny PazVivian HarrisBilly DibDiego CorralesErik MoralesNate CampbellRonald \"Winky\" WrightYuriorkis GamboaNonito DonairArthur AbrahamJoe CalzagheRoberto GuerreroEdwim ValeroVictor OrtizTomasz AdamekAcheivement List:Get In The Ring (5)Win a Fight Now match against the CPUJust Like Mike (40)Win a Fight Now match by KO in the first round against the CPU in a 10 round fightMore Machine Than Man (50)Win 50 Fight Now matches against the CPUKnock A Sucker Out (10)Win by a KO in Fight Now against a CPUEcko Trunk Challenge (15)Beat CPU Miguel Cotton in Fight Now on ProMan Up Manny (15)Beat CPU Manny Pacquiao in Fight Now on ChampionPull No Punches (10)Win a Fight Now match vs the CPU while landing at least 500 punchesPound For Pound (40)Win a fight against a CPU opponent in a higher weight class than youThe Road Is Long (10)Win 10 fights in Legacy ModeThe Champ Is Here (40)Win a championship belt in a single weight classThe Latest And The Greatest (50)Retire as a SuperstarFrom Chump To Champ (20)Win the Amateur Tournament in Legacy ModeMovin' On Up (30)Move up in weight class in Legacy ModeUndefeated (20)Win 5 consecutive Legacy Mode fightsMy Style Is Impetuous (60)Beat CPU Mike Tyson on G.O.A.T. using a created boxer in Fight NowXL (50)Win the Middleweight Championship Belt in Online World Championship ModeL (25)Wing the Lightweight Championship Belt in Online World Championship ModeSolid Contender (30)Win 5 online ranked matchesPain Brings Glory (5)Win a match in Online World Championship ModeComeback Kid (10)Win an Online ranked match after being knocked down twiceWalk Like Ten Men (10)Win 10 Fight Now matches against the CPUDavid And Goliath (40)Beat CPU Mike Tyson in Fight Now on G.O.A.T.King Of The Rope-A-Dope (40)Beat CPU Muhammad Ali in Fight Now on G.O.A.T.Punch Drunk (10)Win a Fight Now match vs the CPU while landing at least 250 jabsEnough To Feed A Horse (10)Win a Fight Now match vs the CPU while landing at least 10 HaymakersPrecision Guided Pain (50)Win a fight where you landed at least 70% of your punches vs CPUGOAT (80)Retire as the G.O.A.T.

Featuring a horde of fighters, undoubtadly the best lineup yet, Tekken 5 features the same deep gameplay and combo mechanics that will keep you playing for quite some time.  And because it's Tekken, there's a bevy of hidden characters and features to unlock as well.  There's no Tekken Force mode this time around, and instead there is Devil Within, a segment that is similar to Tekken Force where you play as Jin Kazama as he battles his way to learn of the devil gene within him.  It's not much to write home about in itself, but there's more features to behold here as well, including the addition of playing the arcade versions of Tekken 1, 2, and 3 as well as the Namco shooter Starblade.  The graphics are improved and the backgrounds have been revamped as well, all helping make Tekken 5 the best fighter not just for the PS2, but for home consoles in general.

Rumored in 05-06, this game was to be an Xbox 360 launch title, but it kept getting delayed. Years... years... years... I looked at the same lame screenshots for years... Then on September 6th 2011, my prayers were finally answered and the game came out. I pre-ordered it, the first time I ever did so, and I played the hell out of it for three months solid. Oh boy...I am cheap, okay, so when I buy a game, it is like an investment. I spent SIXTY dollars on this for the special edition. I am GOINT TO ENJOY THIS GAME IF IT KILLS ME. And honestly, it's a good game.It takes inspiration from other zombie titles like Left 4 Dead and Dead Rising. It takes elements from Fallout 3 and Oblivion. It has a shallow story. It has glitchy cut scenes. It has Glitched gameplay. It is not perfect.This IS HOWEVER a good game. I know many people rip on it when they start out just because they are slow to catch on to some elements of the game. I saw a review where someone complained about a mission, dropping off juice, and they wined because the drop-off point was not clearly marked. I had trouble with that too, but I discovered were to place the item once I looked around a little. I did not throw my controller like a baby, or curse, or cry, or whine. I played the game and found where I needed to go.The combat is not perfect, but this is a horror game. The controls are supposed to feel less than adiquate to instill a since of emergency. I'm not saying I support crappy controls, but the controls were not that bad. I picked it up and got hte hang of the controls quickly. Heck, I thought it was satisfying when I smacked a zombie across the face and broke thier neck... but that's just me I guess...Thank goodness there are traditional zombies! I am tired of fast mutant zombies. Yes, there are those too. Fast zombies appear generally sparcely and other mutant infected monsters are far and few between, making them far more credible in my eyes as enemies. But there are slow, shambling, groaning, growling zombies. They can sneak up on you like in a horror movie, they can follow you through a deserted house, and they can and will beat you to a pulp. Don't be mistaken, these are monsters that can rend you to pieces!OPEN WORLD! OPEN WORLD CITY?! Yes, ever since Resident Evil 2 and 3, I have wanted and open world zombie city game. In Resident Evil 2, you got to see a desolate zombie infested city for a little while, and in Resident Evil 3 the majority of the gameplay takes place in a city full of undead, but it was not open world gameplay and was cut up by load screens. In Act II, you get to GO TO THE CITY! Burned out busses, beaten trucks and cars, shops left open and abandoned, junkies barracading themselves with junk as the hoard roams toward them, scattered weapons that you can claim, and hoards and hoards and hoards of zombies! There is a quarante zone full of fast zomies, streets crowded wil slow zombies, a menacing enemy known as the Ram, and enviromental hazards! YEEEEEEEE!!!!!!The AI is dull, you will only have to suffer escourt missions a couple of times, and the game is generous by letting that escourt character stand back while you do the work, but you will go WHAT a couple times too many, as your AI buddy jumps right into a fire you lit to kill the zombies.The multiplayer is Smooth as Sunday MOOOOOOOORNING. YOu might want to set your online to private, because I came across my fair share of jerks who blew me up out of sheer spite and hatred, but you and your like-minded friends can run through the levels together on missions or roam aimlessly about together or alone. Missions require participation, but other than that, have a jolly time. Also, even though the box says it does, it does not have off-line multiplayer. It is lying to you. Not the first time a game has done that, but they should really correct the box before release.For all the wrong the game does, it does something right. Zombies in an Open World. NEver before has this been done properly. Sure, Dead Rising has an open envrioment, but the time constrain really made it hard to explore and still feel good about abandoning a timed mission. Dead Rising was too stressful. Dead Island was barely stressful at all, except in the quarantene zone... that was panick inducing craziness! The fast zombies KEPT COMING ON AND ON AND ON! THERE WAS NO END!But the game is good. Not perfect, but good. I suggest you buy this at a modest $30 price tag. That is well worth what you get.EDIT: Hey, Price drop! At thirty dollars this is a good buy! At the moment of this review (December 4th 2011) The game has dropped to $38.40! This is a perfect time to get it!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"Gradient Vector Field \"subjectedtometal (dot)...","summary":"Do you have what it takes to survive?","reviewText":"Let me preface this review by saying this game is amazing!  Before playing this I was already reasonably sure I would like this game.  It uses the same engine Half Life 2 does and I really like the mechanics in that game.  This game is a first person shooter co-op capable game.  It's sort of like having a dream come true.  I really wish there was a Half Life 2 split screen co-op capability, but Left 4 Dead is a great supplement for that.On some levels I find this game a curious liking for me.  I'm usually a very story oriented player, meaning that if there is no story line I tend to not be as interested.  Even if the story line sucks, at least its there and I usually wind up wanting to find out what happens at least a little bit.  Left 4 Dead isn't setup that way.  It really is one of the ultimate zombie survival games.  (Okay, I admit, I haven't really played that many in my day...)  It essentially has no real background story; you are merely thrust into a situation where you need to run to survive.  No explanation on who you're with or who they are, you just want to get out.  This sounds pretty on point to me.  Despite these seemingly obvious downsides, I barely noticed them.  I still thought this was a great game.My friend and I sat down to play this game a few weeks ago.  I was disappointed to see that there were only four missions we could play through.  I thought I would find this game mediocre at that point.  This completely blew away those expectations!  Basically you play one of the four survivor characters.  There are four different scenarios with the same basic theme.  You are in one location and the extraction point is someplace else.  The only way for you to get rescued is to travel through the area until you get to the extraction point.  This is usually pretty far away and can take over an hour of game play to reach.  There are safe houses in between to break up the level and so you can resupply with ammo and health packs.  On your way you have to battle through literally hordes of zombies!  Despite the four scenarios having essential the same theme, the environments are pretty different, so I never felt like I was being fed the same thing over and over, even though I technically was.  I was far more concerned with accomplishing the goal!  Seriously, this game is so much fun that we've played it several times already.  Usually I don't care much about the achievements on the games, but this game has us trying to actually unlock these achievements!  I'm honestly surprised at how much replay value this game has with only four missions of a similar design theme.The minor complaints I have are really tiny.  I wish it had more weapon options.  Don't get me wrong, the weapons that are available are incredibly useful and fun to use... but part of me wants more.  In most FPS games I have a whole slew of weapons at my disposal.  I think this game would be really cool with more varied weapons.  The only other thing that I didn't like is that you can't run through the campaign as a zombie in offline co-op.If you really like zombie survival scenarios then this is absolutely a must have game.  If you just like FPS co-op games then this is still a must have game.  The game is an intense run to rescue and you will feel on the edge of your seat most of the time while playing this.  Maybe with the success of this game it will prompt the developer to actually write a more story oriented type of game.  I know this was predominantly made for the Online crowd, but there is a huge interest (as far as I can tell) for adding in a full on campaign to play through.  That would only sweeten the deal.  My one concern would be that this developer would get too focused on online play and remove the basic campaign mode... hopefully they'll never do that (*cough* like Quake Arena... *cough*).  In the end this really is exhilarating and I'm looking forward to achieving my 53,595 kills someday!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2009"}

Rhodes","summary":"An Original and Engrossing Game","reviewText":"Pros+Incredible story+Beautiful graphics+Amazing soundtrack+Unique gameplay that has a lot of balance+A lot of extra things you can do off the beaten pathCons-Your friends and family will feel neglectedSega has, by and large, given consumers a mixed bag of games.  Sometimes you get games that don't live up to the potential that have been set for them and sometimes you get some downright bad games.  When Sega has their head on straight, though, you get a game like Valkyria Chronicles.  It's a rich tale with even richer gameplay.  If there's one RPG PS3 owners must get, it is Valkyria Chronicles.Valkyria Chronicles is set in the year of 1935, but in an alternate reality.  The story itself is told some nicely rendered cel shading as well as some well written and well performed dialog.  The story is told through episodes which you'll undertake.  It's an overall engrossing story filled with fantastic characters who are all well defined.  The cutscenes themselves are also fairly moving.  It's actually quite amazing how deep and mature the story really is.Gameplay wise, Valkyria Chronicles is somewhat different from your typical tactical RPG.  In most tactical RPGs, you and the enemy usually take turns to act.  Valkyria Chronicles does something a little different.  Instead of taking turns you have what is called Command Points.  As long as you still have command points left, you can send forth any unit you like and the order with which you send them doesn't matter.  You could even send one ally to do everything provided you have the correct amount of command points.When you select a unit, however, Valkyria Chronicles throws in another twist.  You view the action on an overworld map, but once you select a unit the game shifts into third person where you must move them yourself as though you were play a third person shooter.  It's actually quite unique and breathes a lot of new life into the Tactical RPG genre.  When an enemy is in sight, you'll have to aim and fire.  The enemy can, if they wish, counterattack you as well.  Just the same however, you can take the proper precautions and duck behind cover if you wish.  There's quite a deep strategic element to the game.  This is not going to be one of those Tactical RPGs where being stronger is all that matters.  It goes much deeper than that.  The game is balanced in such a way that each unit, depending on what they are is useful for different things.  Scouts, for example, are good at pin-pointing where the enemy is, but they lack the firepower to take them down.  Snipers, on the other hand, are good on offense, but lack range and defense.  No matter how you slice it, it's impossible to take complete advantage of the game.  Yet for what it's worth, you never get the feeling the game is too hard or too easy.  It's just right.Providing even more balance is that once you take control of a unit it isn't for an infinite amount of time.  Every unit has an action gauge, and when it runs out they can no longer move.  You're still allowed to take action such as healing yourself or shooting at your enemy at least.  Also, if you decided to keep using the same character over and over again for each command point, you'll notice their action gauge will fill up less and less.  Again, it's designed so that you can't take absolute advantage.On the surface the gameplay is somewhat simple, but it's really quite deep and asks for a lot of strategy on the players part.  After completing each mission, you'll be awarded experience and a ranking.  The faster you get a mission done, the better your experience and ranking.  On the other hand, characters do not level up individually.  Rather their class (be they Sniper, Scout or what have you) levels up.  There's so much depth to the gameplay that you hardly realize the game doesn't actually have online or multiplayer support of any kind.  It'd be nice to challenge a friend online or work cooperatively, but with how engrossing the single player experience is, it's not that big a deal.Visually, Valkyria Chronicles is an astonishing looking game.  It is by far the best cel-shaded game to date.  The artistic design of the environments and characters is vibrant and colorful.  Everything also moves very smoothly, even when things on the battlefield get hectic.  Much like the graphics, the game also sounds incredibly good.  Not only is there a very catchy and moving musical score, but the voice acting is also very well done and distinguished.  It's amazing how much effort Sega went through to draw you into the story.  It works incredibly well.  And if you happen to dislike the English voices, you'll be happy to know you can switch the audio to Japanese.Make no mistake, Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing and enchanting game.  It's got a deep, mature and well thought out storyline with lovable characters, and the gameplay experience is so unique that it's engrossing.  If you're an Tactical RPG fan, Valkyria Chronicles is a must own title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2008"}

Nonetheless, it is Batman and I had already spent 65$ dollars on it, so I bit the bullet. I must say, this video game takes itself too seriously. I was never a huge fan of the Nolan films because they were overtly violent, and this game seems to follow the morose tone set by those awful films. There are literal cut-scenes that involve 'thugs' getting shot IN THE HEAD. In a Teen-rated video game. This level of nihilism and violence should be reserved for M-rated video games, trash such as Call of Duty and Gran Theft Turismo.The storyline involves a motley crew of ASSASSINS who are literally paid money to KILL Batman for the sake of making Gotham - a city that is seemingly occupied by more foul-mouthed criminals than law-abiding denizens - more dangerous than it already is. There are characters named ElectroCUTIONER, DEADshot and DEATHstroke. Batman KILLS in this, albeit inadvertently. The theme of this game is MURDER, people, if I am not making that clear enough to you. Seriously. You would think this game was written by the duo of Liefield and McFarlane during the edgy 90s.

The game is set more in the open world of Arkham City rather the Arkham Asylum as you're allowed more free roaming experience around the city then in a set area.The gampeplay controls are pretty much exactly like the previous two games meaning that you have the X or square button(Xbox 360/PS3 controller) for attacks or dive attacks if your on a higher area looking down at the enemies,Y or triangle for the counter attacks when you see the lightning bolt symbol above the enemies heads signalling that their about to attack you or to drop a smoke pellet if enemies or armed,the A or X button to jump or evade certain attacks, and B or the circle button to use Batman's cape to disorientate enemies rather then do the counter move.  And of course when you're target with either the Batarang or Batclaw you use L2 or LT to target and R2 or RT to fire.The cross control pad allows you to access Batman's array of gadgets like the batclaw/batarang/explosive gel etc,etc. The LB or L1 allows you to enter detective mode to see certain aspects like enemies or clues and such just like the previous games.The graphics are topnotch a little better detailed then Arkham City though just by a little and the buildings around the city do indeed seem taller allowing you more range to scout and glide down and around the city.  The A.I. for the enemies and villains seemed more adept too though again not by much from the previous games.The story so far shows it is before Arkham Asylum where Batman has apparently just started making a name for himself in Gotham so the bad guys still think of him as more a bogey man rather then the known crime fighter he is in Arkham Asylum/City.So if you played or have the previous two games I definitely say this one is a must have though it's not really necessary to have the previous games if you just started as this is a prequel to those games it's still a good choice to add those to your gaming library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2013"}

Not Fantastic, but Great.","reviewText":"Ok, so this review is a little incomplete since I didn't finish the game yet, but whatever.  It's a great dungeon-crawling, boss-slaying RPG with decently good graphics.  Yes, it's hard...yes, it's difficult.  My main build is the Royalty class Assassin build.  I just use magic all of the time, and it's a breeze.So far, I beat levels 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 3-1, 4-1, and 5-1.  When I got to 2-2 (Flamelurker level), I stopped playing.  I came very close to beating him, then I died and got sent back to the beginning of the level (which is what usually happens when you die anywhere in the level anyway).  No big deal, so I started over.  The thing is that I just got bored of that level, and for some reason, I kept dying trying to get through it again.  No clue why because I breezed through it the first time around.  The level has plenty of platform jumping and falling if you choose to go that route.  I tried that a few times, and I kept on dying.  A major disappointment with the game is that you can't control your direction of falling.  Once you fall, you just go down.  To me, that's a major weakness in this game.Other than that, it's pretty solid.  And here's a tip:  if you know you're going to die or immediately when your health is completely depleted, just press the PS button and quit the game.  When you load your file up again, you'll respawn at the point before you died.  Doing that has been a lifesaver for me, and if I never knew that, I probably would've gotten very frustrated with the game and quit it a long time ago haha.So yeah, after losing my patience with 2-2, I just put the game on my shelf for the time being.  I just don't have the patience anymore for it, especially since I have 11 unopened games that I still have to play.  Rest assured though that I will return to Demon's Souls in the future (next year, most likely).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2011"}

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality.

{"product_name":"B002I094AC","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A N64 arcade shooter classic gets even better","reviewText":"I truly believe that Nintendo should include a warning label on every copy of Star Fox 64, both the original 64 version, and now this new 3DS remake. It would go something like this: \"Warning, this game is so incredibly addictive, yes, so absurdly fun that it may, in fact, destroy any stability and desire in you to do anything productive. Relationships, work ethic, and basic personal hygiene may suffer. Play and have a blast at your own risk.\" Seriously, this game is so fun, it will devour your soul. I don't know anyone who was ever a \"casual\" player of Star Fox 64, and for good reason, because this was one of the funnest, most classic games on the Nintendo 64. I played it a ton in its original form when I was a kid (ah the memories), and now I am happy (and somewhat nervous, given how addicted I and many others can get with it) to say that this remake is just as great as the original. As a matter of fact, in some ways, Star Fox 64 3D vastly surpasses the original.Chances are, you already know what you're getting here with Star Fox 64. It's essentially a 3D space shooter with tantalizing arcade appeal, excellent control mechanics, a ground-breaking (for its time) story branching mechanic that allowed roughly 25 different possible paths through the story based on performance, near limitless replayability, a more cinematic feel (at least compared toStar Fox on the SNES), and enough cheese-smothered charm to feed an army of mice. All of these selling points are back and better than ever. It's great, but the enhancements in this remake are amazing and really add to its quality.In a time when most companies lazily port old games with no update whatsoever (I'm looking solely at youRayman 2: The Great Esca...er, um... I mean \"Rayman 3D\"), Nintendo once again shows us how it is done. Star Fox 64 3D retains what was great about the original (the levels, gameplay, and audio) and completely enhances what has perhaps aged quite a bit, namely the visuals, and by adding some new features. The graphics are jaw droppingly gorgeous, especially if you remember the original. Seriously, compare pictures/videos of them side-by-side and you'll be amazed at how far technology has come in 14 years. Bravo, Nintendo EAD and Q-Games, you did great! The 3D is also one of the best implementations I've seen yet on the 3DS. Lasers, meteors, enemies, background vistas (which look fantastic), particle effects, the Arwing, you name it, the 3D really does it all justice and, most importantly, actually enhances the gameplay itself. The audio has been enhanced a bit as well, with rerecorded voice-acting and some of the sounds and music have been remixed or remastered, but overall, it has thankfully remained pretty much untouched. The classic musical score by Koji Kondo and Hajime Wakai is as epic as it ever was, the voice acting is still awesomely cheesy, and yes, Falco is still a hilariously smug jerk, and thank goodness for that. That character alone makes my day. The others are great too though. ;)They did add some new things other than the obvious visual effect. There is also a scoring mode after you complete the campaign that allows you to go back for medals, adding even more to the appeal for arcade gamers. There's also a save system now,a huge update from the original, thank goodness. There are also two control-modes of play, the classic N64 control scheme that utilizes purely analog stick and button inputs, as well as a new 3DS scheme that takes advantage of the 3DS' gyroscope capabilities. I prefer the N64 controls, but the gyroscope-mode works surprisingly well and is incredibly fun to use, but it usually nullifies the 3D because of position change. So there is a trade-off there.I'll be honest, I don't care a whole lot for multi-player in Star Fox 64 3D, but it's there. There's no mode for playing against others on the internet, unfortunately, but there is a 4-local multiplayer for you to play with your friends if one of you has this game and all of you have your own 3DS (duh). They did add some power-ups to that mode and overall, it plays fairly nicely, based on my limited experience with it. If you have friends who all own a 3DS to play this with, then you'll love it.Star Fox 64was one of my all-time favorite N64 games, right up there withThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Super Mario 64, and the originalSuper Smash Bros. If all video game remakes were like this andOcarina of Time 3D, I'd get every single one (here's hoping for a Majora's Mask remake too). Star Fox 64 is a classic that has been given a really great treatment in this remake. It enhances all the aspects that needed updating, while keeping the core addictive awesomeness of the original Star Fox 64 perfectly preserved. This really is a timeless game, and I give this 3DS version the highest recommendation. Buy it, blast n'splode it, and soar through the galaxy, saving the Lylat system in your iconic, trusty Arwing!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GF72","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Paslay","summary":"Simply Stunning","reviewText":"I'm assuming that most people reading reviews for this title have played the original and are simply wondering if it's worth $50 to play again. I can say definitively, yes. If you are newer to the series, missed the original and own a Wii U, stop reading this and go buy a copy NOW. It will be the crown jewel of your collection.I'll be honest. I absolutely hated the original when it first came out. I've been playing the Zelda series since the original LoZ on the NES. I had always imagined Link and the land of Hyrule very realistically. When Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask came out I was awestruck. When I saw the ORIGINAL E3 footage of Windwaker with a very serious, realistic looking, Link fighting a detailed and larger than life Ganondorf, I was beside myself. Months later when they made the announcement that the original art had been scrapped for a cartoon overhaul I was furious. Eventually I bit the bullet and picked up a copy and the story breathed new life into the series and the Windwaker > Phanton Hourglass > Spirit Tracks story arch is one of my favorites in the series. It's really the perfect blend of serious and interesting story while still maintaining a light hearted air about it.It was a no-brainer to pick up this remake when it was announced. However, I could not have anticipated how stunning this game looks. This is what the original was meant to look like. The models, environments and textures are stunning. The lighting really adds an ambience that sets the mood for each area. This is probably the best looking Zelda title I have seen. During the opening sequence I just ran around the little island, taking everything in. It's phenomenal.The addition of the Gamepad is great. Everything is right there for you to look at. It's especially helpful with sea charts. The Tingle bottles are a great addition and bring a broader sense of community to a single player game. Every time I see a bottle I get a little excited for what might be inside.All in all, this is a lot like Ocarina of Time 3D in that they took a classic game from the series and breathed new life into it. Hopefully Majora's Mask is next on the list. Aside from the graphics, no drastic overhauls took place because they weren't necessary. You'll notice a few welcome additions but everything just makes the game better. If you have a Wii U, this game is a must own!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Timothy Lovett","summary":"Fundamentally Flawed but Fun for Awhile","reviewText":"Alright, I'm likely to upset some folks by saying this game isn't as great as the hype has made it out to be. Some will say this is because the game is so new and others may say my expectations of it were flawed. Either way I feel like I should mention all of the items which I personally found fundamentally flawed in the games design such that others who look to determine if this game is the right fit for them will be able to make a well informed decision.I'll probably add more to this list as I recall specific things that really stood out to me.To begin, I was one of the folks that got early access via the preorder promotion and also had some time off for the holiday break which I used to play the game. Through this time I was able to get to level 50 about two weeks ago and had some experience with raiding on the normal level with my guild.The following areas will be discussed:PVP: warzones, world pvp, instanced worlds, separate world levelsClasses: crowd control, skill treesLevel: speed of leveling, possible locations for levelingZones/Planets: instancing, planet feel, one path through worlds, likelihood of return to planet after visiting, spaceport, need of mounts, token systemQuests: questing types, questing reward ui, speakingCompanions: reliance on,Crafting: importance of trade network for crafting, purpose, items required for crafting availability, self reliance, paid collectionFun/Additional: human gathering location, mounts, death penalties, inflated economyGuild: guild specific itemsSpace informationRaid informationModification systemArmor differentiation / uniqueness of piecesEnd GamePVP - Warzones (GOOD):Right now there are three warzones that exist. A capture and hold warzone, a basketball / rugby style warzone, and a capture or defend alternating push to last objective warzone. All three are fun and pvp in general feels a lot more exciting than a lot of games I've previously played it in. On top of that there are stat scaling buffs given to players to somewhat even the playing field so level 10s can play with level 40s and not entirely be destroyed. Level 40s still would have an upper hand, however, as they have more skills but it's not impossible to defend against. This system is superior to the bracketing systems most games use because it allows smaller queue times as a result. There is currently an issue where well geared level 50s are near impossible to defeat but the 1.1 patch should address this by giving them their own bracket.PVP - World PVP (BAD):World PVP is somewhat of a joke because of certain design decisions made by the developers which fundamentally would be difficult to change. Firstly, the lowbie planets and capital city planets are inaccessible to the opposite faction. While this could prove to just be a minor annoyance on top of that (as I'll mention in a few paragraphs) many of the other worlds are entirely on different maps for opposing factions. So while you are on the same planet there is no way you will ever bump into an opposite faction user. In my leveling I saw two imperials total and the republic (my faction) is the outnumbered faction.PVP - Instanced Worlds (BAD):As a result of the instancing it further makes it unlikely that you will bump into a member of the opposite faction. It also means that the person who you were fighting can just change instances to get rid of you. It just makes pvping a lot harder because you're dealing with pvpers who can escape to different versions of an already sparse populated world.PVP - Separate World Levels (BAD):A lot of the leveling up worlds have completely separate world maps which look almost identical to the opposite faction but contain completely different npcs, quests, and human players. In these worlds there is no way to interact with the opposite faction. So while both factions may share the planet they can never see each other.Classes - Crowd Control / Class Purpose (ANNOYING):Oddly enough bioware decided that the best option for giving skill abilities to classes was to give everyone very similar abilities. This is fine for PVP where it's nice to have a ton of stuns (and trust me you'll be stunned a lot if you play in warzones) but for pve it removes the real purpose for having so many alternating classes for questing. No longer do people really need to ask for a CC class as they have plenty (everyone is one). Now people just ask for DPS, tank, or healer -- which while fine it removes a lot of the niche purposes of having such a varied player base.Classes - Skill Trees (DECENT):SWTOR appears to not really make any big changes to the skill tree style leveling we've seen in other games. You pop in more skills until you have five at a level and then put points into higher trees or dual spec. There are some interesting combinations you can make but it's nothing ground breaking.Level - Speed of Leveling (BAD):While some uber casual players may rejoice there are a few benefits slower (but not grind focused) leveling can have. First, it limits the number of players reaching end game for a bit allowing developers to enhance some content there prior to them reaching it. Secondly, it makes the accomplishment of actually reaching the highest level more worthwhile. The game leveled me so quickly turning in a quest reward could potentially out level me for other quests I was turning in. I could have skipped planets but I wanted to experience the story. PVP also levels at an extreme rate giving enough experience to potentially level just in that by attending 10 or so warzones. Ever match (even ones I entered right at the end of the game) gave a sizable sum of experience.Level - Possible locations for leveling (BAD):There really only is one path to level 50. While you can skip levels there is no choice in terms of whether you go to planet A or planet B when you're level X. There is a set planet for each range of levels up to 50. On top of that if you do your class quests (which you need to for companions) you will have to at least visit each planet and be forced to visit many of the zones inside of them so you'll need to walk the distance of the planet regardless. I remember fondly the feeling I was getting bored with one zone in WoW so I'd get up and go to another zone to quest and find I liked the beasts I was fighting there more. With SWTOR I'm stuck having to deal with the same beasts over and over again with no option for anything else until I'm done with the level.Zones/Planets - Instancing (BAD):I mentioned this in the PVP instancing note but wanted to make sure I mentioned it here as well. You really never see other people even in busy worlds. They seem to limit the instances to around 50 people and while this may sound like a lot it really isn't because those 50 people are spread across every single zone in the world you're on. It's nice when you have to do a grind quest (which many of the quests in SWTOR are) but it's not nice when you want to feel like you're playing a MMORPG.Zones/Planets - Planet Feel (BAD):Planets feel empty. Not just because of people but because of the way they were designed. There are no animals just grazing really and almost all npcs just sit in their camps waiting for you to attack. NPC characters in town repeat their same animation or just are randomly standing as well as if the whole world aside from your character froze in time. On top of that there are no weather patterns or a day/night cycle and the planet just feels like something is missing.Zones/Planets - One Path Through Worlds (BAD):While some of the later planets don't have this problem (and some like the jail planet do) often you'll find some of the planets have only one path through them. This means that you are being hand held from point a to point b and stopping for quests along the path. This is fine but it removes the immersion you feel in some MMORPGs which allow you to make the mistake of going the wrong way. There were zones in WoW for example which could easily put you against a creature of much higher strength at a low level. Here you'll always be where they want you to be (or on the rails as they say of the themepark).Zones/Planets - Likelihood of Return to Planet After Visiting (BAD):Almost zero. The reason I say almost is because: 1) many class quests force you to travel deep in the planet for a one minute discussion before they send you off (annoying), and 2) you'll likely come back at 50 to hunt hard to reach stat bonuses you missed while leveling.Zones/Planets - Spaceport (ANNOYING):One thing you'll find that will likely annoy you is the spaceport system for landing on planets. Every planet uses a copied spaceport (sometimes in space you need a shuttle to get down and sometimes on the planet) which forces you to run without your mount all the way into the planet. It's just an annoying time sink because there usually is really nothing to see on your way.Zones/Planets - Need of Mounts (ANNOYING):Some people tend to be bad at saving up money... while this game does seem to have a broken economy (inflation is a huge problem) it is annoying to be forced to have a mount to really keep playing. The game effectively does this when you reach Tatooine. Previously a mount is a nice to have feature but many of the planets like Tatooine and Hoth are big empty planets which you'll spend 95% of your time on just traveling. While I like the feeling that the world is huge it just makes it a pain to go anywhere on the planet since you know until you find a binding point / fast travel you won't want to leave even for a flashpoint (dungeon).Zones/Planets - Token System (INTERESTING):I find the token system to be an interesting idea. Basically each planet has its own token type which you can redeem for rewards if you collect enough. This could be an armor piece, a weapon, or a mod (more on mods later). When you complete some quests you have the option of taking a token instead of a reward and sometimes they drop of monsters you kill in the zone or off bosses in flashpoints (dungeons). The nice aspect of these is that you can quickly get good gear if you haven't had luck with any drops or haven't found the piece you need. The bad part is it trivializes the loot drop system by allowing you to select exactly the missing you piece you need. So instead of going on the auction house and purchasing the lightsaber I need to upgrade I'll just collect some tokens from Esseles (the first flashpoint) to get modifications for it. It's not bad but it removes the need for such an auction system since it makes quality gear accessible without the need for other players (since the tokens from from easy daily quests along with regular monsters and normal quests).Quests - Questing Types (BAD):Aside from a very select few quests the majority of quests are either kill or fetch quests. The selection was pretty disappointing as they ignored some of the more fun types of quests I've experienced in other MMORPGs like defend person quests, etc. On top of that while occasionally you will get a quest item to use (scan these droids, etc -- although the only time I remember seeing this was the starter world) these are in their own inventory. Some may like the fact it doesn't interfere with your inventory but there is something to be said about actually holding the item versus just throwing it into a grabbag quest inventory you can ignore.Quests - Questing Reward UI (BAD):You don't know what sort of reward you'll receive until the quest has been handed in. This may be realistic if you're doing chores for grandma but it's nice to know if you can skip a quest when you're outleveling a zone because they made leveling too quick.Quests - Speaking (INTERESTING):I found the speaking in quests to be interesting... until I learned I could skip it with spacebar. In general a lot of the quests reuse the same text (beast races like wookies will say the same sounds a lot and your character has canned replies he reuses) and often it's not really even that interesting. Class quests are interesting and I never skipped them, however.Companions - Reliance On (INTERESTING):It's interesting how much reliance is put on companions for questing. Jedi Knights at this point in time almost exclusively have to use their healer companion past a certain level (according to most I've heard from) up until level 50. It's a nice idea to have companions but it effectively just turns every class into a PVE pet spec where in order to do most content it's smart to keep it out. You don't always need it but many times you'll find some content is impossible without it. Unfortunately this also leads to people rolling need on gear for their companions (who may be a different armor class than them). When I did play tank for a bit with heavy armor a cloth user ended up with the heavy tank pants I needed so he could use them for his companion... just additional pain since some folks don't see this as ninjaing loot.Crafting - Importance of Trade Network (BAD):None. Any items you need for crafting you can send your companions on a mission to get. You can be completely self reliant and there are very few (save for the highest level crafting items) that you need any item outside of those missions to get (it drops from raid bosses and everyone needs one so it's not like it's a random item). This kind of takes away one of the elements of crafting which really makes WoW stand out; the coolness of having something others may not own. I recall the pain of having to find some obscure item from some elementals I needed to build an item I could craft and how I could spend x amount on the auction house to get it right away or spend some time trying to get it to drop. I also recall how happy I was to finally be able to craft the said item. This is gone with SWTOR as you can just craft whatever you want with little work involved.Crafting - Purpose (BAD):There is little purpose to crafting aside from biochem (for reusable stims, addrenals, and medpacks). While you can make mods for armor and weapons, armor, and weapons they are unlikely worth the time involved as you can easily get an item from tokens or by questing in a shorter period of time. Often merchants on planets will sell blue level items as well for a small amount so you can just buy those there. In general crafting is a waste as even when you hit 50 you'll likely out level the highest level crafting items (besides biochem) with the gear you can quickly assemble. I did a few PVP easy win a few warzone quests and I had T1 armor almost instantly. That's better than the armor that drops from the instances at 50.Crafting - Items Required for Crafting Availability (BAD):Like I mentioned above you can get the items almost instantly even for the purple recipes. It's not hard.Crafting - Self Reliance (BAD):No crafting skill requires any other crafting skill. So unlike some engineering recipes in WoW which could require a dye made by a chemist (forget the name of that skill) you can completely do your craft without other players. It removes the need for trading crafted middleware-esc items from the auction house and really makes the game more like a single player game.Crafting - Paid Collection (BAD):You don't actually ever need to leave the Republic/Imperial Fleet station to become a master in your craft. If you have the money you can just send your companion(s) out and run missions for you to quickly rise in level. There is no level cap with skills as well (although produced items have them) so you could level up a level 50, get tons of cash (which isn't hard with how inflated the economy is) and then build a few level 10 alts who craft out every skill to 400. It just removes the exploration aspect of crafting which gives crafting a uniqueness. There is something to be said about having 400 skill scavenging skill when it required you to have to gather from all sort of nodes than it is to just have your minions gather. The nice thing about it though is that they made the planets so boring to go back to so you can just avoid them altogether if you change crafts.Fun/Additional - Human Gathering Location (BAD):There really isn't a human gathering location right now. I suppose you could say the fleet is one but aside from groups around the PVP quest vendor and flashpoints there really isn't a place where lowbies and high levels go to all just hang out between questing. In WoW you had the banks/gates of Stormwind and Ironforge but in SWTOR there really is no common place. This could also be because of the nature of the game, however, where most people never really return to the fleet all that often unless they are done with a particular planet.Fun/Additional - Mounts (BAD):There is no real purpose for mounts aside from the annoyingly large planets. While some people show their mounts off in the station once you hit 50 you are unlikely to really use it much except to go around the station from end to end or datacron hunting. Mounts usually are a thing people are willing to spend a lot of in game cash to really get a nice one for and there is no real point here. On top of that the higher level mounts (rank 2 and 3) are barely an improvement on the original. So there is no real point to upgrade aside from how inflated the economy is so you'll always have cash.Fun/Additional - Death Penalty (BAD):Everyone can rez other people and themselves at the exact location they died. On top of that you lose some durability but nothing else. At least with WoW you had to run back to your corpse. It's not uncommon to see people in SWTOR CC (which everyone gets) a tough enemy, kill the adds, die from the tough enemy, respawn 10 seconds later, and kill the tough enemy alone. It's just kind of silly.Fun/Additional - Inflated Economy (BAD):Inflation is out of control in the game. First, there are too many easy ways to get money. Second, there isn't enough to really spend money on. The issues from crafting I mentioned before really give nothing for people to spend additional cash on and aside from inventory space purchases you won't be buying much. I don't think there was a single point in the game I went bankrupt and toward the end of it I stopped caring about even thinking of selling items (I'd just stop picking them up because it wasn't worth the hassle of managing my inventory for items I'd only sell for cash I didn't need).Guild - Guild Specific Items (BAD):This can be fixed in patches luckily but they currently don't offer much for guilds. No perks (which is fine) and no bank. Guild banks are pretty common these days so not sure why they didn't have one at launch.Space Information (BAD):Space is a single player mission based system. All of the levels are copies of each other after the initial few unique ones just made slightly harder (enemies take more damage forcing you to upgrade). Once you upgrade your ship there is no real difficulty and given how it controls your ship for you (you can only move directionally to avoid thing) it gets pretty repetitive quick. It's a single player mini game. It also gives a lot of cash and experience so I'd avoid if you don't want to level too quickly.Raid Information (BAD):Raids so far are kind of a joke (they can fix this later though luckily). The enemies are either way too easy or are bugged to the point of impossible. In the Eternity Vault we had the second boss bug out not allowing anyone back into the zone after we wiped on our first try so we had to wait until it reset to try again (since resetting it wouldn't work). On top of that it somehow killed us outside of the zone. The final boss also bugged out after he died with half of our group still in the trapped state forcing them to suicide and rezed to get loot. I did like, however, how each person in your raid has a chance to get an armor token to trade in for armor. It's nice because it opens the door to allow a random aspect to retrieving loot more than one person could use. I always hated losing each roll to get a piece of armor while this somewhat removes that need.Modification System (BAD / GOOD):One neat (and bad from an auction house point of view) is the modification system. Until end game (which had mods you can't take out with set bonuses and high level armor / weapon damage) you can use the same modded pieces from when you receive them to the end of the game. This means that you can just keep getting new mods and upgrading as opposed to buying a new item. This is great if you like the look of a piece of armor but really bad from the point of view of a crafter. Since people can easily get mods from tokens (although some may buy mods from mod crafters) there is no point for people to buy blue items really any more that drop. It's too expensive to buy a rare or semi-rare item when you can easily get an item up to that level with a few simple purchases. It really helps ruin the economy and having a clothing system like rift would have allowed people the look they wanted without this breaking of the economy. It's another fundamental system which many (including myself like) but it does have an effect on the economy as a whole as a result it seems bioware did not plan for.Armor differentiation (BAD):Another annoying aspect of the game is the lack of surprise from killing bosses in flashpoints (dungeons) and raids. There is something romantic about receiving a certain end game item and having stats you didn't know about that are great for your character. Because bosses drop specific tokens to get specific end game gear everyone in your class will be wearing it removes that aspect most MMORPGs embrace. It's nice to have the cool shiney thing everyone wants and having the same exact gear just really is disappointing. It also removes the need to really visit a ton of flashpoints (dungeons) since you can just farm your equipment. On top of that most people will have T2 PVP armor because it's so easy to get it. You don't need a specific rank to get PVP armor just need to do the daily which gives you a grab bag to get T2 armor (or the easy weekly for 3 grab bags). If you're lucky (like some people have been) you can end up with four pieces + in the first week just doing daily quests. It's pretty crazy.End Game (BAD):End game right now is fairly bad. This can change but aside from the buggy raids there isn't all that much to do. You'll find the flashpoints (dungeons) to be kind of worthless quickly since it's so easy to get good gear without doing a bunch of them. On top of that without really any crafting goals (in WoW I spent a lot of time really building out my high level engineering items) there is nothing to do aside from PVP and do daily quests for commendations (tokens) you can buy mods with or other items. It really is pretty boring once you reach it. I'm sure they'll add more content but many people who hit 50 have already begun to check out of the system or roll an alt (which is boring since you'll hit all the same zones you just went through because of the lack of quest differentiation).Well, anyhow, I want to give my review of the areas of the game I thought were a little disappointing. Relative to a lot of games they did a really good job with SWTOR. If anything I'd say their biggest issue was that, in a lot of situations, they designed the game from the perspective of a single player. On top of that their ignorance of the MMORPG market led them to make a lot of really foolish mistakes ruining their economy fundamentally (which drives a lot of consumer behavior); in a lot of cases they seem to have favored cool design decisions (let's make moddable armor) over their effects on the game world. This is further exacerbated by the commendation system which, while it rewards players for grinding, removes the need for players to get armor upgrades from other players.Anyhow, I hope my review will help others come to a conclusion if this game is the right fit for them or not. I liked it for the first 1-50 and got bored / fed up with some of the issues I mentioned. At the very least I suggest you buy the game for those first 50 levels as they are fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2012"}

Groh","summary":"Great Protection, Pretty Bulky","reviewText":"This is a nice case for all Nintendo DS systems but especially fits the 3DS. Inside there are spots for games, extra stylus, earbuds, AR cards and screen cleaners.Your system is really secure inside with multiple fasteners/velcro strips. My son's 3DS even fit (although very snug) with a case installed on the DS. He really likes it and has used it for car travel where his DS is usually sliding around on the floor.There are a couple of things that I noticed that seem to detract slightly. There is only one zipper so you can't leave an opening at the top for easy grabbing. And it is a pretty bulky case so it won't fit easily in a bag. But if you think about how much space the parts would take up and add some great padding for protection, then this is the case you would get.A recommended purchase if carry space is not an issue.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2011"}

I remember playing them in the NES and playstation 2. However, Lord of Shadows just didn't cut it for me. The boss battles were nicely done with some amazing graphics, but the game itself were very constricted. There was barely any exploration to be made. The game consisted of different missions. I did not particularly like that. I did not want to go through \"missions\". I expected it to be more like an adventure game as the other castlevania games.

I had never heard of it.  I didn't pick it up until a couple years later for $10 at a store. It blew my mind.  I liked it way better than GTA games for many reasons.  The graphics were great, the physics somewhat believable, and the story second to none.Do I feel that this one is as good?  No. But, I like it better than GTA4, The Godfather, or Red Dead Redemption for xbox 360 as far as SINGLE PLAYER values are concerned.  One of the games that I just mentioned involves a whole lot of running (or riding) around that seems somewhat pointless to me.  Don't get me wrong, I own and like all 3 of the mentioned comparable games.  But, Quality vs. Quantity is the issue here.  I will take quality any day.The story and gameplay are great.  Cover based combat isn't as good as others but, it's a story-heavy game. DLC IS COMING FOR ADDITIONAL MISSIONS AND SUCH.  One of which is free with code from game.  Multiplayer would have been nice but, could be on it's way.  That is the trend these days.  Release half a game and then charge for the rest of it one piece at a time.  I guess I can't criticize them for following suit with everyone else.  A certain company even sells guns,etc. for a game so that people have an advantage over others who don't shell out the money and insults those who have earned the rank.  Game Hint:A company that is not good is......Anyway the game is fun, the graphics nice, and the story is turning out to be really good.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00D9EPI38","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Ciriello \"AdWhois\"","summary":"Pretty much an improvement over the original Xbox 360 in every way, still needs a HDD though.","reviewText":"First off, let me just say this Xbox 360 is way quieter than the original (non-slim, non-elite) Xbox 360 which I also have. Though it still has a power brick it is much smaller (as is the console itself) than the original, and it is also much quieter. Unlike my old Xbox 360 (I think its the arcade) the Xbox 360 E has a designated kinect port so you don't have to use an external power plug or take up a USB port. The Xbox 360E 4GB came with 1 month of Xbox Live free, and a wireless controller (non-rechargeable), as well as a 3.5mm to red/white coax audio cable and standard video component cables. Also unlike my old Xbox 360, the Xbox 360E has built in wifi which is a very nice improvement/money saver.I was able to get the Xbox360E from the Microsoft Store for $99 on black friday and to me that is simply stunning that you can get something as good as the Xbox 360 for so cheap. I've also got the Xbox One (bought from Amazon) and really it's no contest. For value you want the Xbox 360, as of now the graphics on the Xbox One really don't seem much better than the Xbox 360s and the price is outrageous, as long as they are making games for the Xbox 360 it will always be worth it.The only real downside I can see to the Xbox 360E is that it doesn't come with a Hard Drive. 4GB of space isn't enough to do anything except save your games. Almost every game out there requires an update and you'll not be fitting more than one on the internal memory. In cases like that of BF3 (and probably BF4) you are required to install additional \"HD Content\" to the hard drive if you want the game to look good. Unlike updates which you can install to a USB memory stick the \"HD Content\" has to be installed to a hard drive so you need to get one anyways... The fact that updates were required just to play most any game was pretty annoying to me. The Xbox 360E 4GB is virtually unplayable without some additional form of storage, it just surprises me that microsoft would sell a version like that.The good news is that if you don't feel like buying a HDD from Microsoft (the Xbox 360 Slim Hard Drive works) and you happen to have an extra 2.5\" laptop hard drive laying around you can upgrade the Xbox 360E for just $5 through use of an enclosure:Xbox 360 Hard Drive Shell EnclosureOtherwise the cheapest/smallest HDD option is $30 for a knock-off 20GB hdd. Also should be noted that the Xbox 360E console does not come with an HDMI cable so you'll need that too if you plan on having it look HD.At the $100 I paid on black friday the Xbox 360E console was quite the deal. At $150 though it might be worthwhile to just get the \"slim\" that already includes a Hard Drive and maybe a couple games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2013"}

From a graphic stand point I don't believe there is anything better.  Uncharted 2 might be the most graphic console game to date.  The textures are brilliantly rendered and the animation is incredible.  One of the things I enjoyed about the game is the environments which include snow, jungle, city, temples, trains, etc.  There was excellent variety in the levels.  The game controls very similar to Gears of War, just a bit more loose and fast paced.  Overall the controls are perfect and make for some intense 3rd person gun fights.  The game also is heavy with explorations and features a few creative puzzles.  Uncharted 2 was well balanced with fights, puzzles and exploration.  Story wise Uncharted 2 features quite a few characters, all very well acted, and is engaging overall.  The story gets just a bit silly towards the end, but overall it isn't that bad, more of a nit pick than a real complaint.  The game features a 7.1 pcm soundtrack which is excellent and couldn't really be any better.  The overall length of the single player campaign is 8-1o hours with more difficulty levels and online multiplayer options, including coop.

Same old show for the most part.","reviewText":"I'm surprised to see this game getting four star reviews because I've got a real issue with Sony and how they have been treating MLB the Show Franchise for years now. It almost seems like this is just another roster update, there are a few differences, but hardly is worth the justification.Let me start by saying this game came out in May. This is a complete and total joke, it should have been out in March like it usually is. I don't know what the reason for the delay is, but it wasn't worth the hype. You see them making a big deal about facial hair and fans. This has hardly anything to do with the gameplay, which should be the most important thing. Yes, the game looks beautiful and I'm sure it will improve with the next release but it's STILL THE SAME GAME!Road To The Show: This is the game I play the most. This is what a sports game should be all about. They have changed the points system and got rid of the Advancement Goals which was nice. They also have this so you can save it for year-to-year. However, if any of you play NBA 2K you would know how big of a joke this player mode is. It is following the same format since it's release. There should be a full fledged experience like 2K is doing.Online is horrible and laggy. I've played a few times but it really isn't fun. It's impossible to hit anything. Diamond Dynasty is something new and fresh but NHL has been doing this already so once again the Show is old news.Look, the game is still fun but let's be real. It's $60, it was delayed and they have no one in the market to push them. Instead of being at the forefront of sports design they are followers and that is upsetting. I will not be buying next years game unless I see some serious upgrades to RTTS.Another thing, they took our Rivalry mode. My friends and I would play this for hours and now it's gone. Thanks Sony. In the end I feel they really don't care about making a better game but you can make the decision for yourself.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2014"}

Particularly I'm satisfied with renting it rather than buying it, but if you like to play games over and over again to unlock everything and beat the games in all levels of difficulty and also have friends to play multiplayer then it has a good replayability value so you can buy it, especially now its under 20 bucks.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2004"}

Wish they had included Zelda II","reviewText":"[I have written two Zelda reviews, one for the original NES release published June 14, 2001, and one for the Gameboy Advanced release [in 2004] for the Classic NES series, published June 15, 2004. Mike London 12-1-2012]Review 1:  (Four stars for the rerelease.  Five stars for the actual game.)THE LEGEND OF ZELDA, one of Nintendo's most famous NES games, finally sees a rerelease on Gameboy Advance.  People have been waiting a long time for this.  The Super Mario series got its update (including a graphic overhaul) over a decade ago on the SNES as SUPER MARIO ALL-STARS, including a brand new (for the American market) game called THE LOST LEVELS.  The two NES Zelda games, however, never got rereleased until the Game Cube (!), and on top of that, it was a promotional, free rerelease.  All this being said,  is the long wait worth it?Well, sort of.  Although it's great to play the old school Zelda without hooking up a working NES, it's rather pricy at twenty dollars and the graphics may very well turn off younger video gamers.  Not only that, it's very odd NINTENDO gave Zelda fans four Zelda titles in the ZELDA COLLECTION for free, and here they just released the original without any bonus material or extra features.  Nintendo could very easily have included ZELDA II on this cart as well.  That being said, THE LEGEND OF ZELDA, of all the classic NES games re-released, is one of the few that justify's its pricetag.  The rest could easily have been put in an anthology of classic NES games, instead of bringing each one out separately.The gameplay of THE LEGEND OF ZELDA sets up the template followed by all subsequent games in the series.  (Only the NES sequel has any real amount of deviation from the Zelda formula, bring in more RPG elements into the mix).  You play as Link, a hero in green, who has to rescue Zelda from the evil megalomaniac, Gannon.  Not to much of a story, but about as good as you got in the mid 1980s.  You have to rescue eight pieces of the Triforce, which is a mystical triangle (one of three).  These triforce fragments are hidden throughout the world map in various dungeons.  Items you get in one dungeon gives you access to other dungeons, and as you progress, you get various upgrades for your sword and pick up new items.  After you beat Gannon the first time, then a second quest opens up, with items, dungeons, and shops in entirely different locations.  I wish they had released a special edition of SUPER MARIO BROTHERS with the Japanese version of SMB II as a `second quest.\"  But oh well.  Unfortunately, the second quest never really caught on with other games.  The Second Quest is harder than the first.  To get to the Second Quest at the beginning of the game, put \"ZELDA\" as your name.The game itself is very nonlinear, which is what made it such a popular game.  There was the incredible depth of adventure that just permeated the entire thing. Released during a time when most games were side-scrollers, this set you in a world where you could explore and find items. There is the now standard item list, where you obtain items and use them to interact with the world about you. There are hidden dungeons that you must find, and you can burn bushes and push rocks, etc. It radically opened the power of the NES console up, and the gaming world would never be the same.Ironically, though, some may find ZELDA too challenging for this very reason.  Bereft of any real narrative, ZELDA doesn't give you any real direction where to go next, save for the infamous, sometimes incomprehensible old men who give you `clues' on where to go next.  If you don't know where you're going, you'll find yourself wondering around a lot, mostly directionless.  That's what made the game so popular in the first place, but for modern games it may be off-putting how difficult it is to find some of the dungeons without some internal direction from the game.  (As a perfect example, just think how many bombs you would have to use to find the very obscure ninth dungeon on the second quest.)  The SNES installment gives you visual indicators on where to bomb, etc; the original ZELDA does not give you visual ques on anything.  So unless you know the game well or you have access to walkthroughs, expect a lot of time just trying to figure out where to go next.The graphics, while looking rather archaic by today's standards, holds up rather well given its age.  The sprites are bright and the scenery is colourful.  There's only a few instances where you can tell that the screen was squished to adapt to Game Boy Advance's screen, but this isn't very noticeable.  The music is a near perfect port too, making this a very faithful recreation of the original.  For those old enough to remember the NES glory days, the graphics will bring back a lot of memories; for new gamers, however, they may find it difficult to get over the primitive graphics and into the game itself.  Their loss.Conclusion: One of the few NES CLASSICS worth shelling out twenty bucks for.  Still, it's rather puzzling they didn't include anything extra, or even the second NES Zelda game, given they released both ZELDA and ZELDA II, plus the two N64 games, on one spectacular, free collection for GameCube.  For those who never played the original Zelda, this will hook you for life.  There's no better way to start playing this historic series than the original.  For those of us old enough to remember the NES, this is a great game, and a great way to relive very fond memories.  Still, if you don't have the Zelda Collection, this is a very worthwhile purchase.-------------------Review 2: One of the greatest and most influential games ever released, June 14, 2001Released in the Stone Age of Video Games, this game stands as one of the most influential games ever released.  Nintendo players quickly sent the message to Nintendo by making this one of the most played games released on the old NES, with this release staying in the top ten games as voted by Nintendo Power readers for several years.  It would become the blueprint for RPG games, and its influence can be felt even now in the current game scene.  Others would take this and see what they could do with it, and because of this game the RPG became an established genre, although this will always be the game that started it and stands at the beginning, casting a very long shadow over its descendants.  But don't be mistaken, this RPG has some things that are very unlike its genre.  Levels are not built up (this would be the next installment), and magic and that were not big concerns.  Hearts were used instead of experience.  But these would be incorporated in the other release, so even then Zelda has its hands on that as well.So what is it about this game that so captured the imagination and the dollar of the average gamer?  Well, one was the incredible depth of adventure that just permeated the entire thing.  Released during a time when most games were side-scrollers, this set you in a world where you could explore and find items.  There is the now standard item list, where you obtain items and use them to interact with the world about you.  There are hidden dungeons that you must find, and you can burn bushes and push rocks, etc.  It radically opened the power of the NES console up, and the gaming world would never be the same after this game.To give a personal history, my brother and I got a Nintendo when it came out, playing all the standard games but somehow missing this one.  Although I played it, it was only in 1999 that I sat down and, for the first time in my life, played through the entire game.  It was amazing.  We had got the Super NES counterpart when it came out in 1991, so I knew that by heart.  This was just as great, although I still think the Super NES instatement,The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, is the best overall though I have not yet played the two new Gameboy releases,The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of AgesandThe Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons.  I'm sure they'll be great.By today's standards, the graphics are absolutely terrible, and by the standards of the day, they were only average.  But this proves only one thing: playability comes over a sleek looking graphical interface.  And this game has that.  Indeed, even now people call in asking Nintendo tips on this game.  Considering the NES has been dead for several years that is something indeed.  Of all things, this game desperately needs to be released on the Gameboy, packaged with the sequelZelda II: The Adventure of Link.As far as story goes, it is nowhere near as complicated as the games that came after it.  Essentially, Princess Zelda has been kidnapped and Link must regain the 8 pieces of Triforce to gain entrance to the ninth dungeon for the final showdown.  Musically, there are only three tracks, one for the Overworld (the now famous Overworld Theme, commonly called the Legend of Zelda Theme, which this game's N64's counterpart has been criticized for ostracizing, the dungeon theme, and the ninth dungeon theme.) After he beats Gannon the first time, a second quest opens up, meaning yet a whole other adventure.  The difficulty rating is greatly increased.  I personally think they should have down this with SUPER MARIO BROTHERS II, the Japanese version, now known in the States as THE LOST LEVELS.  It corresponds in difficulty to a second quest.  But that is neither here or there.  The great disappointment is that no one else took this to heart, and this is one feature that has not been a major influence on the RPG genre.  The second quest so enriched the game, giving the gamer more for his/her dollar, and I wish they'd do second quests more.As far as games go, \"The Legend of Zelda\"'s influence cannot be overestimated.  Truly one of the giants of the Gaming Universe.  This and SMB 3Super Mario Bros. 3are the best NES games by far.  Lets hope they re-release it soon!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2004"}

Roman","summary":"What a lot of people probably thought Fallout 3 was going to be like.","reviewText":"Borderlands didn't interest me for the longest time. Gameplay looked weird to me with all the hit points flying out of enemies as they're getting shot, the scenery looked like it was taken directly out of Fallout 3 and given a cartoon-y loo, and reading that there were 'a bazillion guns' made me wonder if that wasn't compensating for boring gameplay. But I gave it a shot after a few friends of mine recommended it, and you know what? This was a pretty damn fun game! It has a couple of problems here and there, but I'm really glad I gave Borderlands a shot- it kept me entertained for well over 30 hours, and will keep me busy for a little longer as I try to get a few more trophies. I'm not even a fan of first person shooters (I can count all the FPS games I've played in my life on one hand), but this is one of the more fun games I've played on the ps3.Regarding the plot, there isn't a lot to talk about. You select one of four mercenaries at the start of the game in a quest to find a mysterious Vault (Fallout simile 1 of many), located somewhere on the planet Pandora, a dangerous place full of mutated raiders, dangerous creatures, and...well, more stuff out to get you. You'll get clues as to where the Vault is through tons of the missions you'll get from various people and even local Bounty Boards. Missions range from simply killing raiders, taking out big bosses, collecting parts for guns, clearing pathways, finding audio journals, and even finding a guy's dirty magazines. The game's done almost entirely in first person mode, though there are a couple of times when you switch into third person to use turrets to mow down the bad guys, or catch a ride on a pretty cool car with either dual machine guns or a rocket launcher. As you go through different locations on Pandora, you'll find lots and lots of treasure (always referred to as loot in the game). Money, guns, shields, character class enhancers, health, etc. But when you start out, you can only carry a couple of things, so choosing what guns you'll want is an important decision, as is how many healing items you'll want to bring along. Everything on Pandora costs money, and there aren't any healing stations or beds for a quick rest. You wanna heal? Go to a health vending machine and buy some health packs. Vending machines are plentiful on Pandora, and you'll be using them a lot, usually for ammo upgrades and selling excess items. And if you die? Well, your DNA is stored at a local checkpoint, so you can come back, but it'll cost money too.This is one of those rare games where I really did want to take on every side quest that came my way. The reason it took me so long to beat the game was because of the side missions, just so I could get more money or cool new weapons. Later on in the game, there's a -steep- price for dying, with my most expensive death costing over 35000 bucks. Ouch. So keeping a lot of money on hand is useful. What's great about Borderlands though is that as you take that last hit, you'll have a few seconds as you're falling to kill any enemies around you. If you get one, you'll get a Second Wind, and keep on going. Sometimes it'll help to keep a very weak enemy alive when you're surrounded by bigger guys, just so you can have an almost guaranteed second wind. As far as the bazillions of guns go, it's really just many variations of a few types, with some differences being a tiny percentage increase on zoom. You have the usual handgun, shotgun, assault rifle, SMG, snipe rifle, rocket launcher, and a very nifty energy based weapon later on. But all of those except the latter have countless variations, and also get elemental enhancements like fire, acid, explosive and electric. Electric takes out enemy shields fast, fire burns flesh continuously, acid melts through armored foes, and explosive has a chance to blow up enemies after they're shot. Regular weapons with no elemental effects are always good, but you'll want to keep one of each element type around as the enemies get tougher. Except maybe fire...I barely got any use out of that type after the first 10 hours.And those character classes? All very cool. The Soldier's special ability has him deploy a portable turret with a shield that provides cover as it caps enemies. The Siren's lets her turn invisible for a short time and cause explosions upon entering and exiting invisibility. The Hunter has a pet that flies over and takes out the enemy, great if they're taking cover. And the Berserker takes less damage and absolutely plows through enemies with his huge fists when his ability is activated. As you level up, you can enhance some of the properties of the abilities.As fun as it was exploring Pandora and taking on mission after mission, I did have a few problems that keep Borderlands from getting 5 stars. First is one a lot of people complain about- backtracking. About halfway through the game, I was able to get a teleportation device, but there's only one of these per map- not in various locations in each area. You can't teleport from your map- you have to reach the station. It'd get very boring walking through areas I cleared out for minutes at a time just to reach the teleporter. Second, the difficulty is weird. In the beginning of the game, some areas were a total pain for me to get through, but later on, everything got very easy, and I found myself rarely dying unless I couldn't get to cover in time to let my shield recharge. My weapons just got too good, and one of my guns took out a huge boss in less than a minute. The last problem is my main one- the target on your map that marks where you need to go. 95% of the time, it's accurate, but for some missions, it just gives you the general area of where you objective is. This was always the case with finding parts for a gun, and it drove me nuts, having to resort to looking at a video online to find out where a stupid revolver chamber was. Yeah, guess what, it wasn't anywhere near the marker, and I wish the mission summary would've mentioned something about it.But the game's still great, and has a terrific online co-op mode. Despite all the little touches of Fallout 3, like the many bobbleheads you'll find, this is a solid game and I can't badmouth it very much. Not a system seller, but definitely a fun shooter to play with friends or by yourself. Borderlands gives you plenty of bang for your buck.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"At last, the Halo series has come full circle.","reviewText":"It seems these days we gamers get inundated with HD remakes and remasters all the time, most of which amount to nothing more than bare-boned ports slapped with some up-rez paint and stretched to widescreen and, most importantly, the price of a brand new game. Until now, those seemed like adequate, maybe even \"good\" efforts. Not anymore. Developers of the world, start taking notes; THIS is how you do a truly awesome, worthwhile remake. 343 Industries was not content to lazily shove a ten-year-old game into your face with no substantial updates and call it a remake, using manipulative, fancy terms like \"HD\" and \"remastered.\" No, instead they opted for something much more grand, and much more glorious. There's a lot to cover here about Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, so I'll get right to the campaign. If you don't like long reviews, tough, don't read this one. Halo CE is too great to be confined to a short, anemic review, and this version deserves a lot of detail. I make no apologies for that. I'll tell you right now, this is an absolutely incredible deal at $40 (it would be a great deal at $60!). Halo fans rejoice, the developers have heard your cries and answered them in Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary!Full disclosure: I am a single-player campaign first, co-op second, competitive multiplayer third/last, kind of guy. Halo is about the only series I've ever actually cared playing competitive multiplayer for. I've sunk countless hours into all iterations of Halo multiplayer, including the original. That been said, I play video games almost exclusively for the immersion and story, and this game was a revelation for me ten years ago. Halo: CE's campaign is legendary, second to none in terms of sci-fi epics, and it is what I will give the most attention to in this review. However, for you multiplayer enthusiasts, I will try to be as detailed there for you too. Here we go...I never thought I'd finding myself saying this, but Halo: Combat Evolved now has graphics and art design that at least matches, and in some areas surpasses, Halo's best past efforts. Well, sort of. You see, there are two engines ever present while you play. The new anniversary engine that 343i and their partner developers created adds a whole new layer of delicious, high fidelity visual goodness that, surprisingly, surpasses evenHalo Reach'sphenomenal graphics engine at times. The original Halo had ground breaking visuals at the time of its release, and really gave the epic story a feeling of grandeur and scope rarely seen before or since in a sci fi video game. Now, once again, I'm finding myself in absolute awe at the scope and sheer beauty in this game. This is true when looking at the broad picture down to the tiniest details. From the incredibly striking, sexy Mjolnir Mk. V armor that has a pristine green sheen, to the glowing projectiles (which are independent light sources and look really dynamic lighting up the world as they fly), to the way grenades dynamically shower the scene with glowing cinders, to the barrage of sparks when bullets ricochet, to the updated enemies (covenant and flood both look awesome!), to the updated marines, to the Halo ring itself in all its majesty (jaw-droppingly gorgeous sky-boxes and environmental vistas included), Halo Anniversary truly exceeds all possible expectations graphically. It does an awesome job staying true to the spirit and philosophy of the original's art design, while maintaining coherency with Halo's later sequels, while still making it all feel so new and fresh again. The art design in this game was always top-tier and spectacular and now, finally, it has the console power it needs to really shine through, and boy does it ever!The new visuals here, from the graphical quality to the astounding art design, all add up to make that feeling of discovery and awe more strong than ever. I don't want to give away how they brought Halo's iconic levels into the year 2011, because you're in for a treat when you discover it all for yourself (again). In every conceivable way, each level in the campaign was recreated with a clear reverence for the source material, while greatly improving levels that generally weren't very beloved by the fanbase (I'm looking directly at you Library!). I played the original Halo more times than I care to count, but this feels like I'm playing it for the first time. It's like falling in love all over again. Hit \"back\" on your controller and \"classic mode\" activates, transporting you back in time to the original engine entirely, graphics and all, and it is very striking to see how far technology has come in a mere ten years. It's also amazing to see that pretty much the only thing \"dated\" about the original Halo: CE is its graphics. \"Classic mode\" is a great feature.It is also worth noting that in \"Anniversary mode,\" they redid the cutscenes to make the shots more effective, the animations more refined, and to enhance the overall story telling. Don't worry though, there's no changes to the story like stupid \"Greedo shooting first\" moments injected in. We all know Master Chief shoots first. >:D They DID add really cool motion comic terminals (alaHalo 3) that connect all of the existing (but mainly Combat Evolved) Halo games into the upcoming new Reclaimer trilogy, as well as really tell 343 Guilty Spark's own sad, poignant tale. These terminals are really well done, the way this new story is conveyed is awesome, and the story itself is, no surprise, extremely deep and well-written.Some of the audio has also been redone for this release. The voice acting is the exact same as before, with the original recordings used and not even put through any processing or remixing, but everything else has been enhanced. Weapons retain the feel pretty much the same as they did way back when, but they also now sound a lot more powerful and have way more oomph to them. It's an amazing feat to retain the same spirit of a ten-year-old masterpiece, while actually improving on those old aspects and making them feel brand new again (a theme I have stressed throughout this review. It really is amazing how well they did this). My hats off to the audio director, who clearly poured his soul into this project. The musical score was also rerecorded with the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra, and it sounds spectacular.  Again, it only enhances the original, but changes nothing. It's very respectful, and as a diehard Halo fan, I was most pleased playing this. If you don't like the new musical recording, there's a place in the main menu where you can activate the old soundtrack files. Yet another nice feature, no? The music and sound effects mesh beautifully well. The glee I feel listening to high fidelity 7.1 surround sound with mywhite Astro A40 Audio Systemwith this game is unmatched. Amazing sound design for sure, but I expected no less from Halo. Even ten years ago, Martin O'Donnell's work in this particular aspect of the game was revolutionary and it still holds up masterfully, even today.Well, those are the biggest changes to this version of Halo: CE's campaign. As I said earlier, the game has two engines. One is for visuals, and then there's the *always* present original engine dictating every sort of under-the-hood, coding related aspect of the game, with its entire gameplay glory still intact, warts and all. This can be both a great thing and a bad thing, depending on your perspective. The physics, the AI, the weapon values, the level design coding, and anything else related to gameplay is the exact same as you remember it, pixel for pixel. This includes glitches like freakishly deformed dead character models and jerky motions at times (I found these more humorous than detracting from quality). All the great/dumb tricks you could do in the original, you can do here. The ridiculous mini-mortar cannon pistol? It's here in all its glory. The levels are all exactly the same with the same layout you remember. The Assault Rifle has 60 rounds and is a beast; by far its most powerful iteration of all the Halo series. Grunts flee in terror when their leader is taken out.I could go on and on, but the point I'm trying to make is that Halo CE pretty much defined how a FPS should play on a console, rivaling even a PC's place as the go-to location for FPS gameplay. 343i respects that, and so changed nothing about the gameplay; it is FPS perfection for console. The amazing thing is that when combined with the new visuals and audio, it feels like a brand-spankin-new game, and even today could be a game-of-the-year champion, EVEN among all the heavy hitters that this year boasts. New additions like never-before-seen skulls and co-op over Xbox live are just cherries on top of this awesomesauce-drenched sci-fi cobbler.I personally do not have a Kinect or 3-D capable television, so I cannot speak as to the quality of those features in this review. However, if as much work was put into implementing those things as there was put into literally everything else in this game, well, I think you Kinect/3-D enthusiasts will more than likely have a lot to enjoy here.The multiplayer also got a lot of love. There are six multiplayer maps remade beautifully from Halo CE,Halo PC, and even one classic fromHalo 2. There's also one firefight map added from the campaign (along with a brand new chance to play firefight with friendly AI-controlled ODSTs). These are all played in Reach's engine, and you can download them onto your system to play from Reach directly, or you can just play these maps from the menu on the screen. The thing is, the developers really worked hard so that from the menu, you can select playlists that perfectly emulate the classic Halo CE multiplayer from the old days, played on the classic maps you remember. When playing in these classic playlists, I feel like a 13/14-year-old again, at the good ol' LAN parties, with big, clunky SD televisions, playing Halo CE multiplayer all night long with my friends and their friends. It's awesome! They also made one variant to each of these maps so that, if you want, you can play them utilizing Reach's style of multiplayer, armor abilities and all. So technically, there are TWELVE maps here and again, these maps are great whether playing in \"classic\" playlists or ordinary \"Reach\" playlists. With such drastic differences in gameplay possibilities between those two, this equality in greatness is no small feat. Great job 343! I honestly wish more developers cared about their fans so much.I could really go on forever about this version of what is easily one of my favorite games of all time. I was very skeptical when I heard they were developing a remake of this game, but Anniversary does not disappoint one tiny bit. I really didn't think they could refine such a classic masterpiece, but by god, 343 Industries, as well as Saber Infinity and Certain Affinity, did what I honestly felt impossible and actually made this classic feel new again! Let me be clear here; the developers were clearly cogniscant of Halo's massive shoes, and so respectfully recreated the experience perfectly while refining all aspects that had aged, namely visuals and audio, while adding some supplementary story (terminals) and gameplay (skulls) elements. They did a fantastic job. Even if you don't like the changes, classic mode essentially wipes them all away and you can enjoy Halo in all its original glory, now in widescreen and HD resolution. My golden standard for faithful, enhanced remakes areThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D,Star Fox 64 3D,Final Fantasy IV (DS),Klonoa, and now Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary. I challenge any and all developers to top these games in terms of remake greatness, but I know most will fail. This is magic in electronic form. Buy this game! Better yet, buy it NEW and *reward/encourage* 343 Industries for actually improving on perfection! Buy it, devour it, and once again, LOVE IT!My feelings on 343 Industries taking over Halo: \"I think we're just getting started...\"Update 12/12/11, I would like to take this opportunity to present my own opinions on the pricing and multiplayer issue people seem to be having:Historically, for the typical price of $10, you can have access to three-four new maps for Reach. Three multiplayer matchmaking maps, maybe one firefight map, and no new playlists. That's it.Halo 3: ODST, was originally $60 for essentially a 4-6 hour expansion campaign, firefight, and three exclusive new multiplayer matchmaking maps for Halo 3, as well as the entirety of Halo 3's multiplayer suite (all of which most people had shelled out tons of money for already). Bungie themselves stated it was only worth the price of an expansion, the publishers thought differently. Sixty bucks...Halo Anniversary's entire multiplayer can be bought by itself and played entirely through Reach for $15 off of the Xbox Live Marketplace... Let's see here, if you buy Halo Anniversary in its entirety for $40, that means you're essentially paying $15 of that for a new firefight map with exclusive new friendly AI capability (which is basically like having AI buddies in campaign who will use turrets effectively, and are great to have if you strategically play with them in mind). You also get *SIX* classic maps beautifully recreated for matchmaking. You could say TWELVE since each map was tweaked (new pathways, ramps, paths, etc) to compliment the type of gameplay Reach's multiplayer offers. They also offered certain gametypes and playlists that do very closely emulate the classic multiplayer gameplay of the original (if not perfectly). Some of the \"classic gameplay\" ones show up as vote options mixed with Reach gameplay. So really, is $15 for the multiplayer so outrageous?That means, if my first-grade math serves me correctly, the campaign is $25. Yes, $25 for one of the most influential, highly praised video game campaigns of all time (and one that is easily 8 or 9 hours long if you rush, 10-12+ if you take your time. I've probably sunk at least 25-30 hours into this version alone because of its high replayability factor), with major visual and audio overhauls, as well as widescreen for the original, many new control options, much better cinematics, 3-D capabilities, pretty substantial additions with Kinect, achievements, co-op over Xbox Live (It works FINE, I've played many times over Live, sometimes as host, sometimes not, it never stuttered for me once), really cool side-story via stylish motion comic terminals (that gives hints for Halo 4, another plus), inventive and fun new skulls, classic mode itself, and a slew of other features... Is $25 so unfathomable for something that had so much work put into it?And for that matter, is it so offensive and outrageous for this package to garner high-praise? I'm seeing *very* snobbish reviews and comments all over the place, by people that are offended that others would rate this package so highly... I mean, really?! C'mon people... do I really need to reiterate the fact that here, a 5-star is defined by the phrase \"I love it?\" The 5-star reviews here are by people who loved this game, why hate on them and put them down for that fact? I just don't understand people who want to dictate to others what they can and cannot like/love simply because the product didn't fulfill their every wish and whim. That in itself is absurd. Reviews are subjective to the reviewers' opinion, it's a very simple fact.Honestly, I think the campaign is worth $40 by itself, but no, it's $25 (and as of June 6th, 2012, it's a mere $15!), along with a $15 multiplayer, which, by the way, is a steal of a deal at $15 if you compare its value to Halo's history of map pack content and prices. So please, stop with the complaining, and show a little reason. All of this about multiplayer was clearly explained beforehand. The outrage and snobbish cynicism is getting more than a little old.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}

Shimkus \"Movie Manji\"","summary":"first impressions are very good. vastly improved over 2k10","reviewText":"NBA2k11 features Michael Jordan, and as I grew up with video games ever since the NES days, I can tell you that there were many basketball games that he didn't allow himself to be in. This game is like a makeup for all those lost years when they had some guy on the bulls, with no profile picture, and some generic name, but usually had mad skills! But even if you hate Jordan (i.e. Jazz fans), NBA2K11 is better than last years game, which had terrible team defense, with a hard to master shooting stick.The gameplay is much smoother. On defense, you aren't so inclined to crouch down in some crab defensive posture, when instead you are trying to prevent a fast break. You back peddal at such a brisk pace that you are allowed to make some little mistakes on defense without basically giving the keys to the paint to quicker guards now. It seems as though the defense is still filled with some glitches though. It is very hard to pass to who you want everytime. I average way too many turnovers because of this, and the commentators are never slow in pointing that out either. And the defenders have great hands, and are always looking to deflect your passes, no matter how skilled of a passer you may have. Put the two problems together and you have moments when you get really mad, and offense can turn to defense really quick. You better learn how to defend the fast break unless you have found a way with the your playstation move controller that my PS3 dual shock control can't do, because you are going to give up the rock tryin to feed the post. Even on simple pick and rolls, on seemingly money plays, at the last moment the defending center can at the last moment raise his arm (with the back of his head faced to you!) and make the deflection!Some of the amazing things that I have never seen in a basketball game are dynamic stadiums. Some games are not very filled with fans, while Laker games are really energetic! Nitpicking here, the Staples center usually lowers the lighting on the audience, and sometimes I felt that they had too much lighting on the crowd, and also, they had the crowd all in their seats at the beginning of the game. If you have been a Laker fan for long, you will know that Laker fans are awesome, but they are usually late to the game LOL! But this is a fantastic element to the game that I am amazed with!Although I feel the graphics altogether to be better than last years, it does seem as though some of the players don't look like who they are supposed to be. I felt that Derek Fisher's game persona, looked really bad! And Kobe still looks like an alien, like last years. But I really enjoyed some of the reactions of the players. There are some really spot on behaviors done by alot of players.As time goes by and I play more of this game, I hope to add more to my review. So far, I absolutely love playing classic Michael Jordan games, and seeing a better game dynamic than ever before. I have much to learn about this years game, even though I have played last years version alot, it is much different. I love this game, and it is the best basketball game ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2010"}

Madden 2005 is a disapointment espcially after last years great Madden 2004.  Madden 2005 is done improving, just adding some unnessecary stuff to the physics, the result is a bit choppier gameplay that looses a tad of it's smooth balance of running and passing. I beat the New England Patriots 41-0 with the Cowboys. All I did was throw the same pass all game long. That's a true story.  It's just not very realistic football. That being said, it's still basicly Madden 2004 with a code of paint and it's still Madden so I can't say it's a bad game it just didn't improve.On the other hand ESPN has improved. It's hard to explain but the gameplay is just better, it actually can be a bit cumbersome to pass the ball in ESPN 2K5, usually leading to better balanced defensive battles and games where the team comming up with interceptions and controls the football game with a running attack and a careful passing game wins.  In ESPN 2K5, it usually takes a bit more time for either team to take control the game. Field goals actally have a role here in ESPN 2K5, unlike Madden where a 45 yard field goal is out of the question, here the kickers are pros and make them like they do in the real NFL. Unlike Madden, you'll be forced to settle for field goals sometimes and actually punt sometimes because defense and field position are a factor. Unlike Madden 2005 where a 4th and 13 usually has a 50% chance of working out that doesn't fly in ESPN 2K5 very often, your chances of comming up with a defensive stop after you punt are much better. This kind of senseless going for it on 4th down usually leads to loosing or even getting blown out in ESPN 2K5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"Enjolras","summary":"Beautiful","reviewText":"I just got finished playingThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princessafter I was sick for a week. The game is now about 4 years old, but despite that it's still an incredible game and well worth getting (you can probably get it used cheaper). It's one of the best games I've played on Wii and in some ways beats outThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time(but notThe Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past). Here are some of my thoughts after beating it:GRAPHICSThis is probably the most beautiful of Zelda games. Especially after the horrible cartoonish look ofLegend of Zelda The Wind Waker, the realistic textures in this game make this a beautiful world to explore. There are definitely places where one could just sit and relax, like the fishing pond. Also, the enemies and bosses all look awesome - they're invariably large, nasty looking creatures!GAMEPLAYThe game includes some cool battle sequences and use of items. In some cases, you need to use a certain item or ride your horse to defeat a boss - but it never feels too forced. The battle of the Bridge of Eldin, with its jousting scene, is the best. The dragon in Skytown is also really cool. I wish you could replay some of those sequences and boss battles again - that's my only complaint about the gameplay.GAME CONTROLSI had some difficulty positing Link and getting him to do what I wanted, especially on the Wii because the A button does so much (sometimes you jump when you meant to grab). The more I played, the more I got used to it, but I think the 1 and 2 buttons could be been better used to add functionality (they just display the map).PLOT/STORYGenerally, it's the same old story - Gannon is trapped in a dark world (Twilight in this case) and you need to defeat him and save Zelda. There are some cool twists and when you're playing you really don't know what's going to happen next (unless you read a spoiler review). Midna, a new character from the Twilight realm, is pretty cool. She has an attitude and helps you out quite a bit with hints.MUSICGreat, as always with the Zelda series. It doesn't have quite the power ofThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, but it does fit really well with the game (especially the Hyrule Field at night theme).OVERALL EFFECTThis is a great game, and it gets better the more you play. There's a lot of stuff to do. Even some of the side activities are fun, like finding bugs and Poe Spirits. It took me at least 60 hours of playing time to beat, and I want to go back and get all the items. I'd definitely recommendThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princessto return to Hyrule for a bit beforeThe Legend of Zelda: Skyward Swordcomes out this fall.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2010"}

Graphically it looks on par with what the Gamecube version was. The story and cutscenes are simply amazing and not only well animated but well detailed. You can also upgrade your guns and mix herbs to increase your health. The best part is taking a grenade and chucking it at a bunch of your enemies and watching them explode.

The only downfall of this little beauty is that it isn't backward compatible with the Gameboy Color or Gameboy games, but if modern gaming is okay with you (and there's alot of re-releases of popular titles to choose from, anyway), then you won't miss it.All in all, I give this system an A++ for it's overall huge attitude in such a small package.

Still, I think it's a great racing game. Great graphics, great driving dynamics, great flexibility in upgrading, customizing, tuning and racing your cars. I really enjoyed the \"Auction House\" functionality. There's still a fair amount of activity in there and it adds to the singleplayer mode as well as the online racing. I play a racing game once in a great while, but have been doing one here and there for almost 15 years now. So, admitting I haven't played the hottest new entries in the last few years, I do think this is a very sophisticated and well-made racing game and a lot of fun. Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2011"}

Gamers will always love AC for the sheer amount of stuff you can receive. You can upgrade to a giant two-story house with a basement. You can purchase all of Tom Nook's and Gracie's furniture and apparel. You can mail-order goods you purchased in the past. You can keep fossils, bugs and fish in your museum. The sheer volume of stuff you can obtain never ends.No, the big problem is that there wasn't much depth to this game in the first place. Once players obtain all the goods they ever need, there's not much left for them to do but to find more stuff. There's hardly any substantial narrative, so it will never reach the epic scale of storytelling in games such as \"Harvest Moon.\"AC is much easier to play than a majority of \"Harvest Moon\" and other real-life simulators. It's even more user-friendly than \"The Sims.\" Characters are never restrained to a short time limit. Since the game clock is conjoined to the actual time and date of the year, players have nearly all day to collect as many things as possible.But there isn't much inside the actual game that is new. Sure, the city is the perfect place to position Crazy Redd, Dr. Shrunk and the fortune teller. Players can even get their own new haircuts. However, there's no real urgency to find these items because they are available right from the beginning of the game. Even the new items in Gracie's only change every season of the year.With all this said, though, \"Animal Crossing\" retains its massive appeal. The new Wii remote controls allow players to effortlessly design all their clothes, flags and hats. Fishing is easier than all the other AC games. Even town traveling is incredibly simple if players have a Wi-fi connection.Just don't expect anything mindblowing. The Wii edition of AC really could have been the equivalent of a real-life chat community, where players interact freely in massive worlds. However, with \"AC: City Folk,\" it's clear that Nintendo wants to keep children safe by limiting the free-roaming range of activities. It's still a great game, but for the newest generation of hardcore gamers, it could have been so much more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2010"}

It has broken almost every sales record for first day sales. Unfortunately, the game fails to deliver in many respects.In the single player mode, the plot makes almost zero sense until the last 2 missions. The menu interface (tied into the campaign story) is rather unique and quasi-interactive (there are a few achievements related to this menu system). Unfortunately, many of the weapons used in the game were not developed/used during the years in which the plot takes place. The SPAS-12 and Steyr AUG were not used in the Vietnam era.The game also uses the term \"ACOG\" in a generic manner to describe a variety of magnified optics. Generally speaking, the ACOG is a Trijicon product to describe its family of Advanced Combat Optical Gunsights. In this game, an ACOG could be a Russian POSP or the built-in optic for the AUG and Enfield L85.Some feel the multiplayer mode is the real gem of the Call of Duty series. Black Ops adds a Combat Training mode where you can play against Bots (Unreal Tournament, anyone) and earn currency for mods so you can try all the equipment/gear before you commit in the normal multiplayer mode. I felt it is more of the same. Once you've played a Call of Duty multiplayer game, you've played them all. The veteran players were already at level 20+ within a few hours of the game being released. I was still trying to get used to the horrible controller interface versus the more effective mouse/keyboard solution for FPS games.The zombie mode is kind of interesting, although you just encounter endless waves of Zombies with up to 3 other players online. Left 4 Dead is much better for zombies.The graphics aren't anything to write home about, and the audio is kind of sub-par compared to Medal of Honor and CoD MW2. I use Turtle Beach X41 Digital Dolby 7.1 surround headphones, and the positional audio in Black Ops is terrible.Overall, the game is moderately enjoyable in the campaign mode and the multiplayer mode is more of the same. It's best to play with friends, otherwise it feels like any other multiplayer gaming experience with random strangers. However, Black Ops was certainly not worth the release date pricing, although Modern Warfare 2 has not dropped much in price even a year after its release.I give it 3/5 stars. CoD MW2 was much better. Black Ops was just overhyped and overmarketed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004FUL9YW","description":"","reviewerName":"Dustin D. Smith \"Duster\"","summary":"Dont judge this game until you upgrade Heller and reach the Red Zone","reviewText":"I was starting to feel regret seeping into my mind about 6 hours into this game. Something just didnt feel right. Yeah i was having a pretty good time playing the game. Things just felt like they could be cranked up a few notches on the fun meter. Thats when i made it to the Red Zone, the final part of the game where the whole city is in ruins and overrun with infected. The buildings are the tallest here and you can use your Heller to his fullest potential. I highly suggest upgrading his jumping/ running early in the game, so when you make it to the red zone you are flying over huge sky scrapers and doing elbow drops on tanks from 50 floors up. It is quite exhilirating. The rush of vertigo never gets old and slaying hundreds of infected and taking on the challenging brawlers and strike teams is sooo much more fun when you have massive buildings to scale and plan out your attacks. This game redeemed itself in the red zone and now i dont regret buying it at all. The improved graphics help alot with the immersion as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2012"}
