{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike.

VanPortfliet \"Matthew san\"","summary":"A beautiful game, but lacking depth","reviewText":"It was only around the beginning of 2005 that I finally decided to purchase this game used, after hearing continual hype about what a great game it was.I wouldn't really say it was a disappointment. The graphics were incredibly beautiful, and the castle where the game takes place is a fascinating and all around very interesting place to get lost in. An enjoyable game, but it didn't really pull me in that much, and I wouldn't say that it's anywhere near one of the best games I've played.For all of the beauty of the game, it is unfortunately lacking in any kind of depth or interesting gameplay. Well, the puzzle solving WAS fun, and interesting. But that's where the fun ends. There is absolutely NO character development, no variety whatsoever of different attack moves, no real combos, no magics or techniques, no armor, no accessories, and a whopping 2 weapons in the entire game. The first half of the game you have a stick, the second half you have a sword. That's it. Also, there is essentially only 1 kind of enemy in the entire game that you have to fight over and over and over and over again. The combat is just plain monotonous and boring, and it really drags this game down. You have 1 move: swing your stick (or sword). It also has practically no replay value, other than to maybe see the scenery one more time.So, this game is very beautiful graphically, it's unique, has a good story, and is definitely worth playing through once if you like puzzle solving. But in my opinion, it's not all that underrated, as it seriously lacks any kind of real depth to the gameplay.Barely an above average game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2005"}

Geist","summary":"New Direction is Fun, but May Disappoint Die-Hard Fans","reviewText":"As a die-hard fan of the Mario Party series, I was disappointed when I first played this game. Your player moves with all the other players, coins and items have been done away with, the dice only rolls 1-6, you don't get to choose how many turns you play, and, most shockingly, you don't buy Stars to become the game-winner. I missed the original concept from the first 8 games.That being said, once I decided to be a little more open-minded about the game itself, I realized that Mario Party 9 has plenty of merits on its own:- Amazingly fast load times- Mid-level bosses and Final Bosses add a unique spin to the game- This is the only Mario Party in the series where I enjoy every single mini-game- Even if I didn't like a particular mini-game, I usually have the option to play a different one instead- Mini-games are challenging enough to keep the longtime-gamers appeased, but also isn't too hard for new players- On that note, the competition is kept a lot closer... I can't destroy my friends like I used to be able to in past Mario Party games- Solo-play records are kept, so if you're a loser like me and usually have no friends to play with, you can try to beat your past 1-player-mode records to unlock more items- Minigame mode is the most developed of any Mario PartyLongtime fans of this game might not be able to get past the differences in this version, and that's okay. It took awhile for me to warm up to this, too. But then I started realizing, despite my disappointment, I was having a LOT of fun playing this one with my friends, as well as when I played it by myself. It was hard for me to accept it, but I have to concede that this game is a step in the right direction.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2012"}

Oh, and GRAPHICS. From the Ridge Racer series to the Soul Caliber and Tekken series, every new game never fails to amaze with graphics that push the system far past the limits we all thought it had. This game is no different.The best way to describe this game is to call it technical perfection. The in-flight graphics are the most perfect I have ever seen in ANY air-combat game, pc or console. The load times are non-existant. And needless to say, if you liked the previous voice-overs, music, menus and graphical mission readouts from the previous games, you'll be in heaven. And even when you die (and trust me you will), you can just choose restart from a menu and go right into the action.Okay, so the graphics and presentation are great. But we all know no game is worth playing that doesn't have great gameplay. While there aren't many missions in this game, the missions that are to be found are absolutely outstanding, with changing mission objectives, and bonuses to be obtained from destroying special enemies and getting a high score (as a side note, at any time during a mission you can flying back to your aircraft carrier by going past the white dotted lines on the map in order to refill your ammo and repair ALL damage to your craft). And since you have TWO unlockable difficulty levels to beat after you beat the game the first time (I'm currently working on expert and hoping to unlock ace), you'll be playing the same missions over and over. Usually something like that would bug me, but the missions are so darn fun (And the jets you unlock later are so cool) that you won't mind a bit.This game is no slouch in the audio department either. The sound effects realistic, and the voice-overs from both the enemy, and from your wingmen during the missions are wonderful.When you are playing this game, it almost feels real. But I doubt flying a real fighter jet would ever be this fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2002"}

The hard drive lets you save music, store games, download content, and even play old XBox games.In the original XBox, every XBox unit had a built in hard drive. This was inconvenient for several reasons. First, there were people who never used it, but who had to pay for it anyway. Next, if your XBox died, it was a royal pain because the hard drive wasn't removable.You could try to move items off your hard drive onto memory units, but many save games were simply too large to fit on a memory unit.The XBox 360 has a great improvement - you can buy the XBox 360 with or without the hard drive. You can even buy the hard drive separate if you want to upgrade your XBox 360 later on. If your hard drive fries, you don't have to get an entire new XBox 360, you just buy a new hard drive. If your XBox 360 fries, you don't lose your information, you simply pop out the hard drive and plug it into a new XBox 360 unit.The XBox 360 hard drive lets you download content from XBox Live onto it - this can include new maps for games, new levels, even songs and videos. You can store your own CDs on the unit, which is fantastic for playing your own soundtracks during games.It even comes with a free copy of Hexic HD - a tetris-like game that is really quite addictive.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles.

It's also at a great price now, and the availability of games is still in good force so you shouldn't lack for being able to obtain titles you want. Games are also reasonable, some being as low as 5 bucks. Be warned: The \"Mario\" titles can still go for as much as $30.00 depending on where you shop. Mario will always be popular, no matter what system he's on, past or present.This sleek little box has some power to it, and the unique gaming format (small discs) makes it great to collect for. Some titles to get for this are: Super Smash Bros. Melee, Tales of Symphonia, Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, Pokemon Colosseum, Pokemon: Gales of Darkness, Super Mario Sunshine, Luigi's Mansion.............the list goes on and on. As I said earlier, most of these can be gotten for under $10.00. And since the Wii is backward compatible, they should be easy enough to get.Since I've owned my Gamecube, I haven't had ONE problem with it. You'll read on the net that Xbox 360 owners all too frequently suffer the \"red rings of death\" and their systems crash and burn, requiring delays as Microsoft repairs them or sends them another unit. Nintendo has always made quality systems, and not one of their systems I've owned (and I've owned them all) has broken down on me.From a collector's standpoint, the Gamecube is now the perfect time to get started on this system. Over 400 titles exist to pick up, plus plenty of other accessories (the Gameboy Player to name one) should keep you busy for a long time.So, in conclusion, the Gamecube might be the next system you'd like to own. If you're a fan of Nintendo, get this system. It's cheap, it's easy to collect for, and it'll last a lifetime for your gaming needs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2008"}

Theres not a big selection of weapons only a few but I say the knife is the strongest weapon you got just upgrade it 3 times for a more powerful thrust to your enemies. The controllers are responding great, just use the left anolog stick to move the character and the right to move the camera and the rest are for other weapons shrinking (for small holes) gliding and jumping. I guess the PS3 version kinda has that freeze loading issue but it's not really that bad it'll only freeze for a few seconds but I have no real problem with any permanent freezing.For easy mode it still can be kinda challenging to fight some enemies and bosses but not that hard like some people say it is, I think they gave up too quickly and for a hack and slash game this is certainly no GOW clone like EA's last game dantes inferno.Any one who's into god of war or dantes inferno or any other hack and slash beat em up game will certainly enjoy this game.Final verdict: A MUST HAVE!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2011"}

For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach. They've made a solid shooter that takes full advantage of Epic's state-of-the-art graphics engine, but did nothing to set the shooter apart from the crowd.

Sam's daughters life and death is enough to turn a professional agent into a lethal weapon on a quest for answers and revenge. The stealth mechanics are greatly improved, and there are many clever ways to dispose of or avoid your enemies - if you want to play things safe you can sneak around (and choose to dispose of them one by one), but if you're really in a bend you can always end someone with a quick headshot. The game looks and sounds great, and plays much like an interactive action-thriller where you'll want to see how things end up as the thing unravels. There's also a great array of co-op and online modes for two players, with a full prequel story, plenty of unlockables and many little bonus challenges if you've made it through the main story.The only thing that puts Conviction down a notch is that it's definitely no Modern Warfare, and if you don't have patience with games, it might not be for you. Patience is the key word - you can become an effective and quick player, but there's almost no point at all in playing if you're going to run around with automatic weapons and shoot enemies down instantly. This game is very unforgiving even in the easier difficulty settings, so some players may be turned off by the idea of replaying the same area ten or twenty times in a row because a guard heard you near the very end. If you have the time though, it's a thrill to take on thirty armed guards with just your hands and the shadows as a weapon.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2010"}

That's Battlefield Bad Company. This isn't the elite squad, or the ultimate soldier, or the secret weapon. Instead, you're with the \"B Company\" of misfits. And you're not out to save the world from impending annihilation. Instead, you're just trying to do what you can to get through the battle with a bit of loot to make your retirement a nice one.It's funny how the game turns many classic war cliches upside-down. This is definitely irreverent. And still, you have a lot of fun with it, getting to know the characters and their personalities. I can laugh out loud at the dialogue even multiple times through.The gameplay is fun. There are extensive maps full of items to collect and gather up, and of course enemies to slaughter. You can destroy pretty much anything you want to, and enemies don't constantly regenerate out of some mysterious human-generator just behind the corner. It gives you a sense that this universe you're plowing through is reasonable.There is a multiplayer mode but we don't tend to be multplayer people. I've heard from others that they love the multiplayer mode. I can report that the single player action is enormously fun and even on replays it still brings a smile.Are there any down sides here? The game's about shooting and exploding people. It's not meant for little kids. If you're not a fan of combat, this probably isn't the game for you. But we absolutely adore this game. I love the humor, the gameplay, and the landscapes.Highly recommended.Rating: 5/5I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2012"}

Anyway, this time, you play the role of the first Big Daddy, whose origins are slowly revealed throughout the game and who was also important in the conception of the Little sisters protectors. Not only that, you also have to deal with you own little sister's mother, who is not too happy to see that you are still alive. Through the game, you will meet old characters from the first game like Mrs. Tenenbaum, though for a very short time since she has to help other characters, whose adventures are DLC (downloadable content) through your XBoX 360.All the locations in Bioshock 2 are new environments that have never been explored in the first game, so you're in for a treat with the locations' visuals. The game's atmosphere is still as scary as ever, especially as you haev to deal with a new kind of sister, a more dangerous one.Finally, it would be important to know that your character's actions will have more of an impact in your ending than in the first one. So be careful if you want to play a good ending, or a neutral one, or a bad ending.By the way, I have read on the internet, and I do not know if this is true or not, that Sheryl Lee, who played Laura Palmer in Twin Peaks, did some voices for a splicer who, around a fire, talks about Jack's fate. If it is true, then I wished they could have given her more roles in the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2010"}

Now she must face the Space Pirates once again in an all-new adventure.","reviewerName":"Sumbudy \"buriedatlantis\"","summary":"Still one of the best games of all time","reviewText":"This game has been out a few years now and most everyone knows whether they like it or not.  Playing through it again, however, it surprised me how well this game holds up.  Should that be a surprise?  Probably not.  Most all Metroid games hold up.  I still have as much fun with Super Metroid as I did when I was 12.  The difference, to me, is that the old 8 and 16 bit games have their charm.  The graphics are what they are and gameplay was what drew you to 'em.  The same is true here.  Though, it must be said that the graphics hold up very well.  This is still a beautiful game.  The environments are breathtaking and realistic.  It definitely looks better than some of the Wii games out there.The beauty of this game, as is true with the rest of the series, is the sense of immersion and exploration.  The isolation.  The sheer atmosphere of it as you discover new parts of a dying world.  There is a sense of history surrounding you and you must make your way through various puzzles and enemies to find the items that let you continue to explore the world and try to take out the vile Space Pirates using it for their own Phazon-induced schemes.  And you feel like you are there every step of the way.The bosses are fun, huge and varied.  I enjoyed facing the bosses in this game.  The challenge of figuring out their weaknesses, learning their patterns and taking them down was quite satisfying.  Also, they were neat to look at.The scan system works, it's very effective in filling in backstory and the history of the planet, as well as figuring out how to deal with enemies.  I don't mind the scan system for those reasons, but I can see how it can be frustrating for some players who feel like all they're doing is scanning objects.  Especially if you are a completist (I'm an \"near completist\", I don't have to have every single thing, but I will put in effort to get enough to get as close as I can and also not get the lamest ending).Though I have to throw in that this game does include 2 things I absolutely hate:1)Water Levels: These are never fun for me.  They are more a chore and I have a deep irrational fear of deep water (even in video games).  It must be noted that this isn't quite as bad once you get the gravity suit.2)Chozo Ghosts:  No particular reason, I just hate Chozo Ghosts.  They pop up way to often and make backtracking more difficult than it should be (I guess that is a reason after all).Yes, this game has put a few years behind its release date and there have been a handful of Metroid titles since, but I have a feeling I'll be playing this game more than once or twice in the future.  Just a fun, immersive experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00002SVFQ","description":"F-Zerodelivers the excellent play control you've come to expect in a game from Mr. Miyamoto and his team at Nintendo. You can bank with the R Button and tip down your nose while making jumps. You'll need all the control you can get, too, as you roar through the twists and turns ofF-Zero's 15 deviously difficult courses. There are four hover cars to choose from, each with its own strong points and weak points. Most beginners find the durability and handling of the Fire Stingray easiest to use (despite poor acceleration), but veteran players will often choose the more-balanced Blue Falcon.Strategy plays a big part in this speedfest. In this one-player racing game you will need to find shortcuts, elude hazards and snag power-ups if you want to beat your savvy competition. Keep an eye out for sand, land mines, magnets and other trouble spots, but always be ready to get a boost from a speed or jump plate. You'll earn one Super Turbo per lap, and part of the strategy is knowing when to use it.When originally released in 1991,F-Zero's graphics were light years ahead of most of the competition. It still impresses mightily, thanks to innovative use of Mode 7 scrolling that immerses you in the adrenalin-pumping action.Sonically,F-Zerois one of the best SNES titles. Driving techno music and top-notch sound effects, including the hum of your car's turbines unwinding, relentlessly propel the action. The aggressive artificial intelligence of your rivals never allows you to ease up.","reviewerName":"Zachary Koenig \"K-Dawg\"","summary":"Tight Controls Allow It To Age Well","reviewText":"As a child, I played many hours of &#34;F-Zero&#34; on the Super Nintendo, back when it was at the height of graphic gaming.  Though always a bit disappointed that no two-player option existed, I still had a lot of fun mastering the controls and trying to perfect the different courses.Fast-forward about 20 years: When it comes to racing games, F-Zero still holds up for a number of reasons...-The graphics (though obviously not &#34;state of the art&#34; anymore) still look really cool and unique.  The whole &#34;hover-racing&#34; concept was truly one-of-a-kind.-The music is perhaps the best soundtrack ever created for a video game.  I can play tracks over and over again just to listen to the music.-The tight controls.  I don't think I've played a racing game to this day where the controls are so tight.  This creates a fairly high level of difficulty, as there is little margin for error, but it makes for an experience that stands the test of time.  At one point in my life, I was playing this game on Expert level.  After not playing for roughly 15 years, I can still slip back into the general feel...but have to start back at beginner again!  Basically, the controls are just difficult enough to never truly be able to master, while just simple enough to be able to get the hang of them fairly quickly.Overall, &#34;F-Zero&#34; is one of the best games ever produced for the SNES.  It's cool concept, great music, and endearing controls make it a game that will last much longer still.  It's many sequels have been hit-or-miss, but none have ever quite lived up to this incredible original.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2014"}

Yet, he dealt with heartbreak after heartbreak the past several years from being accused of being a pedophile, to debt and financial issues. Nevertheless at the end of the day, his music has shown that it will live on. That has shown well with his catalog being re-introduced to new fans all over the world. That was shown last year when Michael Jackson: The Experience was released for the Nintendo Wii. The game was a strong video game experience that was a real challenge to what Rock Band & Guitar Hero have shown. But now that it is on the Playstation 3 & Xbox 360, but is it better than what it showed for the Wii? Not really completely in the moonwalk.Michael Jackson: The Experience is not anything new for PS3 & Xbox 360 gamers, if you've already mastered the game for the Wii. This review is for the Xbox 360. It has the same addictive gameplay with its music and excitement that Michael Jackson had left behind in the world. The game features 37 of his big songs from his solo works from Off The Wall, Thriller, Bad & Dangerous. The game puts you in the King Of Pop's shadow and in the gameplay. The game includes a lot of Michael's biggest songs from his career including Thriller, Black Or White, Smooth Criminal and Bad. The graphics look good, but the gameplay with the Kinnect is just as strong as was on the Nintendo Wii. While the control and the gameplay is strong, it doesn't really offer anything extra for the 360 version to stand out and drive if you've already mastered it on the Wii. The Kinnect version could've included some songs that were overlooked on the Wii edition like Scream and You Rock My World from the overshadowed Invincible.Still, despite the fact that it is nothing new for the Xbox 360 compared to the Wii, Michael Jackson: The Experience is still a fun and entertaining game that is still fun to play and master top to bottom. If you already have played the Wii edition, and awaited a long time for it to come to the Xbox 360's Kinnect but never owned the Wii, it still is a good buy. Michael Jackson honestly will and was to the world, a one-of-a-kind performer. While his work will never be replicated, his spirit lives on, and Michael Jackson: The Experience is a good game to buy for the 360.Graphics: BSound: BControl: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2-Overall: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"C.

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"HONEY BUN RUN","summary":"WORST TOMB RAIDER I HAVE EVER PLAYED!","reviewText":"I have been playing Tomb Raider since PS1. the puzzles are frustrating. confusing and now I might sue Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix for giving me a horrible headache for compensation. it's also hard to play this game when you are staring at her wooty the entire time and those cans. ooh! anyway glad I just played the demo. the guns and different things in the game is not worth your time to try and aim since it does it for you. big let down. 2013 is the best Tomb Raider game. the puzzles are challenging. but, doesn't anger me. glad I wasn't a sucker for buying this and just demoing it. like others have said lots of bugs as well. just pass on this one.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2014"}
{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"A perfect game-with issues","reviewText":"I became a huge fan of the Uncharted series after Uncharted 2: Among Thieves blew me away, one of the most epic games to ever show on any console.  I was absolutely satiated for UC3: Drake's Deception and couldn't wait to play the game.  I just finished the campaign and I'll say this: Fans of the series will have absolutely no problem getting into the Nathan Drake groove.  Drake's Deception is everything and anything fans could ask for, and in my opinion is one of the best games (if not THE best game - so far...) this year.  That being said, it took me awhile to warm up to the game at first.  Perhaps the undoubtedly universal acclaim given to its predecessor left expectations for Drake's Deception a little too unfairly high, but it took a little long to feel hooked in.  The graphics are amazing, some of the absolute best out there (although I prefer UC2's character faces - here, they're definitely more expressive, but they also seem like they went through Botox...just my thoughts), particularly the textures.  The sand chapters are absolutely stunning, as is the canyon ride as well on horseback.  The story is kind of convoluted at first, at to me it was, but once it got past the midpoint I completely found myself lost in Drake's story and literally played straight through the last half.  Gameplay was traditionally Uncharted, albeit I felt it fit more between Uncharted 1 and Uncharted 2 due to the sometimes wonky aiming feature and the onslaught of enemy that you have to kill on occasion (most notably the pirate chapters).  Chloe's appearance, albeit short, was a great addition as she is such a great character (and voiced by the equally amazing Claudia Black) and Elena's arrival halfway through also added some much needed girl power to the bag.  The dialogue is entertaining, but I found more humorous banter in Among Thieves than Drake's Deception.  I also absolutely LOVED the ending, which finds you leaping and bounding for dear life.  Like I said, this is really a perfect title, albeit with some minor issues that probably won't be annoying to the majority, but were little annoyances to my experience.  Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception definitely lived up to the hype, so buy it already!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0053BCMAC","description":"","reviewerName":"GintaxAlvissforever","summary":"A Step Down From The Other Paper Mario Games","reviewText":"I had many issues with this game. As a fan of the Paper Mario franchise, I was very disappointed with how this game turned out.The game was aimed for casuals. I can see that, but the core elements of the game were taken out as a result listed here.Story: Mario games are known for having a very simple story. This isn't the case for Paper Mario as it is an RPG. This means that story should be very complex and compelling to continue. Starting with the first Paper Mario, while it was generic, it expanded on the world of the Mushroom Kingdom. 1000 Year Old Door also was more of an adventure of going out to see the world and meeting new places but character development is very important here. Finally, Super Paper Mario had a wonderful story equal to the story book that Rosalina tells in Mario Galaxy. You were pulled into the story and you wanted to see what happened from the beginning to the end actually caring for the characters (even Luvbi after a certain plot twist). Here though, the story was sacrificed for gameplay and even then gameplay suffered. Here, it's very generic plot that is basically recycling the plot from the first Paper Mario.Gameplay: The major flaw in this Paper Mario is the lack of partners. In the trailer, we were shown that Chain Chomp might have been Mario's partner along with a Toad. Because Shigeru Miyamoto wanted something simple, the partner system was scrapped...which makes no sense given how the partner system was in the first two games. The third game while it lacked the partner system made up with being able to switch between Mario, Peach, Bowser and Luigi as well as having Pixels that allowed you to do something else (plus it wasn't really an RPG game). While to literally make the game called Paper Mario with the paper aspects is good, I think its a waste to not have the partner system because it limits all the possibilities you can do in battle.Overall, it's a step down from the previous Paper Mario games, so while I might not have as much fun as some other people, I'm pretty sure others will disagree.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2013"}

Groh","summary":"Who Knew Sticker Collecting Could be So Much Fun!","reviewText":"I've played all the other Paper Mario games but my favorite was Thousand Year door - and still is. I was really disappointed in the Wii version, Super Paper Mario. But I've been happy with Sticker Star.It starts out slow. I thought this was going to be another dud. How silly to have to get stickers for every battle round. What happened to just picking up skills and adding to them as your repertoire of battle picks? There were so many available that this was not an issue as the game progressed. The story was also slow to start but picked up after awhile. I wouldn't say it was a strong story line but it was okay. Battles are pretty good and progress in difficulty to the eventual, miserable, horrible final battle with --- Bowser.I liked that it was portable on the 3DS system (as opposed to having to sit in place for the Game Cube and Wii systems. As an older adult with reading glasses, I found the 3D difficult to find the 'sweet spot' so I often turned it off. But if I was just looking around, the 3D was fun. There were plenty of hidden items and treasure, puzzles to solve, and fun things to work with. The secret doors were great, Luigi plays a very small (itty bitty) role in the game.There are no partners that join your party but you do get to find 'things' all over the place and once you stickerize them (&#34;Stay Perky!&#34;) you can use them in situations to solve puzzles, or in battles. I also love the little guy in the back room who will sell you things on the sly.I took my time going through the game, looking all over the place and putting stuff in the museum. It took me 30 hours to finish the game but actual playtime to just get through could easily be under 15 hours. My 13 year old son has also enjoyed it and we like sharing things that we've found, &#34;Did you see the passageway over there?&#34; and trying to one-up each other in problem solving and finding things.A great game worthy of being in the Paper Mario series but it has somewhat short play.

It's no wonder why so many people, gamers and non gamers, have played this game and enjoyed it the whole way.Before Super Mario came out, games were alot different.  BEfore the release, most games didn't have the same level of play that Super Mario did.  This basically means, the multiple levels, the attacking of various creatures using more than one strategy, all kinds of stuff never seen in a videogame before.  It boggled the mind back then, it was amazing, and the fanboys whoi lived during that time know what they are talking about.  In short, nobody saw a game like this, that had trooping turtles, secret levels, real levels, being able to throw shells, shoot fireballs, too many stuff that nobody has ever seen before.  Look back at games before this game was released, and compare it's gameplay to this game.  If you really stop and think about what's going on, how you are playing, and what you have to do, it really blows your mind.Of course, Super Mario brothers may have been influential, but I have to say that it is still fun today.  The classic story, the rivalry, the jump,. and even the graphics are still fresh in some ways.  Forget about how games like MOtorstorm look so realistic.

The way some of them were going on about the game online and otherwise, I was expecting this game to be less than spectacular...in fact, I was expecting it to not be any good at all. They way they talked was like the game was way too easy, lacked scope when compared to other games in the series, and was, basically, more of the same(not adding anything new to the mix). I'm glad I decided not to listen to them and purchase the game, anyway. While the game is somewhat more of the same, that's not a bad thing. That's what made Golden Sun special in the first place. However, everything else they went on about...well, that's their opinion. I think the game is great. I love it. I think, given time, it will become a classic just like the first two. If you look back when the first game came out, it never sold bookoodles once the game came out. It took a little time but people caught on. I think the same will happen with this game.So, what's my take on the game? Well, first off- I think the game looks absolutely amazing. Way better than any Final Fantasy game I've seen in recent memory, that's for sure(yet, those look pretty amazing, too). Considering that the original Golden Sun was intended for the Nintendo 64, I imagine this is how the game would have looked(if left up to Camelot). Second, everything you loved about Golden Sun has returned and I got to say that the puzzles are pretty clever this time around. Do I think this game is as epic as the first two?

The Dualshock 4 is by far the best controller on the market and is a big improvement over the DS3, the only buttons that could bother you is the option and share buttons as they are a little small. The triggers are also a huge improvement over the terrible ones on the DS3. I got Killzone and Assassins Creed 4 with my console (both amazing by the way) and I am really impressed with the graphics. The best way to describe the cross gen games (the ones that are also on PS3/360) is that they are just clearer, and its like someone removed the fog from them. Games like Killzone, look amazing and are nothing that last gen consoles could do. Ignore the 1 star reviews, so launch units always have problems but its nothing wide spread. Great time to be a gamer, I highly recommend a PS4.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0000AI1KK","description":"Sequel to the terrifying Fatal Frame, Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly serves up another chapter of horror that will keep you up at night.","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"dora\"","summary":"An incredible survival-horror game.","reviewText":"This is, in my not so humble opinion, one of the best survival-horror games to date.  The fixed camera angles cost me my life on more than one occasion, but other than that the controls are all relatively fluid and intuative.  The viewfinder mode (a first-person mode used to combat spirits) can be a little confusing at first, and I wasted a lot of film when I first acquired the camera.The plot is incredible in its complexity.  I don't want to say too much about it, since it's simply more fun to piece it together for yourself.  I will say that some of the items you use to uncover the story, such as photographs and film reels, are very eerie.  In one film reel, which was supposed to have been filmed many years ago, you can see the main character with her camera for a split-second before it cuts to a Ringu-esque scene of a woman crawling out of a box.The sound design is one of the places where this game truly shines.  The distorted sound effects of ghosts are simply creepy, particularly with the ghosts who are speaking but are so garbled that they're unintelligable.Why did I not give this game five stars?  Because it did its job too well.  This is the first game to have ever scared me beyond the startle-factor (where monsters, in this case spirits, jump out at you).  I found it difficult to play the game for more than half an hour or so at one sitting.  That is a personal thing, however, and others might find it to be less scary than I did.  I still highly recommend it because it is, as I said at the beginning, one of the best survival-horror games to date.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

The one game that is supposed to pick you up and knock your socks clean off.  And it does that, but not with constant action, fighting, or gun-blazing battle scenes.This is an exploration game, very much in the vein of the old Sierra games like King's Quest, Police Quest, and Space Quest.  It is less of a &quot;beat em up&quot; than a &quot;talk and walk.&quot;  Because that is basically what you do: talk to person A, get a hint as to who person B is and where to find them, then take a walk to find person B.  There are little diversions along the way, such as taking care of a kitten, buying everything from canned soda to little toy trinkets, interacting with the largest set of characters ever seen in a video game, and more.The action comes in 2 forms: either TQE scenes, which are twitch reaction events that demand you hurry and press a button that appears on screen, and the other is the actual fighting sequences, where you use various moves to battle differing amounts of enemies.  The action is fairly few and far between, and you will spend most of your time walking and talking.  There is training time, but since it is not normally against an opponent, the action there is minimal.What made this game so jaw-dropping for me was the scope of it all.  You roam from city to city, meeting dozens of different people, all with their own personalities, visiting dozens of buildings and shops, each with its own flavor and purpose, and manipulating dozens of objects.  I give the game's creator (and all-around Sega mastermind) Yu Suzuki a world's worth of credit because coordinating all of the aspects of this game must have been a nightmare!  And to think this is only part 1 of 4!Complaints?  Well, compared to Metal Gear Solid, the voice acting in Shenmue is... well... laughably bad.  It could have really made you feel like you were living a fantastic movie, but the absolute wooden stiffness that the lines are delivered with along with their interminable slowness (&quot;Hi...Ryo... how...are...you...today?&quot;) really ruin the awesome sense of realism that remains otherwise intact.The only other complaint from me is the stubborn control.  In most games such as this, up always walks you forward.  In Shenmue, whichever way you point the digital pad is the way you move.  This makes for some maddeningly uneven &amp; unpredictable movements.  Luckily, due to the slow, exploratory pace of the game, the only place where the molasses control becomes truly infuriating is during the scant battle sequences.But, control and translation issues aside, this game addicted me like no illegal narcotic ever could.  You don't ever want to put it down.  Every event leads to another event, with more areas to explore and people to interact with.  The game is fairly easy to beat, but a game like this is meant to be an enlightening exploration experience, not a frustrating &quot;do the same board 20  times just to get it right&quot; kinda thing.  It really took me back to an era of simpler games, with epic storylines, and expansive worlds to explore.  I had more fun with this than with almost any other game in recent memory (all the way back to Metal Gear Solid on PSX.)  A landmark achievement that will most likely be one day crowned &quot;Best Dreamcast Title Ever.&quot;","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2001"}
{"product_name":"B002EE5ROO","description":"Set several years after the events of the first game in the series,Dead Rising 2contains all the fun and over-the top carnage which gamers associate with a zombie apocalypse. As with all releases in theDead Risingseries, it is a survival horror game. Players take on the role of an all-new character, with equally new motivations to survive and resources to do so. These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode, an optional prologue to the game available as downloadable content and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"D. Allen","summary":"One of the year's best!","reviewText":"Dead Rising presents an interesting game play concept. You get about 72-96 hours in game to complete everything. This translate to roughly 8-9 hours in real life. I was at first turned off by this and sort of felt I had to try to rush everything. Basically everything is on the clock. You have to get things done by a certain time, or you won't get the complete story/game. I learned to love this system and felt like it definitely fit the game.I personally love the zombie franchise and this is one of few games I felt that got the right atmosphere with the whole zombie theme. In this game you play a character named Chuck who is trying to save his daughter who was bitten by a zombie.The flow of the game is rather simple. You have 72 (or about 84~96) hours until military comes to rescue you and whoever else. You are staying at this safe house, and you venture out into a very large area of a fictional Vegas. The game is split up in two ways: cases and missions. Cases are what drives the main story and they are given at a set time. For example, you have to give your daughter Zombrex - which prevents her from becoming a zombie - at 7am. A case might appear later at 9am which then drives the story more. You can miss a case if you're not in the area at the time the case is suppose to start. In that case you can still continue but you won't ever know what happens.Besides cases, you also get missions. Usually you get this in a form of a radio call. Missions are usually given after some timeframe between a case. Usually you attempt to save survivors or you might fight a psycho who can't handle the zombie outbreak.Some thoughts about the game:Combo system ~ You can develop your own custom weapon in this game. In DR1 you can use anything as a weapon. DR2 still offers this but now you can combine weapons to earn extra points to level up. What you can combine is fairly large, and there are set rules to what you can combine. You can tell an item can be combined by the fact that you see a blue icon above the item. You have to take it to one of the many work benches you find in the game to combine into a combo weapon. The bread and butter item I think that you'll most use is the spiked bat which is taking a box of nails and a baseball bat. It's powerful, and you can make one early in the game. Each combo weapon has two forms of attacks: regular and power (where you hold down the attack button for a second). You earn points to level up as you use combo weapons and some offer more than other. Also if you own a combo card - which explains how to combine the weapon though it isn't required to do so - then you earn more points to level up than if you didn't have the card. It's interesting and some are rather good to use. However, some combo weapons feel rather bothersome to use on a regular basis. For example, there is one where you can combine a metal pipe and fire rockets with. You can easily clear a lot of zombies at once, and it's rather fun to shoot. However, you can easily drop it if you select another weapon or a zombie attacks you and you have to pick it up again.Psychos ~ What made DR1 so fun was the psychos, in my opinion. In DR2 they return, and they're rather crazy. You get some good ones like Slappy who is a deranged toy story mascot. He was fairly funny. All of the psycho usually end with Chuck saying a one liner. Sometimes it's funny. For example, there is one where a rather large man was marrying this woman and at the end, Chuck was like, \"You may now kiss the bride\" as he's being devoured by a previous bride he slain but turned to a zombie. Overall very good though I felt they could polish up some of the psycho moves. It seems like all of them are rather the same in how you fight: wait for them to do a move, run up smack them with a spiked bat, then run away until they do it again. It seems like you don't fight much of a different psycho each time, just the same thing but different behavior.Survivors ~ When I played DR1, I had the hardest time saving survivors. Most of the time, they die rather horrendously at the hands of zombies. In DR2, they took the AI and made it smarter than ever. No longer do you have to micromanage your survivors and having large groups of survivors easy to handle. Some of the psycho battles offer survivors but before that you can sometimes bring in survivors to help you with fighting the boss and adding a little bit of damage. In this version, on my first playthrough, I only lost 1 survivor but that was due to me and lugging that survivor around too long.Story ~ I won't spoil it but I think the story is taken depending on what you liked. In DR1, you played as a reporter who is trying to uncover the story. In DR2, it's a more personal game. You play Chuck who is trying to save his daughter and you might feel more at home with this story. For me personally I liked the story of DR1 since it feels so related to the zombie outbreak. This one it's like the zombies are just an inconvenience to you rather than you actually going in and trying to figure out what is going on.Cars ~ I don't recall any sort of cars in DR1. I think you get a motorcycle and a jeep. In DR2 you get a motorcycle and you can even customize it with items. For example, you can have a motorcycle, and attach chainsaws to it making it really deadly. This is really helpful in later parts of the game when you have to navigate through heavily infested areas.Graphics ~ I felt that DR2 is a bit sluggish comparing to DR1. I felt there were a few frame rate issues here and there especially in the outside area. For example, in one situation, I was talking to a survivor up on a stand and more zombies came to the area and the game slowed down to a near turtle speed. Overall it felt a little jerky in some parts.Clothes ~ I'm unsure if anyone else agrees, but I find that the amount of women clothing you can wear is rather disturbing. It feels like every story you get to has women clothing that Chuck can wear. I like it where I use Chuck's default outfit, but when I get an itch to try on other clothes, I find it rather depressing that there isn't much men clothes you can wear and they look rather horrible compared to Chuck's original.Overall I loved the game. I played it over and over and felt like I can play it for years to come. I still play the original DR1 heavily and that was out for nearly four years already. It's a totally nice game and each time you get so many things. The time limit might seem burdensome, but it really isn't and free roaming isn't all that great of an idea in this game. The time limit is just great but I would imagine for some people it would be a huge turn off.I think any zombie fan should pick up this title. It's flat out awesome.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I0IIPY","description":"","reviewerName":"O.P.T. \"O.P.T.\"","summary":"Did I get duped into buying this game?","reviewText":"I was SO STOKED when I read that an actual decent new Sonic game had been released, so I put it on my list of \"games to buy.\"  I'd watched a bunch of reviews on YouTube and the game looked absolutely beautiful and a blast to play.  Well, I have the game now...just got it.  So far I'm extremely disappointed, so much in fact that I've decided to go ahead and write this review now instead of wait until I finish the game (which, in all honesty may never happen because I'm so disinterested in playing it).  First off, the game is indeed beautiful and a pleasure to look at.  But.  That's where it stops for me.  Now I might be getting old, but to me the environments in this game are WAY TOO DETAILED...to the point of being very distracting.  Add to that the fact that Sonic often scales back SO FAR that I literally lose track of where he is on the screen he's so small (I play on a 26\" TV btw...not huge but not small, either).  Do you know how difficult it is to play a game when you keep losing track of where your character is onscreen?  It really breaks up any slight feeling of \"fun\" I might be having.  And then there are all the cutscenes.  God, spare me with the cutscenes.  If I wanted to watch a cartoon, I'd watch a frickin' cartoon.  I get that Sega's trying to appeal to little kids and/or create a storyline but come on--just let us play the d@mn game.  Spare us the filler.I dunno guys, I think I was duped.  Again.  Lets just face it: Sonic does NOT translate into 3D well.  How many DEAD HORSES is Sega going to unleash upon us while trying (unsuccessfully) to create a decent 3D Sonic game?  It didn't happen with the Saturn.  It didn't happen with the Dreamcast.  It didn't happen on the Gamecube.  And folks, it's not happening on the Wii.  WHEN WILL THEY GET IT THROUGH THEIR HEADS AND GO BACK TO 2D SIDE-SCROLLING GAMEPLAY!?!?!?!?!?  SEGA are you listening!?  We'll still buy your d@mn games if you go back to the original formula!  Look at the highest rated Sonic games in the past 15 years and guess what they are?  Sonic Gems and Sonic Mega Collection.  2-D!!!!  Proof that if you build it, WE WILL COME.  I've been hearing a lot of hype about the newly released Sonic Generations game, but it pains me to hear that game (surprise surprise) contains 3D gameplay in places.  At this point that makes me very reluctant to even give the game a shot.  Once bitten (more like one hundred times bitten with all these doozie 3D Sonic games), twice shy.  Please SEGA, get it together.  Look what Nintendo did: They released New Super Mario Bros Wii in classic 2D side-scrolling with updated graphics and that games sells like hotcakes.  Why don't you do the same!?  2D would even be easier for you to program, another reason you should be all about it.  So what's the hold up?  Enough with the 3D Sonic games...I beg of you.  ENOUGH.  Give us a game like Sonic CD only with updated Wii/PS3/XBox360 graphics.  It's that simple!  NOW DO IT.Edit: Okay, I actually forced myself to play this game to the end!  I wanted to see if maybe I was missing something??  It took me all of seven hours to complete, and I still stick by most of what I wrote above.  Sonic just doesn't work well in 3-D.  Some of the graphics were amazing, I liked some of the music as well.  The fun factor simply wasn't there for me.  I hated the levels where Sonic would automatically run and then you had to dodge all kind of crap, and then if you die you have to start WAY back at the beginning and do it all over again...that got old real fast.  As did the numerous false endings...how many false endings does a game need!?  My God there were three or four of them.  Meh, this puppy is going to a new home!!  I can't fathom ever playing it again, which I guess means the replay value is approximately zero.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2011"}

Unfortunately, that's the only good thing about the entire game. Rather than take the Raw Vs. Smackdown 2009 control scheme, this game gives you a horrible tiered-fighting scale that only opens moves as you progress in attacking your opponent. Forget the hip-tosses or flipping off the top rope you could do before, you are allowed to punch and kick here...and that's pretty much it.As a result almost every wrestler fights the same way to start out. As you begin to win a match, you get a few \"custom\" moves to the character open up, but it's nothing to write home about. If it wasn't for the fact that this game finally offered the dream roster of players (minus Randy Savage, Ricky Steamboat, and Dynamite Kid--all of whom were involved in key Wrestlemania matches). You also get actual video of some of the matches represented here and the chance to change the outcome of said matches. Again, a cool addition in theory, but very poorly executed.This game will probably drop in price quickly since it has such a horrible control system. Why they didn't just take the existing controls of Raw vs. Smackdown I'll never know...especially considering the fact that you can import characters from that game if you wish.A great roster with authentic entrances (for the most part) gets this game 3 stars.

{"product_name":"B0002B90SA","reviewerName":"Davidovich53","summary":"Ups the ante on Star Wars games","reviewText":"One thing about KOTOR 2 that greatly impressed me is how Obsidian, taking the KOTOR franchise over from BioWare, did not mess with a winning formula. They faithfully carried over the first game's visual style, presentation, and atmosphere, which means those who played KOTOR 1 can jump right in.Just like KOTOR 1, the game hinges on its story rather than fancy gimmicks or better graphics or more features. KOTOR 2's storyline runs parallel to KOTOR 1's, and introduces a new protagonist whose only tie to the first game is that he/she fought in the Mandalorian Wars. Again, the characters can be a bit flat/stereotypical, and will do most of the talking throughout the game (you mostly choose how you'll respond to others through your dialogue choices).The main reason why I would actually rate this game higher - yes, higher - than KOTOR 1 is the intelligence of the script. What I mean by that is how the game's characters challenge you (both the main character and the person playing the game) to think long and hard about some things that are regarded as \"truths.\" Yes, I'm talking some serious philosophy here. For example, Kreia, one of your allies, challenges you to think about how a random act of kindness actually robs the person that's being helped of the chance to struggle, fight, and become stronger for it. And a Jedi Master will challenge you to think about what to do if a cause you believed in strongly ends up doing just as much harm as it prevents. In another instance the game shows the dangers of both blind allegiance AND independent thought (yes, the latter also has dangers). And the best part is that all of this is presented within the context of the game's various scenarios, without ever sounding preachy.As far as the gameplay mechanics are concerned, Obsidian spiced up the battle interface with new Force powers and feats, which open up a new dimension to strategizing and outfitting your party. Unfortunately it seems all the bugs and glitches from the first game were carried over as well, such as the \"doorway bug\" and the \"menu bug.\" And playing Pazaak is still just as hard.As a nod to those who played the first game, Obsidian decided to insert many references to KOTOR 1 here and there. For example, KOTOR 2 recycles two planets from the first game, Dantooine and Korriban. The maps are identical to the ones from the first game, but this time you explore slightly different parts of the planets. And people in the game are constantly referring to the Mandalorian Wars (the war that was fought five years before KOTOR 1's timeline) and the Jedi Civil War (the events of KOTOR 1). In fact, you'll find that the Jedi Civil War casts a very large shadow over the lives of many people you'll encounter in the game, including most of your allies. You'll find that having played the first game certainly enriches this one, although it's not crucial.So, in summary, if you're suffering from post-KOTOR withdrawal symptoms, your prayer has been answered - go buy this game NOW.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2006"}
{"product_name":"B0050SVLI2","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"Signatures are onerous.\"","summary":"Some hiccups prevent Revelations from being stellar","reviewText":"RE: Revelations is a decent, but not a great, game.  From a gameplay standpoint, The Mercenaries 3DS was more enjoyable, and also had better control. People complained about Mercenaries because there was no campaign mode, but as Revelations shows, a campaign doesn't necessarily make for an enjoyable game.For one thing, the story in Revelations is pretty lame.  There really isn't much there. As is typical in the Resident Evil world, there are numerous large organizations with three or four-letter abbreviations that play some kind of role in manipulating events behind the scenes.  Nobody really knows what's going on or who the good and bad guys are.  The Resident Evil plotline has gone way too far with these mysterious organizations.  I mean seriously, how many organizations can there be?  And how many suborganizations can there be within a larger one?  Why do we need an FBC when we already have a BSAA?  Why does Umbrella need a Security Service AND a UBCS? Why are people on the same team always trying to kill each other?  Everyone speaks in cryptic lines that hide, not illuminate, the story.  Why are Chris and Jill playing a game of cat and mouse on two Mediterranean cruise ships?  Why can't both of them just get on the damn horn and say, \"Um, here I am dude.  Stop looking for me.\"Revelations has other problems besides the lackluster story.  It has frame rate issues, and extremely long load times between certain areas.  These load times are disguised as a large wheel on a door spinning to unlock it, or a ride on an elevator, but they're still load times in which the frame rate drops to zero at points. There is one particular battle on the ship's promenade in which the frame rate is so bad it's almost unplayable.  Guys, when the frame rate gets that bad, cut some polygons, drop a few enemies, or lower the texture resolution.  I'd much rather have a smooth frame rate than really pretty graphics.Another problem with Revelations that vexed me to no end is the calibration on the analog nub.  If you don't have the analog nub pressed up as hard as you possibly can, your character won't run, but walks instead.  The nub has to be literally crammed to the top, as if you were trying to push it through the DS's casing.  I tried recalibrating the nub several times, to no avail.  This single problem proved to be such an annoyance to me that it pretty much ruined the game. I had the constant feeling that I was trudging through quicksand. I never had this problem with Mercenaries.Overall, Revelations isn't a bad game: it just suffers from a few issues that taken together definitely diminish one's enjoyment of the game. I think Mercenaries 3DS is the better offering, but to each his own.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2012"}

Plug it into a good set of speakers or nice pair of headphones and prepare to jump, scream, and just have a great, gory gaming experience.If you can imagine the jaw-droppingly great Resident Evil REmake on the GameCube mixed with the GameCube's Resident Evil 4 control setup, you'll know exactly what you're in for with Resident Evil: Revelations. The game lives up to the awesomeness you're imagining.Capcom didn't get lazy with this one, either. The graphics are stellar. These are console level graphics, as good as anything released so far on the more powerful Vita system. The game is lengthy -- expect a good 10 hours of gameplay. The story is deep (well, as deep as an RE story ever gets). The level design, the character design, the weapon design, the weapon upgrade system ... everything is top-notch.And no, to answer your question, you don't need the circle pad pro to play this. In my opinion, it plays better without it and plays far more like the older Resident Evil games you've grown used to.I paid double what this is currently selling for and still thought it was well worth the price. If you own a 3DS and don't own this game yet, what are you waiting for? Order. Now. This thing is a system seller.Note: I have nothing against 3D and there are some games (Super Mario 3D Land, for one) I love playing with 3D cranked to full, but the 3D in RE: Revelations just didn't work for me. The game is much prettier with the 3D off. It's also too easy to lose the \"sweet spot\" in combat and end up staring at a blurry mess of a screen. Your mileage may vary.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2012"}

I'm not a true die hard Call Of Duty fan but Iove the game its fun and it exciting but when I learned that Ghosts was coming out I knew I was going to try it out and honestly it's my favorite COD this one is all about stealth in such but that doesnt last long just turns into a highly action pack game like the other ones nothing is wrong with that, but I would of love to see a more story element and stealth driven COD similar to Black Ops which balance the right amount of action which I loved. The play style is just about the same nothing really new except like I said the graphics and characters thats about it, also the storyline is very predictable at certain points which reminded  me too much of MW2 and MW3 so if your interested go for it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00003E4EB","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Jan Parmelee","summary":"It has great games but only 3 or 4 of them fit under this.","reviewText":"I think Nintendo 64 was probably the worst Nintendo system next to the standard NES.The standard NES had a strong library of games but that didnt matter because only 3 or 4 have a save option. Nintendo 64 on the other hand has strong graphics and a short amount of games. There are only 4 or 5 games on this system that are worth owning unlike Game Cube's 15. The graphics are not a weakness what is a weakness is that Nintendo 64 just didnt have enough quality games.Super Mario 64,Super Smash Bros,F Zero X,Ms Pacman Maze Madness are the only N64 games worth owning. Those games almost make up for the limited number of games.Its still worth owning because of its great games but dont get your hopes up after all these years there have been only about 4 or 5 games worth owning.The Super NES also had a pretty limited supply of games but managed to be one of the best systems ever made because the 5 or so games for it were masterpieces.I suggest you get a Game Cube because it has more worthwhile games than any other Nintendo system before it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"C.

It is approxamatly 18 hours long (double that if you want all the upgrades to the weapons) and I didnt find myself feeling stupid becuase I didnt know where to go next or how to solve incredibly hard puzzles like such games as the new mario's, blinx, and starfox would have you doing. This game was challenging enough to keep me interested, but not so challenging that I got frustrated.

While a lot of people wanted it for VII, lucky number ten got the game that continues the original's storyline.  Does it live up?  Yes and no.With this game being a sequel, Squenix decided to mix it up a whole bunch, try things they would never try in a normal FF game.  Some of these things work: The mission based system, non-linear storyline, all female crew, all work to a great effect.  The platform jumping, the Charlie's Angel-esque posing, and the even more embarrassing script doesn't.The game picks up where the last left off.  Yuna lets her hair down and starts the profession of sphere hunting.  Along with X's Rikku and new character Paine, Yuna stumbles across a sphere with an image that may or may not be the man that disappeared so abruptly.  Is it?

As far as how fun the gameplay was, they are botha bout on an equal plane there, and I did very much enjoy the new additions of weapons and enemies in 3.  Story-wise, I think Killzone 2's story is just a bit more epic, but both stories are pretty epic none the less.  Both games controls are pretty tight.  Length-wise, I believe Killzone 2 is a little bit longer, and as far as difficulty is concerned, Killzone 2 gets a bit harder and has a harder ending than 3, but both games are beatable and not ridiculously hard.  There is a coop mode in this one, aside from the standard online coop & such, which is pretty cool...can't remember if there was on 2.  Either way you look at it, I'm of the mind that both of these games are definitely awesome and worth while.

{"product_name":"B0054INKZK","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Very Repetitive Gameplay","reviewText":"I will admit that some of the visuals in this game are amazing, and the story is slightly interesting. However, the gameplay is extremely generic, repetitive, and annoying. It's really just a button masher, without any room for creativity or strategy in your playstyle. I also didn't like how there was no way to improve your weapons and armor. Then, each of the weapons have some good and bad things about them, and if you were able to use them interchangeably they would really benefit each other. However, you only have access to one of them at a time, and for most of the game you can only change weapons by disarming/cleansing the enemy. The other biggest problem for me, was the way the game uses extra lives. When you run out of health (which is coolly shown by losing your armor/clothing) you have to mash your buttons to wake back up, however there is a limit to this and each time it's harder to wake back up. This inevitably ends with you dying, and the game then lectures you about how to stay alive by mashing the buttons even though that was just what you were doing, and you have to revert to the last save/checkpoint which at times can be way far back, there's also incredibly long load times. For the platforming, it's very basic, and it's pretty floaty and many times hard to be accurate, especially when holes in the world blend in with the environment. I probably would have enjoyed the game more if I chose Easy instead of normal (as the worst problems may not have occurred as frequently) but once you choose at the very beginning of the game you can never change it for some reason.In the end, I would definitely not recommend this game, but some people could possibly find a good game here if you could overlook all of the faults, something that I couldn't do.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2012"}

However if there is a fanclub or Facebook group dedicated to lovers of hitting the square button, then this is definitely your cup of tea. Gamespot describe it as \" solid action and over-the-top gore\" and \" a cut above other movie tie-ins\", which translates to ;Press the attack button until your thumb is sore, cut a mans arm off, cut his head off, impale a man on spike then cut another mans arm off and impale his mate on some spikes, then cut a different blokes head off and cut his mates arm off, then impale his mate on some different spikes, then decapitate a man and look for his mate so you can decapitate, cut his arm off, impale him on some spikes or some other fancy method of button mashing in sequence which boils down to you could of just killed him by pressing square! And all this has happened in the first 3 seconds of the game.Oh yeh, to be fair I did leave out the JUMP button. After you have used the JUMP button and ascended to the next part of the game you get to cut a mans arm off, cut his head off, impale a man on spike then cut another mans arm off and impale his mate on some spikes, then cut a different blokes head off and cut his mates arm off, then impale his mate on some different spikes, then decapitate a man and look for his mate so you can decapitate, cut his arm off and impale him on some spikes.

I only played the stand-alone campaign and here are my thoughts:Pros:- Same beautiful scenery from Red Dead Redemption.  One of my favorite things about that game was just riding around on your horse in these quiet lands (something you don't get to do in your typical city-based video game).  You can do the same here.- You can play John Marsten as a bad guy.  It was difficult to do this in RDR because a band of sheriffs would chase you around when you killed an innocent.  But there are no authorities in this game, so you can kill whoever you want.  It is pretty fun to help townspeople kill off zombies, and then go ahead and eliminate all the townspeople!- I got about 12 hours of gameplay out of it.  So there is some nice entertainment value considering the low price.- The game is not too difficult.  For a casual gamer like me, this is important.  There are no missions you have to repeatedly attempt due to difficulty.- You get to hunt Sasquatches!Cons:- Gameplay was slightly repetitive.  You basically just keep shooting zombies in the head.  Don't get me wrong, it's still fun, but there's not much variety in the missions.- The final mission was disappointing.  After finishing it, I thought \"that's it?\".- The PS3 version I had definitely had a few glitches.  For example, there were no zombies in the game when I first started it.  Luckily I googled the issue and discovered I had to delete my game data and start all over again.  I also noticed other small glitches while playing.Overall- I would give it 3.5 stars.  It is certainly not as great as Red Dead, but if you're a big fan of that game, I would check this game out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2012"}

This side-scrolling, hack and slash, RPG, is one of the best games for the PS2, if you like that sorta thing.  The 2D graphics will take you back to the good ol' Sega Genesis days.Its strengths are its gameplay (if you like side-scrolling hack & slash/Action RPGs), as its top notch in that category, the music & sound in the game is also very good.  Odin Sphere is very original in many aspects and a very odd game, which is a good thing, its different and I like that. (example:  During, after, or before a battle you can plant seeds so they can grow into trees within seconds, which produce fruit for you to eat, which gains experience points...) The boss battles are simply awesome, most of the bosses take up nearly the whole screen and are very challenging to beat.  As the story progresses, you'll eventually end up using 5 different characters, which have different skills and weapons, and play completely different.  You can even make potions in the game, which aid you in battle.I have only a few dislikes with Odin Sphere, which prevents it from being a 5 out of 5 star game.  At times it can be too difficult, and the game has no difficulty option.  I consider myself a gaming veteran, and there has been times in this game where I would die nearly 6-7 times in the same stage, having to restart the stage each time.  It can be frustrating to lose in a stage where there is a ton of enemies, because you'll have to restart the stage when you die, which means having to battle the same enemies in their particular order, all over again.  My only other complaints are that I wish the stages were longer in terms of gameplay space, and that there were more stages/areas/levels, and more boss battles.All in all this game gets 4 stars overall.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms.

This game is just way too much fun.  Basically, you're in a grand theft auto style city where you can pretty much climb any surface.  There aren't really any interior spaces but everything else is fair game.  And that's just the beginning of this.  Climbing, jumping and falling is all without consequence.  You can take a fall from the tallest building and roll with it.Then you've got your karma gauge which adjusts depending on how you use your powers for good and evil.  I've got people taking pictures of me now as I've been trying to be good and heal people.  Your powers will continue to grow and there are many things to find.There is a radar which you'll have to use to find hidden items which you'll be using a lot.  To get more power storage and find more items, you're dependent on the radar.  And if you're color blind like me, that can sometimes be a challenge to figure out the colors exactly.The graphics are great.  The game is pretty forgiving for beginner players and throws just enough at you that you can't wait to see what's next.  The new powers that you unlock depend on your level of good or bad as well.  There are hours of play here.  Definitely a winner!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2009"}

Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City.

If you've never played any of the previous installments then the combat system is fantastic.  You can pull off some nice combos without the game feeling like Street Fighter where you have to be obsessively skilled to pull off the basic combos.The graphics are pretty darn good, however having played Final Fantasy 13 directly prior to this I can say that it is not the best looking game available.  Most people have already commented on the grandiose scale of the game as well.  When the camera pans out and you see that Kratos is nothing but an ant in comparison to the titans, you really start to understand the task he has to overcome.There's some annoying aspects of the game like apparently Kratos is strong enough to prevent a titan's fingers from crushing him yet he cannot jump with a person on his shoulder.  Those instances don't happen often but it was annoying.  Also the Titans are weak (I can see why they lost the Great War) if a man with the Blades of Exile and nothing else can take them down.Combat is tough...even on regular (not a bad thing).  I found myself dying plenty of times but I guess that too is a function of trying to figure out the best strategy to beat the monsters.I also didn't like how you could not pan the camera around because sometimes it is hard to see and other times you might just want to look around.The story is good and pretty straightforward.  Kratos is out to bring down Mount Olympus and everyone in his way.  The ending is left to interpretation.  I think he did plenty of killing but in actuality saved the world.  But maybe that's just my loose interpretation of it.  The game is on the short side but it's nonstop action with only a few breaks for some minor puzzles.The game is \"EPIC\" (we must find another word people!!) with great graphics, a story that drives you forward, great combat and excellent boss fights.  I wouldn't say it's better than Uncharted 2 or Final Fantasy 13, but it's definitely an extremely excellent, fulfilling and top notch game.  It's a great game but I think it was overhyped so much that there was no way it could live up to expectations of being the greatest thing since the internet.  It still deserves 5 stars though.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2010"}

In almost every instance where this became noticeable, I would simply shut the system down, immediately restart it, and the problem was no longer there. Haven't played much with the latest patch. But I've no doubt that lag is something that's going to be taken care of. And, although it's clear that other reviewers don't feel the same way I do, (for me) there's still nothing which comes even close to providing what this game has to offer. The lag has not kept me from playing or wanting to play. Not by a long shot. And even if the lag never goes away, I will continue playing. This game is amazing. You owe it to yourself to experience it; lag or no lag. And please keep in mind that I'm normally the type of gamer who is annoyed with even the most trivial of load times, lag, etc. That should speak volumes about how good the core gameplay is here. More than 100 hours into my playthrough and I'm nowhere near out of quests (not even the main storyline quests), and the leveling system is such that the only real reason I can see playing through from scratch once more would be to simply experience it all over again or choose a different side of the war. Amazing game. Did I say that already?*ORIGINAL POST*As with most RPG's in this era of gaming, Skyrim delivers a vast amount of choices to be made and places to be seen. What makes this game different however, is its lack of a linear equation. You really have to wonder if any two people will ever have the same experience playing through this game. While there are plot points to be found, you are not likely to ever stumble across them the same way twice. And, depending on how you approach your experiences and choices, the game will always unfold differently. I'm guessing I will likely still be seeing new things well after my 10th playthrough.Without question, this is the most beautiful game I have ever seen where landscapes are concerned. At times character models and certain parts of cutscenes still take on that unnatural look or set of movements so commonly found in RPG's. But I literally cannot even think of another game which looks this good.The people and places of this world are engaging and memorable. The voice acting is fine tuned. And there's always something new to be had with this experience. Just when you think you've seen every creature or enemy, something else comes charging at you.The more you use certain types of skills, the more proficient you become with them. But the game also gives a mass amount of freedom in the area of perks; leaving you feeling as though you aren't on some unalterable path if you primarily like to use magic, for instance. You'll still find the ability to become a badass with swords, armor, etc. There are also the powers hidden around the world which further aid in your development, but aren't directly associated with your class. All in all, this leaves you with a character you will consistently feel good about; as the room to improve upon or make changes is completely suited to your liking.You'll likely find that both 1st and 3rd person view modes have their pros/cons, and will therefore move freely between the two points of view, depending on the situation in which you find yourself. And although some battling in this game still gives the impression of play fights (so common in RPG's), many of the kills present in Skyrim are much more akin to brutal melee kills in modern day first person shooters. These types of kills are beyond satisfying.If I have to point out the bad (which, of course, I feel I have to), I'd warn that the game doesn't always give great direction with regard to control function and item sorting/selecting/assigning. If you're familiar with role playing games in general, you'll know this is nothing new to any such experience. But one would have hoped that, in a game this groundbreaking, they would have addressed controlling and modifying with a few quick tutorials. But perhaps that's not even worth complaining about. Maybe it's something I want until I have, and then I realize that such things take away from the adventuring spirit of this game.In short, this is the best RPG I've ever touched. Many will play this game for years and not tire of it, or stop thirsting for another venture into these gorgeous vistas; packed with ever-new twists and turns. If you have any kind of appreciation for beauty and exploration, then you should buy this game right now. For no one has ever done role playing this well. They may never do it this well again. All its lacking is the ability to share it with friends through some type of multi-player or co-op. But then, this is meant to be your adventure, yours alone, to guide.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000069BD9","description":"Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancebrings theMortal Kombatseries a new 3-D fighting engine, adds tons of features and extras, and still offers up classic gameplay.This installment features a 3-D battle system that still manages to maintain a 2-D feel. For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings. The plentiful additional content offered with this title includes special movies ofThe Making ofDeadly Alliance andThe History ofMortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancesuccessfully reinvents the series by offering up a unique mix of improved graphics and stylized gameplay without compromising any of the features that made theMKseries popular over the years.--Carlos RodelaProsComplex gameplayRealistic 3-D graphicsHundreds of unlockable featuresConsWeak storylineUnbalanced combo system","reviewerName":"Nick Watkins \"Nick Watkins\"","summary":"The Best Kombat Yet?","reviewText":"Since its debut in the early 90's, Mortal Kombat has been famous for its large arsenal of intriguing characters and the rich, immerse background each one has, as well as being infamous for the blood that flies out of your opponent after simply punching them in the arm. With each new game, new characters have been introduced, but the main objective has always been the same: kill everyone until you get to the boss, then kill him, too. The objective is no different here, and it's still fun as ever.This is the first MK game to not feature Liu Kang as a playable character, but I don't think anyone really liked him to begin with anyway. Quan Chi and good ole' Shang Tsung have formed an alliance together (coinsidentily, a DEADLY alliance) and with their combined power bring down the reigning Shao Kahn. With Tsung gathering souls to put into the long dead Dragon Army and reserrect the army to take over the Earth, their alliance seems unstopable. Until Raiden finds out, and you can probably figure out what he does...That's right! He tells a bunch of people. Some classic, some brand new. On the good side, there's characters such as (and these are only a few) Jax, Sonya, Johnny Cage, the humerous Bo' Bai Cho, Sub-Zero, Frost and Katana. On the evil side, there's (this is still only a few) the two sorcerers, Shang Tsung and Quan Chi, as well as Reptile with a brand new look, Kano, Mavado, and way more. Even a vampire has been introduced. But if you're like me, none of this even matters, and you just need Scorpion. And he's here, in all his hellish yellow glory.Also new to this game are the three different fighting styles posessed by each character. You can fight in one stance for a while, until the computer you're fighting aganist (if you're playing in arcade) starts prediciting all your moves because they have already been used on him. When that happens, just change styles. Some styles are weak but fast, some are slow but powerful. But the most fun style is definetly the weapon, which each character has. This was introduced in MK4, so you probably know how it works, except this time your weapon can't be knocked out of your hand and you can't pick weapons up off the ground. That's good, if you ask me. A lot less hassle. Weapons include Sub-Zero's ice blade, Scorpion's ninja sword, Raiden's staff, Bo' Bai Cho's walking stick, Cyrax's beam sword, Kano's butterflies, Johnny Cage's nun chucks (yeah, I know that's now how you spell it), and more. As I said before, each fighter has a weapon.Also, during each fight and mini-challenge you have, as well as each time you complete a mission in Konquest (I'll explain later), you earn coins of whatever color. There's red, blue, orange, onyx, jade, etc. When you get enough coins, you can go down to a place called &quot;The Krypt&quot; and purchase coffins for different prices. There's all kinds of things to unlock in the coffins, such as levels, new characters to play as, videos, etc. You'll find if you want to play as a classic character like Reptil or Raiden, you'll have to purchase their coffin, first.Now, about Konquest. It's a new feature in which you choose a character and have to complete 10 missions with them, learning about their special attacks and fighting styles along the way. You earn coins for each completed mission. That's basically it. Fun to do and cool to read the stories that it tells about them.I highly suggest you check this game out if you've enjoyed any MK game in the past, and if you're one of the extremely few people who have never played a MK game before, this is a nice place to start.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2004"}

Blanton","summary":"Interesting game with a good scare factor!","reviewText":"I am not what you call a vampire fan or even know the difference between different secs of vampires but I thought this game sounded interesting so I bought it at half price (I waited  awhile from the intital release date to buy it) and began my journey into the darkness of L.A. California.............What did I think???It is a game genre that I am not familure with at all. Before buying this I played a lot of FPS and RTS war games even a flight sim here and there but never a horror game and one about vampires to say  the least so my review may not mean much to the hard core fans but coming from outside of this game genre I thought it would be interesting to review my initial output fo the game since I am the least bit partial to the genre.Graphics are very good but not like HL2. I like the way they did the interiors in buildings with such vivid imagination but the outdoors need some work. Lighting was good in certain areas like the Mansion upstairs (Light House strob light was cool) but the game is mostly very dark which looking at the theme it is expected.Gameplay is where a game makes it or breaks it and as far as I am concerned VMBL made it. A typical RPG in third or first person with a good story line and acting. An example of this is when your doing favors for Treasa at the Asylum and she freaks out on you tryng to kill her other personality (Janus) which you think is her real sister all along until she shoots Janus and nothing happens to her? This was very weird but interesting because I never have seen this type of scene in any game as if they just through it in to surprize you! The combat part of the game needs a lot of work but for what the game claims to be an RPG, this is expected.Horror is where this game earns the full 4 stars for me. That is why I bought it and why most people buy this type of game for the scare factor if there is one so did I get scared? Yes, I did! Never have I been afraid to play a game (come on I'm 30 years old and grew up watching the Shining) but when you play through the Hunted Mansion level with the lights out, downstairs alone and the sound way up, you will get scared like I did! Trust me! I loved that Hunted Mansion because you did not know what was around every corner and the sounds you would hear there were very errie!Overall the game is a good scare in some parts but in others a good story and plot to follow along with. I did not finish the game as of yet (I am stuck in downtown L.A. map at the Skyline Hotel level trying to find this women to talk to but can't get any access to the hotel rooms to find her and my hacking points are not up to speed to break into the hotel security system) so I am just giving you a half-way-through the game review but it's the intital impression the game gives that counts when judging it not the ending of it!My advice, if you like horror genre games and a little scare here and there buy this game! If you want a FPS action game like HL2 look else where please! If you just like a good story line and plot that is a little out-there then this is the game for you! Heck, buy it and see what you think reguardless of what anyone here says in there reviews of the game. You won't regret it, trust me!Ohh and I almost forgot, you will be afraid!!!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2005"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K7ZI","description":"","reviewerName":"Prometheus \"diosprometheus\"","summary":"A Mistake","reviewText":"I don't know about the other games in this series as I never played them, but buying this one was a mistake.  You see I don't like games where you can't see half the time and you continually have to reset the view in order to see.  There is something about these games from Japan where they don't want you to see (Bayonetta was a little like that and this is worse)  and well, since my eyesight ain't so hot to begin with I just don't need a game like this.  After all it makes it hard to defeat the big bad boss when you can't see him most of the time.  I didn't play the game for very long and, well, I am seriously thinking about sending it back.  I also didn't play the game with the motion controller so it might work better with that since it was originally a Wii game but the press R3 on Playstation to kill you enemy is kind of corny and didn't work very well for me.  I admit that I might not be use to doing that as I have never played a game before where you had to press R3 and then move it in a certain direction to kill you foe and I am not sure I want to play a game like that.  Not sure I care for the story line about a Mechanic  (see Charles Bronson Jan-Michael Vincent movie) who wants to be the number one.  Graphics didn't thrill me much but then again, I didn't play it for very long as it quickly got annoying and didn't hold my short attention span.  I'll stick to games I like such as Dragon Age, Mass Effect and the Uncharted games rather than this game.  I am sure this game will find some fans for this slash and hack kind of thing.  I am not against those kinds of game either.  It took awhile but I got to like Wet after awhile but always found Bayonetta extremely annoying with its countless cutscenes in the middle of battles and falling off of bridges in the middle of attacks.  Onechanbara was okay but I found it rather primative.  None of those game had you pressing R3 and moving it in a certain direction to finish off the foe.  I am sure that there are games I will like much better than this one and are better than this one too.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000FW87AI","reviewerName":"Micheal Hunt","summary":"It has it's bugs, but the fun overpowers it.","reviewText":"So, after SvsR 2006, what's been improved for 2007? First, a couple of controls have been changed, so it is now easier to Irish-whip an opponent, and also drag them around in a grapple. Unfortunately the trinagle button is still used for running, and it does not get better till 2008 i'm afraid. Had only this game had the following years controls, it would have been a much more successful game than it was. Not much in the way's of match types have changed since the last game, maybe a few alternations to how a submission is won, or grabbing things from the top of the ladder, but in the way of is there any new match types to play? It's pretty much just a new backstage area, and a repeat of the 2006's Bar/Pub room. However there has been a new invclusion of an area above the regular ring where you can go and fight a hardcore match in which is a lot of fun. You can smack opponents into microwaves and hi-fi equipment and interact with the audience, not to mention climb a scaffold and take off from it, through an opponent laying on a table if you want. This new area is a cool new area. The new hotspots that where in it's demo form in 2006 have been perfected. Some hotspots have up to 4 different things that can be preformed from it.Match types since 2006 seem to be about the same, only the fantasy match (bra and panties) has been left out.Singles*No Manager*With ManagerTag*Normal*Tornado*Elimination Normal*Elimination Tornado*Triple Threat*Fatal Four-Way*Handicap*Royal RumbleMain Events- Backstage Brawls- Bar Brawl or Parking Lot BrawlBattle Royal*4/5/6-man (includes options for over the top rope elimination or not.)Buried AliveElimination ChamberNormal or Tornado 6-ManFirst BloodHardcoreHell in a Cell (1on1, triple thrat, tornado, fatal four way, 6man)Iron ManLadderLast Man StandingSpecial RefereeSteel CageSubmissionTablesTLCMoney in the BankNo inferno or scaffold matches.Also removed this time around is the ability to run along the barriers outside the ring, but in it's place the announce tables have been upgraded so you don't just do a move and fall off, certain finishers now break the table easily, and you now have to rip the top off the table to get onto it. You can also use the wires from the table to strangle your opponent. Very cool new feature.Legends included for this game are;* Classic Hulk Hogan* Bret Hitman Hart & Jim The Anvil Neidhart (Hart Foundation)* Bam Bam Bigelow* Mick Foley / Dude Love / Cactus Jack / Mankind* Jerry \"the King\" Lawler* Kurt \"Mr. Perfect\" Henning* Shane McMahon* Stone Cold Steve Austin* Tazz* The Rock* Rowdy Rodd PiperUnlocking these legends is a simple process of just playing season mode and winning at PPV's for the most part. You can then buy them in the smackdown store.Season mode consists of not a great deal of interest. Once you have done it and unlocked what you need, you won't have any desire to return to it.Back from 2006 is the challenge mode where you compete in given matches based on classic matches or fantasy matches. For the most part this is easy peazy stuff, but watch out for the Mexicool vs Brothers Of Destruction match up... it took me a while to beat that one.The challenges this time around are just for extra money, however by the time I played them, I had already unlocked everything after beating JBL in season mode and earning 100,000 which is enough. The money is a pointless waste of time once everything is unlocked, which apart from legends, is not much, just useless things.Having played 2008 and 2011 so much lately, I was surprised going back to 2007 was actually quite fun. Once you get past the bugs in commentary where a chair shot is called a stone cold stunner and a bunch of other moves being the wrong names called out, it's still a lot pf fun to play. Sure. it's not perfect, not quite as good as 2008 or 2011, but it's backstage areas are more fun than those two. However, I would still rank this up there as probably the 3rd best of the SvR series. Quite a lot needed to be improved, but it's done now, so what can you do? Take it for what it is, and overall, it aint that bad.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001CMIUYS","reviewerName":"41reviews","summary":"Stays true to final fantasy series","reviewText":"This is a great series with another great addition to be added. This one definitely keeps you playing for endless hours if you decided to do all the side quests or try to obtain all the items.  I'm not a person to do something like that - I personally like to play for the story and nothing more.The story by itself is intriguing enough to keep me interested. At first the game moves slow only because there is a lot of character building and a lot of cut scenes to keep you interested. After getting past all of that and really into the game, you'll find that the game has a lot to offer. There is the typical leveling up that you need to do especially near the end, and of course a lot of running around.  One of the features I really liked was that the enemies don't just pop up out of no where.  You have the ability to avoid them most of the time. I find it very useful when you get tired of always running into them and just wanting to progress the story.I think leveling up could have been a little less confusing as you find so many weapons to level up that its hard to figure out what is the best weapon for you to use until it is too late.  I recommend studying ahead of time on which weapons you want to aim for for leveling up so you don't waste precious time and elements.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2013"}

The story is a thrill ride of shocking twists and revelations. Max Payne's signature slow motion gunplay has been improved on every level. Get ready for Bullet Time 2.0, with new guns and moves that make action more intense and cinematic.

Massive production values include a motion-picture stunt crew, professional talent for voice acting and graphic novels, live motion capture, and authentic digital source material from New York City.","reviewerName":"Sean David \"J.W.\"","summary":"A Few Problems, But Still Very Fun Sequel to a Great Game.","reviewText":"If you're a hardcore action fan like me, chances are you've probably heard of Max Payne. It combines elements of John Woo films and film noir graphic novels. Some people may not like the film noir style or graphic novel look, but I think it's very unique and stylish. Now the sequel, Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, improves on it in every aspect. I understand that of course the game is going to run and look better on Xbox and PC. It probably does, but that didn't stop me from buying it for PS2. The graphics are both good and bad. The environments are decent and the character models could be better save for Max Payne, Mona Sax, and Vladimir. Max no longer has that stupid sneer on his face. Voice acting is pretty good, but it tends to skip every now and then. Controls are pretty much the same as the first, except now you can pistolwhip or throw grenades with a weapon equppied. The Bullet-Time feature has been improved and the sequences when reloading in Bullet-Time are awesome, looking just like a top-notch action movie. Don't let the love story theme stop you from purchasing this. It's a very good story and some levels let play as not only Max Payne, but Mona Sax, but she basically plays the same as Max, which is or isn't a bad thing necessarily. Also, the dreaded nightmare sequences are on here, but they're not as hair-pulling as they were on the first. These are short and playable. My only complaints and why Max Payne 2 didn't score higher with me is that unfortunately, the Xbox and PC version are both graphically and technologically superior to the PS2 version. Also, it's a bit too short. But these problems don't hurt the game that terribly much as it's still very fun and just as good as the first if not better. I give a 4 out of 5.

{"product_name":"B0017HIIWW","description":"Transformed and unleashed, Sonic races to save the world...and himself. Sonic the Hedgehog is on an adventure unlike any other. Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Katarina_Kiki","summary":"Excellent!","reviewText":"The daylight levels are very fun and typically fast paced, but the nighttime ones can be repetitive.

Sturgeon","summary":"The Good The Bad  and the Ugly","reviewText":"As with anything, Majora's Mask has it's good parts and bad parts. I'll start with the bad first.First and foremost, this cart is expensive. The game itself is ... (a higher end priced game), but there is also an expansion pack required on top of that which can cost another .... So you want to be sure you want it before you get it. M.M. is also much more difficult than the previous Ocarina of Time. You should definitely plan on buying a players guide to go with it.Probably the thing that stands out most once you get past the sheer cost is the new time limiting factor of game play. As the story goes, you have three days to finish whatever sidequest or dungeon you are currently on before you have to play the Song of Time and start over again. When this happens, only side quests and dungeons are saved. You lose everything else.  This has a tendency to make the player feel rushed and may keep them from taking the time to make the most of this game.The time limit does have an up side to it however. It forces the game to be extremely compartmentalized.  You have a specific goal to reach in your time of playing, you reach it, save the game, then when you come back to it, you move on to a different goal. You always know what you want to get accomplished in each three day period. Therefore, game play is very goal oriented and you know when you're making progress.The graphics are, much better than Ocarina of time. The cinematics are amazing and often very humorous. Link is also given a set of new abilities that are always fun getting a handle on.  The last word is that this game is fun. I've found it very hard to put down it's so addictive. If you can justify the cost, it all boils down to a really good game, especially if you're already a Zelda fan.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2001"}

Hicks","summary":"My favorite game this year","reviewText":"I generally like FPS games, but they do get stale after a bit. I also tire of being abuse online by 12 year olds in COD or MW. It is nice to play an immersive and innovative single player game like Dishonored.The world is unique.  It is often described as Steampunk, but I don't think that is correct. It is rather more Renaissance meets Superhero in Dystopia.I get too impatient with wide open games like Red Dead Redemption or GTA. I don't have the time to invest in a lot of the RPGs. Dishonored gives you a pretty concrete mission, often with an optional side mission. The openness comes from exploring along the way and by constructing an approach to your assassination based on the environment, your chosen powers (you can't have them all or max them all out) and even the animals that are in the environment.The AI is not completely stupid, so if you goof up there is a reasonable amount of trouble you can get yourself into. The save system is great, with frequent enough automatic saves as well as the option to manually save within a missionThere are a few issues with the game. I don't know how framerate is  established on the XBox, but on a 60 Hz set, there is a crummy blurring of the environment with movement of the camera, not with the actual onscreen action. This disappeared on my 120 Hz set, even in game mode. I don't quite understand why this is so, but it was annoying, and seems to be of some issue in the XBox version as opposed to the PS3.This is one of the few games I have played through more than once (the other being the Ninja Gaiden series) and at first I was PO's that you can't keep your runes and charms. But this forces you to rethink how you want to approach the replay. The first time I killed everyone all the time; the second time I was stealthier and used Possession more. That's the real beauty of this game. You can blast through it if you want, but you can then rework the whole experience in a completely different way that makes it feel fresh (it helps that you can skip most of the cutscenes as well).I can't recommend this game enough. It is such a refreshing break from the FPS genre, can be played for 30-60 minutes if that is all you have, and will keep you trying different approaches to the missions.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2012"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Justin Stewart","summary":"Scary game","reviewText":"This game was truly scary and great at the same time.

You play Sam &quot;Serious&quot; Stone a charecter like Duke Nukem or Caleb of Blood who is sent back in time to save the world, The whole game takes place in Ancient Egypt with about 14 levels. I played it on the default OpenGL video mode, the graphics are fantastic as good as quake3. The textures look real. The levels are very big and the areas are very large with many wide-open spaces. I like the choice of weapons too. The saving and loading times are also good. It is not a game like half-life, The gameplay is just get from point A to Point B by shooting everything that moves, no puzzles solving and not many jumping too. There are not many different monstors but there will be loads of them comming on all sides, They respawn a lot but they dont cause much damage and it is not very hard getting them. Picking up ammo and health respawns the monstors, Infact if you find a locked door pick up the ammo and health packs lying arround, the monstors will come on all sides, and when you killed them all the door will open.The game is quite short but it has a great replay value and this game is not about completing it is about enjoying the action gameplay. The multiplayer, co-operative, and split screen modes and the very cheap price make serious sam really worth it. Serious Sam is one of the best action games i have ever played and it is a must have if you like action games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2001"}
{"product_name":"B000B43OY4","reviewerName":"RPG Fan","summary":"Welcome to Next-Gen","reviewText":"I bought the 360 with a grain of salt.  By now everyone and their grandmother is aware of the issues with the 360 and overheating.  From what I understand there's been an improvement with the opitcal drive so it doesn't run quite as hot as when it was first released.  Still, I've been catious-- making sure there's plenty of ventialtion and even at times opening the window nearby to let the cool air in.  I also bought the two year warranty just to be on the safe side.  If you take care of the system it should be fine, just keep that in mind.I've been a Sony fanboy for quite some time but twith the PS3 lacking any decent games until Q4 2007 and with a $600 price tag the 360 won me over (good job, Microsoft.  I pretty much hated the original Xbox but you've made the right moves and won over a customer).  I, like many others, jumped the Gears of War bandwagon and since then my library has gradually expanded and I've been highly impressed with the system.  As long as you do a little research on which games you buy (IGN.com or check the ratings on Amazon) and don't buy any lemon-games you'll be hooked to the 360.My only disappointment is the loss of my beloved Final Fantasy games with the switch from Sony.  Now if only Microsoft would spend some of their bucco bucks on a contract wtih Square-Enix (even if it allows Sony first-release rights or something, like an X month window) I'd be in gamer heaven.  Fortunately there are some good looking RPGs coming for the 360 soon.So, again, awesome system.  I love it and have been converted from a Sony fanboy to now a Microsoft customer.  I can't say it enough, just take care of your system (and consider the extended warranty-- it's only $60 for 2 years, better than paying X amount for a new one or uncovered repairs) and it should last you a while without any problems.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0002ILS1K","description":"Time passes, the pages turn ... and a new chapter unfolds in an unfamiliar land! Get ready for a two-dimensional role-playing adventure for the ages as Mario returns to paper form in pursuit of a threat unlike any he's ever faced. This time around, more emphasis is placed on the paper abilities of Mario and his friends. He can turn sideways to slip through cracks, fold into a paper airplane to fly, roll into a tube and much more. He can also use tons of items like hammers and thunderbolts.","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","summary":"More Fun Than A Barrel Of Goombas!","reviewText":"I played and greatly enjoyed the original Paper Mario back on the N64, so when I got around to buying a gamecube (yes, I got mine after they stopped being current-gen), I decided to pick up the sequel, \"Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door\".  Unfortunately, the first time I tried to play this game, I was lured away by the siren call of the Ace Attorney series.  So, I quit playing Paper Mario and I played the first three games of the Phoenix Wright series (in a row!).  So, now I've finally gotten around to Paper Mario again.  Hooray!Graphics (score 10/10): When you have a system that isn't renowned for it's graphical prowess, in order to make the game look good the developer has to get creative with the graphics.  I believe they've suceeded here.  Making the whole game sort of resemble a pop-up book is actually an ingenious way to introduce creative visuals to the game.  The characters are literally flat like paper, and although the backgrounds appear 3-D, they, too, are supposedly made of paper (when you go into a house, the front wall falls away as though the paper was folded down).  Furthermore, the game has lots of places where the graphics play on the whole 2-D/3-D dichotomy in amusing ways (for example, Mario gets an ability later where he can turn sideways to show the edge of his paper cutout and squeeze through narrow openings).  Despite all this optical trickery going on, it rarely feels like the perspective is confusing or disorienting.  Overall, this game is proof that developing graphics for a less powerful system doesn't mean that your game has to be ugly.Music (score 9/10): The music is pretty darn good.  Each song is appropriate to its location; with most of the music being cheery and upbeat.  All the music is distinctive enough to keep you interested, so I don't have any complaints.  There isn't any proper voice acting, but Mario occasionally says things like \"Oh yeah\" and \"mmm-hmm\".  The rest of the sound effects are appropriate-sounding and most of them are amusing too.Characters (score 10/10): Normally I absolutely despise silent protagonists in RPGs.  You know what I'm talking about - the main characters who have no personality and never speak.  I really hate that because it doesn't really give you any reason to empathize or form an attachment to your character.  Even though Mario never really speaks (he occasionally says brief things like \"mmm-hmm\" or nods \"yes\"), it didn't bother me at all.  Here, the game sort of pokes fun at itself and the whole \"silent protagonist\" thing.  There are even various scenes where the other characters comment on how Mario doesn't talk much.  The other characters are also likable, but not terribly deep.  Then again, I don't expect deep from this type of game.  What they do have, though, is quirky humor and charm.  Also, if you are a fan of old-school Mario games (I never played any of them, but I'm aware of them enough to recognize various characters), this game is chock full of old enemies that have been re-purposed into NPCs.  You'll see goombas and koopas and boos and such everywhere.  And, of course, all of them are infinitely cute!Story (score 10/10): The story itself is pretty simple.  Mario is, as always, trying to rescue Princess Peach.  And, as always, in order to do this you need to collect X number of magical items.  The various little quests, though, are infused with humor.  There are plenty of fourth-wall-breaking jokes thrown in, too, as well as plenty of self-parody jokes (just talk to Luigi when you see him and you'll know what I'm talking about).  Like the characters, the story isn't incredibly deep or anything, but it's very humorous, cute, and entertaining instead.  Plus, the pacing is excellent - I never felt like the story was dragging or like the game was too long due to filler.Battle System (score 9/10): The battle system is essentially turn-based, but with plenty of timing -based action commands thrown in.  You choose between the usual options of attack, items, special moves, etc.  If you choose to attack, you'll have to pull off some timed button presses to do optimum damage.  For people who don't have great coordination, don't worry, it's not too difficult.  For all those who dislike regular turn-based battle systems, the battle system of Paper Mario should please you since it's a bit more involved.  For me, however, the battle system was a bit more of a mixed bag.  I actually really like traditional turn-based battles since they are so relaxing and not based on timing (I'm one of those uncoordinated people!).  While I did enjoy playing this game, sometimes I found the timing-based commands to be frustrating.Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Let's see, there're tons of things to talk about here.  Let's start with some of the notable good things.  The leveling system allows for some customization since every time you level up, you get to choose which to increase: HP, FP, or BP.  I appreciate this choice.  Also of note, if you are the sort who hates random battles, it will please you to know that all the enemies in this game are visible on-screen and can be avoided.  I'm also pleased to say that the game gives you very good direction on what to do next (for the most part) so that you don't feel like you're floundering in confusion.  Now, let's talk about the few gameplay issues that bugged me.  Firstly, I really wish you could hold more items.  Your item space is very limited and it will constantly irritate you.  You can get an item that increases your inventory, but it really only becomes available toward the end of the game.  Secondly, I wish you could switch between your partners in the field more quickly.  As it is, you have to go into the main menu and tab over to select a different character.  It would've been nice to have a button that cycles through characters on-screen in the field.  Other than those two things, though, I don't have any complaints!  I feel like the overwhelmingly good gameplay mechanics (camera, pacing, overall design of dungeons, etc.) make up for those two small annoyances, so I've given this section a perfect score.Overall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  I don't often give out perfect scores like this, so it's quite a compliment for this game.  Sometimes I give out perfect scores because a game has a deep and complex narrative (on top of excellent gameplay) but for other games I'll give out a perfect score because they are fun - and good at what they are meant to be.  \"Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door\" is one of those types of games.  It's not meant to be a deep complicated narrative; it's meant to be a fun humorous bit of fan-service for Mario aficionados on top of great gameplay - and essentially, that's what it is.  Plus, it's one of the more unique RPGs I've come across so far.  If you have a gamecube and are itching for a good RPG, then I strongly suggest you pick up Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2011"}

I confess I was a bit skeptical of the game when I had seen it at first. It looked just like Fallout 3 with a different setting and a few new items, I thought to myself as many did \"This looks like it's just DLC\". Well, I'm pleased to report Fallout New Vegas is anything but that. It's a deep and massive game with an interesting story and a more Fallout flavor that Fallout 3 by far.So, lets get down to business, the gameplay. This game plays just like Fallout 3. Virtually everything is the same in this department. The VATS systems is usefully but thankfully the targeting in the game is much improved thanks to the ability to aim down the sights of a weapon. I found myself not using the Vats much because of how fun it was just to fire the gun manually. The weapons have a new sense of weight that was absent in Fallout 3 as well. There are also new Ammo types in the game. Usually enemies wearing armor or who have armor plating won't take much damage from regular ammo so you need to use armor Peirce rounds, or if the enemy is unarmored you can use hollow point rounds that will tear right through them. This is a nice and interesting change but ultimately doesn't make much of a difference. Same with the new workbench system. On the bright side you can now buy add ons for your guns. For example, the hunting rifle can now have an extended clip, and a scope added to it among other things. Guns can have silencers and new outer casings. Over all this was a fun and interesting new addition that was very welcome. Leveling is pretty much the same, there are a few new perks and you only get perks every other level up, but experiance is easier to get more amounts of and leveling up doesn't take very long.Two things that stood out about Fallout New Vegas were it's addition of the companion wheel and Hardcore mode. Hardcore mode allows you to play the game in a way that you need to sleep, drink and eat to survive and ammo has weight. These may seem like minor changes but it is most defiantly different and makes the game much harder. This is not a bad thing, it's more interesting to have to balance those things.Now onto the companion wheel. In the game you can find characters to travel with, and they are actually quite useful. They don't die, they just get knocked unconscious and you get the experience for their kills, plus the companion wheel allows you to give them commands that are basic but efficient as well as talk to them. Each character has their own individual quest that is interesting and in depth as well.That brings me to one of the negative aspects of Fallout New Vegas. Though there are a lot more side quests in the game, most of them are basic and don't take you very long, nor are they very interesting. They are usually just errands to run. Go here, kill that person, come back, get paid, done. There are some quests in the game that are very good, don't get me wrong, but most of them are just so bland. On the bright side the ability to earn the trust and balance what factions you want to join or destroy is a very cool dynamic. Fallout is a very political game. You have to choose your actions carefully so that you don't anger your benefactors. This gives a whole new meaning to the the idea that your decisions effect the over all game. If you take on or sabotage one faction the end game changes drastically. It was very fun to find and get to know these factions.Now, a lot of you are wondering, and I have gotten this question a lot since I got the game. How big is the game. Is the Mojave Wasteland smaller than the Capital Wasteland? No, it's about the same size actually. There are lots of landmarks and places to go as well. This game feels and looks very distinct from Fallout 3. The setting is totally new and unfamiliar. It's more colorful and desert like. Though often times I felt like it was a bit too much like a desert and not enough like an actual Nuclear Wasteland. But ultimately it still feels a lot like Fallout. More so than Fallout 3. It has the tone and feel of Fallout 2 really, so old school fans of the series will be very pleased. The Super mutants look and other characters and enemies like the old school fallout and there are all kinds of references to the older games as well. This is the Fallout you know. The Graphics do look a tad dated, but that never really bothered me, Besides, there are a few minor improvements. It's more Fallout, and that's all I care about, besides, the game still doesn't look half bad.My Biggest grievance with Fallout New Vegas is the fact that it is buggy...to say the least. There are glitches galore. Enemies that fall through the ground, get stuck in door, the game lags and eventually crashes after so much time playing and other ridiculous problems that should have been fixed before the product was shipped. I feel like I'm the one beta testing the game. Bethesda has since released a patch that did fix a lot of the bugs, but it's still inexcusable. Its times like this when I wonder if they even bother to beta test their games at all. I know this game was developed by Obsidian but still, Bethesda should have made more of an effort to fix this before the game was released, not a few days after.Moving on, The next thing I'd like to discuss is the the story of Fallout New Vegas. This storyline is interesting to say the least. It begins with you getting shot in the head and you are then thrust into a much bigger world that involves you gaining the trust of certain factions all while unraveling the secrets of New Vegas and it's mysterious leader, Mr. House. Overall I was pleased with the games story. It was about as good as Fallout 3's story, though like the end of Fallout 3 I couldn't play the game after I beat it, this pissed me off because I figured they'd have at least learned from that major mistake. I'm sure some future DLC will fix that, but still, I found that to be very annoying, I don't want to pay to continue to play the game after I'm finished with the main quest. Especially when the game ended in such a way that it seemed like that was the logical step.The sound of the game is top notch thankfully. The noise from the distance is unnerving as you can hear gun fire and screams from seemingly miles away. The music is good, nice to listen too, though the radio isn't much to enjoy. It isn't addicted to hear Mr. New Vegas like it was to listen to Three Dog. That said the Voice action is very good, much better than Fallout 3's. There are more people voicing the characters and usually their ethnicity matches their voice, unlike the previous games, and there are more than 1 or 2 people to voice certain types of characters like old folks or women.So all in all Fallout New Vegas is a great game full of rich content and re-playability. It's addictive and well wort the price. This is a full game and There is so much to explore and be captivated by about the game that I don't have time to go into it all. So, I give Fallout New Vegas a solid 9 out of 10.Score: 4 out of 5Pros:More Fallout style gameplay that feels distinctCompanion wheel, Factions and Hardcore mode make things more interesting.Interesting story and great voice acting.Better weapon handling and aiming.Weapon upgrades and ammo types.Dated graphics aren't much of an issue.Lots of new content and weapons.A lot more side quests than Fallout 3Lots of cool landmarks and locationsCons:A lot of the side quests lack much depth.The Mojave Wasteland sometimes doesn't feel like much of a nuclear fallout zone.inexcusably buggy.Workbench and ammo making isn't really interesting.when you beat the game you can't continue to play afterward.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2010"}

Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

Le","summary":"Bioware's Space Odyssey with Sex and Violence Continues","reviewText":"Having played ME2 3 times, I find it rather more difficult to talk about ME2 without making reference to ME1 as there are so many aspects between the 2 games that are interrelated.  Therefore, if you have not play ME1, I recommend that you do so, but please be aware of ME1's DRM with limited activation - which is removed for ME2; ME2 uses a disc check type DRM with no online or limited  activation - which is very acceptable to me.Now that we got DRM out of the way, the fact that you can import saved games from ME1 into Me2 is an awesome feature that let you continue the adventure and exploits of Commander Sheppard - and indeed, it is a grand adventure as Bioware continues its masterful tradition of blending story telling with gaming experience.  So, no complain with the story department (OK, one thing:  What really happened to the Spectres between ME1 and ME2 ?), but there are some concerns in the gameplay.  However, I find the changes in ME2 hard to describe in term of straight up pro and con; that is, there is both pro and con in every changes.  Therefore, I'll just pick the most prominent and discuss it.First of all, it is a shame that RPG elements are scaled back big time from ME1.  Although in all honesty, I have to give Bioware credits for having the guts to eliminate everything that was not implemented well in ME1 which includes the following:-The Mako Rover:  The control is clumsy (especially on the Xbox 360; I load the games just to confirm this) but I love the planetary exploration capability of an armed space aged Humvee.  In ME2, you now have a shuttle that drops you right into the action.  Streamlined ? Yes, but I think it would be more fun and realistic to have both the shuttle with a small rover for a real sense of exploration.  Furthermore, I really miss the inspiring panoramic vistas from ME1.  Boring Planet scanning in place of the Mako is hardly an improvement and felt even more tedious at times.-Inventory screen: Again, streamline is the key word here, where there is now very limited variation of equipment and armament in ME2 with limited upgrade options.  There is no more grenade, but addition of BFG type weapons - including two different types of grenade launchers -  is a big plus).  Like the Mako, I admit that ME1 console style inventory is clumsy, but I still love tinkering with party inventory in spite of the painful experience.-Omni Gel: Mutiple use in ME1, but most notable for giving you the option not having to  mess with decryption.  Gone in ME2, you have no choice but to put up with the decryption mini game - which Andrew Dice Clay would probably compares to `masturbating with a cheese grater: slightly amusing... but mostly painful !'-Also, outside of the Normandy, you have very limited option to talk to your teammate on a mission.  I am fairly sure this is minor to most Gamers as most of the time your teammates just repeat the comments, but it is a big part of the overall RPG experience for me.-Combat: Now this is a very positive change. Soldier is now the best class IMO because the shooter elements are vastly improved.  Everything from cover function to weapon effect - including weapon effectiveness - are better than ME1.  In addition, I welcome the addition of ammo requirement (or whatever the lame explanation for the heat clip is) as it adds to the realism.  Also, in line with a true shooter instead of a RPG, weapon accuracy depends largely on the players' aiming skill - not how much XP points you put into the weapons itself (a feature of a more traditional RPG). This is also a big change to the level up option - which is also `streamlined' - which, again, really means more limitation.However, please do not expect ME2 to be a hardcore FPS like Half-Life or STALKERS, because you will be disappointed.  The TPS works great on consoles, but is still lacking, and cannot compare to a fully functional FPS  with true leaning, jumping, crouching, or prone options.  Generally, moving in and out of cover don't always work well. And don't be surprise to find out that as you pop out of cover, your target is obstructed by... none other but yourself.  Regardless, combat in ME2 is generally fun if not thrilling - but I just want more RPG elements retained on top of the shooter elements improvements.-Another plus is that there are more team members to recruit.  You now have up to 10 to 12 team members - including 2 returning members from ME1 back for another romp through the galaxy.  Mordin the Salarian is the highlight IMO.  Also, more companions also means more ...-...Romance options this time around.  Personally, I am beginning to find it to be a distraction.  Some flirting conversation options are nice, but actively pursuing a romance is getting somewhat tiring.  I was simply being nice to a certain volatile female member when all of a sudden, I was in a ... \"relationship\".  Honestly, romance options are nice in an RPG, but realistically from a Military point of view, what we really need is more places like Omega's After Life club with an expanded line of `services'.By the way, I cannot get enough of the Quarians and their Migrant Fleet. They remind me so much of both the space faring Bentusi and the `Exiles' in their quest to reclaim their \"Homeworld\" (an awesome RTS game in space.  BTW, Bioware flat out refers to the Quarians' home planet as \"Homeworld\".)Finally, although not as well done as ME1, you still get to connect to different members of your squad and you do feel that lingering sense of loss when they die. Therefore, I'd like to offer some helpful tips on how to keep all members in your squad alive(MILD SPOILER WARNING):-Be sure to upgrade the Normandy.-Pick an alignment - either Paragon or Renegade - and stick with it.  There are some exceptions where you have to `cross over' because the interruption options are too fun to pass up; but other than this, keep to your alignment as much as you can.  Besides having more conversation options available, having a high alignment also helps the next point...-Be sure all members of your squad is LOYAL by doing all loyalty missions.  It is helpful to do the loyalty mission for Jack and Legion last - with at 3 full bars on your alignment meter, or more. (In addition, earning squad members' loyalties unlock new abilities; abilities that you can `siphon' from)(END SPOILER)In conclusion, ME2 is what I consider a light-weight RPG that meshes well with a middle-weight TPS (more RPS - role playing shooter - than RPG).  Personally, I had hoped that Bioware would  improve ME1's shortcoming instead of eliminating them altogether. However, if Bioware keeps up the trend, then everything bad or questionable in ME2 will be eliminated in ME3 as well - at least, I hope so.  As is, in spite of its shortcomings in the RPG department, ME2 is still a fun and thrilling sci-fi adventure and a great gaming experience; and comes close to topping ME1 - but no cigar.  Regardless, if you ever own a telescope to gaze at the stars late into the night and wonder what possibilities are out there, ME2 is totally worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2010"}

Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

{"product_name":"B002I098JE","description":"","reviewerName":"TRON","summary":"A GREAT Game, With Horrible Maps","reviewText":"I don't see the hate in this game. It is honestly my second favorite Call of Duty. My first favorite was the original Modern Warfare. See, you people are expecting too much. For a game that comes out every year, you expect a whole brand new game every time. It's a fast paced FPS, that's something they can not change. Also, I don't understand how people are saying &#34;same as the last Call of Duty.&#34; Ummm&#8230; What? This is definitely not like Black Ops 2. Treyarch and Infinity Ward are two different teams. Yes, you run and kill people with guns, that's just how Call of Duty is. Let's compare Black Ops 2 and Ghosts:Black Ops 2 is a more colorful, &#34;cartoonish&#34; arcade-like game. If you played Black Ops 2, you know what I mean. Ghosts has more realistic graphics to it. It's harder to spot people. Many people don't like this. I honestly would rather have the more realistic graphics.The maps&#8230; oh these maps. The maps in Black Ops 2 were honestly better. I like maps that aren't too small but also aren't too big. I occasionally enjoy playing tiny maps such as Nuketown for the fast paced action, but I prefer medium sized maps. Most of the maps in Ghosts suck. Some are huge, and some are medium. Maps like Stormfront or Stone Haven are terrible. They don't look bad, but they're too big for the amount of players in the game, which brings me to my next point.Less players in Ghosts? Okay, so I don't know why they would put less players in a match. 6v6 is a little too small for the size of the maps. In the Xbox One version, there is Ground War with more players.Balanced weapons! Yes! Almost every weapon is actually usable in Ghosts. There really isn't any overpowered weapons. The strongest assault rifle would be the MSBS, but it's a 3 round burst, so unless your accuracy is on point, you will die. You can dominate a game if you're comfortable with even the weakest gun.Different killstreak classes! Not much to say here except you can chose between Assault, Specialist, and Support. A great addition to the game.Finally, the best feature that sold me on this game&#8230; players actually die. Many people don't like this, but you die WAY faster in Ghosts than on other Call of Duty games. I feel like this is how it should be. In Black Ops 2, 90% of the time, you have to unload a full clip to kill 1 or 2 people! In Ghosts, you can kill up to 5 people on a full clip. I have yet to encounter someone eating my bullets.Overall, GREAT game and having tons of fun! Just wish there were better maps!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2014"}

First, the white man takes their land and moves them to dusty reservations, then aliens abduct them from those reservations and imprison them on a spaceship built from twisted metal and grotesque, pulsating flesh. At least, that's what happens to Tommy, along with his Cherokee grandfather and girlfriend, in Prey, a game that's been in development hell for many moons, but has proven well worth the wait.The visuals are astonishing, and the story, which crosses tribal mysticism with sci-fi horror, will keep you guessing until the end. Creative level design allows you to switch gravity to the walls and ceiling, which will either have you giggling gleefully or wondering if there's an herbal, Native American equivalent of Dramamine.Despite its innovations, Prey falls just short of greatness. As cool as it is to rip the legs off alien bugs and hurl the explosive insects at enemies, eventually the novelty wears off, and you realize they're still just grenades. And whether you're crawling down a corridor's walls or ceilings, it doesn't change the fact that it's just another first-person corridor crawl.

Fable was promised to be a revolutionary RPG that would take interactivity with computer controlled characters and environment to new levels.  It didn't quite live up to the original expectations that were set, but Fable is still a lot of fun.The basic premise behind Fable is that you guide a Hero from childhood to fame and fortune.  You can choose to be good or evil, and the choices will change everything from people's reactions to you to your physical appearance.  You can also choose what type of adventurer you will be by how you distribute your experience points. Put points heavily into Agility and you'll be a rogue.  Put more points into Magic than anything else, and you'll be given the title of a mage.One of the best features is your statistics subscreen, which tracks just about everything you do.  On this screen you can see the number of: people you've killed, times you've gotten drunk, wives you have, times divorced, and much more.The only noticeable shortcomings are the relatively short time that it takes to beat the game (a pro could get through in 10-15 hours), and the extremely short ending.  Even if you can beat the game in 10 hours, you should be rewarded with more than a 30 second ending.A little more interactivity and more quests would take Fable to 5-stars.  However, it is still a fun game with a good bit of replayability.  Definitely worth a purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2005"}

Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A 10-megaton blast of nostalgia on a disc","reviewText":"Ah yes, the ol' Sega Genesis, beloved originator of \"blast processing\" that \"does what Nintendon't.\" You gotta love the great console wars of the early 1990's. They truly gave birth to some epic moments in gaming. For those out there like myself who grew up playing Sega Genesis games at home and have a weakspot for nostalgic blasts from the past, this collection is a Godsend. There isn't much to say about this collection that hasn't already been said in great detail, but I felt it to be a worthy endeavor to add my voice to the legion that is Sega fans.What you get when you pay for this collection is essentially 40 Sega Genesis classics, as well as 9 extra bonus games you can unlock, some of which are arcade titles and others of which are Sega Master System games. Most of these games really are timeless classics too: Sonic 1-Knuckles, Ristar, Shining Force 1 and 2, Phantasy Star 2-4 (and the Sega Master system version of 1), Vectorman, Ecco the Dolphin, Dynamite Heady, Comix Zone, Golden Axe 1-3, I mean the list goes on and on. The games here range from serious smash hit titles to very obscure, lesser known gems that should have been hits. It's a great collection that will offer hours and hours of nostalgic fun and truly memorable experiences. There's also a large variety of games here, taken from all sorts of genres that were prevalent at the time.The Genesis was a system with fantastically unique hardware. I mean, the music alone is magic in electronic form, truly. Obviously, the graphics have aged and some better than others, but like a fine wine, most have aged quite well and that adds to their charm. What's even more amazing is just how timeless the gameplay is in most of these gaming darlings. To be honest, I'm quite stunned at just how much most of these games have retained their \"freshness.\" Granted, most games are over two decades old, but still, these games play way better than I expected them to. That could be attributed to the stupendous work done to port these games onto the disc. The games have been worked on so that they output in HD. Now, the graphics aren't better, but the colors are definitely very vibrant and you don't have the infamous SD lines going across the screen. Beautiful, colorful games like Ristar never looked so good. The controls also work very well on the PS3 controller too. Sega and Backbone Entertainment did a very good job making sure these games play and control exceptionally well. Bravo!Also worth mentioning is the fact that there are quite a few extras you can unlock. There are nine additional games that are quite easy to unlock. These range from arcade games that eventually became Genesis titles, such as Altered Beast, as well as some famous Sega series that started on the Sega Master System, such as the first Phantasy Star. That was really nice to see on here. There is also a gallery of sorts on the disc, where you can view nice little advertising/marketing pictures of each game, as well as neat, informative fun-facts about each game and its history. There are also bonus things such as interviews that give insight into that time period in Sega's history. All of these are really nice extras for Sega scholars out there. Overally, Sega really went all-out to give one of their shining achievements the treatment it deserves, and I really respect that.The very first video games I ever played as a child were on the Genesis my family had at home. I grew up with a healthy diet of awesome Sega treats. Now, all these years later I have my own home with my own family, and to play these titles on my PS3 at home really packs a nostalgic punch in the heart. I have such a soft spot for those old classics. My wife, on the other hand, grew up with a SNES at home instead and was blessed with all of the truly magical titles that graced Nintendo's awesome 16-bit counterpart to the Genesis. Even she, who has never really known Sega's quality first-hand until now, has loved becoming acquainted with it with me from this collection. Two very different experiences, same great opinion of this collection. That's just awesome.This disc was truly a divine gift. To top it all off, this collection is a mere $20 these days, sometimes less. That's less than 50 cents a game! What a fantastic value! I really can't recommend this collection enough, whether you're a gamer who was significantly impacted by this sweet system of blast processing, or you're a gamerly scholar who is interested in a genuinely thrilling and fascinating pocket of video gaming history, this is a great purchase. Buy it, crank up your speakers and put on your early 1990 goggles, and travel back to a truly wonderful, memorable era in gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2012"}

I've played it for a week now, and it's simply not up to Rockstar standards.  The graphics, the load times, the controls - it all feels utterly unfinished to me and is not something I would expect from Rockstar studios.-I am a huge fan of the GTA series, and when I heard back in the day that their next video game venture was \"Bully\", and was going to be different, I was very excited to give it a shot.  I was let down.-Graphics: They're weak.  From the jagged edges on your characters' bald head, to the 3rd and 4th finger glued together on every single character in each cut scene, it's just weak.  Polygon issues, bad character movement.  It's simply not up to snuff.-Control: From the first minute of playing the game, when I discovered I could not invert the Y axis, I knew I was in trouble.  It makes playing hell.  Moving and aiming is not smooth and I have trouble getting around on the skateboard and bike.  It's just like lower-quality versions of older GTA games.-Sound: fine. No complaints.-Load times: Don't get me started!  You will do a LOT of waiting in this game!  From entering a building to entering a classroom, you must WAIT.  It gets really irritating and I find myself giving up playing much sooner than usual.-Story: You're in school, you go to class, you cause trouble, you do little missions.  It's not bad.  I do like the classes - each is like it's own mini-game you must successfully complete to get a good mark for that class.-Gameplay: I mentioned it a bit in the Story - classes are minigames. You can find other side missions.  I haven't found any \"main\" mission yet.  We'll see once I complete some classes I guess.  What I can't stand about the gameplay is the CONSTANT harrassment of other students and proctors.  They are ALWAYS bugging you which makes getting around a real drag.-Overall: I'm disappointed.

They could easily update the roster and leave it at that, maybe alter a few things in story mode, but no each year they go above and beyond to try and create the best possible wrestling game out there, and truth be told they are second to none.True this game features an updated roster but what makes it fun is the little details.  First and for most they made the choice of bringing back commentary and including for the first time voiceovers.  Now for anyone who played Just Bring It and Shut Your Mouth remember the commentary was horrendouse.  I like many wound up turning it off because it was just painful to listen too.  However they took a step in the right direction with this one in that the commentary is not repetitive (or as repetitive) and is actually somewhat fun to listen to.  The voice overs in some cases work out and in other cases don't.  Sadly in this case you can tell those who got into it and those who were reading the script.The legends update was great in that now the legends actually come out to their theme (or a variation of it).  Biggest one being in my eye and I am sure for fans the return of Bret the Hitman Heart.  Sadly the legends (for those who lasted into the attitude era) don't have their titantrons or voiceovers.  Also the legends cannot be used in Story mode.In terms of new matches there are only 2 this time around.  The Parking Lot Brawl is basicaly a Hardcore Match only the weapons are variouse vehicals surrounding you.  The other update is to the Elimination chamber where it is 6 man tag Elimination chamber.The best adjustment was to the create a wrestler.  Now it is fairly easy (or not as time consuming) to get their attribute points up (I maxed out myself in about two trips through story mode which is about 6 hours of gameplay if your good).  You don't even have to control your creatd wrestler to give him attribute points as you buy them in shopzone ie. Wrestlemania X9 on gamecube and earn them by winning matches.Finally outside of Online play the two newest features are Creating your own title belt that you can then defend online or on Create a PPV, yes Create a PPV is back and not nearly as tiem consuming to set up.  It even creates a little mini Movie for a buildup for your main event (in my case for my first PPV Bret Heart v. Shawn Michaels 3 stages of Hell).Overall this is a great improvement over last year and is definetly worth the money.  This isn't just an updated roster like those other sprots games, this is a whole new step for the franchise.  Buy this or Rest in Peace.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2004"}

This is soly based on how well you can use your weapon and dodge attacks.  The first thing that you'll realized is the graphics.  Unbelievable!!!  Never have I seen more beautifully designed levels and characters.  The next is the gameplay.  Awesome!!!  It is a compelling story line where Ryu (the main character) is seeking revenge against Doku (destroyed Ryu's village).  While on your long and very tough (and I mean extremely hard) quest to find Doku many secrets and characters will intervene in the games storyline.  As you have noticed I only gave it four stars, the reason for this is the lack of a more advanced tutorial mode.  The game starts off with you at the bottom of a canyon and you have to get to the top where you will then start to battle.  Some notes will be given on how to through some areas, but most is all on your own and trying to figure it out yourself.

The title of my review is not a insult towards Red Dead because that game is classic. I will keep my review simple and to the point. I can truly say after playing almost 30 hours in 4 days of AC3, I'm ready to cancel my pre-order of Halo 4. I'm so burnt out. I now, even more, extra appreciate the 6-10 hours campaigns on games. I did rent this game so I feel I got my money's worth. Total of $8. If you have Redbox, then you know how that works when keeping your rentals. Saying that, I most likely will still buy Halo 4 because it will be something different. Thanks for patience on my quick rant, here's my review.Like I was saying, AC3 felt like Red Dead Redemption, or maybe any other open world game, but this game specifially. I only focused on the main missions, didn't collect all collectiables, didn't play any of the dice or gambling games, shoot, I didn't even buy things from the stores. So if you add those things and side missions, you are getting a deep game. Thankful the game has fast travel marks on the map to where you can go straight to the area. I did this close to the end because I was ready for the game to be done. Just so you know its a total of 12 sequences, each one last probably like an hour and that's not including your failed attempts on a mission. Its not a spoiler so please don't troll about it.I gave it a 3 because it was just too long for my tastes. I had fun growing with the characters you play and how they improved on each level, also appreciated learning some more things on history. This game actually had me googling things. What I didn't like were the glitiches, especially in battles to where your actions weren't always reacting when they were suppose to and some of the cut scenes seem to be already in play as if you walked in the middle of a movie. I didn't like the horse riding controls, play red dead, that's how you control a horse. And last but not least, it didn't leave that impact like I thought it would, meaning I don't care if its another one made. And FYI, I'm not an Assassin's Creed colletor. I've played the other ones, but never PLAYED them, just did a few rounds or \"Sequences\" to get a taste of the game. AC3 seemed different so I wanted this one, well to invest playing time. Thank you Red Box!Any political or history buff will enjoy this game. The game is deep and very long but it just doesn't leave an impact for me.

Worth every penny.","reviewText":"Dead Rising is incredibly fun and addictive.  I've played through the 72 hour mode and managed get nearly through the unlocked \"overtime\" game and so far, I'm extremely impressed.I'm not a big fan of 1st person games on the console (which shooting in the game is), so it took me a while to get used to the pulling of trigger, directing with a thumbstick and shooting with another button.  Naturally, the bats and swords became favorites of mine as you don't have to do more than hit the X button to swing away. :)While a lot of people have given the game a negative spin on the save game mechanics, I actually really like the way capcom did the save game.  Yes at first I complained just like everyone else!  That was until I understood it.During the game, you have to find the dreaded bathroom or one of about 8 save points within the mall and this can be frustrating at low levels as you beat off hordes of zombies.  The system finally clicked on me when I had to start over though.  In my game I had gotten to about 11th level but missed one of the main quests which failed the story arch for me.  So I dejectedly went to the beginning to start over and it was then that I realized all my hours of time and energy were not wasted.  As I started the game again, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my character was 11th level and had retained all his skills, extra hit points and inventory slots.Talk about re-playability!  Instead of simply tossing you into a harder version of the game starting from scratch, you get to start over with your fully invested time and experience into your next character! See the beauty of this system?Even if you haven't saved for hours and you find yourself dead, you've got the option of saving your progress and restarting with all the experience gained.  You could spend a game session running around killing zombies, getting familiar with the layout of the mall and controls, then save after you die and go for the storyline and quests with all the experience intact.  I wish that I had known that from the beginning!  You've always got the option to reload from a save point as well, so it's a good idea to save often as well.I understand that starting over isn't ideal when you have spent 2 days wacking zombies around, but there is so much to this game that it will be nearly impossible to go through it once and see everything.  I continually found myself having to pick and choose which scoop to conquer.  This may be by design, but it's frustrating and my biggest complaint that nearly most of the game your rushed to complete all of the scoops.  It would have been nice to have 96 hours and time to explore the mall at your own pace.  I'd also like to see some form of safe house on the other side of the mall where you could temporarily stuff some of your rescued survivors.Those few annoyances aside, this is my favorite game on the xbox 360 hands down.  Worth every penny and I eagerly await a sequel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2007"}

{"product_name":"B002BS47YE","description":"","reviewerName":"M. MacMahon","summary":"Crysis Returns With a Taste of Console, but Also a Lot of Fun","reviewText":"Crysis was maybe the last of its kind... a big-budget spectacle of a PC game built to move graphics forward and offer non-linear gameplay which encouraged free-thinking and tactical thought.  Crysis 2 is not a sequel to that game, so put that out of your mind immediately.  Crysis 2 is a console FPS game ported (rather well, relatively) to the PC and its action and levels are more linear and guided.  That said does this mean it's a bad game?  No, it does not.While Crysis 2 is more linear than the original it is still relatively open compared to games like Call of Duty and Medal of Honor.  It reminds me most of F.E.A.R. actually, with semi-open environments and roaming enemies.  The comparison to F.E.A.R. holds up in other areas as well like the combat, which feels very visceral and tactile.  Shoot an enemy with a shotgun blast and they will spin around and then crash into a desk or shelf, wrecking in realistically and spraying particle effects everywhere.  Jump over a car to the enemy hiding on the other side and you will knock him over with just your body weight, then you can melee him to death.  This kind of physical action was great in F.E.A.R. and it feels great here too... it's not the same as Crysis' open playgrounds, but it is still a very fun shooter for different reasons.Graphics are amazing if you ask me, and run better than the original by a large margin.  Some aspects are worse than the original Crysis like textures and an overall \"soft\" look, but others aspects are much better.  For instance in Crysis certain details popped-in pretty close to you as you walked along but in Crysis 2 on max settings I have yet to see any significant pop-in.  Lighting is also better to my eye, mostly in how it plays off the reflective surfaces of the New York high-rises.  Interior detail is much better, every time I went in a hut or building in the original Crysis I felt like the graphical detail dropped about two generations worth, but in Crysis 2 the shops and apartments look just as amazing as the outside world.There are a few PC issues.  Lack of quick-save is a real bummer and the checkpoints are rather spread-out at times.  This is especially a downer for higher difficulty settings, since I (and most people) hate repeating content endlessly, so it puts me off a hardest level replay.  The video settings are locked to three choices rather than being fully customizable, though the community seems to be taking care of that already with command line entries and custom launcher tools.  The game runs perfect on \"extreme\" for me, so I'm not too bothered by the lack of advanced settings personally.  Some menu quibbles round out the port issues.  Honestly all in all if this were expected to be a console game the port would be pretty good compared to many others.  I think the root of the complaints lies in the fact this is a sequel to a PC exclusive.That line of thought actually extends to the entire game.  As a sequel to Crysis this game is a large disappointment with dialed-back tactical options and gameplay as well as port issues from the consoles.  As a stand-alone game though, if you can view it as that, it offers great combat with a real visceral feel and levels much wider and more open than pretty much any FPS of this type now-a-days.  If you can get past comparing it to the original at every turn and you like fun shooters I would suggest an immediate purchase.  If you require Crysis 2 to be everything Crysis was, PC focus included, then you're going to be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002BS47YE","description":"","reviewerName":"NeuroSplicer","summary":"MAXIMUM...CONSOLING!","reviewText":"SONY's PS3 is now 5 years old whereas MICROSOFT's Xbox360 is 6 six years old.\"How is this relevant?\" one would ask. It should not be, yet, sadly, it is.It is unfortunate that CRYSIS 2 has been designed and developed to run on hardware several Moore's Law cycles old. Remember how only umber-systems could run the originalCrysison Ultra and PC magazines still use it to benchmark performance tests? Well, CRYSIS 2 is nothing like that. The good news of course is that now even older and less powerful systems can handle the new game; the bad news is that it does not matter - the graphics are nothing to write home about.FROM THE KOREAN JUNGLE TO (THE SIMPLER) NYC ONEFoliage, rock formations, rivers, sandy beaches and crystal clear waters - all reflecting, refracting light and playing with shadows...remember how impressive the original game was? Well, I found the graphics to be a noticeable downgrade - and the urban environment nowhere near as demanding or as far drawn as those of the first CRYSIS.To be fair, the graphics are not bad (in fact, they are above average), they are just not what one would expect from the sequel of the graphical masterpiece the original CRYSIS was. The closeup textures (yet strangely not floor surfaces) are more detailed but after so many years this minor improvement cannot outweigh the game's graphical disappointment.ONLY A PSEUDOSEQUELI consider this a pseudosequel because apart from the title on the box, there is very little that picks up the story from the original game. In fact, besides Prophet making a...5sec appearance, the only thing that acts as continuance is the NanoSuit - and even that has been consoled down (read: oversimplified). Alternating between stealth and shield is all there is to it now (gone are strength and speed). Also gone is the multitude of choices on how to approach the next objective. The sequel has you on a connect-the-dots path that is meaningless to deviate from.SOMEONE PLEASE CLUE CryTek THAT **LESS** ALIENS IS ACTUALLY BETTERAs inFar Cryso inCrysis, I barely tolerated the chapters where I had to fight Aliens. I mean, it would be unrealistic to expect great originality in a video game developed in the era of hydrocephalus corporations, so we end up with aliens that remind us of either the sentinels from THE MATRIX or the tripods from WAR OF THE WORLDS or some other movie. So, give it a rest. Trying to outwit humans and then besting them is much more satisfying.And while we are on the subject, someone please explain to my how do humans infected with the alien virus become...bullet-proof? Anyone else notice that the billion-dollar NanoSuit is actually more vulnerable than infected flesh?AND THE DRM NEWS ARE NOT THE BEST EITHERI expected EA to give us a choice: either an OnLine Activation or a perpetual disk-check. CRYSIS 2 does not come with a choice. We get 5 Activation tokens (so don't forget to revoke when uninstalling) and, in full disclosure, I withheld one star from he final rating because of this.There seems to be a downhill path connectingFar CrytoCrysistoCrysis:WarheadtoCrysis 2.True, the starting point was very high. Unfortunately, the descent has been equally steep.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00503EAG2","description":"eli","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Sorely Predictable, But Incredibly Fun","reviewText":"There is nothing new to be found in \"Modern Warfare 3.\" There are evil Russians, conspiracy theories, and grizzled soldiers protecting freedom. More importantly, there are explosions and extensive use of high-powered weaponry. At no point in this game will you see something you've never seen in other games, outside of perhaps the Eiffel Tower collapsing right in your face (well, Twisted Metal already did that, so never mind). If I were to score this game on originality, it would be a miserable bloody failure.But much like I would never judge a Michael Bay film against something by, say, David Lynch, I'm not going to compare Infinity Ward's latest against other, more original games. Instead, I am going to compare it to other FPS games on the market. By that standard, it is an always-entertaining, cheesy popcorn movie of a game. Much like every Summer must have an explosion-packed action movie with scant substance, every Winter must have a predictable action game with great set pieces and an astoundingly predictable formula. That game is exactly what \"Modern Warfare 3\" is, and in that category, it succeeds.Picking up where \"MW2\" left off, we're put in the shoes of various military members from different governments around the world. They're all tasked with tracking down and killing the elusive Makarov, a sadistic Russian who dabbles in mass genocide and usage of nuclear weapons. Along the way, you must work through approximately half the Big Book o' Action Movie Cliches to reach the villain. Rescuing a president and his daughter? Check. Avenging a dead friend? Check. Realizing that a partner is a traitor, only to realize that he's a traitor for the right reason? Check and check. As mentioned above, this plot is complete filler, and only exists to rationalize the carnage that is occurring around you every second of your experience.What glorious carnage it is, though. Very rarely can I say that a game has no lull in action, but there wasn't a single instant in \"MW3\" where I felt that I was out of immediate danger. Buildings around you are always on the verge of collapsing, lethal enemies always have backup, and for every step you take you can be guaranteed where you're standing will be in pieces within five minutes. This is a true blue, dyed-in-wool action experience, made for those who can't stand games that are more subtle and are paced more slowly. It certainly is fun, and I had a blast in the single player campaign.But even so, the whole experience with the CoD series is beginning to feel a bit tired. Explosions everywhere, bullets whizzing by, formulaic military banter... you know what to expect by now, and it just doesn't feel as fresh as it once did. Much like most critics, if not Hollywood itself, got tired of Michael Bay after a few movies, I fear that Activision's juggernaut is going to soon fall victim to it's own success. By sticking to the same layout in every game, both Infinity Ward and Treyarch have shown that they care more about sales than originality. This year's \"Black Ops 2\", which has already been unofficially announced, offers no light at the end of the tunnel.As games like \"Borderlands\", \"Bulletstorm\", and \"Metro 2033\" have proved, the FPS market is not dead in terms of originality. But the military sub-genre is, and unless one brave developer steps forth, it's going to go the way of the dinosaur soon, and be overtaken by some other genre that the lowest common denominator will adore, and legions of more \"alternative\" gamers will despise. It's just the way the market works.Back on topic, \"MW3\"'s graphics are predictably great. That's to be expected with the type of budget the developers are given to play around with in this series, and I would hazard to say that anybody could produce amazing results with such virtually limitless funds. Every rendering of the major cities that get ravaged in this game is completely accurate, giving off a unique feeling with each new set piece introduced. It's great fun watching as everything blows up around you, giving off a desperate sense of urgency that has always been the series' strongest suit. Even though we've seen the landmarks in \"MW3\" get destroyed in other forms of media before, Infinity Ward definitely has a certain cinematic flair for making it feel engaging and panic-inducing. It's definitely a distinguishing feature in this series to have such catastrophic events happen in gameplay versus cutscenes, and it's what makes this more fun than the rest. If nothing else, this game is a serious looker.Not much can be said about the sound. The soundtrack is exactly what you'd expect from an action-intensive game. An orchestra plays dramatic music when you see a city get destroyed or a landmark fall, guitars wail as your characters get access to heavy weapons and cut through waves of enemies. The music is incredibly forgettable, and the same can honestly be said for the voice talent. While there are some definitely great actors at work here, such as the criminally underrated William Fichtner, they're all delivering such wooden dialogue that it's hard to care about anything they're saying. As for explosions and gunshots... well, they sound like explosions and gunshots. So that's good, I guess?\"Modern Warfare 3\" is not a bad game, nor is it a great game. It hits all of the sweet spots, and I'd be lying if I said there weren't a few moments that made me genuinely excited, such as the submarine level and the final showdown with Makarov. I had fun with every second of it, but much like the aforementioned popcorn movies, I forgot about my experience a day or two after finishing it. It's all style over substance, and while there is a time and place for that, it certainly isn't with games that succeed on a far deeper level such as the \"Uncharted\" or \"Resistance\" series. Activision's biggest hit is starting to show it's battle scars, and sooner than later, it's going to have be honorably discharged.Score: 7.25","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2012"}

Estopinal","summary":"This should be the model for future games","reviewText":"I thought I knew what an open-world game was like before I played Far Cry 3.  I was wrong.  This open-world game is as available to the player as for example, Skyrim.  There is clear character development and I felt like I was accomplishing things as I went through the game.  Not to mention the fantastic gameplay mechanics.  Combat is amazing and can be tailored to whatever style you wish.  The game gives you choices in how to play it, something that is lacking from so many games these days.  Nothing is expected.  I watched an enemy camp get mauled by a bear and while I was gleefully enjoying the carnage, a tiger had come up behind me and was ready to turn me into dinner.  There were certainly frustrating moments, but I always wanted to keep playing because it was always still fun.  I was eager to do things just right.  The story is pretty good, but for me it wasn't the story that kept me going.  It was the sheer awesomeness of the combat.  It was just so fun and so varied.  Stealth kills, run-and-gun kills, and more.  For me the best part was capturing the enemy bases (which unlocks fast-travel points).  Each new base was a new challenge that I'd spend a few minutes on observing, trying to develop the proper tactics and strategy.  I don't know that any other game has made me want to do that.  Something about this game is just so addicting.The only negative that I can come up with is that some of the Path of the Hunter side quests were a little frustrating (hide and seek with an animal essentially).  And vehicle control left something to be desired.  But these are very minor things that do not detract from my overall enjoyment.Final word: Buy this game.  Truly amazing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2013"}

It's rare when a game limited to one genre manages to get everything right. For Grand Theft Auto 3 to assume multiple guises and pull it off with such panache and style is paactically unheard of. Whether it's a third person adventure, a first person shooter or a driving game, you're never in the position of having nothing to do. Not in Liberty City. Shoot bad guys, drive fast cars, pick up hot women, and make big money. You can do it all, baby. Wanna drive a police boat like Crackett and Tubbs? You can do that too. The level of detail in the game is so great, you could spend weeks trying to discover everything. All the familiar Grand Theft Auto staples are back too. THe shady payphones, the pagers and the radio stations are all there, but this time in three lovely dimensions. A game like this could have gotten too big and too ambitious for its own good, but no matter how you choose to spend you time doing odd jobs, or just blowing stuff up, getting back to your primary objectives is always an easy process. If only life were that, simple. Is Grand Theft Auto 3 flawless? Of course not, The game runs a little slow, lacks some polish, and the targeting  system is nothing special. But that's nitpicking considering its accomplishments. No matter how you slice it, Grand Theft Auto 3 is an instant classic that deserves a place on every grown up gamers shelf.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2001"}

David Swan","summary":"Bowser Takes Center Stage","reviewText":"It's almost as assured as the sun rising in the east that a Nintendo product starring Mario will be of the highest quality. Technically this is actually a second party game having been developed by AlphaDream but it remains rock solid both in terms of visuals and gameplay. This time the brothers Mario find themselves miniaturized and swallowed up by Bowser ala the 1966 film Fantastic Voyage. For the first time Bowser takes center stage as a playable character while Mario and Luigi assist him from within. For instance the brothers might give a nerve connected to Bowser's bicep a jolt for a burst of power or pound an enemy to restore Bowser's fiery breath. The same `condition' that caused Bowser to inadvertently inhale the brothers also allows him to suck in enemies so that Mario and Luigi can get in on the battle action. Not that there isn't tons of enemies existing within Bowser to keep the plumbers busy.My one issue with the previous Mario and Luigi was the controls. Besides Mario and Luigi the player would also control their baby counterpart and each of the X/Y/A/B buttons was mapped to a character. Besides that the right shoulder button could be used to switch modes. It was all very confusing and I have to confess that I never felt comfortable using it and even after hours of play would mess up the buttons. Inside Bowser simplifies it somewhat by mapping both X and Y to Bowser but it still doesn't feel as smooth as the rest of the game and you still switch attacks using the right shoulder button. My other issue with Partners in Time was that it was much more linear than Superstar Saga but this isn't nearly as bad in the newest game. Although you can wander a lot more the game makes sure to point out your current goal on the map with a star just so you don't forget of get confused as to what to do next. One ding I gave Brothers In Time was the lack of side quests and although Bowser's Inside Story improves there still aren't a ton. Perhaps my biggest disappointment was the lack of great gear and almost complete absence of badges. Once you get access to badges you pretty much get them all immediately. The gear (Pants, Socks, Shoes etc.) don't really get a whole lot better as the game goes on. Sure you have a slightly wider selection but they really don't have a major impact.The Luigi/Mario franchise has always had a fantastic battle mode. The fights are all about pattern recognition, timing and quick reflexes. I actually found some of the battles surprisingly challenging given the target audience but maybe I'm just losing my lightening reflexes in my old age. The menu system in the game is one of the best I've ever seen and allowed the players to use the stylus to click on character statistics for a brief explanation. Perhaps the crown jewel of the series is the scripting and AlphaDreams continues to maintain its high standards. Having Bowser as the main character adds even more to the humor of the story. My issues with this game are small and I wouldn't hesitate at all to give it five stars and rank it among the best DS games of all time. This is a must have game if for nothing else than the ability to blow into the mic to control Bowser's fiery breath. Now THAT is an experience you don't want to miss.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2009"}

I'm irradiated...","reviewText":"Fallout 3 is absolutely, undeniably, the best first-person RPG I've played to date.  I'll try and break down some reasons why in the following review.  For starters, I'm a game freak: tabletop miniatures, pen-and-paper RPGs, computer games, and console games... I try to give every type of game a chance, but some just don't cut it...GRAPHICS, SOUND, ETC: There's really nothing to say about it... It's breathtaking, scary at times, and full of \"Wow\" moments.  The graphics on the 360 version are mouth-watering, eye-popping amazing.  The sound is engrossing.  I should mention that I run the game at 1080i via HDMI and hooked up to 5.1 surround.  I've tried it at 720p with just my TV stereo sound and I was no less impressed.STORY/THEME: post world war 3; actually, 200 years post world war 3.  You can learn all about the history of this alternate timeline in the game; it is fascinating and creepy.  The story is compelling enough to want to play and play (more than you should), but it is not lead-you-by-the-nose.  Like all true Bethesda RPGs, Fallout lets you make the story.  You can choose which missions to do, or you can choose to just wander around like a freaked out, radiation-infected lunatic.GAMEPLAY: Bethesda improved the game management and interface of Fallout.  I loved Morrowind and Oblivion (Bethesda's previous, fantasy-themed RPGs), but the interface was a bit clunky in those games.  Fallout fixes all the problems, in my opinion, and makes dealing with inventory and stats a breeze.  You'll spend more time sucked into the game world and story then managing your extensive list of weapons, items, etc...VALUE: the game is pricey--as all newer games are--but I would pay $50 for this game because of two thing: (1) this game could be played many, many times through the original story alone; it is unlikely anyone will find every single hidden place, character, or side mission in one pass.  (2) Bethesda has already released relatively inexpensive add-ons that greatly improve the game; a couple of the expansions are almost entirely new games in and of themselves!CONTENT: This game is not--NOT--for kids.  Take the Mature rating very seriously.  There is plenty of foul language, drug use, and sexually suggestive material.  The game is rated for and intended for adults.  Please do not let kids play this game.  I only turn this bad boy on when my kids are in bed for the night--period.EDIT (UPDATED 11/5/10): I can't say enough about this game; 5 stars isn't high enough, let's put it that way.  I've finished all five DLC packs and would gladly pay for 5 more.  160+ hours later and I still love playing this game.  Whether I'm just exploring the wasteland or re-playing the main story with a new character, Fallout never seems to get old.  This is the first game ever that I kept--didn't trade in or give to a buddy.  I've been gaming for 20 years, so that should say something about how awesome this game is!  After trying Fallout: New Vegas, this game is still the best; there's no comparison.  Grab the Game of the Year edition and you'll be occupied for a LONG time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2009"}

The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. The Zapper comes withLink's Crossbow Training, which helps to familiarize the player with the Zapper in a shooting gallery style game.Link's Crossbow Trainingcontains three game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger.Features:Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are sold separately","reviewerName":"All Powerful Wizard Of Oz","summary":"For the price how can you go wrong?","reviewText":"The bottom line is fun. The Wiizapper delivers on this and then some. Boxed with Link's Cross Bow there is no doubt you will get hours of entertainment out of the Zapper and the game it comes with.

If you were lucky enough to pick this up for $19.99 then even better.The game play is simple enough. Point and shoot. The controls and aim work flawless as one might expect using the Zapper with the Wiimote firmly in place.

{"product_name":"B00IIHU44E","description":"","reviewerName":"Nasahr","summary":"Best system / Best experience","reviewText":"The xbox one is an excellent if a misunderstood/sometimes unappreciated system. It's very innovative as well. It's the only gaming system that i could literally leave on for DAYS yes Days at a time and never have any overheating or hardware issues. Try that with anything else.. I've owned mine since January and haven't had a single problem.I don't use the voice commands very much because they don't work very well BUT i love that at the press of a few buttons i could be watching tv then jump home and do something else then jump back to tv without having to switch tv inputs, which is much more convenient than it sounds. Also you could play a game and watch tv at the same time which is useful if you want to listen to CNN or keep score of a game, really the possibilities are endless. If your choosing between a PS4 and this it's more of a preference kind of decision.The PS4 seem's to be a nice gaming system and has slightly more graphical power (but same graphics) but personally i want my video game system to do much more than just video games. The xbox one offers that in spades.Even if you want just video games from your system the xbox is excellent at that as well (i love video games) and the xbox one offers an excellent online gaming and social experience and the controller is the best i've ever experienced (i also own ps2,360,ps3) You could even make phone calls with the xbox using skype by simply speaking in front of the kinet. I actually ordered pizza with it once haha.Overall i would rate the xbox one itself a 9/10. It's a excellent console that just needs more games available to it. The future is bright though for xbox as there are many new games coming out this year for xbox one and many are xbox exclusives. Titanfall is probably the best multiplayer shooter (yes better than cod and bf4) and Titanfall 2 will be released in a couple of years (xbox exclusive as well) and Halo will be coming to xbox one soon. Plus the Microsoft cloud and Microsoft's frequent updates to the xb1 make the possibilities endless. There really is no limit to how far this console can be pushed. Microsoft has big plans for it, in the future.* I strongly suggest getting a TV mount for the Xbox KinetAgain a big part of your decision between PS4 and Xbox one will be based on preference. My advice? if you own a xbox 360 get a xbox one but KEEP your 360 as well. If your not sure the xbox one will be right for you, i recommend you try it out. A lot of these negative reviews scared the crap outta me but i made the leap anyways. The first 3 weeks i really didn't enjoy the xb1 very much but once i got more games and got used to it (yes it takes getting used to) I loved it. After 4 months of ownership i can honestly say i love my xbox one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2014"}

The graphics are the best in any Halo game to date and the newly redesigned sound effects pack some serious oomph into the game. The story is really well done and introduces a whole new set of characters for us to get familiar with. It's interesting to note that when the game starts off, it's simply business as usual with very little to separate it from any of the other games. Then the Prometheans are introduced and the game suddenly becomes something else, a whole other thing entirely. These new enemies are super cool additions to the Halo universe and I look forward to seeing more of them and their variations when the inevitable Halo sequels get released.The campaign itself feels a little shorter than usual but it's completely satisfying throughout and graphically speaking, there are moments that are guaranteed to take your breath away. Multiplayer is as good and solid as ever and Spartan Ops, the new, episodic content that lets you perform missions either solo or with your friends is pretty sweet, especially as you progress further into the missions. The controls are classic Halo so jumping right back in should come as second nature to any seasoned Halo player. Savvy players will notice a few differences here and there such as loadouts and changes to the character customization component but they're changes that only improve the game, not hamper it.If you're a Halo fan, this one is a no-brainer. If you're not, this one comes easily recommended and you don't have to be a Halo geek to enjoy this, you can easily jump right in this one and get whatever background story you don't get from the game from the wikis or the books. The best thing I can say is that any fears of the Halo series being handed off to another developer have been assuaged. Bungie of course will be missed but 343i obviously have a deep love for the franchise and have done remarkable things with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00005ULXN","reviewerName":"Scott Cohen","summary":"Sonic Adventure 2: Battle, a worthy purchase","reviewText":"If you walked up to a Sonic Fan 11 years ago, when Sonic first came out, said you were from the future, and told them that a Sonic game would be on a Nintendo console, they would laugh you out of the room. 10 years later, in 2002, the prophecy game true. Sega has become third party, and a Sonic game did appear on a Nintendo console. Sonic Adventure 2: Battle is a port from the smash hit on the Sega Dreamcast. This game is a blistering hot game that you won't see for a while.I'm not going to bother you with the story of Sonic Adventure 2, because you most likely know it. Dr. Robonotic, also known as Eggman, is trying to follow in his grandfather's footsteps, and finish creating the ultimate device for taking over the world; Shadow. Shadow stole information from the government, and the government mistakes Sonic for Shadow, and Sonic goes to jail. In this game, you want to find Shadow, and set the record straight.In every game, there are it's flaws, and this game has them. This game runs at a blistering fast 60 frames per second (fps) and that is just about as fast as the go today. There are very few hiccups when it drops to 30 for about a second or two, but it kicks back to 60. In this game, just like the Dreamcast version, the camera is a little unruly, and sometimes it goes out of control, making it hard to complete your task. That only happens in a few levels so there is nothing to worry about. This game will make you come back for hours. I have over 50 hours in my game, and I'm still playing it. There is an extremely addictive Chao world mode, that lets you raise a Chao, these cute little blue things. It will remind you of the ill-fated Tamagotchi things. But these are so much better. Chao's grow according to foods you give them. They have certain statistics that need to be trained. Their power, swimming, flying, stamina and running. Giving them their favorite foods, and Chao drives that you find in the levels (those little colored capsules). This may attract you for hours. ... In Sonic Adventure 2, the game lets you bring your Chao on the run. You need to have Sonic Advance to carry it around with you. You can also play without a cartridge. The Gamecube will save some information on the Gameboy Advance's RAM and you can still do the same things you can do with the game, but you cannot save your data, until you transfer it back to your Gamecube. Don't worry, you cannot lose you Chao, it will be saved on your Gamecube, but the information of your Chao will be in the GBA.As in the adventure part of the game, the story is tied in with six different characters, classified by being heroes or dark. The game is based on Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Shadow, Rouge the Bat, and Dr. Robotnik. The game has 30 different action levels, and 150 different missions within the levels. This will take you a long time, if you want to collect all the 180 emblems. A little inside secret, if you collect 180 emblems, there is a secret level, so start collecting! I'm not going to spoil it for you. If you have the Dreamcast version, you are going to miss out on the excellent multiplayer modes. There are even more games than the Dreamcast. If you also have the Dreamcast, and the modem you can go to a website, and download a complete file, and check out the level. Have a good time playing Sonic!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2002"}

The main reasons I didn't want to buy one was because everytime Nintendo releases a handheld, they release another in 6 months - to a year and your old handheld is useless as is out of date. A huge rip off if you bought it full price just before the next instalment was released.This is Nintendo's first 3D console, the reason why I love it compared to the rest which are all for Platform games (like the Gameboy, etc.)The graphic engine is nowhere near as good as the PSP's but the Nintendo DS is roughly the same graphics ability as the old Nintendo 64.I got my DS along witht he Mario Kart Bundle, and I was upset to find I could only have a Silver. I really wanted a Blue but there was nothing I could do.One of the positive points about the Nintendo DS is the Mario Series. Its why I love Nintendo so much and it's a shame they probably won't release Banjo-Kazooie or other classics like that on the handheld because of damn xbox.Other things I love is the touch screen but you really do need to get a protective screen to keep it clean and dirt free, otherwise it makes your Nintendo DS look horrid.Unlike the PSP, the Nintendo DS allows you to go into chat rooms and write messages with your stylus (the NDS pen) or type them in English, Japanese or a select few other languages. It helps if your friends have DS's and not PSP ;POverall I think the DS is a fun little handheld, and knowing my luck another will be released in a few months and it'll be the same old thing with Nintendo. But I highly recommended the Nintendo DS to any old fans of the Mario Games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2006"}

The storyline is extremely well-written and strange. From it spawns many bloody times and exceptionally odd happenings. If you consider a doll house haunted by a possessed doll who wrote, in blood, on the wall \"help me\" and \"play with me\" many times strange, this title certainly fits your definition of the term.The graphics are nothing spactacular, though when was this ever a major concern of the the hardcore? Battles tend to be a little on the boring side, but the unique judgement ring approach (a spinning stick in a ring that requires timing to execute attacks, magic, and items) keeps things interesting.This game should be given a chance for at least 7 hours. I found it quite boring in the first 5 but it heated up considerably after this amount of time. So much that I couldn't put the controller down, I was hooked. That right there speaks volumes about a game; any game that has the hooking quality is a winner in my book.A large part of this hooking was definitely the music. This game has some of the best music that I've ever heard. I actually imported the soundtrack (my only time) because I liked it so much. The second half of the game has the better music, so this also explains my latter enjoyment.If you want an offbeat storyline complemented by a strange system of battle and off-the-wall monster design, Shadow Hearts is an excellent choice.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00005MI42","description":"Some things never change and for us, that's good news. For example, Mario's archrival, Wario he's looking good on the Game Boy Advance, but he's still the same money-crazed hooligan who starred in some of the greatest handheld platformers of all time. This time around, the story of a golden pyramid is enough to send the big blowhard racing off to the nearest jungle. Sure enough he finds the big brick triangle, but before he can collect the loot he'll have to undergo a brain- and body-bending series of challenges. Four guardians stand jealously over the four sections of the pyramid. Wario will either have to defeat each guardian or activate a switch and escape before time runs out. No longer invincible, Wario will have to replenish his health meter by gathering pieces of heart. Wario will have to undergo even more dramatic transformations before the big showdown with the head honcho of the golden pyramid.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"Warioland 4 for GBA","reviewText":"The Warioland series has been very popular for Nintendo since the original Game Boy days. In 2001, Nintendo released Warioland 4 on the Game Boy Advance as one of the first games for that system. And what a game it is: a side scroller, action adventure romp where he looks for treasure once again. You control Wario as he explores a pyramid with different sections and stages. The goal for each stage is to find a key and escape the stage to open up others areas. Along the way, you can collect all kinds of treasure while picking up (or buying) power ups to defeat enemies and/or assist you in getting through the stage. You can find scattered CDs to open up the sound room and listen to various music tracks and you also open up mini games to play as you complete stages.The PROS: The game is very challenging but not to the point of frustration. Every stage is a puzzle in which you have to figure out how to reach the key and then escape before your time is up. Everything from the presentation, graphics and sounds fit the outrageous antics of Wario as he does what he does best: plunder for coins and treasure. With more then 20 stages to explore, this game will keep you busy as you find everything while having fun at the same time. And when you are done with the stages, you can play mini games to get power ups or extra lives.The CONS: This would have been a fun multiplayer title but sadly that didn't make it into this fun. This is solely a 1 player romp but the game can store up to 2 saves so other people can play and save their progress without touching your saved game. Other than that, there aren't any flaws.This is one of the best games to get for the GBA so grab yourself a copy anyway you can. It's challenging but not hard to make you quit, looks and plays great and will keep you busy for awhile (especially if you want to reach the 100% completion status.) I highly recommend this title so it should be in your GBA collection ASAP.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}

House of the Dead: Overkill plays more on the great HotD series that starting back in the early 90's in the arcades. You play as Agent G with his foul-mouthed partner Isaac Washington (yes he's black!) as you figure out why zombies are plaguing the US. While the story is hilarious, vulgar, rude, and completely dirty there are tons of funny voice acting and dialog to enjoy. The characters are played out very well and you get pretty attached early on (there's only about 8 levels or so) along with the major hottie Varla Gunns.The game plays like a typical on rails FPS where the game controls where you move and you just worry about shooting. The game has many locales from jails, to hospitals, to swamps, to theme parks so you won't get bored one little bit. There are many guns to buy and upgrade along with some great unlockables for beating the game. While you wondering through levels there are a few temp upgrades you can shoot (I wish there were more), such as health, grenades, green blobs that slow down time for a little while, and gold brains. Yes, collect all these brains and you unlock artwork, videos, etc. Now upgrading your weapons is mandatory such as less recoil, clip size, damage, the whole nine yards. You can have up to two weapons equipped and switching back and forth between these two is a great strategy when you have too many zombies to deal with. You start off the game with a pistol and if you save up your money (more on how later) you can buy more weapons. Buying a shotgun first is great since you use all your rounds to clear most of the zombies out and then switch to your pistol to finish off stubborn stragglers.One great thing about OK is that it NEVER gets too frustrating. When you die you start off right where you were with no continues...of course you take a score hit, but people who don't care about this won't break their Wiimotes in anger. The levels are just the right length taking about 10-15 minutes to complete with super fun boss fights. Each boss will have their weak point circled in red and all you have to do is shoot whatever projectile they fire at you and keep on them. The bosses are disgusting, grotesque, and very funny looking. You're probably all this is great, but there's more!MULTIPLAYER MAN!! That's the best ever...while it's the same as single player having someone help you can always be fun. Now, if you beat the game you get the director's cut (I won't say what it is!!) along with being able to dual wield weapons...yes it's sweet, super fun, and adds lots of replay value. Wouldn't that make the game too easy you say? Well use the \"Extra Mutants\" tweak before each level and you have an extra challenge. Sadly, there is no online play, but hopefully a future HotD will have it. I HIGHLY recommend this super fun game to any adult who has dust collecting on their Wii.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00020V4N0","reviewerName":"Enlightened \"Both Eyes Closed, see what u don...","summary":"Holler If Ya Hear Me","reviewText":"I've been playing this year's version of Madden nonstop for about two months now and indeed it is a very great game.  Everyone already knows this.  But this review is for me to rant my dislikes of the game.  Although the defense has been completely revamped sometimes it seems as if the game is cheating.  Let me explain...the linebackers in this game are among the greatest ever.  They blanket fast wide receivers, cut on a dime, have DB like motions, excellent hand eye coordination, read routes in zone all dat, tackle everything etc.  But it gets to the point where they are breaking on outs WAY WAY TOO FAST.  They'll get out there and cover the out route on a receiver like they were Deion Sanders.  Sometimes they'll run the route for the receiver even breaking at the same time or even before the receiver does.  Ok that's not that unrealistic but then they won't JUST knock it down, they'll cut the corner (like they have DB speed!) jump ten feet in the air and pick it off.  And when they catch they're already 5 yards away from the reciever!  Sometimes I had a LB cover my slot receiver on a fly with no safety help and a play action.  Unrealistic.  That's strictly for the DB's.  And when you do run it the lb's are in the backfield before you can hand it off but when you pass they all in the passing lanes.And speaking of Dbs, their play is amazing.  DB's break on the ball incredibly fast...not unrealistic yet...but when you throw in a pump fake they don't even bite...and if you think you have your receiver open deep?  Forget about it...no matter the speed of your receiver the DB is always running step for step and they will, while runnin full speed trying to keep up, jump a 45 inch vertical flail around and knock the ball ( 100% of the time is underthrown by a human) down in single coverage.  If it is a safety overtop forget about it because he's never late breaking to that and almost always will knock it down or pick it off no matter if there's a post coming at him.  And if you do throw the post he's all over that as well knocking it down.And another thing when it's pass the D Line handles your o line tossing them around like ragdolls penetrating 3 yards in the backfield as soon as the ball is snapped forcing you to throw quick or scramble.  And if they blitz outside expect your tackle to be dumber than a box of rocks and let NOT ONLY ONE BUT TWO defenders run right by him and won't even attempt to lunge or nothing and let them kill my qb all game.  One thing that has been left out is that forward motion of the arm when the QB is hit and fumbles.  If your QB gets hit while throwing it's almost always ruled a fumble and they scoop it up score.  Your O Line, knowing that they let somebody through, won't come back and try to block the man so when it is a fumble they don't even know what's going on.  One time I got sacked and fumbled, ball was on the ground for like 2 or 3 seconds and not one O linemen turned around.  The QB was just laying there like a fool and didn't even attempt to get the ball back knowing that he just dropped it.  At least try to trip em up or something.  And guess what they ended up running for a touchdown. And when you do throw the whole secondary and LB's show up for the tackle..swarming.  If the computer gets hit while throwing the pass will still be completed 80% of the time.  No break on the ball by your DB.This wouldn't be so bad if your team did the same thing.  But unfortunately they do not.  You wanna man up a receiver with Chris McCallister?  No way.  Try to bump that receiver and he gives my CB a move and more often than not catches a slant or he gets beat deep even with the safety over the top he outruns everyone.  If you Try to manually control the CB and do as the computer does and jump ten feet high, and they'll just put their hand up still allowing them to catch it.  Sometimes they go up to bump a receiver and the receiver runs right around them.  That's not that bad...you can't get hands on them every play but the separation is like 5 or 6 yards when they miss and the computer ALWAYS hits the man that misses the bump.  It's crazy.  Playing regular man with no variation causes your corner back to get torched underneath but they are pretty good at not getting beat deep.  Playing off man is death unless they got a long way to go in a very short period of time.  So man isn't working let's go to a zone.Zone coverages more often than not work.  But if you get a play action expect your cover 3 corner to commit the number one cardinal rule in defensive back history; he'll get beat deep in cover 3.  Doesn't matter how fast your CB is the WR will eat up his cushion and will be next to him before he even turns to run and by that time the WR is already by him.  The safety done bit on something and the computer more often than not throws a perfect pass right over the WR's shoulders catching it in full stride and making your CB look stupid.  I've had this happen to me numerous times with like 10 seconds to go in the half, and they score on that BS.  Part of the reason your DB's and LB's don't break on the ball like the computer's is because the D Line is gettin mudded every play.  Their O line will pick up every blitz on all madden and will sometimes even pancake the blitzer and go pick up someone else. On the run they're pushing the line of scrimmage up three yards at the snap of the ball.  I mean they are getting blown off the ball...no penetration.And if you think your LB's will look up receivers and jump routes forget it.  You selling yourself wolf tickets.  They will let a WR run through three zones across the field and catch the ball right in front of them.  They usually drop to certain depths so when there's no underneath threat shouldn't they be looking for the deep in as the computer does?  Well...they SHOULD.  I find the computer catching 16 yard routes that would more often than not get PICKED when I run the same play.  And again no break on ball by safeties.  And in cover 2 the WR will run a 7 route and the safety won't move off the hash!  What's going on?!?!  Even with all that the game is very fun to play.  I can't put it down...even though the game cheats it doesn't cheat so much to make you wanna throw a controller if ya feel me.  I mean they'll do a play and you'll think to yourself \"The game is cheating!\" , but then you realize in the NFL people make spectacular plays or screw up and blow a coverage every now & then and the offense happens to exploit it, or they miss tackles.  Or they watched that film and they know that route and that reciever's tendencies.  So all in all...Madden is still madden...great gameplay, franchise mode, and head to head competition.  Fluid controls and good animations and graphics.  To me, it's better than ESPN football but hey that's just one man's opinion.*****additions******DB's break on the ball TOO FREAKING FAST!!!!!!!! One time I had a fly route and a post corner on the same side and the DB, with his back turned, somehow with his spidey-sense, sensed that the ball was being thrown to the post corner. He stopped on a dime, left the man he was guarding broke on the post corner and picked it off...almost took it to the crib. and the DB wasn't no Chris McCalister or Champ Bailey or Deion Sanders or Patrick Surtain or Will Allen...it was just some nobody. Everything is knocked down or picked off even when it's completely apparent that the receiver is open. DB's on deep balls jump (on time) before they even turn their head around and even before the reciever jumps and knocks the ball down. On top of that your receiver rarely even jumps...he just puts his hand up like the ball will magically fall into his hands. Even when you manually take control of the reciever the DB out jumps him while running full speed and not even looking at the ball. I've played cornerback and I know that you CANNOT jump that high unless you stop and plant and at least have an idea on where the ball is. You can't run full speed, jump ten feet in the air without looking for the ball AND knock it down 90% of the time and you don't even see the ball. You just can't do it. When have you ever seen a cornerback just out jump a receiver while looking at the ball let alone while he's trying to catch up to the receiver? That's right never. But when the computer throws a fade on your guy he doesn't even put his hand up and gets burnt on a straight fly and the receiver is not Moss. When have you seen man to man CB just simply get ran right past and burnt by five yards by a WR who is not faster or better than him? That's what happened to me. Chris McCalister on Hines Ward...he should be locked down. QB throwing perfect passes. Linebackers freakin manned up with a reciever (with no safety help overtop) on the post corner and jump 1000 feet in the air and break up the pass. And to make it so bad the QB underthrows it even when you step into the throw and the blitz is minimal.And speaking of blitzing...I may blitz seven people and just so happens everyone gets picked up. Once I blitzed 7, and the QB had time to PUMP FAKE and still get the throw off and complete the pass! What is that? But the computer might blitz three or four and the tackle won't even attempt to lunge at the Defensive End... it's really pitiful sometimes. And on running plays often not one but two blockers will run right by the guy that makes the tackle like they didn't even see him and on stretch plays the MLB will run right through the A gap untouched and tackle me the same time I get the ball (more than a couple times a game). I was playing the Steelers on all madden on 15 minute quarters to learn a new playbook and in the first quarter I was sacked 12 times and threw 6 interceptions and they had 6 tackles for loss. Jamal Lewis had like 90 yards on 15 carries and they still didn't even bite on the play action. That's just BS. And speaking of BS...how does a corner playing man to man bite on a play action? Someone please enlighten me. And on a play action how is my RB gettin tackled 8 yards down the field and no Pass Interference is called? And out routes are pretty much useless because the defensive players break on the ball too fast. Once I was on the goaline and ran a play action pass to Todd Heap, and the Steelers fourth string defensive end dropped in coverage but bit on the play action. Clearly beat, I lob the ball to Todd Heap in the corner of the endzone and amazingly the fourth string D. End ( rating is like 70) jumps off one foot and knocks a fade down in the corner of the endzone. That's when I just turned the game off. It made me mad to no end (it was fourth down!) yall wouldn't understand how mad that made me---cursing at the tv and everything! (This was today by the way) And when you do finally deliver the ball what do they do? They drop it (most likely a first down pass)! Most of the time without getting hit. But Burress comes through on a slant and stiff arms Ray Lewis and drags Boulware three yards down the field. WTF?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? They had Duce Staley break THREE yes THREE hit sticks in one play from first Ray Lewis (impossible!), then Ed Reed (a pro bowler), THEN anthony weaver and was finally ankle tackled by willie Demps. Sorry but Duce staley is not that good anymore.And speaking of broken tackles...expect at least one person on your kickoff team to miss a tackle and everybody else get blocked. But when they kickoff to you, your lone returner is left to fend off five defenders cus nobody on your team tried to block. And if they do happen to block and all you need is that one missed tackle...forget it your guy's goin down. In all my games of Madden 05 I have returned not ONE kickoff or punt (against the computer). I can barely average 18 yards a return. That's unnrealistic. I'll still play the game tomorrow though...what a game what a game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2004"}

There are two halves to this story.  First, there is a generic JRPG story - kill the bad guy, save the world.  Second, there is a philosophical analysis and statement on the main character's situation (he is stuck in his own dream).  Dealing with controversial topics like reality, war, politics, evil, activism/motivation, and suicide, I loved the story in this game.  It was touching, and exciting.Additionally, there are history lessons about Chopin's (famous pianist, who plays the main character in this game) life thrown into it, which always relate to the story.The characters behave fairly realistically, which improved the story.The graphics are pleasant, smooth, and just adorable.  This is by far one of the cutest JRPGs I've played.  The style of the world is consistent and has a very anime feel.The game's action all occurs in static battlefields, initiated by encountering enemies that roam the areas freely.  The battle system was really exciting, and well balanced.  Regular enemies weren't too easy, and bosses were challenging.  For a predetermined amount of time your characters are able to attack, and use skills and items in real time.  Each character takes a turn based on their speed.  Half the fun of battles was trying new skills and strategies.  Players can do some really fascinating combos and skills if they wish to, which is great!The gameplay consists of towns, dungeons, and of course battles.  Towns have decent exploration.  Dungeons are linear enough to explore all of it, but nonlinear enough to cause you some backtracking (if you choose).  My only complaint here is that some dungeons are too long, causing a some boredom.My only other complaint is that sometimes objectives aren't well explained.  Often I found myself clueless where to go, although it's not too hard to figure it out yourself.It's a strong game, though a bit long and tedious.  I really enjoyed it.  There is extra content, but I don't think I'd replay it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2008"}

It takes everything the original put into the series, and enhances it. The controls are more precise, smooth and convenient (with the addition of a single button health and stasis refill system), the visuals are even more detailed and gritty, the sound is as creepy as ever, and the story remains intriguing and intense.

Not only do you get to enjoy fun levels to play, both in the game and online, but you can make your own levels to share as well!To begin with, the game is a straightforward platform-type game. You're a cute little sack-creature that you can customize almost infinitely.  You move along through their pre-set levels, hopping on stairs, pulling levers, turning gears, and solving puzzles.The game would be fun enough if that was the entire purpose of the game. However, that's just the beginning. The game comes with a very well done level editor so that you can create levels of your own! Let's say this sounds too complicated to you. Not to fear - you can spend years playing levels *other* people have developed and put online. There are incredibly fun levels to immerse yourself into. I'm particularly fond of a Godzilla themed one!Once you've gotten the hang of the game both with the built in levels and the online ones, you might want to venture into the world of designing your own levels. The ability to customize is just phenomenal. Fill it with pink cupcakes and floating butterflies. Create a dark world with gears and spikes. Whatever your vision is, you can make a world to match your dreams. Then you can put it online - if you wish - and share your vision with everyone else!The level creator comes with a very in depth set of tutorials so that you can learn the steps one at a time. You take it at your own pace and build up your own skills.I really don't see any down sides here. If all you want to do is hop around in a fun platformer, you can do that. If you want to have an endless supply of new levels to poke around in, you've got access to that. If you want to play online with friends, you can do that. And if you've got the urge to create your own racing games, platform games, or just silly worlds to hang out in, you can do that too!I suppose if you're a blood-and-guts war gamer, you might find this a little cutesy for your taste. So you do have to appreciate the soft-fuzzy atmosphere here. However, with that being said, I think the game really does appeal to just about everyone!Rating: 10/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2011"}

Setting it up was a little confusing as the instructions aren't that detailed.  It's a little heavy, so it's not the easiest thing to move around.  Plus, storing the thing isn't the easiest thing either because it's a bit bigger than some of the other drum kits by Harmonics.  Also, trying to fold the thing down takes a while because you have to unscrew everything all the way to get the pads and cymbals to go all the way down.Hitting the pads and cymbals works well as it's pretty responsive.  Everything's adjustable (not easily though).  It looks nicer than some of the cheaper drum kits for Guitar Hero and Rock Band, but I don't know if I'd recommend spending the extra bucks for this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2009"}

Cloaked in stealth, you will move unseen through crowds, travel stories above the peasant herds on which you feed--leaping from rooftop to rooftop--and use mind control to overcome vampire-proof inventions. The combat choreography unfolds with dancelike precision as Kain engages armies of demons and humans alike. The comprehensive menu of unstoppable attacks, nimble combos, and special moves are designed to appeal to even the most jaded of fighting-game fans. The world that Kain moves through is a lushly detailed gothic environment that is not only gorgeous to the eye, but also alive with the soon-to-be-dead. The AI behavioral response makes peasants and enemies variously flee, take up arms, or remain unaware as Kain moves through crowds or charges, sword raised, into open areas.","reviewerName":"dark54555 \"dark54555\"","summary":"Great story hindered by AWFUL controls and HORRIBLE glitches","reviewText":"Eidos really dropped the ball here, folks.  As usual the story is great, although there are a few notable inconsistancies that will hopefully be explained in the next game.  However, the poor controls and obvious lack of beta testing kill this game.  First, to attack you have to target an enemy.  Usually not a problem, but while targeting, you cannot jump. You can also only dodge left-right, not back or jumping.  Second, while sucking blood, you're stuck in the equivalent of a very repetitive cutscene, where you are still vulnerable to attack though can do nothing to avoid the blow.  Third, if you die, you have to watch any cutscenes between you and the last checkpoint over again, no way to skip them.As for glitches, there are hundreds if not more.  Clipping is horrible, people fall through walls.  Not a problem, unless you wanted their weapon.  Well into the game, many people, myself included, lose the ability to save, by either getting a Save Failed message or a corrupt new file, which has led to a few people having to start over.  As much as I love the story, this hardly seems worth the hassle and frustration of playing a game Eidos and Crystal Dynamics failed so horrifically on.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00005ME7X","description":"Originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System,Dragon  Warrior IIIis a Game Boy Color port of one of the all-time classic  role-playing games. The game reunites two of Japan's greatest RPG talents in Yuji  Horii (story and game) and Akira Toriyama (character design). Toriyama is also  known as the creator of the immensely popular Dragon Ball cartoons and comics. A  prequel to the first two games in the series,DWIIIcasts you as the  child of a great hero who must defeat an evil demon. New additions to the port  include improved graphics, new minigames, new items, and a better translation of  the original Japanese dialogue.The game starts off with a personality test that loosely determines how other  characters will react to you. Gameplay is standard RPG fare: exploring, building  experience levels, acquiring allies, gaining weapons, and ultimately going after  a large monster. There are some interesting minigames to mix things up. The  Monster Medals feature adds a collectible aspect to the game. Monsters may leave  medals behind after you defeat them. Some monsters only appear during certain  times of the day. Getting all the medals unlocks a secret dungeon. You can trade  medals via link cable to make things easier. Most RPG fans will love this game,  but those raised on modern RPGs might find its combat a bit tedious. This game  is compatible with Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance only.--Raymond M.

She plays the Lego games and a couple other older PS2 games for her age group. Well, she loved it so then it was my turn with her at my side to show me the ropes. As everyone has noted the HD graphics are as good as watching any of the movies in 1080p. All the character voices are there too. The game is huge with tons of missions divided into separate maps. As you complete more missions, you get access to more missions and areas of the map along with unlocking items you can buy with your gold. There are helpers along the way in that you can activate an arrow to guide you on your current mission. Some missions are a little harder then others, but all are pretty doable. One mission is to rescue the miner's donkey who is on top of this mountain that has all kind of broken railroad tracks, etc.. leading to the top. I said, wow that looks hard and my daughter said, no its easy dad. lol. Driving cars can be an issue. My daughter struggles with them. Its not impossible, but harder then it should be. In all a fun game that has a ton of fun little missions to fulfill along with other neat aspects such as buying toys with your gold, awaiting their arrival in a big box, meeting new people, and watching the awesome construction of your new buildings.

Fantastic for Vita, too. 2 games in 1.","reviewText":"My review is mainly for the Vita version, though I'm sure the PS3 version is great, too.You know how sometimes when they remaster or port games, the remake often ends up sucking horribly and ruining the game? Or, it just doesn't really add much and ends up not being worth the cost?Well, this is neither of those. This remake is FANTASTIC. It is very high quality - HD visuals, improved interface and tutorials, upgraded music, high audio quality, extra features, and it's TWO full games for the price of one regular Vita game. For the Vita version, a big benefit is that you can play this on a portable device (unless you hate using them) and easily wear headphones for a more immersive experience.If you've never played these games before, get this. You won't regret it. If you have played them before, I would still advise getting it. It will be a very nostalgic experience with improvements over the originals. I don't even like FFX-2 but I still think it's worth it just for FFX.

{"product_name":"B007XYBUBE","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Fig.","summary":"Great Start For The Series. (Vita Game Download & Cross Play Instructions Below.)","reviewText":"I, like many of you, when first heard about this game, inmediately thought \"Mash Bros\", and so I had my doubts. And honestly speaking, the main reason I pre-ordered the game was the free Vita version...but all my doubts are now put to rest, this is a game that deserves a 5 star rating and well deserved.For starters, the game comes with a great roster, which includes:KratosParappaFat PrincessSweet ToothRadecSly CooperNathan DrakeHeihachiDanteBig DaddyJakRatchetNarikoColeEvil ColeRaidenSack BoySir DanielSpikeToroThe game comes with different modes that include, Solo Play, Tournament, Versus Match and character customization and extras. Stages are fully active, they come packed with hazards, items and explosions, some of which can really hurt you and your oponents. Each character has 3 stages of \"special moves\" which can be used, once the special move meter is full. Once full, you simply press the R2 button and the character will engage his/her special move. Each special move stage has its unique set of skills and will vary in power, 3 being the strongest of course.Graphics:Very sharp and bright with plenty of interactive arenas. Each stage/arena belongs to each of the characters game locations, for example, a flying cargo plane (Drake), God Of War, etc. Each level has been carefully detailed and playing is not only fun, but there's eye candy and plenty of it. Each character has also been done with great attention to detail, from sack boy to sly cooper to Raiden, all look well done. Explosions and other effects look great and will not disappoint.Sound:Again, each stage has sounds from each franchise. I personally like Uncharted's classic orchestra style and God Of War's dramatic score. Character voices are original and their sound effects, from weapons to special moves, sound great; even during heavy battles, you'll be able to hear each effect, music and other stage related sounds with detail and plenty of punch.Performance:I was afraid to run into frame rate issues, but thankfully, this isn't the case. Even with a full roster on screen at once, the game perfornmed impecably. There was no lag during online play or choppiness during local and single play. I tested the game with a full roster on a stage with plenty of action, such as background effects and incoming hazards; the game did not skip a beat.Multiplayer:Simply put. FUN with NO LAG. Both local and online, the MP section is flawless, connections are easily stablished and maintain a lag free performance. Up to 4 players at once, both off/on line. At first, each fight will seem a bit chaotic, but once you learn the basics, each fight will become more interesting, as you will be thinking of ways to fill up your special move meter or simply finding ways to hurt your oponents with style ;)Cross Play Multiplayer:I tested it and have not complaints. I was able to battle against PS Vita/PS3 opponents without any issues. Connections are smooth and easy to stablish. I noticed both systems were in perfect sync, each fighter's move translated into an accurate action on the screen, it was 100% real time action. More about cross play below****Controls:Easy to pick up and learn. You'll be given the option to play a \"tutorial\" the first time (one time only) you start the game and even though the game is extremely easy to play, I recommend playing the tutorial, so you can familiarize yourself with each button. Pulling combos will take some practice, but are easily done once you get the hang of it. I have no complaints about the controls and neither will you.In conclusion, if you're still on the fence about this game, let me put your mind at ease and tell you that this game delivers, it is FUN to play, specially with other players, the more the better; you will probably spend a lot of time on this game off and online and its replay value is extremely high. A great party game that can acomodate those whom just want a quick, fun fighting game and those whom like more technical fighting, such as combos, etc. No matter what your aproach is, this game is without a doubt, a great start for the series.********************************************************************************************************************VITA GAME DOWNLOAD:PS Vita Code: THE FREE VITA GAME CAN ONLY BE LINKED TO ONE PS3 DISC ACCOUNT. THERE'S NOT CODE TO ENTER OR GIVE AWAY.The game includes a free copy of the Vita version, but it doesn't come with a code nor will it give you one, here's what you do:Insert disc into your PS3Navigate to the game menu on your PS3 dashboard.There you will see 3 disc icons for the game.Select the second icon for \"disc benefits\"You will be taken to the sub menuChoose the cross buy option.Once you've done that, you will be taken to the PSN store, where you will add the vita version into your cart. The price will be $0. Check out and it will be on your download list.Log in to PS Store from your Vita, go to your download list.You will see the game, plus its online pass.Download and you're done.If you don't have a PSN acount, you will need to create one in order to download the Vita game.***************************************************************************************************************CROSS-PLAY INSTRUCTIONS:Please do not get confused with cross and remote play. Remote play connects YOUR vita to YOUR PS3 to be able to navigate and play game discs on your PS3 from your Vita (not all discs work). Anyway, Cross Play works by sending friends \"game invitations\", but there has to be a copy of the game on each system (PS3 & Vita), here's how:From PS3:- Versus Mode-Press R2, Invite Friends.-Select the friend whom is playing on his Vita-A message will pop up on your friend's Vita showing your gaming invite-Once he accepts, he will then apear on as player 2.-You're done! Battle and enjoy.From PS Vita:-Versus Mode-WiFi-Make sure you're connected to PSN by touching the upper right hand corner, you'll be taken to a sub menu, there you will either see \"sign in\" (connect if you do) or view invites/invite friends.-Select \"Invite\" and your friends list will apear, select him/her-PS3 player will get an invite message-Once they accept, you can battle together.FINAL NOTE ABOUT CROSS PLAY....I'm sure you want to give this a try right away, with your own Vita, don't worry, it's actually quite simple, create another PSN account for yourself, but remember that you will need another email address....to avoid confusion and headaches when creating another PSN acount, simply add a number to your actual PSN account when creating the extra one...example, your current PSN account is \"PLAYER\" make the new account \"PLAYER2\"Hope this helps.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"Cool Chris \"Cool C\"","summary":"Well worth it - no regrets","reviewText":"First off, I think anyone who read these reviews could easily identify which reviews are fake - they are all those 1 star reviews posted by PS4 fanboys with no substance.  Just wish that Amazon could find ways to weed them out so consumers can actually understand the greatness of XB1.As a disclosure, I am not Amazon verified customer for XB1 - I bought my XB1 - day one directly from Microsoft.  I received my XB1 on Friday, November 22, end of day and my kids were anxiously waited for it until UPS knoced on our door.TV Intergration - 5 starXBOX right out of the box was designed to integrate TV with it.  I was able to use XBOX to control my TV and DirecTV without any problem.  Setting up was quick and easy.  The most amazing part is I have an old TV and XBOX has no trouble recognizing it.  The best part of the TV integration is the SNAP feature.  While it is cool to be able to SNAP the TV, hearing it could be a whole different story if you have two separate audito channels coming out of the TV.Display - 4 starAs I indicated above, I have an old TV and it is starting to crapping out so I can't really measure the TV output.  Our initial review is great.  I don't see any drop framerate or any stuttering when snapping the tv.Creating Profiles - 5 starOne of the greatest improvement of XB1 over XB 360 is it allows user to create multiple profiles using just 1 gold account.  My kids wanted to track their achievements, but the XB 360 only can use one gamertag per account.  We were able to set 3 extra profiles relatively easy.  This is one of the important improvements of XB1.Signing in using Kinect - 4 starKinect is able to recognize everyone of us and sign us in.  The real challenge is on home screen it won't sign in the profiles of the user it sees unless you instruct it to change home screen.  It is understandable because Kinect has a wide range of view and it will only change home screen only if instructed.  One of the most amazing, or could be annoying, thing is Kinect saw my daughter in a room (she is a minor) and would not allow me to turn on YouTube is I give XBOX the permission.  Wish that XBOX is able to recognize that there is an adult in the room and the restrictions are removed automatically.Voice recognition using Kinect - 3 starThere are times we need to yell for Kinect to understand.  With practice, I'm sure the voice recognition will improve.  The trick is don't treat Kinect like a robot.  When I give a command in a normal voice, Kinect is able to execute the command.  When my son talks to it in words, Kinect actually takes longer to process.Gesture control using Kinect - 3 startThe new control should be easier, but I have yet to see this case.  Raising my hand will initiate the gesture control but Kinect has a hard time tracking my hand.  Hopefully this will improve over time.Interface - 4 starThe interface could be a lot better.  There are menus and sub-menus that we need to learn.  It is not as bad as some of the reviews I've seen.  Once we learn where to go, it becomes a second nature.  The app does not show all the available app in the store.  You need to search it and the app (in this case Amazon Instant Video) will show as an option.Privacy - 3 starLike FB, privacy of XB1 is quite confusing.  There are times that I couldn't understand what is the right option.  As of today, I have not figure out how to limit Kinect video monitoring or remove some part of the sharing with friends.YouTube, Amazon App - 5 starBoth of these apps ran without any trouble.  I was able to login and start using both of them.  YouTube allow linking Xbox and table/phone app.  Any videos you searched on your tablet can be easily shown on XB1 instantly.Gameplay - 4 starAt launch time, there are not that many games to play.  We did get the Need for Speed Rival from Amazon.  Our disk drive works fine (I guess we are the lucky).  Inserting the disk would not launch the game automatically.  Once we initiate it, it needs to be installed to XBox 1.  We can't play the game on install.  We actually needs to wait a few minutes (close to 80% progress) before XBox allows us to play the game.  The controller is amazing and there is no lag.  The game framerate looks fine without stuttering.  Because this is game specific, loading of NFS is slow.  Hopefully subsequent games could be amazing.For all its worth, I would give XB1 a 4 star, but considering the potential that XBOX can offer I decided to give it a 5 star.  A lot of people do not like the Kinect to be included in the package, but as one article I read cleary explains it very well.  Now that Xbox has a large install base of gestrue control, developers now have the incentives to use this as part of their game design.  Unlike PS4, this option would never cross game developers mine.  For this reason, XBOX is one generation over PS4.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00005N7YR","reviewerName":"D. Mok","summary":"Excellent game, very addictive.","reviewText":"Medal of Honor:  Allied Assault must be held up to a higher standard than most games.  For the original Medal of Honor on Playstation and especially its superlative sequel, Medal of Honor Underground had set the bar incredibly high.  And though Allied Assault has some flaws, it is overall a really engaging game.First, let's get the gripes out of the way.  I'd have to say the story elements in the PSX Medal of Honor games were stronger.  Allied Assault still uses real historical situations to ground its levels and that remains as effective as ever, but some of the missions are so long and varied that the central goal becomes obscured.  Reloading takes much, much longer than it did before and though you may argue for realism, given the one-against-many scenarios in this kind of game, I think it's a bit too punishing.  One last problem is that the level design suffers from the same flaws as in Medal of Honor -- sometimes the exit to another part of a level is so obscured that you could end up walking back and forth many times before you find there's actually a door in the wall.  Finally, some parts of the missions (like Syphon Filter) are based on previous familiarity:  For example, I stepped on landmines about two dozen times during the assault on Omaha beach, but there's no indication of where the mines are, so you're relegated to trial-and-error -- always a bummer.  This problem is corrected in a later level, the destruction of the Nebelswerf rockets, where &quot;Minen!&quot; signs clue you in.Now, the good parts:  I was hesitant to buy this game because of the prospect of playing with a keyboard and mouse, but I picked up the control scheme very quickly.  Aside from the ability to customize controls (way to go!), even the default settings are highly intuitive.  The ability to save games saves you countless hours of frustrated replaying (especially essential since some of these levels are really, really hard).  The pacing is tight as a drum, and the sound and music work are without peer.  The ability to pause the game and go to system menu is simple yet indispensable.  And although the size and difficulty of the levels makes for some confusion, it also gives you more hours of gameplay.Not as good as Medal of Honor Underground (&quot;Mike Powell&quot;, the lead character here, is nowhere near as fun to play or developed as Manon Batiste), but still well worthy of my full recommendation.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2002"}

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

That's all i'm gonna say about the story, since there are so many twists. The sneaking behind walls is great, and so is the 1st person view.

I knew that was the thing for me and decided to skip getting Pandora Tomorrow.So I rented the game and played it with my brother. The first mission is a training mode which only shows a few of the literally dozens of moves a splinter cell can pull off. The next missions are fun and very intriging. They make you think like a spy. Which route should I take? Where are the enemies located? What is the best and most quiet way to take them out? You have to think about all these before advancing through the level. This game makes you think.Not only that but the graphics are top-notch too.

{"product_name":"B00006599Y","reviewerName":"Vappour","summary":"Well worth the money","reviewText":"This was a really great and entertaining shooter.  It's well worth the money as it gave me many, many hours of challenging gameplay.  As I'm sure everybody knows, it's based on the Q3 engine which is becoming a little dated.  The graphics and cut scenes are not the greatest anymore -- but they're still quite good.  Best of all, the AI is much improved over the original SOF (QII engine).  The bots often  give you a really decent contest -- especially at the higher levels.  Some players complain that the bots shoot too well, see through cover and always throw grenades with perfect accuracy.  This is what makes the game.  After all, you're the one with unlimited \"lives\" who can always try again.  Other gamers don't like the number of weapons the game allows you to carry.  If this is the case, drop all the ones you think are unrealistic.  Also, you're allowed to pick the weapons you carry before each mission.  Play with just a knife if you think that will make a better game.  SOFII has less of an \"arcade\" feel to it as compared to the original.  Except in a few places, the targets don't act as much like pop-ups.  This is a very linear game.  There are objectives which you meet and then you move on to another level.  There are no \"secret places\" to find or complex puzzles to solve.  A couple of half-hearted \"stealth missions\" are thrown in (bummer), but they don't last long.  There are a few bugs (at least on my system).  Other than the usual clipping errors (floating bodies and weapons), there are certain places where the bots are able to poke their weapons and shoot through solid metal doors, etc.  In another place, I watched in disbelief as my armor and health decreased when a bot shot at me on the other side of a concrete post.  Some powerful bullets here.  The worst bug was a badly designed level near the end.  You seem able to go into a hallway where the designers don't want you.  Instead of the usual barrier or locked door, you simply get shot \"dead\" out of \"the blue\" everytime you try to enter this hallway.  Very annoying.  I liked the fact that, as with most Q3 based games, almost everything is adjustable.  The default gory graphics are a bit over the top but they can be toned down in stages (along with decals, amount of brass shown, etc.).  The plot and dialog are a bit cheesy, but who the hell cares?  The same is true in most of these games (how about RTCW?).  And finally, there is the multiplayer component which is absolutely great and is icing on the cake.  SOFII belongs in any FPS gamer's collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2002"}

Somebody said, \"Hey, let's take Marv, call him Jack, put him in an Escape from New York setting, and have him participate in an ultra-violent game show.\"  The game is broken up into 14 Arena Style Levels where you must score points by violently murdering other contestants.  There are Arena Levels, Driving Levels, and Boss Fights.  Jack gets 30 minutes and 2 Continues at the beginning of each level.  The gameplay takes full advantage of the Wii Controller as you creatively find ways to eliminate your competition.  When you score enough points, you gain access to a Boss Battle.  After you defeat the Boss, you can progress to the next level.Story:  8/10In an area like Manhattan, a Government Agency sprayed the population with some sort of Steroidal Rage Drug and encouraged mass murder.  Over time, the city became full of death traps and weapons.  Our hero, Jack an ex-Champion of the games, is sent into the city to find out who's behind it all.  There's actually more story than there needs to be, but it's all well done.Graphics: 6/10What's Black and White and Red All Over?  This game.  The basic art style is black and white like the Sin City graphic novels.  There's also plenty of blood to highlight the violence.  The character and level designs are outstanding, but the Black and White art makes it a bit hard to focus and tends to strain your eyes after an hour.  In the end, if doesn't matter how stylized your graphics are if they cause eye strain.Gameplay:  8/10Killing goons has never been so violent.  In a normal game, you might kill a guy by stabbing him or throwing him into a fire, but that's just so pedestrian for Mad World.  In Mad World, you score points by inflicting as much lethal damage on an enemy as you can.  For example:  First, you might beat a guy up, then slam a tire over his head, pinning his arms to his body.  Then grab a street sign, rip it out of the ground and jam it through his face.  Then, pick him up, head butt him a few times for good measure and walk over to a meat hook.  Slam the guy onto the meat hook, over and over and over again by thrashing your Wiimote.  That will get you the score of HARDCORE VIOLENCE.  You've never been able to inflict more damage on a human body before this game... EVER!  The more points you score, the more death traps and weapons appear in the level.  After a while, the levels play out almost like Tony Hawk where you strategically maximize the death traps and enemies to score as many points as you can.  Optional Mini-Games are also available such as Man Darts, or Decapitation Golf to allow you to score even more points.  The gameplay is really fun, but starts to feel repetitive after about an hour.Sound:  5/10The music tracks are a mix of rap and action music.  They're ok.  The cutscenes are very well written and acted.  However, there are two announcers that punctuate the violence as you are playing the game.  Their perverse jokes get really repetitive after a while and they start to get annoying.  You can turn the Volume down independently for the Announcers, Sound Effects, or Music.Replay Value:  7/10At any time, you can replay levels to try and improve your High Score.  There is also a Multi-Player mode where Two Players can compete head to head in the Mini Games.Overall:  8/10This game is fun in small doses.  Brutally killing guys with the Wiimote as you're trying to discover new and creative ways to kill them is very fun.  You can probably finish the game in about 6 to 8 hours.Mad World is Rated M for Language, Crude Humor, Porn Jokes, Violence, Gore, Murder, Dismembering, Impaling, Immolating, Vaporizing, Smashing, Bashing, Chopping, Slicing, Dicing, Chain-sawing, Pulverizing, Burning, Stabbing, Thrashing, Mutilating, Catapulting, Disemboweling and the list goes on... and on...Buy it if:You want to own the most Adult Game of all time.You want more traditional games for your Wii Collection.You want to play the mini-games in Multiplayer.Rent it if:You want a violently fun arcade style beat 'em up.You want a short, but fun action game for the Wii.Avoid it if:You don't like violence, crude humor, or black and white art.If you like this game, you'll love No More Heroes for the Wii.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00BQI3UQG","description":"","reviewerName":"JoshJosh","summary":"great game, good port","reviewText":"Donkey Kong Country Returns, made by Retro Studios (Metroid Prime) is one of the best games of the past five years. It might be the best game on Wii. The level design is top-notch, turning the game into one that plays how a platformer would play today were the genre to have kept evolving, instead of being dumped aside for 3D games. It looks great, has tons of content, and plays extraordinarily well. The feel of Donkey and Diddy Kong was perfect. The only noticeable flaw was the control - Retro put some moves on a shaking mechanic that, while not a deal-breaker, was just a bit too imprecise for what the game demanded.Nintendo has seen fit to move the game over to 3DS, and it's a good move. This is easily one of the best games on the 3DS, and easily tops New Super Mario Bros. 2. The Wii version's best qualities shine through. The level design and character physics are as good as ever.  The graphics still look great, albeit with some downgrades. The frame rate is mostly good, although there is noticeable stuttering on busy scenes. It's not enough to really affect the flow of the game, but it is noticeable. All the levels arrive, complete with time trials (sadly, there do not seem to be leaderboards, which is a noticeable omission).The controls ditch the shaking and instead rely on a more typical button-based configuration. Unfortunately, it's still not perfect. You can use either the d-pad or the analog slider, but, for some reason, each is tied to a certain button configuration. For example, the analog slider mode uses the L/R button as grab, which doesn't feel entirely natural. The d-pad button configuration is superior, but the low placement of the 3DS d-pad makes it a bit awkward to play with. I would have greatly appreciated a free-form configuration that would let me set any actions to any buttons.There's also an \"new\" mode, which gives the characters a bit more health and offers some items to make it through tricky spots. You pick the mode at the beginning of the game and can't switch after. I haven't tried it, instead opting for the Wii mode. I am pleased to say the game remains as challenging as it was on Wii - it's a great challenge.I gave this game five stars on fun - I love this game to bits. Retro made a masterpiece of 2D gaming here. Overall, though, I'd give the 3DS port four stars. It's an amazing game but the lack of control configurations and slight framerate drops take it down a peg. Still, it's a game that MUST MUST MUST be played by anyone who enjoys 2D gaming. Even with those slight issues, the 3DS version is excellent and well worth playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00026RFI2","reviewerName":"K. Ostrowski \"bra1n1ac\"","summary":"I'm a big fan of Dragon Ball Z...","reviewText":"And when I'm a fan of something, that means I scrutinize it much more closely and wish very deeply to see it achieve its potential.Dragon Ball Z is an anime series that revolves around characters with superhuman powers such a superhuman strength, speed, endurance, flight and the power to fire blasts of life-energy from their palms.  These powers grow stronger the more they train, and so as such, they spend most of their time either training or fighting.Now, I believe Dragon Ball Z could use fighting game elements to make a perfect game based on the animated series.  No, I don't think this is that game, but there's a reason for that.In virtually every episode of the series, you'll hear someone talking about something, witness someone training to get stronger, or watch as one or more of the good guys is paralyzed with fear over how much stronger the enemy is than they are.  For example, when Vegeta attacked the Earth, he was so strong that he put Goku (arguably the series' main character) in a hospital bed.  Yet later in the series, he is attacked and almost killed by Zarbon, one of Frieza's henchmen.  Zarbon, in turn, had less than half the strength of characters like Burter or Jeice, who in turn, were about half as strong as Ginyu, the person commanding them.  Ginyu was, as far as we know, Frieza's second in command, but Frieza was over 100 times stronger than he was.  Over 1000 times in the american series.In fact, Frieza was so powerful, that he single-handedly wiped out the entire planet that Vegeta hailed from with a simple gesture IN HIS WEAKEST FORM.This is a massive power difference between two characters in the series, as you might imagine.But Budokai 3 is a fighting game.  There's no getting around that.  And in a fighting game, having one character who can annihilate another just by breathing hard wouldn't work too well, would it?Well, at any rate, I doubt it would, in a fighting game.  It would, however, work just fine in an RPG.  The whole \"training and getting stronger\" thing is just another word for what we in the video game community call \"mining for experience.\"  A system that could easily be incorporated into a game like this as a bonus game/story mode, while also incorportating the enormous mathematical power levels that DBZ brings forth.But in this game, the biggest difference between the character of Frieza and the character of Cell lies in their movesets.  In the anime, Cell could kill Frieza with one punch, but in this game, it's not too tough to beat Cell using Frieza in a fight.Furthermore, and more to the point, when I fought Cell as Goku in this game's story mode, he wasn't really any tougher than when I fought Frieza, nor was he really that much stronger.Maybe some day a DBZ RPG will come out in the vein of Kingdom Hearts gameplay-wise, that will faithfully represent the vast gulf in power between the DBZ characters.  This game does not fulfill the potential of a DBZ video game because of this.However, in virtually every other respect, I think this game is great.  It's got quite a few DBZ fighters (though it does leave out a few, like Kibito, Chaotsu, Burter, Jeice, Zarbon, Dodoria, Cui, 19, etc...) and quite a few moves and move styles for those characters that are even customizable at one point.  When I picked it up, I was so anxious to see which characters I could earn that I didn't put it down for a day and a half.  I was that obsessed.Long and short, this game may not be what I've been waiting for in terms of a DBZ video game, but it's the best DBZ FIGHTING game I've ever seen.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2005"}

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"Derek Vazquez \"DaFynestRican\"","summary":"It's a grower","reviewText":"Many people might be disappointed about the new direction this title takes Dead Space into, but if you like \"light gun\" titles and are open to change you just might enjoy this one. That said, I think anybody who has played a little bit of Extraction can dispel the garbage of it being a cheap cash-in. A lot of work went into this title, more than would have been necessary to make a quick buck. It has great voice acting, detailed graphics, and a storyline that answers a lot of questions as to how the disater on the Ishimura came to be. No, you aren't alone for most of the game, and no you don't have complete control over where you are heading (although there are small instances where you can choose a direction on a branching path), but this is still survival horror at it's finest. You won't be jumping out of your seat with cheap scares, but there's nothing that compares to the tension and panic you feel when four necromorphs are bearing down on you and you're blasting away for your life ( I was swearing up a storm and shooting off every limb in sight just to keep them off me!). It doesn't detract from the enjoyment when you pull a 2nd player into the mix for co-op action, either. Hell, you've got computerallies, might as well play with a real one! My brother and I played through a few parts of the campaign with me and having never really played Wii before he was pretty impressed with what he saw.

One for Elder Scrolls and one for an MMORPG...As an Elder Scrolls game, you have to ask yourself one thing: &#34;Do I want to play an Elder Scrolls game with a bunch of other people?&#34; If the answer is &#34;yes, at all costs!&#34;, skip the rest of this review and click &#34;buy&#34;. If the answer is &#34;Yes!....wait, what costs?&#34;, then read on.The first cost, of course, is the actual monthly subscription fee. What this gets you is a multiplayer world and (we all hope) regular content updates included as part of the subscription. The other cost is a bit more subtle...how do you have an Elder Scrolls style world where everyone can go everywhere while still customizing all content to YOU? The answer is &#34;you can't&#34;, or at any rate, they didn't make any new big innovations here. ESO is more linear than other Elder Scroll games, far more like other MMORPGs. When you are level 15 you need to be in an area that's appropriate for level 15. The game isn't totally linear -- it's not Half-Life 2, for example -- but it's no Daggerfall or Skyrim either. You need to move through the world as is appropriate for your level. Consequently this has the same problem as all PvE MMORPGs, which is that if you want to play with your friends, you need to work to stay in synch. If someone runs ahead and plays 8 hours of quests without you, you can't just log in the next day and join them where they are (not unless you want to die a lot because you're in an area too high level for you).So that's what being multiplayer does to Elder Scrolls. If that's acceptable to you, buy away. If you were looking for a single player experience, though, you may be disappointed.For people already familiar with MMORPGs (and may not be familiar with Elder Scrolls) probably the biggest surprise is going to be the combat system, which is, in my opinion, far more immersive and engaging than a lot of games. You are expected to actively swing your sword and actively block and actively dodge. This isn't WOW where you target something and eat nachos while mashing &#34;Shadowbolt&#34; over and over. You need to get involved. And it works surprisingly well. The lag seems to be invisible and the game's performance is actually amazing.I really mean that. I dunno who they hired to do their network code and graphics engine but they're not paying them enough. The game handles hundreds of players on screen in crisp, high resolution graphics and it is frankly better and more amazing than any other MMORPG I have ever played, and I've played most of them. From high end machines to low end, all of my friends and guildmates are amazed at how well this game runs and how good it looks.Character design is more akin to Elder Scrolls than regular MMORPG tropes too. Don't look for a &#34;tank&#34; or a &#34;healer&#34;. Decide what role you want to play, decide which class looks like the most fun and then figure out how to build that class into that role. All classes can be any role, in their own way. I'm playing a Nightblade, which on the surface looks like a rogue, but I'm playing him as a tank. One of my friends is playing a Nightblade healer. It basically means we both have some decent abilities for burst damage and escape but I am very tanky and he is very healy and our character builds don't look much alike, despite being the same class. You could be a sorcerer tank or a dragonknight archer, etc. The class/role system is pretty wide open.PvP? Elder Scrolls offers probably the best PvP we've seen since DAOC. It follows the DAOC model, which is somewhat like the GW2 model but with some important differences:Most of the world is PvE but the 3 teams come together in the middle of the map. The middle zone is, we estimate, on the order of 15 times larger than GW2's &#34;Eternal Battleground&#34; (search YouTube for the travel time comparison video someone made), and that's the 3-team PvP area. There are keeps to fight over, PvE quest hubs (where enemies can and will gank you, but the XP is great if you can avoid getting murdered), &#34;Elder Scrolls&#34; to steal from enemy keeps, small public dungeons (where enemies can and will gank you), LOTS of open space to hunt in and, &#34;coming soon&#34;, the Imperial City, which is a huge PvEvP area in the middle of the PvP map (not yet implemented, though you can SEE it...)Will this game have legs to go long term? I dunno. At worst, I think it'll be the next Rift -- alive and kicking for a year or two before the new wears off for everyone. I don't think it'll be another SWTOR -- which was closing servers due to lack of players less than a year after launch. Whether it's the new WOW, exploding onto the MMORPG scene and there to stay, remains to be seen. It may depend on how popular the PvP is (which sustained DAOC for years) and how well they can deliver new content.All things said, I'd vote &#34;go ahead and get it&#34;. The only people I think will be unhappy are those who expected another Skyrim with an open world meant for soloing. This is not that.For me, it's fun. I dunno if it's long term (&#34;Magic 8-ball says: &#34;Ask Again Later&#34;) but it really has its moments and is not a flash in the pan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2014"}
{"product_name":"B001G8M738","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"A New 'Twist' On an Old Classic","reviewText":"I remember playing the original Bejeweled classic game for hours upon hours entranced by the addicting fun of matching the different shapes and colors of jewels. Bejeweled Twist has lost none of it's original charm and addictive qualities and introduces a new level of strategy not present in earlier titles.In earlier versions of Bejeweled a player advanced in the game by shifting pieces one at a time in order to create 3 (or more) in a row matches that would allow for more jewels to cascade down. The major shift in 'Twist' is that now the player moves 4 jewels at the same time in a clockwise motion. A multiplier builds up as the player moves pieces around the board efficiently. Thus rotate too many pieces and your multiplier will suffer for it. The game definitely rewards forethought.To add more complexity to the matter, as the player advances new pieces are introduced on the game board. These include pieces of coal, bombs and locked jewels. Coal itself cannot be matched though can be destroyed by clearing adjacent jewels for a nice bonus. Bombs display a number that ticks down every time the player makes a move. The goal is to create a match using the bomb piece before the ticker reaches zero. Fail and you'll be taken to a 'wheel of fortune' of sorts where you're given a 2nd chance to survive the bomb blast. Fail and it's game over. Locked jewels cannot be rotated though are easily cleared by lining up the appropriate adjacent jewels.Other game modes include Zen where the player basically cannot 'lose' a game; and blitz where a player faces a set of puzzle challenges are included in the package.Visually the game is the best yet from Pop-Cap Games. By far the best looking Bejeweled to date I'm happy to report that the game runs smoothly on even modest machines. The minimum installation requirements are extremely forgiving.Sound effects are toned down in this game, thankfully! Previous versions of Bejeweled often wore on me as the chime from clearing a set of jewels grew very annoying. Not so here.One thing that I wish these games featured was a way to quickly port them to other devices such as PDA's, cell phones and MP3 players. This game would simply be great on my iPod Touch though I can't justify purchasing it twice.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2008"}

A co-op player can come into the game at any time and leave at any time (note only one of you will play as the Master Chief, while another will play as the Arbiter, and the other two players will be Elites that work with humans)- Great looking graphics and animation, that look even better then Halo 2, F.E.A.R. and just as good as Bioshock, while these graphics might not look as good as Gears of War do to some people these graphics still are some of the best seen to date.- Intense multiplayer action online through Xbox Live with matches as small as one on one and as big as 16 players (and offline with out using Xbox Live using either spilt screen, or system link). Halo 3 is set up similar to Halo 2 in the sense that you're given a rank when you play multiplayer (this rank can go up or down at any time) this rank is representative of your skill and your matched with others of your skill type, that way new unskilled players and hardcore veterans will not often play against one another, unless they make a special match themselves that ignores rank.BAD:- Confusing plot to new players of this franchise - Playing Pervious games and read the Halo Novels will fill you in on the details, if you are incline to learn them.- No Clan Support (like in Halo 2) - This might get fixed in a future patch- Game is considered short to some (Campaign Story Mode).IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A Sci-Fi First Person Shooter with quick pacing and vehicle combat.- Co-op and online versus/team games is the big draw here.- NEW MODE: Forge is a mode that lets you edit all the maps in Halo 3, while you cannot rebuild the maps themselves you can in this mode, add and take away any and all of the objects from vehicles and guns to spawning points and flag zones. This is all done in real time and you can invite friends to this mode while your customizing the map(s), they can play a multiplayer game while your doing this (instead of just waiting for you) and if you want you can forgo editing the map and join the game at hand as either a player or the map editor (who looks like 343 Guilty Spark), while playing as the map editor you can still add and take away any and all objects from vehicles and guns to spawning points and flag zones any time you want.- NEW MODE: Theater Mode is a video editor that lets you record and play back any and all matches from Campaign, Multiplayer, and Forge modes from the point of view of any player either in first person or third person (even in a orbit-cam where the camera circles around the player) all in real time (you can also pause this at any time as well as fast forward and rewind), even use your camera to fly around the match and see the match from any angle you want, Don't forget you must save your videos before you turn off the game or you will lose said videos. Also you can take a picture at any time and save it to your Xbox 360 then download your picture at Bungie.com.GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Halo 2 (Xbox)- Halo (Xbox)- Resistance: Fall of Man (PS3)- Bioshock (360)- Gears of War (360)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- There are bonus items scattered through the Campaign Story Mode called Skulls getting these \"Skulls\" will make the game harder (by doing things like turning off radar for the rest of the Campaign Mode your playing it) but will also greatly increase your meta game score for the Campaign Mode.- There are two different limited collectors editions of this game. One is called the limited edition, which comes in a metal tin and has a bonus disc (with behind the scene videos and such) and also comes with an art book.

I would have to agree with that assessment, but for different reasons than most believe.  The enemies themselves are not really the challenge.  The high difficulty stems from poor control interface and no check point system.  While it's very satisfying to successfully pull off a parry and counter strike, there are numerous times when you should have parried perfectly and for no reason at all, simply miss, and get smacked for a 50% energy drain.It is also very difficult to move around during a battle, and you often find yourself either facing the wrong way or getting hit by a random swipe while you have your shield up.  Another gripe I have is that arrows are far too expensive.  Five arrows will run you 100 bucks (souls)!!  That's insane.  Arrows should cost about 1 or 2 souls, I mean come on. There's also no way to sell off junk that you pick up.  You can just \"store\" your crap with some bum you find in the Nexus, but he doesn't give you any souls for it, so why even bother picking up a \"broken sword\" in the first place?The no check point system causes you to rush through levels after the fifth time you die simply because you're out of patience.  I also find it stupid that you lose energy, quite a bit sometimes, even when you successfully blocked an attack.  What's the point in having a shield exactly??In closing, I think this would be a very average Oblivion ripoff if not for the lack of checkpoints and the poor controls.  The developers seem to think that making a game very frustrating is an easy way to make it difficult.  I would prefer a good control scheme and actual tough enemies, to weak and stupid enemies who kill me because I can't move correctly due to poor and awkward controls.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2010"}

However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Scott","summary":"Full of flaws that fanboys miss","reviewText":"This game is great in many ways, but full of flaws-rushed to production-muffled sounding announcer-clone characters-glitches-overpowered and underpowered very unbalanced charactersdispite all of that it is one of the gamecubes better games, but def not better than todays smash bros brawl.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2013"}

Plant \"CP\"","summary":"MW3 = THE BEST COD EVER!","reviewText":"First off, it seems like alot of people are whining about the spawning, and lag, and people are even saying that they made no changes to this game.  Thats just rediculous.  The spawning could use some changes, but it's the second day the game has been out, so you know it will be fixed.  And i havn't experience any lag online at all.  And if someone says that they made no changes to this game, then they are crazy!  They made a ton of really good changes.  The map designs have gotten better.  Finally in Mw3 the perk system actually makes sense, and 2 attachments is no longer a perk but a weapon proficiency.  They took over powered perks and split them into 2 perks, ( Ghost from Black Ops = Blind Eye & Assassin from Mw3) and weapon proficiencies are awesome.  Theyve added lot of new guns, (pp90, cm901, scar l, acr 6.8), and those are just some of the new guns.  They've also added equipment like, (Bouncing bettys, trophy system).  The new point streak system along with strike packages is amazing! All 3 strike packages are unique and all of them are addictive.  But by far my favorite edition to multiplayer was the game mode, \"Kill Confirmed\".  Kill Confirmed is the best, and funnest game mode to play.  There is alot more to the multiplayer of MW3.  Also, if you enjoyed the single player campaign of MW2, the MW3 campaign will not dissapoint you.  And don't forget there is also SPEC OPS! Do not hesitate to buy this game.  It is by far the best COD yet to be released.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"Princeps P \"The Princeps\"","summary":"Honest Review from Halo Gamer","reviewText":"I have been a Halo and Gears player for years and just recently purchased Battlefield 3 and Modern Warfare 3. Both are a different type of gameplay than what I am accustomed to, but both do have their pros and cons. Even though this is a MW3 review I will incorporate BF3 into it as well just for comparison, as I believe BF3 is more similar to MW3 than Halo. I am reviewing this game from a technical perspective, not so much from gameplay. Everyone is different when it comes to what they like, so my preference should not be a factor. However, if you are an avid Halo and Gears player then our taste could be similar.First off, I am only addressing the online play. I owned the original MW and did not like it for the unlimited spawning of enemies, so I never bothered to buy any of the subsequent titles; from what I have read this is still the formula for campaign.  Many of the previous reviews are upset with the lack of evolution from MW2; I will not be able to comment on that. I find the graphics and the sound par with other Xbox games that have come out recently. I do think that BF3 does look better with the optional texture pack installed. Either way with the fast action of both games it is really hard to stop and look around.The multiplayer gameplay is very fast-paced. I believe it gives enough options for someone to choose what they would like to play. I really like the custom upgrade system where you choose your own path. BF3 has an upgrade system, but it is based on a pre-defined technology tree.  I am very big into objective based games and teamwork, MW3 has added elements to encourage this type of play, but it still seems it is all about the K/D. Oddly, BF3 rewards more for objectives, but makes it easier for campers.  The MW3 servers appear to run smoothly and I have not encountered any problems. Sadly, the BF3 servers still have many issues, which make it very frustrating to play with friends in a squad. MW3 is a smoother experience in this aspect. However, the MW3 Elite service is horrid and still not functioning today. Battlelog for BF3 is fully functioning and I have not encountered problems checking my stats since launch.Overall, I would give the multiplayer part of the game 4 stars, based on ease of operation, graphics and sound. I marked off an additional two stars for the $49.99 price on the elite service, because this is integrated into the game and has been heavily marketed. Personally, I think this is just a way to fleece gamers' money. Sadly, Elite does not even work at this time. Unless, they guarantee a set amount of DLC, $49.99 on top of $59.99 game price is unacceptable. With that being said, the elite service is good for one year from date of purchase, so it is in everyone's benefit to purchase just before the release day of the first DLC to maximize length of service or when it is fully functioning.  I believe the amount of DLC will be dependent on the amount of people who shell over the additional $49.99. I have not seen any game rack up a year of DLC totaling $50 yet.In the end, I find the game frustrating and to fast for my taste, and not worth the $59.99 price plus an additional $49.99. I like to buy DLC on my terms, sometimes I get it all, and sometimes I just get the first offering. I am going to opt out of the $49.99 elite service and just hope the free stat-tracking portion is operational soon.If I had to pick between MW3 and BF3, I would pick BF3. They each offer a different experience. MW3 allows more character and class customization and can easily be played solo. BF3 has planes, tanks, helicopters, larger maps and offers more points for completing objectives, but is frustrating if you do not have a good squad-better played with friends. MW3 is just to fast-paced for me and is too dependent on kill streaks. Technically the game plays smoothly, but is just not for me.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000VJRU44","reviewerName":"B. Deans \"Shadow\"","summary":"Wii = Fun","reviewText":"I would like to say that this is by far one of the best investments i have made.  The wii has been able to involve workouts in a fun and comprehensive way that has made it much cheaper, fun and enticing than going to a gym.  If you were a little overweight and ashamed of going to the gym, or had a lack of time/ money to make it to the gym this is for you.ControlsWii balance board and remote.  The balance board is the best device i have ever seen constructed.  It works on carpets and on hardwood floors.  The board weighs you every day and is able to determine how much preasure you are placing from one foot to the other or how your balance is distributed.  While doing the exercises it shows you where your ideal balance should be placed and helps you align your body properly to get the most of your workout.  The wii remote is used for some tasks like running or jogging.  While in your pocket or in your hand it can determine how fast you are moving just by it being on you. 5/5GraphicsThe graphics are typical wii 3d graphics.  Nothing above the ordinary but what you should be expecting.  If you go for a jog and take an island lap you see a very pretty island with the water along your side.  Its enough scenery to keep you running because you want to see it all.  The side games like balance and skiing look pretty good. 4/5GameplayYou get Aerobics, Strength, yoga, fitness, and minigames all in one.  Personally they are all fun to do.  Aerobics and strength are my favorites.  If you want a break you can cool off with some yoga and or minigames to work on your balance.-Aerobics you can do jogs walk up and down on the balance board and do some boxing along with other things.-Strength you can do crunches, pushups, twists and so on.  These are the workouts people dread but they are executed flawlessly and actually add fun to the game.  As you start out you might have a task to do 10 crunches.  As you do this and complete this task a few times then a new version of 20 crunches will appear. And it will go up further and further untill you get to a challenge mode which lets you go 1 on 1 with your trainer to see who can do more of the task before quitting.  This is the real challenger right here.-Yoga you get simlar yoga poses like the half crescent, or the tree.  You are required to keep your balance while preforming these poses and giving deep inhales and exhales.  The board measures even the slightest movement in your balance and encourages you to do better and better every time.  This is more relaxing and can be used pretty well inbetween things like running and crunches to give your body some cool off time.-Games are there to help you learn how to balance and align your body properly for other various activites in wii fit.  Some tasks might require you to balance on the board to move marbles around.  Or even move a character around an obstacle maze with the balance on the board.  The games add some fun and excitement to the game and are a nice breakaway from working out.5/5 for gameplay.All and all the wii fit is a recommendation for everyone.  Adults and kids alike will have fun enjoy themselves and keep in shape.  You are given a personal trainer that guides you through your workouts.  At the beginning you get a body test that measures your weight and determines what your body mass is.  Then you are allowed to determine what you want to accomplish with your weight, within a certain time line.  You can set goals for yourself that include loosing poundage, gaining pounds or staying in the same weight class.  You can then check in on your goals every day and see how your overall weight control has been going on a daily basis.  On a side note there is a clock that measures how much time you have invested each day.  When the clock hits 30 minutes you have reached your daily goal and it will tell you.  On a side note the game is designed to warn you when you have worked out for an hour time.  Once you hit the 1 hour mark it gives you a notice that asks you to take a 10-15 minute break and drink some water.  This is a great tool and encourages people to not overdo it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000VJRU44","reviewerName":"Raqel Redfox","summary":"What's All the Hype About?","reviewText":"Wii Fit is pretty cool, and I think you should read some of the five-star and four-star reviews to get what I'm talking about here. When I saw the first commercial of Wii Fit, I did not expect there to be so much hype-it's like the next generation of Dance Dance Revolution. I do think it's pretty pricey, yet I didn't expect it to be that good. I read a one-star review with something about a carpet? That really sucks for them, but if you have a carpet and want to play, don't take that as a hazard. I have a carpet and the balance board works just fine on the carpet. If it's a really fluffy carpet (and I mean sink your feet in it fluffy), then yeah, maybe you shouldn't risk it. But it would be sort of weird saying you own a Wii, but don't have Wii Fit. After watching a parody, I expected it to be more boring than it was (watch it on YouTube). The parody was VERY funny, so I made fun of it a lot. But it's actually pretty fun. Even if you don't want to get fit (like me, I'm a teenage girl and healthy according to the Wii Fit so I don't really care) the yoga and strength exercises are really fun. Some of them are really hard, but on one I earned the name 'Body Builder', and on another one 'Yoga Trainer'. The trainers are also really nice. The games are kind of boring, soccer's way too hard for me, but the stepping game is pretty fun. I really recommend getting it, even if you're a hardcore video gamer that doesn't prefer the video games in which you have to move, like me (although I enjoy boxing, golf, bowling, and baseball). If you think it's a bit pricey, I can't blame you, it IS kind of pricey. But it's still (almost) as good as Guitar Hero/Rock Band, so it's a LITTLE reasonable.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2009"}

They may or may not be able to completely accurately reproduce the exact graphics and sound of the original SNES on a GBA screen, and I don't mind including a very basic \"Mario Brothers\" game the way they did, but I'm a little upset that, like LTTP, they added a lot of repetitive and dumb-sounding voiceovers.  I mean, I usually LIKE voices in video games, but only when I don't have to hear the same line over and over.Additionally, the graphics colors were definitely not as sharp as I feel they should have been.  Certainly not up to the SNES level.One of these days, Nintendo should come out with something called \"classic SNES series\" in the vein of their current \"classic NES series\" of games, which will FAITHFULLY reproduce the original games without butchering them or decorating them like Christmas Trees.But I digress.The text means the same thing, but is worded differently, the presence of luigi running back and forth gets very annoying and...I think that's it.The game's story is really the same, and as far as I can tell, the level structure is exactly identicle.  This is why I gave it as high a grade as I did.  If they had tried to mess around with the gameplay like they did in the rehash of Donkey Kong Country, I would have rated this game much worse.But they didn't, so I didn't.

This one is also full of great addiction.  While it isn't nearly as good as Brain Age, it does have its moments.There are only fifteen games in Big Brain Academy.  They are divided into five categories with three games each.  Two of them are math based, while there is one that challenges you in identifying, another in analyzing, and one more in memory.  These games are simple to play and over time become addicting.  There are only three modes, however.  A practice mode where you'll probably start that allows you to play all the games.  It'll save your high score at the end, as well.There's a test mode, which is probably the best of the lot.  In test mode you'll be tested on what you know.  The game keeps track of how well you're doing.  One game from each category is chosen at random, and you'll have to go through and solve the puzzles.  At the end you're given a letter grade, and told what kind of brain you have.Finally, there's a multiplayer.  Up to eight people can play at a time and only one person has to have the game.  The others just bring their DS and they go in and play.  Here you can compete in any game you choose.  It's a race to see who can finish first basically, and whoever does finish first gets the most points and wins.  Multiplayer is a treat, but the game is already good enough without it.The only thing that really keeps Big Brain Academy down is thet there's not enough of it to go around.  There aren't enough games and there aren't enough game modes.  It's fun and addictive, but there's not enough in the package.

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Gordon \"PS3/PC Gamer!\"","summary":"KILLER APP","reviewText":"I usually don't tell people that one game is worth buying a PS3 for.......and that's still the case so don't get too excited. However if I were to tell you the top 3 games to pick up, this would be one of them.Honestly, Uncharted 2 is the closest to all-around perfect for a third person shooter.........ever. Even MGS4 wasn't perfect in that it is an acquired taste with its heavy handed story telling (greatest series in videogame history) and stealth. The campaign is just incredible. Everyone knows by now that Uncharted 2 is the best looking game on the PS3. I have amazon verified purchases of Killzone 2, God of War 3, and MGS4. I'm not going to say those don't come close (GoW 3 actually is on par with it), but this is the most colorful, beautiful, and consistently detailed game available on consoles. Its really amazing and on my Samsung HDTV I pop this one in when I know guests are in our apartment. I leave my door open on purpose. I never had a game look so good that I flaunt it on my HDTV.No one seems to notice the physics on display in the gameplay. If I BARELY make a jump over a gap it'll show in the animation. If I fall from a height and then try to dart off in another direction, Drake's legs will buckle, then he'll move. This isn't God of War 3 where Kratos' jumps are flawless. Drake seems more human because he will stumble, grunt (Kratos grunts too), and land imperfectly at times. All this platforming also helps to remind me that I'm alone. Drake has no army and (most of the time) no friends to back him up. As Drake, I'm an explorer on my own and will do what I can to achieve my goal if it means climbing up a mountain, on the side of a moving train, or jumping on loose ice on the edge of a cliff.Another thing some people won't see are the times where you can use stealth. Some enemy soldiers have patrol routes and if you sit back and be patient, you can learn them. Sneaking up on an enemy will reward you with a stealth kill. There should have been more stealth kill animations...MUCH MORE. But the few there are very rewarding. The sneaking was so well suited to the game that I hope with U3 there are entire levels that require complete stealth. And please give us more silenced weaponry to get the job done.People can really make the story seem like its groundbreaking, but its not. That's not to say that its bad, but coming from a hardcore MGS fan, its great, not superb. You, know the National Treasure type. What's groundbreaking is the voice acting. Nothing else even comes close. Uncharted is far and away the best voiced game in existence, period. The story is great. Its very focused and doesn't offer a whole lot of twists and turns, but its really like an action movie. The action and set pieces are also the best I've ever seen. Some parts can even rival God of War's awesome quicktime events. While the story is nowhere near MGS caliber, its a great action adventure with tons of set pieces and FLAWLESS FLAWLESS voice acting. Its an very entertaining story, unlike Killzone 2 where the story is kill everyone and come home.MP is a blast. This and LBP are the only games that I play MP ALL THE TIME on. Its balanced, fun and the amount of modes is just staggering. While SP is worth the price tag alone, MP just takes this game to 11/10.I have 3 problems with U2. First of all, the shooting in Uncharted 2 is entirely different from Uncharted 1. In U1, you could not see your bullet travel through the air and stream into the enemy. Wherever you aimed at on the enemy is where the bullet entered. In this game you can actually see the bullet flying through the air, which took a lot of getting used to for me, and to this day it still bothers me.My second gripe, albeit minor, is that at times, you feel like there are too many locations in the game. This problem can be entirely ignored however, because the first Uncharted is focused on a single location-the jungle. In this wonderful game you will travel to the mountains, a (better) jungle, an arctic environment (and leave tracks and kick up the snow!), temples, and even a residential town in Nepal! If you were fresh off of beating U1, then this may seem a bit overwhelming:)My third problem that I have with all shooting games besides MW2 is that in the campaign it takes too many shots to kill your enemy. Its not half as severe as Killzone 2 though. KZ2 requires almost half a clip!Overall this is a buy. Don't rent it cause you won't want to give it back. KILLER APP! If you still aren't convinced, are there any games this gen on Amazon that have over 690 reviews with a 5 star average?FEEL FREE TO ASK ANYTHING ABOUT UNCHARTED 2! THANKS FOR READING!

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"\"I Chose... Rapture\"","reviewText":"Bioshock, without a doubt, is one of the video game events of the year. A first person shooter that is more than just a first person shooter. Not only is this game fun, but the storyline is thought-provoking and philosophical. This is more than just a game. This an interactive storybook of epic proportions.After being the only survivor of a plane crash in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, your only chance of survival is to seek refuge in the nearby lighthouse.  The moment you step inside you're greeted by a banner which states: \"No Gods or Kings. Only Man.\" Going further into the lighthouse you're soon taken to the underwater city of Rapture. A place where religion and morality do not rule the decisions of mankind. Where every man does what he chooses for his own selfish gain.  The city is run by a man named Andrew Ryan. When you arrive in the city, however, its quite clear that Andrew Ryan's perfect world wasn't so perfect. The city lies in ruins and chaos runs rampant as a form of genetically mutated people called splicers roam the streets. With the help of a man named Atlas who guides you through the twisted city of Rapture, you'll have to survive long enough to get out.Throughout your adventure there are plenty of things you can do to advance the story. You'll find radio diaries that give hints to the downfall of Rapture. You'll meet people who will tell you things about Rapture. Some of these things, such as the radio diaries, are optional, but if you don't listen to radio diaries you'll not only miss out on some of the complex and absorbing storyline, but you'll also miss out on some of the game's better features. The voice acting contained within each radio diary is fantastic. You'll learn not only about Rapture, but Andrew Ryan and other characters who play a major role in the story. There are other things that move the story along as well, like running into ghosts who will give you more insight. Some of the mutated denizens give you hints (before you have to do away with them). There's a lot to piece together here.  If story and character development are your thing: Bioshock delivers.As far as gameplay goes, Bioshock is a game that presents some complex things, but it's easy to play overall. Splicers are the most common types of enemies encountered in Rapture.  You'll need an arsenal of weapons to take them on. As you progress through the game you'll have splicers that simply attack melee style, others that shoot at you and even some that throw explosives. When you first begin you only have access to a wrench. But along the way you'll pick additional weapons like a pistol, shotgun, machine gun and a few others that you can use to decimate your enemies with.Despite how difficult things might be, Bioshock doesn't penalize you much should you die. If the worst should happen you'll respawn from a Vita Chamber (basically a checkpoint) with some health and everything you had at the time of your death. The enemy also keeps the same amount of health lost. So even if you die over and over again, you'll eventually be able to kill whatever it is that's giving you trouble. Despite the challenge of the game, the simple fact that you can't die permanently does take away some of the challenge.The enemy AI is also pretty good. While they never stop attacking once they've found you, they do act the way you expect them to. If they're firing at you and suddenly run out of ammo, they'll run away from you to reload. If they hear your footsteps, they'll investigate. Your adversaries are no dummies in this game.There are also machines like gun turrets and security cameras around. You can keep out of the way of security cameras easily, but sometimes turrets can be a pain. However, despite how tough gun turrets and rocket launchers can be, the game allows you to short circuit them and hack them. Hacking is a little mini-game in which you must lead a fluid through a series of pipes to the exit. Most of the hacking mini-games aren't hard. Successfully hacking a gun turret or rocket launcher turns them on your enemies.There's more to Bioshock than simply killing your enemy, though. You'll also want to search the dead bodies of those you kill. Usually enemies carry ammo, money, first aid kits, EVE Hypos and some will even drop weapons. You can also search more than dead bodies. You can search any containers scattered throughout the game. Trashcans, cabinets, virtually anything that sits idly by. Sometimes you'll find money, ammo etc.Aside from searching corpses and containers you can also pilfer any food or drinks that are lying around. Food often restores health, while drinks will restore health yet take away a bit of EVE. Most of the drinks you come across are alcoholic drinks, and if you drink too much alcohol it will register and your vision will actually be impaired and you'll start to stumble around.In addition to all that searching, there are also vending machines scattered throughout the game where you can buy healing items, drinks, ammo and more. It'll cost you money. Like some of the machines you'll encounter, you can also hack into a vending machine, and you'll want to do so. Doing so lowers the prices on the items and makes more available.As you go through the game you'll also come across Plasmids.  Plasmids give you powers. At first all you get is electricity, but later on you'll be able to command fire or even use telekinesis. There are several plasmids in the game, with their own little benefits. Electricity, for example, will let you activate switches and short circuit machines. You cannot use Plasmids limitlessly, though.  Plasmids consume EVE and once you run out of EVE, you can't use Plasmids.In addition to Plasmids you'll also find tonics which grant you everlasting effects so long as you have it equipped. There are tonics which improve your physical attributes, engineering skills to make hacking easier, and your combat abilities.Throughout the game you're also given chances to upgrade your weapons. You can also shoot off stronger ammo as you get further, and at some point you'll have to. Some enemies are immune to standard shots but can easily be taken down with armor piercing rounds.The game doesn't just put most of these things there for your benefit, but actually expects you to use them effectively. For example, if there are a bunch of enemies standing in water, you're encouraged to electrocute the water. If there's an oil spill you're encouraged to set it on fire. You can put together lots of great strategies when it comes to your Plasmids and Weapons. Even better is that you can switch between them on the fly. Your plasmids occupy your left hand and your weapons occupy your right. You can't use them both at the same time but the game allows you to switch between them rapidly enough to the point where it doesn't matter.Finally, the game allows you to invent and construct items for you to use a long the way. You'll need to find components to invent items, though, and that's easily done through searching all those basic containers.As far as the game looks it is by far one of the most detailed and beautiful games out there. Everything about the game is given a fantastic look to it. From what your enemies look like to the vast city itself. The walls are detailed, the water is detailed all the flames and vending machines are detailed. Even better, the physics and other mechanics in this game work divinely. For example, if you bump into a trashcan, it falls over. If you're stepping over something, you'll find yourself walking a bit slower and stumbling over it.Bioshock is a stunning game. The long wait was well worth it. Tight controls, lots of variety in the gameplay and an absorbing storyline is what keeps this game afloat and makes it fun. It is without a doubt one of the best games of 2007.The Good+Enticing storyline full of philosophy and intrigue+Fantastic voice acting brings the already fantastic story to life+Lots of variety in the gameplay+Great sound effects+Great music score+All around beautiful game+The atmosphere of the game never settlesThe Bad-While it's nice that you don't get penalized or ever have to reload when you die, it brings down the difficulty of this game a bit.  However, as I said, it's a good and bad thing","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2007"}
{"product_name":"B002I0JK38","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Skynet is beginning to take over NBA2K","reviewText":"I have always been a fan of the 2K series always opting for this series over the arcadey, unrealistic NBA Live series since 2000. While I haven't bought the 2K every single year, I have bought a good number of the games in the series and have been very satisfied with the series up until recently.  2K11 was a good game, but way too many problems with cheating AI and a virtually unplayable my player mode unless you can deal with all the frustration.  I was a little hesitant about purchasing 2K12 because of my issues with 2K11, but thanks to a sale and a gift card, I was able to get this game for a net cost of 2 bucks.Graphics and sound has never been an issue with the 2K games, so I won't go into much detail about them as they are great.  There are some issues with \"improved\" game controls such as On The Fly Coaching.  In 2K11 it was quite intuitive to manage this, and didn't need any improvements, but 2k decided to \"fix\" it anyway and now it is very cumbersome to use.  Whose bright idea was it to make you use the same buttons you play the actual game with to also sub in player on the fly?  STUPID.I will not spend to much time on the new clumsy controls though, instead I will spend most of my review about the actual gameplay where my main issues lie. To summarize, there are so many areas in which the CPU cheats and I will talk about a few in the sections below...INCONSISTENT SHOT SUCCESS (CPU hits everything while you miss wide open layups)First the CPU makes way too many shots with people all over them, while your players can barely hit wide open shots without a slider boost, and even still, wide open shots, are missed including layups right under the basket, to make matters even worse, players like D rose constantly get blocked by the rim.  Come the 3rd Qtr, you better have at least a 15 point lead to withstand the onslaught of CPU BS.  The 2nd half is notorious for comebacks, not necessarily by great play, but by the game purposely making you miss wide open shots, while the computer can hit virtually anything.  Even with a double digit lead in the 4th Qtr with under 2 minutes to go, the CPU hits every single shot, no matter the D.  I've even seen the ball traveling THROUGH my defenders on its way through the net.  I recall a game where Monte Ellis went something like 7 for 7 in the final 2 minutes and ended up with 53 points against me.  (I was the Clippers), the only reason I won this game was because I hit all my foul shots.POOR BALL HANDLING AND AWARENESS FOR HUMAN PLAYERSContinuing with this, human player ball control is absolutely horrible, many times my players would literally HAND the ball to the defender while doing a basic dribble.  It looks so stupid and it's as if your player has a bet on the game and is trying to throw it.  In addition, \"50/50\" balls seem to always go to the CPU no matter what.  You knock a ball away from your opponent, your team will just stand there and watch the ball, even the player you are controlling will not immediately respond to your commands to go for the ball, the result, the CPU will recover a loose ball 95% of the time.  Of course on the other end, as soon as the CPU knock your ball away, they are already half way down the court for a fast break layup.  Point guards are constantly having the ball stolen from them by PFs and Centers and here I'm thinking Point Guards have the best ball handling skills, silly me.MAGICAL CPU REBOUNDINGThe same is true for rebounds, I have NEVER seen Glen Davis jump soooo high to snatch a ball away from Amare' Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony, and two other Knicks players, and THEN lay it back up for an easy 2.  Shooting Guards and Point Guards constantly out rebound taller and bigger players and even when you THINK you have a rebound in your grasp, the game once again takes over and either magically makes him bobble the ball or have a shorter weaker player snatch it right out of his hands.SPEED RATING MEANS NOTHINGWide open fast breaks for you team are almost nonexistent because on fast breaks, speed means absolutely NOTHING.  I amazed at how EVERYONE runs the exact same speed when you happen to steal the ball in the back-court.  If I have a point guard, why are power forwards and centers running me down to cut off my easy layup or dunk?  David West should not be able to catch up to Rajon Rondo when Rondo already has a 10 foot head start after he steals the ball.HUMAN TEAMMATES ARE STUPID AND CPU PLAYERS ARE COACHED BY MS CLEOFinally, if you ever wonder how the CPU gets open so much, just watch a reply of the score and you will see your stupid teammates run OUT OF BOUNDS, AWAY from passes to THEIR man, or just stand there while the player dribbles right past him; as if the CPU needed MORE help to keep FG% above 79%.  If you take control of the person guarding the ball handler, and you attempt to block the shot, the CPU will ALWAYS pass out of the shot making a pinpoint accurate pass while spinning to a wide open man for another 3 pointer.  It's almost as if you pressing the block button tells the CPU to immediately pass.  I say this because the computer seems to pass the ball a split second before my block animation even starts.  Talk about being psychic.  Adding to this, on fast breaks your stupid teammates will still almost always float out to the 3 point line.SLIDERS REQUIRE MAJOR TWEAKING AND STILL DON'T SEEM TO WORK CONSISTENTLYKeep in mind all these issues are with clutch factor OFF.  After 2K9, I have always turned this garbage off because this is basically the equivalent of comeback AI where ANYONE can make 3 pointers with hands in their faces.  Turning this off in 2K11 seemed to serve me pretty well, but in 2K12 doing just this didn't help much.  I had to do some serious slider tweaking to cut down on all the CPU BS, and that includes making my Layup success 95%, and guess what, my players STILL miss layups on a regular basis!  Of course the CPU doesn't miss their layups because they have the magical ability to move the ball with so much speed it is able to pass right through defenders' chests.  WOW!BUGS/GLITCHESEven with all of this there are some terrible bugs/glitches with this game.  First, I get called for a back-court violation after I passed out of the back-court to another player, who was clearly past the line. I took a couple of dribbles forward, and then I'm whistled for a back-court?  Really?  Another time I clearly block Dwight Howard's dunk and the ball flies up in the air and out of bounds.  I foul him in the process, and that's fine, great D to prevent the dunk right?  WRONG, the game awards him an AND 1 and of course he hits the foul shot for the 3 point play.  The Magic were behind at the time, and with this being in the 4th QTR and all, the CPU HAD to score and couldn't let a unimportant thing like the ball NOT going through the hoop prevent them from getting 2 points, they have a game to win darnit!SUMMARYLuckily, not every game is like this, but it happens often enough that when it does happen, it frustrates me to no end.  When the CPU is not on their cheating BS, the game can be quite enjoyable, with great graphics, authentic crowd noise, and better commentary from the crew, however, I am glad I only paid 2 bucks for this game; otherwise it would already be on Ebay.While I like the NBA, I don't really have a favorite team and I like playing with all the teams, so what I always do with these games  is control all 32 teams, play a few exhibition games with one team to get a feel for the game, then I start a season.  When the season starts I play a few more big games with one team, then starting with the all-star game I flip a coin to determine which team I will control until the next substitution, this helps cut down on the frustration a little, and does seem to limit the influence \"Skynet\" has on the game while keeping the game exciting.  It is for this reason alone that I keep playing this game.  The Greatest Games mode is fun too, but still suffers from the same cheating that the regular games do.I don't care about my stats, achievements or anything like that for sports games; all care about is having fun.  To be honest, when I'm playing the CPU I really don't mind losing as long as the game is competitive but enjoyable.  But when the computer obviously CHEATS to make that happen the game is no longer fun.  If you beat me fair and square, then fine, but when you continuously make me miss wide open layups, swat at the ball all day long until you get a still without EVER getting a foul called just so you can catch up is not right.I could go on all day about this game, and I haven't even touched my player, but if it's anything like the My player in 2K11, I am pretty sure that would warrant another bad review in itself so I won't even bother.  I'll conclude this review by saying this may be the last NBA2K game I buy unless they fix all the AI issues.  Sadly this series appears to be going in the same direction as Madden and starting to do the same things that turned me off from that series 7 years ago.  I guess once you're on top, you have very little incentive to put forth the same effort you did to get there.  If EA were smart and was capable of producing a quality basketball game with better AI and game play (a big IF), they would release NBA Elite next season in an attempt to gobble up many disgruntled NBA 2K fans that are slowly but surely being turned off from this series.  If 2K doesn't get their act together, then I will be done with basketball sports games, just as I am done with NFL football games (except for 2K5 of course).Sorry 2K, I may have made the decision to choose you over EA a long time ago, but it will take a lot more to continue to please us fans than just on name alone, and I'm not going to give you a good review on a game if it's not warranted.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2012"}

This was certainly a surprise especially after a splash title like Call of Duty 4. You dont have expectations of it being better, the same or even a bit less, but not this bad. Did they change developers or change the original team? The only thing I can think of is they were in a huge hurry to get it out before Christmas and decided to go with a quick port from consoles. This would explain the muddy graphics and well not sure what to say about the storyline or game play.

It's about time that Square added voices to the Final Fantasy games, being that other companies were doing it in their Playstation 1 RPGs. My only problem is at times the voices aren't well done. They sound like middle school or high school actors just learning the craft (trust me I know).  That and Titus has a tendency to whine like a little spoiled brat. The best of the voices comes from Rikku as she actually sounds like she isn't just reading lines. The graphics are very nice, reminiscent of FF8 only better. The music, as is always the case, sounds like some of it was extracted from the other FF games. I'm not talking about the FF theme and the prelude. I'm talking Aeris's theme and the theme to Guru Volcano (The First Final Fantasy). But with so many games and so much music a lot of it starts sounding like each other. The story is somewhat more original and it seems to deviate from the giant meteor, or evil empire, or the evil magic user. All of the first 9 FFs should fit into those catagories by the way. You get to fight Sin in this one. That's right Sin. All I can tell is that it is this giant sphere-like thing (like the movie Sphere) that just sucks everything up like a giant vacuum. Though the real creature is inside the sphere but I won't give that away.  The story is also filled with massive amounts of religious and polictical connotations. This reminds me of FF Tactics or XenoGears. It is not a bad thing. If games have religion in them perhaps it can help strengthen faiths of the players. If children can 'become' violent because of video games maybe they can become more spiriual/religious as well. One can hope right??? The only problem is that the story is very adult.  And thus being adult it may not be suitable for younger players.  My recommended minimum age is 15.  Under no circumstances should anyone younger play this game.  Players have complained that the Final Fantasy games are too kiddie, well now they are getting there wish...and apparently they are now complaining it is too adult. If I had one to chose it would be adult.  The story is always better as it can have more substance. This is another great thing about the game. It is filled with story, and again people complain. No story, too much story, stop complaining and play the game. I have always figured that people who find a Final Fantasy with too much story are expecting an action or adventure game.  I hate to tell you this but RPG are supposed to have stories.  Sorry to break it to you. Anyway, I like FFX. Not that my opinion matters to some but still I like it. It hopefully shows that Squares games for the PS2 will turn around and become better. But wait I haven't talked about the battle system yet, silly me. Gone is ATB, and the peasants rejoiced. The battles are about as real time as they are going to get. Instead of a charge gauge everyone has a turn in the battle line-up. You would think that you have to wait until everything happens but this is not the case. Creatures don't attack simultaniously but you can get the battle moving quickly (almost life-like) by just having everyone attack as fast as they can. That's much better than waiting for a stupid little gauge to fill up. Another nice touch is that you can sub people in during the battle. Since EXP has been done away with if a character acts in a battle they get AP. AP acts like EXP but it works differetly. You get a certain number of AP and your skill level goes up allowing you to learn new skills on the skill gird provided you have skill orbs. That is how you power up your characters...through this skill grid. This grid must have more than 500 additions on it so &quot;leveling up&quot; may take longer than expected. But it's worth it to be able to have more than 9999 HPs, 999 MPs, and way over 9999 points of damage.  I do say that I hate the ending.  less than 20 minutes for a 40 hour game, the ending is too short.  Oh and by the way, yes you can shorten the summon times, it's called using the config menu.  That's all I will say. Don't give in to Sin, buy the game. (Please excuse the stupid joke.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2001"}

If you got a problem with that, then stop reading this right now or face the fanboy/fangirl rage that may build-up inside at someone who you think \"just doesn't get it\".Still with me? Okay then. The controls are dreadful. Whether they're \"supposed\" to be like that or not is irrelevant. They're way too loose, which isn't really much of a problem in the first few stages where stage-traps are almost non-existent and the enemies actually go after each other instead of just you, but once you get to the moving platforms, moving barriers that you have to stay within to not take additional damage, and slippery \"ice\", it gets frustrating real fast. I don't know how the online is because I only rented this and didn't pay for the online pass, but in story mode, you can only play as Sweet Tooth until you beat said story mode with him. You can drive different vehicles, but they're all piloted by Sweet Tooth whether you like him or not.

{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"Deimos \".\"","summary":"Easily best N64 game.","reviewText":"Awesome controls, greta levels, killer music, loads of cool guns and awesome James Bond.

The weakness for many Japanese RPG games is that \"you are only as good as your weapons\" and that is really true here. Finally, you have 3 people on your team in battle but with the lousy camera and button mashing all that does is make the combat more flashy and frantic, but not actually strategic.The story itself is quite linear, so no RPG elements there.

I have completed every Metroid game ever made and this is the first one that I have mixed feelings about.  I applaud Nintendo for going back to what made the original Metroid so good, but at the same time I feel cheated.  Here is why.Pros1)Graphics looked very good as far as levels,enemy's and cut-scenes were gorgeous except it felt like there were too many of them.2)3D third person platforming.  Metroid games are perfect for 2D or 3D side scrolling.  3D First person worked very good in the Metroid prime series but I honestly don't think I would want to play another.Cons1)First person shooting mode.  This is a horrible idea and never worked good in the game.  It is too frustrating to keep switching back and forth between modes.  The fact you cant move doesn't help either.  They should have kept the game in third person only.2)Level Design.  Having mostly one entrance and exit to rooms is not acceptable level design.  Most of the hidden places you had to go were just downright frustrating and hard to find.  Unlike all the other Metroid games that start you in one place and then you must explore gathering equipment you need to reach other places this game simple leads you along like a mouse in a maze. The whole process of Adam telling you when you can use weapons you already have is a horrible idea.  Having the game take place on a ship does not help either.3)Controls.  Not entirely horrible but still very sloppy and frustrating at times.  They should have incorporated the nun chuck with the game.4)Samus Speaks.  I don't think team ninja knows what a \"Silent protagonist\" is.  The whole idea behind the silent protagonist is that you create your own interpretation of the game character.  This would satisfy most people because Samus is a mysterious character.  Now she is a blond with daddy issues.  Very poor taste by team ninja and Nintendo.5)Music.  Talk about the most mediocre soundtrack I've ever heard.  The music was so bad I thought events were going to happen and nothing happened.  There were a few reminiscent melodies but for the most part there was no new impressionistic songs. The sound effects were not much better.6)Story.  Plot was terrible and more complicated then it needed to be. The original Metroid had a better story. Why on earth would Samus take orders from an organization she has no part of.  Most of the time I felt like I was an errand girl for Adam in the game.7)Other weird and frustrating things.  There are parts of the game where it turns into resident evil type of view.  You can only walk very slow and have no other actions.  This is very annoying and I saw no point to this.  Some boss fights were simple frustrating because of having to switch back and forth between first and third person views.  The idea of \"focus\" to replenish missiles and health is a ridiculous idea.  Why do you need to find more missiles if you could just replenish them?  No new weapons or abilities.  The map system was of very poor design.  The in game map never matched the orientation of the menu map so I was constantly confused on where I was.  On top of that in some areas where your in game map shows different rooms and doors the menu map shows you are in one room.ConclusionIf you have never played a Metroid game I think you might enjoy this game because you have no other Metroid games to compare too.  I myself am a hardcore Metroid player and feel as though this game can't hold up to the quality the other games have.  After I finished this game it did not feel like a Metroid game.  It felt more like Ninja Gaiden in space with some Metroid thrown in.  This game was lacking what made all the other Metroid games so great.  Creepy atmosphere, intriguing level design, moving music, and a story that made sense.  Overall this was a mediocre game.  Just what you would expect from Team Ninja, but not from Nintendo.I hope Link doesn't start talking next :/","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00004U1QY","description":"Nintendo certainly has added a quirky spin on the old English game withMario Tennis. With 16 classic Nintendo characters on hand, ranging from  Bowser to Baby Mario, the crux of the game is the standard game of tennis, with  its break points, deuces, and double faults, but also with the added bonus of  power-ups and special moves.The game revolves around the individual players, and, as in other Mario  adventures, the characters all have their own strengths and weaknesses. Bowser  is great for the sheer strength and his powerful smashes, while other characters  survive on speed and agility, rather like inMario KartorMario  Golf.With Exhibition, Tournament, and Multiplayer modes, the game does have a number  of options to keep you busy. The chance to play with up to three other players  makes this game great to play with your friends.With this game, Nintendo has done to tennis what it did to kart racing and golf,  by producing a fun spin on what's not usually the most fun in computer games.  This is how tennis should be: super smashes, special combos, and Mario running  around in circles.--Stuart Miles--Amazon.co.ukNintendo has incorporated characters from the Super Mario Brothers series into a tennis simulation game for up to 4 players.  Each player manipulates a selected character from the 13 in the series.  There are multiple levels of difficulty.  Players need to learn the types of strategies used in traditional tennis; each can choose how to hit the ball over the net by selecting from a wide range of moves, some of which may be unique to the character each has chosen.

The handheld also requires an adapter when connecting with GBA players, since it can't use the old cables.","reviewerName":"Joel McGee","summary":"For collectors and enthusiasts","reviewText":"First off a short history lesson on the Game Boy Micro:The DS was originaly not designed to be the successor to the Game Boy Advance, but rather a \"third pillar\" going along with the Gamecube. The idea was that the DS would be a higer end device with it's unique features while the GBA would be for a more budget minded gamer; at least that was the plan back in 2004.The Micro was designed in 2005 to take advantages of the strenghts of the platform (affordability, conservative hardware) marketed towards those who want to game on the go but don't want a bulky system like the DS or PSP. In that respect the Micro made a lot of sense and it accomplished it's goals, but a lot was lost in the process.The Micro (in case you haven't guessed) is the smallest system Nintendo has ever made, and the last to bear the name Game Boy. In your hand it feels very small, about the same size as a NES controller or basic cell phone. You can easily hold in and wrap your hands around the unit without much effort. The size is by far the most compelling feature of the system.The button layout is similar to that of the NES controller with A and B on the front to the right of the screen, the D-Pad (which nearly identical to the DS lite's) is on the left, and the start and select buttons beneath the screen almost at the bottom of the unit. L and R are on top and are suprisingly large and feel great. The layout is a bit crampt (as to be expected) but works well enough. In terms of comfort, the face buttons better than the original GBA, and the shoulder buttons more comforable than the SP's, but basically it falls in between the two.The screen I think is somewhere in between too. It's much better than the orginal GBA's, it has a very nice even backlight, and is sharp and clear, besting even the SP for lighing and clarity. However, I can't help but to be put off by the small size, and it still falls short of what the SP lite offers.Sound quality leaves a lot to be desired, even compared to previous version. It's tinny, weak, and of course mono. It does work mind you, but put on even a decent pair of earbuds and you will immediatley notice a huge difference. The restored headphone jack is very nice, a bit ackwardly placed (bottom right of the unit) but I'd rather have it that way than not at all like the SP. The sound and backlight can be adjusted by the volume buttons on the side, similarly designed to the XL,(just hold the L button while adjusting for the backlight) I really love the way it's set up and think that it's not only functional but intuitive.So how do I like it? I think it's cool to have such a small, super portable GBA with such an amazing screen. It fits so well in my pocket, and feels like its very durable. It's reliable and not only that it's customizable with faceplates. (They can be found on Amazon for about $5) I can carry it around for a quick round of Street Fighter Alpha 3 or Mario Kart. With all that said, I find it hard to reccomend to anyone who isn't a collector or enthusiast, heres why:1 Unlike all other models of the GBA, it won't play original Game Boy or Game Boy color cartidges. If that is a compelling feature for you, you can mark the Micro off your list.2 They are hard to find. The Micro did not sell well, and was considered a commercial failure. So finding a Micro will be more difficult to come by than the original GBA or SP.3 They are expensive when you do find them. I say expensive relatively speaking. Depending on condition they range from $65 to $100. The DS can be found for about that price and the SP for about half that price.4 They are less functional. The Micro can connect to other systems (other GBA's and the GCN) but requires and $8 adapter in addition to the link cables needed. And if you're going the DS route, you're getting the next gen system with a lot more functionality only lacking the connectivity.In a nutshell you are paying a high price for portablity. For the money the better bets are the SP, or the DS. Either one gets you more bang for the buck. But if you are like me, who already have said systems, there is something inherantly cool about owning a Micro. If you want more info about the best way to go check out my review of the SP, and forthcoming review of the DS lite.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2012"}
