{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.  PadillaPros:Excellent puzzle designAesthetically and stylistically brilliantAppropriately understated soundCons:Most players will finish it in fewer than 10 hoursBattles are too easy","reviewerName":"S. Morales","summary":"A Mysterious Masterpiece","reviewText":"The mysterious game called Ico never made a splash upon release, nor did it really try to. Just like its quiet and shadowy approach within the game, its marketing was just as ambiguous. While I think this game was definitely underrated by audiences, it was just a TAD overrated by critics. You control a boy born with horns called Ico, who's been banished away to an immense castle as we're told \"for the good of the village.\" There you escape and find a white glowing princess, and you must lead her and yourself out of there while trying to avoid the princess being captured by her dark lordess mother and her ghouls, while solving puzzles along the way to get out.Eyes and Ears: 4/5: On a simply artisitc level, Ico is brilliant and beautiful. It's apparent with both graphics and sound the designers were trying to go for a more artsy approach rather than a straight-out bar-none eye-popping design. The graphics in this game are gorgeous, but not to the casual observer, as most of its inspired level design, attention to detail, and polished glitz are greatly overshadowed by a misty fog, or a layer of light calming \"fuzz.\" This effect gives the mysterious world at some mysterious time a sense of surrealistic ambience, almost as if we were dreaming this whole adventurous ordeal.Sound I can summerize in one word: quiet. The ONLY music that ever plays during the game is when you're loading your game, if you die, and during the ending. The other 95% of the time there is no sound but various doves flying around, footsteps, clanks during battle, the main character's mystery language, and other sound effects. At first I felt the game could've only benefited from some beautiful fantasy type music, but later swallowed my words, as doing so would make this dreamlike experience, well, far less dreamlike.Hands: 3/5: While everything else in this game was beautiful, I have to give an 'eh' to the controls. See, the camera is self moving, which means you can't control it and you must move the analog stick in the appropriate direction depending on what angle the camera is pointing (always annoying). Also, I've fallen more times than I needed to thanks to Ico's running being too loose to what degree I'm holding the analog stick. On top of that, during battles it's basically mashing the same button towards whatever enemy you're fighting... but keep in mind, battle is simply an icing on the cake in this game (an easy icing), the fundamental thing here is puzzle solving. Decent controls, but would have appreciated a tighter feel.Brains: 4/5: While many complain that the puzzle aspect in this game isn't anywhere near the challenge they thought it would be, it's for good reason: this isn't Myst. There are no collecting items for later strategic use, or reading riddles and trying to figure out how to solve a puzzle from them, or connecting jigsaw pieces together. The \"puzzle\" aspect in this game are from trying to find a way out of what specific area you're in, and not only that, but trying to get the princess a way out as well (because she's not as nimble as you and can't do as much). Getting from point A to B is the only point. Also, I think the concentration on this is only greater emphasized by the fact that there are no health meters, no power-ups, no hidden treasures, no timers. The only ways to die or lose is if the princess gets captured and pulled into the ghoul's black hole, or if you fall from a far distance. (hint: if you find yourself straying too far away from the princess, you're not doing the puzzle right and she WILL be captured - always keep her as close as possible)Hormones: 4.5/5: While in the beginning most gamers may find this to be too slow, the more patient and sensitive gamer will fall in love with this one. Though you may think this game has no point, play it long enough (well, not too long, I beat it in 8 hours) and the characters will grow on you, leading to one of the sweetest and most heart-touching endings I've seen in a game in a very long while.See, the most beautiful thing about this game lies in its mystery. The fact that you don't know what time you're in, or what world (or universe) you're in, or who EXACTLY these characters are, where they came from and where they go afterwards. Nor do you know what language they're speaking in (everything's subtitled). Still, you fall in love with this brave boy and beautiful princess because you become one with their adventure, and you learn more about their character based on this rather than just having 20 pages of backstory written by the game designer.The purest ones who don't care for meglomania in games will see this one through and appreciate it greatly in the end. There most likely will be no sequal, or prequal, or spin-off. This is just a random but uniquely gorgeous little bird in a huge forest of birds who'll only be noticed and appreciated by a few. And just like a dream, this one comes to an end short, but the ride is great while it lasts.If you're into castles, heroism, fantasy and lovable characters and need a break from blowing people's heads off (I did for a little bit) pick this one up now. Considering most people have it for less than $20, you've got nothing to lose.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000RZPW9W","reviewerName":"VA Gamer","summary":"Incomplete product, very unstable, poor customer service","reviewText":"I purchased Age of Conan two days after its official launch. I played it for the duration of the initial free 30 day subscription you receive when you purchase the game.* Be wary of reviews that only mention the area designed for new players, or extrapolate upon very minor features such as \"character creation\". These things, while strong in this game, are going to account for but a tiny part of your overall experience. My review focuses on aspects of the game that will affect your enjoyment from day one right on through day thirty - namely stability, content, and customer service. *To start, I'll focus on the stability and quality of the application itself: Age of Conan is extremely unstable, being plagued by bugs that will crash your system for a variety of reasons. The game client has a lingering memory leak that has continued to wax and wane in prevalence since launch. As of the writing of this review, the stability of the client is still very poor and the memory leak is still very pervasive (you can verify this by visiting Funcom's official forums for Age of Conan). I attempted to use two separate high-end systems, both different architectures: one has an AMD 64 bit CPU, quad core, with a NVidia video card, the other is a dual core Intel-based system with an ATI video card. The Intel system runs Windows XP Pro SP2 and has 3.5 GB of RAM. The AMD system runs Vista Premium and has 4 GB of RAM. Both video cards are current generation, and are capable of running other modern games at the highest settings without issue. I tried running the client with my drivers and firmware fully up to date, attempted using different versions, and a wide variety of other modifications, but could never run the game with any semblance of stability. To qualify, I am a very well paid IT worker with over ten years of experience. I am currently a network engineer and work with everything from storage area networks to basic system analysis and administration for Netware and Windows servers (and occasionally Linux). I know full well what I'm doing.Next, regarding the advertising of the product: Age of Conan is missing much of what is promised on the box, including technical features such as DirectX 10 (if you're not tech saavy, DirectX is an \"application programming interface\" for mutlimedia - graphics and audio. DirectX 10 is the latest and greatest version). DirectX 10 offers more powerful visual effects and cleaner, more detailed graphics. This game only supports DirectX 9. Large scale player-versus-player combat is not fully implemented. End-game \"raiding\" (content meant for large groups of players) is generally inaccessible to the average player. More on lacking features later.Regarding game play: The virtual game world is not well realized. Many of the zones (sections of the virtual world) you adventure within may look large and expansive, but only a very small area is actually navigable; you are confined by invisible barriers into very small, track-like spaces. And unlike other MMO's where players can travel freely through an immersive persistent world, Age of Conan is heavily \"instanced\". That is, only a small number of people can be in any zone at the same time. When more players try to enter zone a new instance is created, which is a copy of the zone in which a set number of players are allowed into. So, although there may be 80 people in one zone, there may be four instances of that zone with only 20 players in each (I'm using arbitrary numbers as an example, it varies by zone).Again, back to content: the game is very light on this. Aside from the very polished starting area that guides you through your first 19-20 levels, there isn't many fun and compelling activities. The quests are very formulaic and pedestrian (kill x amount of y, bring them to me), and quickly dissapear at higher levels, forcing players to \"grind\" (repeatedly killing the same creatures over and over again, for hours, to advance in the game). The crafting system, a staple of the MMO genre, is severely lacking. It does not reward appropriately for time spent, feels largely incomplete, and for lack of a better word is terribly boring. The developer is constantly making adjustments to how the character classes function, which is frustrating to players as they are forced to keep \"respeccing\" (modifying the abilities of their character skills), which costs money. Accruing money consumes considerable time. You get the picture. Many core game mechanics, such as character stats (think the standard Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom...) do not actually work. All of the gear your characters can use look similar, typically some form of a kilt, and is some hue of brown 99% of the time (I promise you I am not exaggerating). I could literally go on all day in this section. Suffice to say the game isn't very fun, as much of it is missing or does not function correctly.And finally, there is virtually no customer service: in-game petitions for assistance routinely last for twelve hours or longer without being responded too, and more often than not are deleted with no notification, and no reason given as to why. To compound problems, The developer FunCom openly admitted on their official forums that the majority of customer service (both in-game and moderators on their web forums) currently consists of volunteers.A fair warning to anyone thinking about purchasing this game. Buyer beware.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0042WXQ62","description":"","reviewerName":"NeuroSplicer","summary":"CUSTOMER ABUSE FROM HERE TO ETERNITY","reviewText":"2K GAMES is a known offender. Ever since the infamousBioShock, where the draconian and potentially illegal DRM scheme made more noise than the game itself, this game publisher never wavered from its anti-customer attitude and there-is-a-sucker-born-ever-minute scheming mentality. I should had known better.The only reason I bought this game was because I found it at a basement-bargain price. So, yes, 2K GAMES did manage to get some of my money for a while but I vow it will be the very last time. Please read on.My copy was of the 2-DVD version so I did not have to download ...9GB for the 1.4 Patch and the DLCs. However, my horror story was only beginning. After about 25min of installing, the game failed to authenticate so the installation rolled back. Apparently this was not a unique problem with my copy but a common problem well known to 2K GAMES. Hence, the redirection to their website where one has to download a Manual-Authentication Tool, unzip it and create an Authentication-Request file which is then used online to create a Manual-Authentication file - and all this **before** reinstalling the game.Since this is as far from common installation process as it gets, at some point I clicked the wrong option, terminating the manual Authentication before it was completed. As a result, the game then refused to either complete its installation or run the Manual-Authentication Tool! It was only after it dawned to me to use REVO UNINSTALLER to completely remove the AMD(!) drivers (and what were AMD drivers doing in my INTEL system, I wonder), and then hunt down and delete the correct (and hidden) SecuROM folder that the Manual Authentication Tool...graced me to resume.Now I would have to store the Manual Authentication Tool and keep it in perpetuity for whenever I would want to reinstall the game in the future (and why did 2K GAMES not include it on the game disk since this was a well known problem?). Not that it will do me any good when 2K GAMES goes bankrupt in some years and there is no way to authenticate the game...All in all, it took me over two hours to install a game - totally unacceptable for a GOTY edition, where every bug and kink is supposed to be ironed out. Apparently this game publisher has a warehouse of bugs and kinks **especially** made for its GOTY editions!And I am not even going to go into why the fourth DLC does not appear to be installed...If you think it was downhill from there, well, think again. Not only does the game require the disk to remain in the drive whenever one wants to play but it has to...re-authenticate it. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. And, yes, that means ONLINE re-Authentication! My DSL service was down for about 12hours and clicking on the game shortcut, you guessed it, all it got me was a SecuROM window informing me to &#34;replace my backup copy with the original game disk&#34; (which, of course, already was in the drive).The overzealous SecuROM version is so jumpy that it will refuse to authenticate even if I have already given it unrestricted access through my firewall. Clicking on the desktop icon of the game does not work. The only way to run the game is to pop-out the disk from drive and then pop it back in, wait for all the splash screens to cycle and then choose play. This usually works one time out of 5 or 6 tries. That's quality, right?The game itself is not bad - certainly not as awful as the DRM scheme it comes bundled with! It may not be that original, it is far more of an FPS than an RPG to be called an...RPS and the tedium of pointless go-and-fetch &#34;quests&#34; is hardly alleviated by the bazzilion of guns available but it has it moments. Unfortunately, these moments are lost in the aggravation caused by the hoops one has to jump through in order to be...permitted to use the game we have already paid for.The good people at Amazon accepted my return of this defective product, so it is this the lesson I learned for free:NEVER AGAIN WILL I **EVER** TRUST 2K Games TO BUY ANY OF THEIR RELEASES AGAIN!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002ZJNWWC","description":"","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"Head Shots Not Quick Shots","reviewText":"I don't understand all the hate that this game is getting. It has one of the most gripping campaigns that I've played in a while. No the story is not that well developed, but that just adds to the feel of the game. You feel like a soldier that is just getting orders and has no idea what the main goal is. There are cutscenes that look amazing that show your commanders making decisions for you on the ground but its not that developed. The end of the game is perfect. It honors our troops and makes you truly empathize with their plight. I just hope that this is not how the series ends and another is made because you feel at the end that these soldiers journey is not over.The gameplay is a normal 1st person shooter with some nice tweaks. You can slide to cover which is always awesome. Two primary weapons can be held at all times along with your trusty pistol which has unlimited ammo. There is a snap on feature that is similar to the COD series which helps those that are not that familiar with the FPS genre. I don't use it that often, but it does come in handy sometimes. There are quads to drive, Apache's to pilot, and levels where you have to guide an AC 130's targeting. Overall a very fun and varied campaign.The atmosphere in this game is perfect. When the sun is in front of you there is actually a glare, and the enemies use this in certain levels to ambush you. Also the snow and nighttime effects are done really well and make you feel like you are in Afghanistan alongside these soldiers. The cutscenes add to this atmosphere with some great directing prowess that actually look and feel like a war movie with lots of gunfire, and quick shaky cameras when you are running for your life.This game is not without flaws though. The graphics engine while amazing most of the time has some pop in especially when sniping. Also there is occasionally frame rate drops, but it never causes the game to freeze and only lasts for a second. Neither of these hurts the overall beauty of this game. The last complaint that I have is the length of the campaign. It is only 4 and a half hours long on the medium difficulty setting. Now this is disappointing, but what occurs in this time is memorable and I recommend at least a rent if your only in it for the single player.This game is a great alternative to the those that need a little change in the 1st person shooter genre. It really puts you in the shoes of the men fighting the war on terror. I didn't even try the multiplayer so if that is what you are looking for you have to check another review. This is a great reboot to a storied franchise, and Call of Duty better watch itself because Medal of Honor wants its FPS crown back.P.S It's really fun playing through Frontline again. The graphics are not mind blowing but a definite upgrade from the original ps2 port. I only hope they continue to upgrade more of these games.

But many will dislike the gore, and the lack of overall playstyle variety.THE LONG: Playing this game made me feel like I was The Predator. Some may not like Manhunt but I sure did! What an adrenaline rush it was to startle my enemies, then run around corners and hide, only to slowly creep out of the shadows and murder them one by one. Playing this game made me feel less like Solid Snake and more like Jim at the end of 28 Days Later.Your heart beats as you rush around corners, hoping there will be a dark place to hide and not a dead end. And once in those shadows, it's a waiting game as you watch the gang members and stay patient long enough to jump him from behind when he turns around. All the while, the ambient music is expertly scoring the whole scene.Drawing your enemies out with noises and lures is fun, as it makes you develop tricks that help you isolate a single enemy from the group (and gives you a great feeling of satisfaction when you take him down without the others noticing). It's equally thrilling when you accidentally get caught sneaking around, or when someone jumps out to surprise you. I don't exagerrate when I say that there will be several times in Manhunt where your whole body will literally jerk in shock when someone jumps out from around a quiet corner and chases you down (The late-game battle with \"Piggsy\" is a pulse-quickening masterpiece). But Manhunt gives you loads of places to hide, and some great controls to help you do your best to stay alive.The voice acting is fantastic, with your sadistic director sounding like a genuine, twisted person on the other end of your headset barking out orders. Gang members also sound good as they call you all sorts of names and do everything they can to make you reveal yourself.And of course there's the violence. Heads will be cut off, faces bashed in, and shotgun blasts will do their thing. It's a very grim game, loaded with death and just about every swear word I know of. But to me that actually helps this game feel more serious, like I'm dealing with real personalities and real lives. Still, there's a definite satisfaction when you succesfully lure out and execute one of your tormentors, only to retreat back into the shadows to lure out another.Bottom line- Honestly, to compare it to Metal Gear's stealth system is too easy. It's actually much more fun, and more pulse-quickening. This whole game is all about racking up kills while breathlessly trying to stay alive yourself (like I said, the whole game is almost just like the climactic ending mansion scene in 28 Days Later).There's a definite storyline to the game as well, and while it's interesting, it's nothing ground-breaking (although the subject matter is somewhat new to videogames). And if you quickly tire of the stealth/hide mechanism, then just quit playing because that's basically the whole game. Massive artillery is introduced halway through the game and you do a little more shooting than hiding, but the game's still about stealth so if you hate the beginning you probably won't stay with it.There are some definite tough spots, and you'll get frustrated every now and then, but don't give up.  You'll be missing one of the most unique and exciting games to come along in a while.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2005"}

The  graphics are sub-par, sometimes they look good and sometimes it looks like PS2. The textures in particular are pretty bad. The spell effects are always very nice, and good lighting. I like pretty shiny things like everybody else, but thats the least important thing in an RPG and after awhile of playing you don't notice it anymore.The combat on consoles is very KOTOR. They took away isometric view making it PC only. This annoys me alittle as its hard to see the battlefield from the over the shoulder camera. Though it does make it more immersive when playing a particular character in the your party. The AI combat scripting is pretty good, so I just focus on controlling my character and that way the camera doesn't bother me.The origin stories are very well done. The dialogue is excellent and I don't mind not having my character voiced if it means more possible interaction. The story overall is excellent. Character customization is very well done, but mages might be a bit OP; even considering that their mages. Theres plenty of phat loots to be had. The game is NOT sandbox and while not particularly linear it does drag you in a certain direction.It loses one star for the camera issues and graphical hiccups.To put it simply, if you like RPG's at all and aren't obssessed about graphics; and can live with the fact that the combat is more KOTOR then BG; buy this game NOW.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

Although the demo didn't impress me, the reviews convinced me to give this game a try. I was EXTREMELY impressed by the single-player campaign. While BF series has been known for the online multiplayer component, this campaign was thoroughly impressive from start to finish. The gameplay, while nothing revolutionary, is quite polished, with sharp visuals, excellent level design, spot-on controls. It exceeded my expectations completely.The multiplayer also impresses as expected. Vehicle gameplay is awesome, and the ability to spawn stragetically at various spots on the huge maps is spectacular.

Unfortunately it was marred by an incredibly predictable plot, really bad dialogue and robotic voice acting. But it's one of those kind of games that you really want to admire if it wasn't for its faults and boy does this game have faults.Story: There's a war going on and caught in the middle of it is Dart, a young warrior orphaned by something called the Black Monster. So Dart, his childhood friend Shana and an increasing number of friends have to battle evil to save the world yadda yadda.Graphics: Keep in mind this is Playstation. That being said the in-game graphics look okay at times with certain environments looking nice at times but others look horribly bad. However where the game shines is its FMVs. That is the good ones, since some of them are literally looking at old manuscripts or images with a voice-over. Why they even bothered, I don't know.Sound/Music: Fairly unimpressive. I forgot most of the tracks right away and like I said, the voice acting at times is incredibly stilted like they were worried of sounding too \"emotional\" during a recording.Gameplay: Hm, well it's essentially the same as Final Fantasy games on the PSX, walk around screens, get into random encounters(that occur WAY too frequently). The only difference is that there's Additions that you can use. They're kind of like combos where you have to hit a button at the right time to get more hits. It's an okay system but work on your timing, otherwise it's gonna be terrible for you in the long run.Is it a recommendable game? Hard to say. It's certainly a likable game at times but other times you feel like \"ugh, why do I get this thing?\" Best thing to do is just try it out and if it's bad, then sell it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2006"}

After completing the game i stopped playing online and did not touch the game for several months due to Gears 2.  After several DLC's and zombie maps and Chevos, i completeted the game on veteran and i almost threw my controller at the TV and the xbox out the window.  95% of the time i died from grenades and its impossible to stay hidden.  Its not just 1 grenade being thrown at your, its like 2-5 and when you try to run, you get gunned down.  You have to use your items like smoke and molotovs as they provide cover and keeps the enemy back.  If you have trouble as I did, you can watch some utube videos to get the answers you need.The new zombie maps are awesome and you can find people with no problem.  You can pick the zombie map and it will tell you how many people are playing that map.  Its a little frustrating due to people dropping out or people wanting to glitch and poeple getting mad so they leave.  Having to start over at level 1 everytime you die sucks but i find it better if i play alone, but the more poeple their are, the more zombies their will be on every level.  the random box gives you powerful weapons but at the same time it can give you nothing at the same time it could move to a different location.  Their are also 4 perks that can be bought such as speed cola, double tap, quick revive and jaugernaut.Online is still exciting but not as good as COD 4.

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the widerWhite Knight Chroniclescommunity on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale. The game also offers an online interface known as GeoNet that allows players to communicate with others via blogs, forums, quest logs and voice chat functionality, as well as post snapshots from their journeys using the Crystal Camera in-game tool.Key Game FeaturesWhite Knight Transformation- During single player combat players can transform into the giant White Knight, gaining the ability to challenge large enemies as well as troops of soldiers throughout the adventure.The Customizable Avatar Character- Using a wide array of sliders and customization options, players are able to create a unique character that can join the adventure in single player mode as well as online.Combo Battle System- Engage in an accessible, active turn-based battle system that caters to players of all levels allowing both default attack settings and a system for for maximum damage.JRPG (Japanese RPG) Action for PS3- Experience true JRPG action on PS3 that incorporates a variety of online gameplay elements.Beautiful Environments- Players traverse through 13 stages, as well as visit up to six towns/villages to visit and purchase items at shops or interact with NPCs.

Remember, folks, the word \"professional\" just means that someone is paid to do something...not that they are necessarily good at it.First and foremost, realize a title like WKC isn't hyped enough for the publisher to bribe video game review websites for a decent review (unlike Grand Theft Auto IV or Modern Warfare 2).  Also...if you think IGN or Gamespot or any other review website isn't \"bribed\" in some way to ignore or make light of a highly hyped game's sucky spots then I want some of the kool-aid you're drinking so that I can ride home on the mothership with you.With that being said, let's get down to the game.The Good:Graphics - The latest consoles have pretty much spoiled us.  We expect greatness and beauty and this game delivers.  The characters are very detailed and the environments are rich and colorful.  I am still amazed at how well the latest games can capture the look of water.  The devil is in the details and WKC delivers very well.Sound -  The voice acting is about par for a decent JRPG.  There are some seriously corny parts but if you enjoy Japanese RPGs and anime then everything will mesh perfectly.  The music is very lovely and flows right along with the game.  It manages to fade into the background for a pleasant \"white noise\" effect as should the music in any RPG.  Those of you reading this review that cut your teeth on the 8-bit classics of Zelda and Final Fantasy will most likely already have the ability to filter out repetitive gameplay music.  Fortunately for WKC, the music is infinitely better than a tune that can be accurately demonstrated on a xylophone and I find myself listening to it frequently without wishing I could scoop my eardrums out and throw them down a garbage disposal.Gameplay - Turn based RPG with a twist.  I really enjoy building my own fighting combos from the base list of acquired moves.  If a certain move becomes boring you are able to change it up a bit.  Not to mention that if a certain enemy winds up really pissing you off that you can (minus banging your hands together to form a sword) transform into Voltron and beat the ever loving crap out of it.  Transforming Leonard into the White Knight is great once he's fully transformed.  Suddenly you're not so scary any more are you, you piece of troll arse!The Bad:With the exception of Chrono Trigger, EVERY game has at least one sucky spot in it somewhere...and WKC is no exception.Graphics - The game is stunning.  Seriously.  However, I find myself wishing for a bit more detail on the monsters.  Why am I fighting little evil beavers and venus flytraps on crack?  That was seriously the most creative thing they could come up with?  The trolls are cool looking as well as the Magi knights...but when I get up close they seem like they should be fighting Gumby.  It's like every effort was made to avoid enemies with faces and detail.  The plants are just a green sideways pac-man, the little evil beavers are wearing Klan masks, the troll is all nose, and the knights all have on helmets.  I imagine this was to save time so that it could be spent on the main heroes and villians...but at the end of the day I feel like the hero should be wearing a big Jack-in-the-Box head.  Also...what is with the \"Avatar\"?  I custom made my avatar and spent a lot of time on him and when I'm done he looks like a damn nutcracker compared to Leonard.  I even put a mole under one of his eyes and he STILL looks like friggen Pinnoccio!  The only good thing about the custom character is that I can give him the same eyes that Cartman from South Park had when he was trying to fart out a satellite that aliens had stuffed up his anus.Sound - There is one certain character that I already want to go back and lead into an ambush so that he dies.  Why is it in EVERY game the character with the biggest ears (Batman excluded) has the most annoying voice EVER?  The little rabbit creatures make me want to drop-kick baby otters.  While running around the characters in your party will sometimes just spout out random crap.  THE SAME RANDOM CRAP OVER AND OVER AND OVER.  I would even be fine if they made fun of me, \"Damn it...this guy keeps running us into every freaking enemy on the map!\"  or \"Wrong way, a**h***!\"  No...I have to hear about \"That dark knight...he was formidable.\"  Or something along those lines.  That's the ONLY good thing about the Avatar character...he has no voice of his own because he's supposed to be YOU.  Ugh...Gameplay -  I hate multiplayer on any game.  HATE it.  If I wanted to play an online \"RPG\" I'd go play with the little foul mouthed jerks on WoW that haven't hit puberty yet.  So...I make my Avatar and then he's introduced to the main character as \"the new guy\".  He has NO voice of his own and just makes facial expressions and grunts.  Basically...he's the RPG version of Beaker from the Muppets.  He even makes the jaw drop face.  I kept waiting for him to get electrocuted and for his eyeballs to light up.  All we're missing is for the Swedish Chef to start throwing dead chickens around screaming \"UM GESH DE BORK BORK!\"  That being said I cannot comment on the multiplayer (I'll leave that to other reviewers) but am thouroughly enjoying the single player now that I have enough other characters to stuff the stupid self-made avatar out of sight.Future reference for game makers:  SEPARATE THE MULTIPLAYER!!!!  If I want to play multiplayer then let me make a multiplayer character or make the multiplayer character grow along with Leonard but keep him out of sight.  The idea of the \"Avatar\" is completely freaking stupid.  It's like I have this mute squire following me around waiting for me to tell him to shine my boots and drops his jaw straight down every time something dramatic happens.  Remember the chancellor from Chrono Trigger?  Yeah, the Avatar makes a face just like that but in today's graphics.The battle elements have a few...quirks.  The \"Wait Meter\" that is present in most turn-based RPGs is annoying as hell.  It's a huge obtrusive circle that disappears if an enemy steps out of range so that you have to reset the damn thing every time it closes.  Not to mention that you transform back into boring old Leonard if you're Voltron and kick the crap out of something and there are no more enemies around.  What the hell is that?  What if I wanted to run over to another troll a few screens away after I finish using up ALL of my Action Coins on becoming Voltron?  I then have to go and get smacked in the face by KKK Beavers and green sideways Pac-Mans or score a bunch of hits to build back up my action coins.Also...why the hell does it take so long to become The White Knight?  I know Voltron took forever to transform but that was stupid too.  If I were the badguy in Voltron I'd run up and start kicking the stupid right out of Voltron while his ass was trying to transform.  Well...in THIS game the badguys figured the same thing.  While I'm reciting the entire latin phrase found on the side of a pack of cigarettes and the bottom of three different brands of beer the badguys are beating the ever loving poo out of my face.Also...for being an invention of the Ancients and having ultimate power the White Knight is slow as hell.  I have to wind up like I'm getting ready to tee off on a lobbed baseball and then all of my moves look the same.  Why the hell does Voltron have to be so damn slow?  Grab that sword in two hands if you have to and CHOP THE BADGUY!!!Leveling up is also nice...but I can't tell what the hell I'm going to unlock after I choose a skill.  This is stupid, in my opinion.  I should be able to see what the progress will be of learning a certain move and if I deem it as useless then I can move on to the next training topic.I'll end here and say that, all-in-all, this is a great Japanese RPG.  If you do not like JRPGs, however, you will not like this game...and just like the professional review sites you had no business playing this game in the first place.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2010"}

Logitech has done a really great job with this wheel and while it's pretty expensive, it's money well spent if your into racing games.This wheel is just about as close as you can get to a true arcade feel. The fact that the PS3 has such revolutionary graphics helps matter as well because the whole experience really does feel like it's real. The wheel is comfortable and extremely responsive as is the gas pedal. The shifter is also extremely responsive as well. The finishing on the wheel is great because it makes the whole thing feel like your driving a real car. I haven't played any PC games but I can definitely recommend it for PS3.I don't really have any complaints with this product, which is good given it's hefty price tag. Logitech has made a really revolutionary racing wheel that immerses you right into the game. It may be more expensive than the Wii but serious racing game fans will really enjoy this wheel. I can't imagine playing another racing game without it. It's too bad it's not compatible with Mario Kart 64, that would be really amazing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2009"}

There are a variety of missions & weaponry and you just can't go wrong when you're shooting up Nazis in WWII.  However, if you're a ONE CLEAN HEADSHOT kind of shooter, then you're going to be sorely disappointed with this one!  While there are spots when you put your sniping skills to use, the majority of combat is either in trenches, partially destroyed French homes or across fields when you're storming a German position.  And you can literally shoot 20 shots sometimes before a guy falls, depending on the weapon and firing distance.One thing that really irked me was how you take ferocious blasts from fixed machine gun positions, but then once you take one out and assume control of the gun, THERE'S NOBODY LEFT TO SHOOT!!  So you take down an MG42 Gunner and just get to shoot up the French Countryside and maybe a couple of random vehicles before moving on.  While this seems to make sense on the surface (you take the defensive position AFTER you've taken the ground, hence no bad guys left to shoot), wouldn't it be more accurate to think that these positions would have MG42s placed around a perimeter or in more than one side of a house?  After all, the French learned what a tragic mistake a single fortifed line of defense can be with their Maginot Line.Since this game doesn't give you advanced weaponry that obviously didn't exist in 1944, it would've been much sweeter to mow down retreating Nazis with their own MG42s...I can only remember 2 times you get to use one of the fixed MGs and once when you can pick one up and briefly use it.  Just know that when you're using the fixed gun you can and will take heavy fire and frequently have to back off and relinquish the gun unless you want to start the checkpoint over.  Which is another thing...Sometimes the checkpoint saves are quite LONG.  So you can move through a good chunk of territory, make a single mistake and end up going back to the start of that area.  This isn't really unusual in a video game, just somewhat annoying.This game is very unforgiving if you decide to sit back and get into a stationary shootout with your enemies...They will respawn and respawn until you get up and lead your squad forward.  And you DO have to lead them forward most of the time since the AI can be downright stupid, even hilarious.  It's stupid when they block you from getting around in tight quarters or when they jump right in front of your firing weapon...But it's even funny when you're taking a trench and you're behind cover trying to shoot the trench free and your guys just come charging into it right past you and get filled with lead, one by one, a half-dozen by a half-dozen...The bodies literally start piling up right in front of you.There are 2 other \"control type\" issues I had with this game.  First, you have to ROTATE -- Repeat -- ROTATE the L and R joysticks to direct mortar fire...It's not as simple as just pushing the sticks in the desired direction like in 99.9% of other instances when you use the sticks.  This failure of mine to read ROTATE in the correct way led to a 2 month delay in me completing this game.  I kept getting into the trench where you first use the mortar to CLEAR THE ROAD and I kept shooting rounds into the trees and on the hill wondering WHY it was so hard to direct the fire.  Pretty soon a Nazi would jump into the trench and I'd have to start the level again...And again...And again, until I just quit this one and played through some other games before returning to it.I also had trouble getting the jeep to drive in reverse.  There are a couple of spots where you take over the jeep and have very little room to turn around just driving forward.  Drive it into blockage and you're STUCK!  Oddly enough I changed the view to overhead and was able to back up...But in first person view I just couldn't get it to back up.  It really sucked being stuck up next to a fence or house while trying to turn around...I also MISSED THE FINAL CUT SCENE after fighting through the entire game!  I had no idea I was at the end of the game after blowing up the advancing tanks and was going to pause the game to take a break...I pushed the start button when the scene started playing and BAM!, the credits started rolling.  It would've been nice to see the final scene and maybe I can restart the checkpoint if the game lets me...But if not, I'll get over it.  That's just one more thing that kept adding up to a gaming experience the ended up being inferior to COD4.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2009"}

I was kicked out and told that the file is corrupted.  After erasing starting all over again, it still kept telling me that the file was CORRUPTED.

Enemies would spawn versus coming from an entrance.  You know.

I really enjoy action RPG style games.Overall Fable 2 is a fun game to play that feels like it's trying to scale to something great but falls short. It's limiting, buggy and frankly starts to feel small about halfway through the game when you realize there's really only one major city.Fable 2 has many issues. Here are a few:1. Graphic glitches, pop-in, strange lines running through some textures.2. Lockups, sometimes full console crash but mostly just game lockups.3. The story is pretty bad but not as bad as some JRPGs I've played.4. The pet is very limited, it won't tank and has no combat commands.5. Camera in 2 player mode is awful. In fact, 2 player mode is awful.That last item brings me to multiplayer. Basically multiplayer is extremely dissapointing. My wife and I wanted to play this together and realized on of us has to be a \"henchman\". We can't even use our individual characters at the same time. The online multiplayer uses the same camera shared screen technique as the offline which is awful.Ok, so that sounds like I hate the game but not really. I like some things about it:1. The combat is simple but elegant.2. Many of the enviroments look great.3. The narrators voice of work is good.4. Even though the pet is limited it's still nice to have.5. I love this style of game.6. The fact you can buy/sell/customize house is all very cool.Overall it's a game I recommend to people who really enjoy this genre.

Ezio has returned to Rome, and has to deal with the Borgias' corrupt regime. Some cool new characters are added in, and all the ones we know and love from 2 are brought back. The story is great, and the ending will leave you in awe. As the series is known for, the cutscenes, dialogue, and visuals are awesome. The gameplay is much more streamlined than 2, and it's been greatly improved upon. Many tools are available for you to use during combat, and many different strategies can be used. Renovating shops and famous landmarks increases the income of the city, which is deposited in a bank every 20 minutes. You can then collect this money however you please! It's kind of hard to get a lot of money in the beginning of the game, but after you renovate many shops and collect a lot of your income, money doesn't become an issue anymore! The gameplay is much more streamlined than 2, and it's been greatly improved upon. Many tools are available for you to use during combat, and many different strategies can be used. Rome is a big city to roam around in, and there's many things to see and do. These include: clearing out Borgia towers scattered throughout the city (allowing you to renovate buildings in that district), getting Assassination contracts, completing challenges for different guilds, recruiting your own Assassins, ranking them up and calling them during combat, flashback missions, etc. You'll spend a lot of time on this game if you're willing to, and the game does a good job of making sure that there's always something entertaining to do while playing.Although many great additions have been made to the game, it's still essentially the same gameplay from 2, only faster and more streamlined. I have to admit that 2 did some things better, such as the hidden hideout missions. The main missions in this game now have an optional objective, and it is required of you to complete all of them in order to achieve 100% sync. While some may see this as a positive, I don't really like the addition. If you're big con completing the game, it really restricts the open style of gameplay that we've grown to love in the series. It doesn't matter if you've spent 10 hours unlocking the best weapon in the game, you can't use it if you want to achieve full sync in some missions. Sure, they're completely optional, but it's still kind of annoying. You can replay memories if you want to go back and achieve full sync, however. Playing as Desmond was pretty entertaining in the game, although I've always found the story of his ancestors far more interesting. You only HAVE to play as him at the beginning and end of the game, it's completely optional otherwise.Overall, this an awesome game! It took a spectacular game, Assassin's Creed 2, and greatly improved upon it! While some may say that this is just a money grab by Ubisoft, I heartily disagree. You can tell that they worked hard on this game, especially with the visuals, gameplay, story, and atmosphere. I highly recommend this game to anyone, although I strongly urge you to play Assassin's Creed 2 first if you care about the story at all. Hope this helped!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2013"}

Monroe \"Life, is a state of mind.\"","summary":"Easily one of my favorite games.","reviewText":"Obsidian (with some of the original team from FO1 & FO2) was able to create a great Fallout experience that pays homage to the originals in more than one way.The dark humor, exploration, and unexpectedness of Fallout are well captured in New Vegas, and this game very much rewards creative thinking. Though it's a tad clunky at times and characters may seem a bit stiff, the heart of what Fallout is shines right on through! From the great western tunes, and desert atmosphere, it's very much an apocalyptic cowboy game with enough diversions to suit many different tastes. With so many warring factions and branching quest lines you're bound to enjoy at least some aspect of the game. The core experience as always is great and offers quite a lot of customization which adds the replay value of the game.The DLCs as well are all top notch, each one offering a very unique story that adds new characters, weapons, and items to the games running lineup. There are definitely some challenges and goodies to be had with each of the DLCs, and if you stick it out you may even discover a few juicy secrets. The DLCs are included on a separate disk for download. The DLCs are:-DEAD MONEY (a sort of survival horror game with an odd treasure hunt aspect)-HONEST HEARTS (exploring a national park wilderness full of hostile tribes)-OLD WORLD BLUES (Science gone so so wrong, learn the secrets of the wasteland)-LONESOME ROAD (the courier's final journey to face off against the mysterious Ulysses)Bethesda made a smart move in letting the original devs make a new addition to the Fallout franchise. As much as I love FO3, New Vegas takes the cake by offering superior story/quest writing and multiple ways to play and complete objectives. I cannot recommend it enough.Check it out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B007VJ06Q6","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A bit repetitive, but fans of arcade co-ops will love this","reviewText":"The Good: Gorgeous visuals, fun and fast paced combat, plenty of loot and levels to acquireThe Bad: Almost no main quest line or story, very short in length, very few levels, best experience is only with other peopleVanillaware is known for one of the hardest JRPGs on the PS2, Odin Sphere, and I was very excited upon hearing the spiritual successor to that game. While Dragon&#8217;s Crown isn&#8217;t nearly as hard as that game (it&#8217;s much more forgiving) it still has a lot of challenges that await you. Dragon&#8217;s Crown&#8217;s biggest disappointment is its short length. There&#8217;s almost no main quests and contains mainly side quests (about 50). Once you finish the game you unlock a hard mode and then an Inferno mode. Thankfully the game can be played with up to 4 players so it can be a blast.The story is about a Crown that has been taken by an Ancient Dragon. Your job is to return this crown to your kingdom and kill the dragon. The story is very light and I know there could have been so much more here. But the super short length makes it impossible for a better story. There are very few cut scenes and not much spoken dialogue (which is only done by a narrator). Once you jump into the game you can attack, use items, cast spells, and use the right analog stick to move a hand around the screen to collect treasure. You always have a non-fighting thief with you who can pick locks on hidden doors and open chests. Sadly, you can&#8217;t change out your equipment during a mission (most levels can be passed in less than 10 minutes). However, at the end of each level is a boss and they increase in difficulty throughout all 8 levels or so. Each level has two bosses at different levels for various players.Once you finish a mission you can return to town to appraise your items, bury or resurrect bones you find in levels for new AI partners, level up, acquire new quests, and buy runes. Runes are found throughout levels in pairs which need to be matched with runes in your possession. These add various buffs to your party which can turn the tide of a battle. Outside of those main things there&#8217;s not much to do besides hit the level cap. The missions are extremely repetitive since you need to find 9 talisman before facing the Ancient Dragon (that&#8217;s almost all there is to the entire main quest line) and once you are able to beat the Ancient Dragon (probably when you&#8217;re around level 30) you do it all over again on a harder difficulty. It gets kind of boring after a while and extremely tough towards the end. It&#8217;s best to go in with actual people since your AI partners can mess things up. Thankfully, unlike Odin Sphere, you have lives and can even pay to keep reviving with your coins. This alleviates some of the frustration.I just wish there was so much more to this game. It feels so small and claustrophobic. The short levels, the nearly non-existent quest line and story, but at least the characters you pick are fun to use and the controls work well. The art itself is stunning with beautiful water-color backdrops and crazy looking enemies and bosses. This game is mainly designed for fans of the co-0p arcade RPGs of yesteryear from Capcom. Not much of a story, but tons of combat and enemies to kill and levels to acquire. If you want a story heavy RPG like The Elder Scrolls or Fable you won&#8217;t find that here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2014"}

{"product_name":"B002I0HJG8","description":"","reviewerName":"Dagger One Bravo","summary":"Should you buy this game?","reviewText":"This is an above average MMO and it's free now. You don't have to buy the game or pay a subscription fee. Buying the game will get you some kind of Founder status and some miscellaneous freebies for whatever that's worth but you don't have to. Download the game for free and if you like it enough to keep playing it buy some stuff from the cash shop.It seems to me that based on all the freebies I got just for creating an account, actually buying the game isn't really a good investment. I think you get a couple mounts you can either use or sell, some potions and I think some XP boosters but I got all that too, just for downloading the game and creating the account. I got only 1 mount which is a very good mount that I could use at level 1 and even if you didn't get this the game gives you another as a quest reward at level 11. Sure, you can sell the mount(s) for an insane amount of game currency but will you need that much currency so soon that you won't have ample time to earn it? No, you won't nor will you need those XP boosters or any potions you may get. You level like a rocket in this game, get a \"care package\" of pots or a weapon every 5 levels or so and way overpowered weapons are routinely given to you for free at all stages of the game, via a system of finding the appropriate number of \"relic pieces\" (monster drops) that makes said OP weapon materialize in your inventory. As for potions, I have used almost none in this game yet and the ones I have used have all been either during a big solo boss fight or just as a convenience because I didn't feel like waiting for the regen.The leveling in this game, in my opinion, is entirely too fast and I don't understand why developers are making games this way. I've been playing this game for about two weeks and I'm 8 levels away from the cap already! Anything but the most trivial investment in your gear before reaching the cap is a near complete waste because especially pre-40 you can conceivably go thru 2 complete gear sets in no more than a day, if you play that hard. Even if you don't, you're still going to fly thru the levels.So, I say get the game for free and support it via cash shop purchases if you like it.Regarding the game itself, I mostly like it. The fighting mechanic is good, although at higher levels it does begin substituting a fair amount of cheapness in lieu of properly designing the mobs to become exponentially more challenging. They DO become more of a challenge but it isn't all due to design. Examples would be multi-cast attacks only hitting the target once, shield blocking animations working but failing to block frontal attacks, knockback attacks knocking enemies behind instead of in front of you and failed hit detection; i.e., your attack goes right thru the mob while causing no damage. Perhaps some of this is due to poor programming (like hit detection) but the issues of the shield blocking and the backwards knockback is something that I definitely did not experience until later levels and yes, I watch for this type of stuff in every game I play.Also regarding the combat system, while I like the way it plays some classes fair better with it than others. I haven't played every class in the game but I have played 5 of them (Lancer, Sorcerer, Warrior, Slayer, Berserker) which ought to be enough to form a reliable opinion. Classes like the Lancer are very tight and intuitive while others like the Slayer and Warrior often come off clumsy and you find yourself missing a lot of attacks while rooted in place, flailing about with your weapon(s) at a target that has long since moved out of your hit reticle due to an overly long casting time and the fact that once you key the attack you cannot readjust your direction. The problem here is usually the casting time, not so much the rooting, however, there are times when you CAN adjust your direction to follow the target before you attack but all too frequently the direction of the attack does not follow suit.The casting time also creates an additional problem that has a lot to do with an inconsistency in the programming. This isn't going to be easy to explain but I'll try to as best I can. Tera has attack chains. They're pretty good chains too and you can even swap around different attacks to customize them but you have to be careful because certain chains apply a casting time negation to the follow-up attack that you can lose if you replace it with the wrong one. The problem is that the transition from one attack into another sometimes takes so long (due to casting and recovery animation) that the attack is wasted because your target simply moves out of the hit reticle, interrupts the attack or recovers from his condition (let's say, stun) before the stupid animation gets finished and the chain actually goes off. This problem is compounded by the inconsistency in how long it takes to transition from one attack to another (sometimes it's very fast and other times you may as well have keyed them as completely separate attacks) and when exactly the chain prompt appears on your screen. For some chains the prompt for the second attack will appear immediately upon initiating the first attack, while for some other chains there will be a pause of up to 3 seconds before the prompt appears which renders this chain basically useless. There is also an inconsistency with the amount of time the prompt is visible and thus usable. The default time is 4 seconds but I have seen the prompt routinely disappear in as little as 1-2 seconds for no reason at all.These things aren't game-breakers but they do take away from fluidity of the combat when they happen (and they happen rather frequently)and for a game that makes a big deal about it's combat system these things are pretty inexcusable and should have been polished out a long time ago.You'll find one or two other issues with the combat system as well and while the specifics have more than a few rough edges, it's a good system on the whole.And because nothing in the world is perfect let me file one more additional complaint: the movement speed handicap aka \"combat movement speed\". Basically, you have one movement speed out of combat that slows to about half that when you are IN combat. This, to me, is simply an AI cheat (because this handicap is applied only to the player and not the AI enemy) and the pinnacle of idiotic game mechanics only employed by lazy developers. The fanboys like to call it a \"debuff\" but this is incorrect. A debuff implies that your speed was artificially higher due to a bonus stat (buff) applied to you somehow that was removed by an enemy's skill or an environmental factor, hence the prefix \"de\" attached to \"buff\". This is not the case, therefore the so-called combat movement speed is a handicap, plain and simple. If one were too fanboyish to call it what it is - a handicap, the proper alternative term would be \"nerf\".People like to argue the proper usage of \"debuff\" all day long but it really doesn't matter. Anyone that ever took (and passed) a 5th grade English class understands what the \"de\" prefix means and why we use it in the first place. And no, kiddies, the fact that you've been using this word improperly for so long doesn't make any difference. A player is not DEbuffed unless they first had a buff to BE debuffed. After you learn this please also stop using the non-words \"dat\", \"doe\" and \"meh\". They make anyone that uses them sound like idiots.Anyway....The graphics are great and the maps are varied and beautiful. My only complaint here woud be too much time spent on snow maps but that's just a preference issue. Tera has some unique map designs and mobs to go with them. Mobs like the circus-like Jack in the Box jester/vampire and witches, etc. styled in the same manner. That's only one example but you get the idea and most of the mobs are equally well-designed. Of course, there's the obligatory wolves, pigs and panthers but those are just filler mobs and not worth mentioning beyond that point.The dungeons are okay. Nothing spectacular and they're designed for group play because thankfully Tera designed it's classes so that each class is unique and important unlike, say, Guild Wars 2 where everybody is essentially the same with the only difference being skill animations and armour type. I hate Guild Wars 2! Don't even get me started!Never done any crafting or PvP in this game so I can't say anything about that. This is my PvE game. When I want to PvP or spend insane sums of money to craft something nobody wants to buy I play Aion.Now, for you parents thinking of getting this for your kids or letting them play it, you may want to read this part. This game is M-rated and very heavy on exposed female flesh. For me it's fine but I'm 40 years old. Just know that it's there in massive amounts.Also, this game has to have the worst, most profane and juvenile community I have ever experienced. Hardly one sentence is spoken that isn't laced with a cussword, usually beginning with the letter F. It's atrocious and the community is my biggest gripe with this game. Never before have I seen such unchecked poor behavior in an online game and I have no idea what I'm going to do when my blocklist of foulmouthed 14 year olds is full, which is fast about to happen. I haven't found anywhere in the chat or general game options any sort of profanity filter either so I guess the only option is to stay in a tab that the entire community isn't using.The fanboys and the degenerates that act this way will say that it isn't any different than any other MMO but this is a lie. Not even Guild Wars 2 is this bad and judging by the Tera player community I'd say it's well on it's way to replacing that game as the Romper Room of MMOs. Aion and Rift neither come anywhere close to this level of profanity and childish so-called humor nor does PlanetSide 2 or countless other MMO titles. Why it's this way and why Enmasse doesn't do anything to police it, since these people apparently don't have the either the decency or the self-awareness to police themselves is beyond me but this is the way it is.In the end, the game itself is pretty good minus a few technical quirks that should have been ironed out long before now and the apathetic attitude concerning a very, very large portion of the players that make the chat seem like a live-taping of The Jerry Springer Show or perhaps a typical day in any classroom of the modern day public \"school\" system.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2014"}

The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance.

The Wii primarily uses the Wii Remote, shaped like a TV remote, for its functionality. The Nunchuck is for use in the \"other hand\" (i.e. your left hand if you're right handed) just for a few games. It plus into the bottom end of the Wii Remote with a cable that's about 2 1/2 feet long. Most of the time, you leave it unplugged and sitting by the console.For example, in the sports pack that comes with the Wii, only one of the five games uses the nunchuck. This is the boxing game. You use the nunchuck to hit with your off hand, just as you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your primary hand.The nunchuck has the same motion sensing technology as the Wii remote does, so that you can move your hand around and the game knows what you are doing. The buttons are much simpler - there is a Z big trigger button, a smaller C trigger button above it, and then a joystick up on top. For some games, no buttons are used at all.The cable length is designed so you don't trip yourself with it :) It's long enough that if you held your hands apart, you could easily ride even a wide-handled bike. It's not long enough that you could put both arms straight out to the left and right, though. I've never had any problems with the cable length hindering me. None of the games require you to have your hands far apart. In boxing, for example, your hands are always near each other and there's plenty of cable length even when you're jabbing.The nunchuck doesn't need its own power - it plugs into the Wii remote controller when it's in use. So there's no worry about charging up or batteries.I would definitely have at least one functional nunchuck for my Wii, and if you're really into multiplayer two-handed games like boxing matches, then having two would be important.

(or several)","reviewText":"I first got this game in 2011 as a gift, and I was truly amazed.This game is a prequel to the Halo Saga and you will be truly amazed by the events lining up toward the very first Halo. I just found the entire idea fantastic. At the time, Halo Reach was one of the few games, if not only, to be a prequel rather than a sequel. Without dishing out any spoilers, I can say with confidence that you will love the story along with it's connections.One of the first things you will notice is the change in graphics as this game was designed on a slightly new engine. (As Bungie stated themselves) I loved how certain maps would have some wildlife running around as well.You can also customize your appearance for the campaign mode which I thought was a pretty cool feature to see. It adds well to the cut-scenes to see your glorious character in the world of Reach.Multiplayer is also very very fun! 4 player split-screen returns for co-op and the fire-fight mode is fun (However I think that is only 2 players). It felt good to play the multiplayer due to aspects of Halo 3 coming back except with a new twist.Now in the year 2014, I picked this game up again, and I must say I am having a blast playing this game again. It's like a breath of fresh air.If you haven't tried Reach because you thought it was something like Halo ODST, pick up the game for it's reasonable price and try it out immediately. Sure if you played Halo 4, you may be disappointed by the lack of some features, but hey, that doesn't mean this game is bad at all. I especially love the forge world on this map and that was my main focus, yet I loved everything about this game!I recommend this game to anyone who wants to relive some nostalgia or see the story before the first Halo 1.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2014"}

Dean \"John\"","summary":"Impressive for first gen","reviewText":"I had low expectations, since this is the first gen.  But I was actually blown away at how well it worked.Positioning is key, so make sure there's room, especially if you're going to be playing with two people.As another reviewer mentioned, smaller kids will have a harder time trying to stay in the \"box\".  My 7 year old always ends up closer and closer to the TV as we play Wii and such, and I'm always yelling at him to back up.  In this setup, it \"loses\" him when he gets too close, which saves me having to tell him \"back up!\"The interface is good.  The only down sides to it (but not enough of a down to subtract a star) is the intro you have to go through when starting the kinect aware game.  No way to just \"skip\" it.  I don't now if that's just with the game that came bundled with my system (Kinect Adventures) or if they will all do the same thing.  I hope not, since it's annoying to always have that wait to get past the \"move furniture out of the way\" stuff...  Only other minor complaint would be the delay for it sensing when you have moved your hand to select a button.  It gets a \"progress\" type of meter spinning to fill the circumference of the circle where you are selecting.  I would've preferred rather than that delay where you have to hold your hand in position for it to \"fill up\" the circle, you could've \"pushed\".  Hold your hand over a button and push the air towards the sensor...  But those are really the only two things so far I'd want to change if I could.Unit is far more sensitive and aware than I had hoped for, and not nearly as laggy as I had feared.  Yes, it's not QUITE real time movement, there is the slight delay between what you do and it's recreation, but that delay really is pretty slight.  Doesn't seem to interfere with game play so far.My 7 year old LOVES this.  The whole \"you are the controller\" concept just thrills him.It takes pictures of you during some of the game play, and of course the pictures are hardly flattering, so he REALLY enjoys that feature.Still have to try controlling a movie for the heck of it, but since I have a Windows 7 media center that runs all my movies off a windows home server's disk array, I don't use this xbox for an extender.  The two Xboxes I use to extend the media center don't have this on them, but I may try playing and edit my review in the near future.The video chat requires a gold xbox account, as does the ESPN. I had let my gold expire after about 5 or 6 years since I never really gamed online for the last three of those years, so of course now the stuff that I can try will require me to purchase a new one again...Have to pick up some more Kinect aware games, because this really is a game changer, much slicker than just the motion sensing controllers of the PS3 or the Wii.  Can't wait for generation 2, to see what improvements they make.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2010"}

Did he just get off his crotch rocket and decide to beat up some bad guys.  I've never played any Dead to Rights games so I may be missing something.Now, imagine taking a roided-up character from Gears of War with a similar cover system and placing him in a brawler similar to Bourne Conspiracy and having a stealth section similar to Batman AA where you are the dog.  See the pattern.  This game basically plagiarizes from other pretty decent titles, which isn't a bad thing; you would actually expect the end result to be somewhat decent.  The problem is that they don't excel at any one aspect and actually they are all worse than the aforementioned games they lifted from.  The cover system stinks as does the aiming, the brawling sections aren't fluid, and the stealth section is not well laid out.  It just feels like there wasn't any love put into this game.  Or if there was, they need to hire a better skilled team.  There is no attention to detail--graphics are average to poor, there are invisible walls everywhere, if you shoot objects or walls there are no marks left, you can't move any object such as a chair if it's in your way--just the way games used to be on the original Playstation. Also the AI is nonexistant; they'll run back and forth, to and fro, for the heck of it. I'm sure I could add to my list of gripes, but I think you get the picture.  This is a last generation game.  With that being said, you can still get some fun out of it.  You can use enemies as human shields, ahem Gears of War 2 ahem, and throw them off ledges or kick them into enemies.  The finishing move cutscenes, ahem Bourne Conspiracy ahem, are amusing to watch.  It's just a shame because the game had potential but in the end, winds up as just another average game to the already long list of sub-pars.  Look for it in a bargain basement bin near you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2010"}

The buttons have a nice clicky feel to them, even my fat thumbs sit in well. The twin sticks are a case of \"about time!\" I was hoping for the PSP they'd have these things in but we had to wait for this but it was worth it.The cameras are not really worth writing about, they're VGA quality and grainy as heck even in decent lighting, it does skype well enough and skype allows you to switch between either camera on the go and easily. The vita also has a built in mic so that's good and it's not bad either.The touch pad on the back I'm not exactly excited about, I like tactile buttons with responsive feel, the pad sorta is in the way because my hands just kinda hang all over the back of the system. I guess a handgrip would solve this but, this is about the system, NOT accessories. But it does work as well as the front screen so that needs to be said.The sticks feel good, they take a bit to get used to but they're better than they look and better than they feel at a demo store I can vouch for that.No in-built memory is an issue and the memory cards are pricy but if you're just buying physical games then a 8gb card will do you great service.The battery life is a bit short but honestly the cable is compact enough where you can bring it along and plug in where you need to.The speakers are excellent for the size, better than the PSP 2000 and they were solid to say the least.The system is a bit locked down the proprietary connections & cards but that just means be careful with what you buy and don't bloody lose them, then you don't have to subject yourself to the embarrassment of paying 10-15 dollars for what's basically a modified USB cable.I've played a few demos and Unit 13, the visuals are mindblowing, I thought we were another generation away from PS3 quality visuals but they're on par with early games. (yes the resolution is lower and it's a bit less but it's close). And as stated with the controls on the vita everything is just smooth and nice.One HUGE perk is SONY has been pushing the vita with cross-play compatibility with some games, even giving the Vita version FREE with the purchase of the PS3 version. So you can either resume playing a game from the PS3 on the PSV, or actually play with PS3 players amazingly. This is a huge huge benifit and I'm amazed at the deal you get. I'm eagerly awaiting for Ratchet: Full Frontal Assault to launch on the Vita to test this more given the PS3 ver is already out.Overall don't buy into the people knocking the device, they probably haven't played with the Vita once (heck I didn't till I got mine off amazon). The device is solid and is probably the only place you'll be able to get console quality games and CROSS PLAY functionality.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2012"}

A lot of times you really want to try out a certain game but can't because that would mean buying a whole new system and hope that system will offer steady support over its lifespan. With the PSP, it's one of those systems where the games that definately intrigue are on a new system so it becomes a question of \"can I live without buying a PSP?\" or decide to give up and get one anyway. Well I got a little impatient and had to check out those games so I thought I'd get it. So how does the system fare?The system itself can be described as basically a miniature PS2. While graphically the PSP isn't as pristine, many of its games such as Crisis Core and God of War look pretty uncanny to their more bigger console brothers while we also have games such as Jeanne D'Arc, Final Fantasy Tactics or the Metal Gear Solid Digital Novel have great art design and going for a more storybook or unique quality than ultra-realism. The 16:9 ratio of the screen also helps give the games a more cinematic feel and the clarity in many of the games is quite striking. My one complaint and it's more for lack of gear or storage than anything but with the screen as widely accessible to rough surfaces and objects it can get easy to scratch unlike the DS which closes and shelters the screens so either hide the machine or put it where things aren't going to scratch across it.The controls for a handheld game tend to be quite crucial and one thing that annoyed me with the machine was that my hands would cramp after awhile and after awhile would have to wave my hand back and forth like I burned it just to \"loosen it up\". Another small flaw I found was the buttons since in the heat of battle/excitement/whatever, it's easy to hit another button such as the \"Home\" which is right next to the analog nub (which feels awkward too) and it's easy for your palm to rub against the Power switch on the right to turn it off.The PSP allows for a bit more than gameplay such as photos, music (which comes in handy for stuff like Grand Theft Auto where you can have custom radio stations with your own stuff), Wi-Fi and online gaming as well as the UMD movies which is a neat idea - watch movies in the backseat on long trips, say - but I kind of prefer the bigger theatricality of the HD widescreen TV and big volume stereo. Most won't even use the features and are perfectly content with having prints of photos set up, music on CD's or iPod's but the online gaming and Ad-Hoc feature can be quite welcome.As for its library of games, it ultimately depends on your preference. There's racing like Wipeout and Midnight Club, platformers like Ratchet and Clank and Daxter, Silent Hill Origins for those into scary stuff, tactical RPG's like Tactics or Disgaea and long RPG's like Valkyrie Profile. There's even some unique games like Lumines, a puzzle game and PSP's version of Meteos, to Patapon which is basically a mixture of DDR and that electronic board game Simon Says. But for some gamers, actually finding the games can be another matter entirely since there's a good 5 games on my list that I'd love to play yet with 5 stores in town that sell PSP games, not a single store carries it.I'd recommend the PSP for the kind of games it gets and owning a DS at the same time, I can get the more unique style and the traditional whenever I want.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy. If  only it were a bit longer.--David Jenkins. --Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"David Kauffman","summary":"\"Fun\" if you like difficult, tedious and repetitive games.","reviewText":"Luigi's mansion is one of the Gamecube Oldies. Most everyone who ended up reserving a Gamecube reserved Luigi's Mansion as well.Oops.Luigi's mansion is so incredibly... what's the word... oh yeah, STUPID.You start out with a plot line that you have won a haunted mansion in a contest you never entered. You encounter a ghost, and some crazy guy sucks it up with a poltergust 3000 (a vacume cleaner) You then must rescue Mario from the mansion, and thats when it gets exciting... for the one time.Whats the gameplay like? Well, you need to suck up ghosts. First you need to shine a light on them to freeze them, then press L and pull back on the control stick to suck them up. But the drop bombs down, and you go into them, and you lose health and the ghosts! It's [horrible] how you cannot control the way you go. Second, more ghosts pop out and hurt you, and you can't do anything about that either! You would not beleive how stupid the entire thing is. The entire game revolves around pressing L and holding the C-stick down. Short \"mini\" games involve you the size of a peanut againts ghosts 50x your size. Also, during gameplay, the dumbest things let you get furthur. What does sucking in a peice of paper have to do with letting 50 boo's come out of a sewer? Speaking of boo's, you need to capture 50 of them. They are virtually all the same, and by ghost 10, you are saying \"What's the point of this?\" They travel through the walls and you need to capture them by going into a different room! Once I was stuck for 10 minutes in a hallway chasing a boo from room to room. BOOOOORING. You also lose health for opening doors, having mice touch you, and you virtually are dead after 10 touches by a ghosts, plus -20 everytime it shoots out a bomb at you. The gameplay gets a 5/10.Now, I know, I sound like the old men from [a t.v. show], complaining about everything, but I can't complain about this. Despite the ...awful gameplay, the graphics will blow you away. Everything is in 3D and makes it look great. Ghosts have perfect transparentry, and the physics are perfect. If you try to suck up a cloth, it will respond to how hard you pressing the button, where you are, and how much your moving back. It's amazing. The graphics get a 10/10, but don't count on it to help this game's grade.The sound is neutral. I can't complain, but I can't praise. The ghosts basically all make the same chattery laughter, and the boo's have the exact safe sfx for all of them. The sound gets a 7/10, but I'm being generous to the fact that it was one of the first games from Gamecube.Speed's ok. It's not like Madden 2002, thank god, but it's superfast. There is loading time, but it's not annoyingly slow. Speed gets a 8/10.Controls are decent, except for one part. The y button helps you see what can kill a ghost, but it's so slow by the time you know what it is, it bumps into you and you lose major health. You also have to pull the control stick in the opposite direction, which is very difficult because it seems to change while you are holding it. You will know what I mean if you foolishly purchase this game. Controls get a 8.5/10Whats this \"replay value\" you speak of? L's Mansion has NO replay value. Whats the point of doing it again? It's gonna be exactly the same everytime! I'm not joking when I give the replay value a 1/10. You beat it, end of story. What's more to do?Basically, if you want a game that will frustrate and waste your time and your hard-earned [$$], buy Luigi's Mansion. Case closed.Let's review:Gameplay: 5/10Graphics: 10/10Sound: 7/10Speed: 8/10Controls: 8.5/10Replay value: 1/10Total: 39.5/60 giving Luigi's Mansion a 65.83, my lowest review ever.Am I forgetting something? Oh yeah! I always add points for cheats on games. Right, so now instead of a 65.83, I'm gonna give it the appropriate amount of points for cheats, leaving Luigi's Mansion new total to be... 65.83!

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"R. Jensen","summary":"Took me awhile but I really grew to like this one","reviewText":"When Halo 2 first came out, I wasn't a big fan of it. I resented changes made to weaponry, either removing some or makeing others less useful. I perticulerly noticed that \"Heavy\" weapons appeared to be less effective along with the melee. While I was glad that this game made Covenant vehicles easier to operate, I hated the fact Human vehicles were less useful unless you were speeding away from enemies. Also it appeared that the aliens took more rounds to kill. The storyline however did intrique me.After a couple years of playing it less and having the Halo universe expand beyond Halo 3, this game suddenly became a lot more fun. Having experienced Halo 3 which left me with a pretty mixed opinion, this game suddenly went up in likeability. I noticed that the rifles were pretty darn useful and duel wielding Elite Plasma Rifles, could really put a dent in most enemy forces, espically if obsticles were involved. The game felt more like the first Halo, where I felt I really was behaving like the character although not as well. Also I began to appreciate the later levels and how there were multiple ways to get through a combat situation.Two dislikes do remain. One dispite having more levels, I do feel some of the combat is sacrificed for the story and transitions between vehicle to on foot bitts in this game didn't feel as smoove.A lot of fun, but man did it take forever for me to appreciate it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0014X7SQ6","description":"Seven years prior to the events of FINAL FANTASY VII &#x2014; The Shinra Company is rapidly increasing its influence through its monopoly on mako energy and military might. With the burgeoning city of Midgar as its base and symbol of prosperity, Shinra is on the verge of establishing absolute dominance over the world. SOLDIER is a group of skilled combat operatives within Shinra. The elite within the group &#x2014; those strong enough to be deemed SOLDIER 1st Class &#x2014; are respected and idolized by the citizenry. Zack is a young SOLDIER 2nd Class who aspires to become a 1st. He spends his days carrying out assignments under the guidance of his 1st Class mentor, Angeal. During an operation in Wutai, a large number of SOLDIER members, led by 1st Class operative Genesis, go missing. The severity of the situation prompts Shinra executives to deploy even more SOLDIER operatives in hopes of bringing an end to the war with Wutai&#x2014;and conducting an investigation into the mass desertion. The ones assigned to the mission are Zack, Angeal, and the 1st Class hero who is known the world over as Sephiroth... What truths lie behind Genesis's disappearance? What secrets bind the three SOLDIER 1st Class operatives? For Zack, a cruel and fateful struggle awaits...","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core","reviewText":"Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core tells the story of Zack, a member of SOLDIER, who is seen briefly in the original game.  The main villain of this game is another SOLDIER member named Genesis who turned against Shinra.  This game also shows you a bit of what Sephiroth was like before he became the villain we know him as.  I found the story to be fairly interesting, and the ending was very good.The game is also a lot of fun.  Fighting is in real-time, and you can use all kinds of materia that can level up and be combined with others.  There is something unique to this game called a DMW that has three scrolling pictures of characters, and when they line up, you get a limit break and can also level up Zack and his materia this way.  (The downside is the DMW is random, so you have little control over limit breaks and leveling up.)  There are 300 extra missions in this game, but they're all pretty similar, so I was disappointed with that.  They can get a bit boring.The game also has good graphics and pretty good music.  Some of the music is remade versions of songs from the original game, which I enjoyed.  Another thing I enjoyed were the extra things you can get in the DMW.  If you find the right items, you can summon not only creatures like Bahamut and Ifrit, but a Cactuar and even Cait Sith, as well.Overall, I found this game to be a lot of fun.  It's my favorite PSP game.  I just didn't like that the extra missions were so similar, and the DMW was random, which could keep you from leveling up or getting limit breaks for a while.  Nevertheless, I loved the game and was sad when I finished.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2011"}

This game, just like all the Hitmans (and I've been playing since Codename 47 was released for PC) totally rocks. It has everything the other Hitmans have with the addition of some extra moves. Sneaking up behind people to snuff them out is no longer necessary. You can now just walk right up to them, weaponless if you so desire, and annihilate. This means even more violence than the previous games and that's what I play for. Not running around hugging every corner to achieve some kind of stupid rating.Stabbing people. Strangulation. Blowing people up. Popping heads. Gutting them with machine guns. Setting them on fire. All that good stuff that, in my opinion, qualifies as art. And the hitman does it with style. You can entrap targets in this game by purposely blowing your cover and make some dead idiot suspicious of you. Just calmly walk away, and lure that piece of meat into some empty alley somewhere. You can even pretend to surrender just to get him even closer to you.Lots of people said disguises are useless in this game. That has some truth. They don't get you where they would have gotten you in previous games but he's such a deadly assassin now and murders people twice as fast and in so many talented ways that you really don't need a disguise anymore. I prefer leaving each mission with my suit anyway.You don't need to be stealthy. Just find yourself a nice machine gun and a lot of ammo and you can kill everyone in a level since now the hitman can FINALLY take cover and return fire. And with a accumulation of instinct, you can pause the game for a duration that allows you to pick heads out of a crowd of people before unleashing a spray of bullets with one tap of the trigger button. Real nice addition. In fact, this game has been made so much easier to kill that anybody, even people who suck at video games, can play this game. So, that can be a downfall to some. But for me, the more creative ways I have available to me to take out my enemies, the better.The environments in this game are superb. I absolutely love them. They are not bright and shinny like the ones were in Blood Money. It's more dark like in Contracts. The whole beginning where you are being chased by the NYPD was flawless. Everywhere you go you got cops tailing you. Talking about you. Asking civilians about you. Cursing your existence. Yet none of them have any idea of what you look like and I love leaving a trail of dead uniforms everywhere I progressed through the game. My first play through I killed most cops dressed as a cop...which was amusing. The environments seem much more lively than in previous games since there's so many crowds of people around, talking, arguing, being questioned. A lot of the times you can pick up on conversations that can clue you in on key locations on the map that will help you escape.If you enjoyed previous Hitmans, you will probably enjoy this one. If you did not enjoy the previous Hitmans, you will most likely enjoy this one since its been dumbed down enough for anybody to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2013"}

Shooting people gets to be a bore after a while, not to mention that that form of combat is broken. The puzzles are fun to say the least, and the graphics are pretty much of the only selling point for this game, like the much over-rated call of duty series, and its pratically a tomb raider wanna-be.I am sorry but like the call of duty series, this is another saga i would advise to safely give this a pass.

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"Nate, You Naughty Dog!","reviewText":"What a terrific game Uncharted is. Great visuals. Action. Suspense. Scares. Twists...everything that you could ask for in a third person action shooter.The game starts out on a small boat at sea where its three main characters, Nate, Elena and Sully, unveil the plot to find the long lost treasure of Nate's ancestor Sir Francis Drake. After a quick modern-day \"pirate\" attack on the boat (in my view designed to get you familiar with the controller schematic), you quickly make your way to the island where Drake's Fortune is hidden, and your pursuit of it begins.But it turns out that there are others looking for the treasure, You'll have to battle your way through obstacles, puzzles and worst of all pirates...hordes and hordes of pirates. My only gripe with the game are the redundant, battle after battle, run-ins that you have with pirates. Some you can blast right through, but others are pretty darn hard (one of the most frustrating you'll have is in a flooded castle basement), and you'll wonder if you're doing something wrong because you'll die so much before getting through.Some areas require you to clear the enemies out before you can get through, and some you're better off just running for the exit; and the only way to figure out which way is which is by trial and error...you don't get a map. But not to worry...if the game senses that you're lost it encourages you to press L2 for a hint. There are about 60 hidden treasures that you can try to find and collect along your way marked by flashes of light, but weapons and ammo are also marked by flashes of light so the treasures are not always easy to spot (and not necessary to collect to get through the game any easier).You do get some pretty effective weapons that get you through the levels. You're allowed to carry 3 weapons at a time: a pistol or mini-uzi like gun, a machine gun or various shotguns and grenades. And you'll occasionally need to engage in hand-to-hand combat. You'll need to navigate yourself through some treacherous territory and perform some death defying balancing acts (and you certainly won't defy death every time).All around you during your island exploration you'll be presented with awesome scenery: sunsets, beautiful horizons, cool architecture, spooky crypts...you never get tired of looking at this game. So add it to your cart and play it now before the announced sequel comes out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2008"}
{"product_name":"B004H0H890","description":"","reviewerName":"Greg","summary":"Fun in the Sun... While Sitting at Home in Front of the TV","reviewText":"Dipping it's toes into the under frequented pool of Console Sim games (for the fourth time, no less!) is Tropico!  It's tropical turbulance as you lead a small island nation (that's totally not Cuba) through a cold-war era world as the young and enthusiastic new dictator (who totally is Fidel Castro, if you want him to be).I actually have not played the other three installments of Tropico, so i can't speak of improvements or let downs or anything else.  But what I can say is this: Tropico 4 is addictive.  Highly, highly addictive.Which is kind of surprising, considering that the scope of the game is so small!  You only control one island, just the one, little, bare-bones tropical paradise.  When compared to the SimCity's and Total Wars of the industry, gaming Sims where you rule over areas of thousands or even millions of people, one little island that tops out at a population of around 600 seems... weak.  But here's the kicker; you can interact with each of those 600 islanders on the smallest of scales.  You even have a little avatar of yourself that can be sent on various missions and tasks to improve morale.  You can, at any time, see what you're subjects are thiking, what they need from life, what their politcal aspirations are.  You can fire them from their jobs, or demolish their homes.  You can even have the more troublesome ones arrested or killed.  Provided you have the right buildings for the job, that is...Like any city planning Sim, Tropico is all about placing buildings and making money.  And you've got some pretty fabulous control on how you do so.  The grid is very minute, so buildings are arranged almost entirely free-form, giving each city (even each neighborhood) you make a truly unique feel.  You've got dozens of potential cash outlets to choose from (from agriculture all the way to tourism) to pull in income, based on your islands starting resources and (again) what buildings you put up.What keeps the game alive and feeling unique are all the events that happen behind the scenes of building a tiny empire. Sure, there are natural disasters, but those are actually pretty tame to watch and more of a hassle over all.  No, it's the battle of wits with the political factions at play that truly stands out.  All the internal parties: the loyalists, the nationalists, the religious sector and others - all have their expecations and hopes for how you should run the island.  Keeping them all happy is tricky (and expensive) and eventually someone's going to be out for blood come election time... or, you, just whenever.  The foreign powers, also, have their say.  Chief among them being the US and the USSR (cold war era, remember?), either of whom can invade your paradise and take over if you don't play nice with them.Tropico's layers upon layers are what make it compelling and extremely addicting - there's always something going on and always some way to make your island better.  The interface is smooth and clean, proving that a game of this type can work just fine on a console.  The graphics are tight, and always visually interesting.  There's a series of missions that can be played, giving you a specific island with specific resources and specific goal and chronicalling your rise to power; and they're plenty of fun.  But Tropico truly shines in Sandbox mode - you've got an island and some cash and you're imagination to play with.  And, to be honest, failing and watching the island fall into utter chaos is just as fun as making something beatufil and successful.It's a goofy, oddball, somewhat cutlurally insenstiive game (the middle-eastern guy likes CAMELS!  GET IT!) that not everyone will have the patience for.  But I highly -  HIGHLY - recommend giving it a shot if you're in the least bit curious!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2012"}

Johnson","summary":"brilliant","reviewText":"When Halo came out, I found it hard to believe that any game would come close to Halo's greatness in the near future.  Well that game just arrived in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell.It is very easy for me to say that this is one of the BEST games on XBOX and perhaps even one of the greatest games of all time.In Splinter Cell, you assume the role of Sam Fisher an experienced Special Agent called back to duty to undertake a new mission.  I have not been playing it that long, so I do not know that much of the story line.The graphics in this game are nothing short of amazing.  The game seems to utilize XBOX's power in every aspect of the environment.  For example when you are creeping behind a bullet ridden wooden fence, you can actually see the light coming through each hole.  Also when you walk through curtains, the curtains will move as you actually walked through them!  The lights also cast shadows on your enemies and you can sometimes see their shadow coming before you actually see them.The sound is also amazing.  Walking through bushes will give off a crunching/rustling sound, while walking on wooden steps and floors will produce a sound of the wood creaking beneath your feet.  The background music is good as well, but it subtle enough to wear you won't even notice it because you are so into the game.While the graphics and sound are two very good parts of the game, the best part of the game in my opinion is the game play. Sam Fisher has many cool abilities, like the split jump, in which he can jump up between two narrow walls and throw his legs out allowing him to stand on the two walls.  Another ability is that he can back against a wall and peak around the corner to see approaching enemies. He also can use zip lines and scale walls.  Unlike other games, the game stresses stealth and covertness.  Sure you can run around and kill every enemy you encounter, but you will probably get more enjoyment and perhaps even survive longer by sneaking around, sneaking behind enemies and grabbing them before they can make a sound.  While grabbing them, you can also interrogate them for useful information.  The key is to crouch while moving and avoid light and the view of the cameras whenever possible.  You can even shoot out some cameras and lights to conceal your presence.  This game requires thinking to move on to other levels, so if you are into shoot-em-up type action, then this may not be for you.  This game reminds me of Deus Ex for the PC which was another good game.  After playing Deus Ex, I never thought I would find another game of this type that would be better...I just have.One thing and the only thing I don't like about the game is the save point system. You have to complete a certain amount of tasks and goals before the game offers you the option to save.  If you die before you get to that point, then you have to start over from your last save point.  This results in you having to replay a lot of things over again.Other than that, I guess I can say the only bad thing I can say about this game, is that I spend way too much time playing it.  I did not get to bed until 2:30am playing this game.  This is a spectacular game, and a must have for anyone who likes covert mission based games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2002"}

Bakehorn","summary":"SVR 2006 pinned me down","reviewText":"Tight pants, sweaty men, loud yelling--and we're not talking about Richard Simmons; we're talking about wrestling, the WWE. It's something that I've never appreciated or enjoyed myself, but nonetheless, every year I see a few new WWE games that sell like hotcakes and receive critical acclaim. Yuke's and THQ are back once again for WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2006, and for the first time in my life, I have the chance to add to that critical acclaim--this is a quality wrestling game, especially if you enjoy the sport.The career mode is where the majority of gameplay time is supposed to be spent. I can tell that Yuke's put a lot into it, simply because it offers the drama that the WWE is famous for new and old rivalries, women, etc. In some of the cut-scenes you are given the ability to make decisions that change the way the story pans out, but basically it comes down to you leading a WWE wrestler through a gauntlet of matches.Other than the Career mode, WWE offers dozens of game modes like the new \"Fulfill Your Fantasy\"? and General Manager mode. The former mode features some of the WWE's ladies tearing each other's clothes off, and the latter puts you into the fancy suit of a WWE manager. Despite the fact that some of the modes are almost identical to each other, they're all enjoyable in some way and they're a perfect collection for those looking for the thrill of beating men into submission. I particularly enjoyed TLC and Hell in a Cage matches, especially in multiplayer games.The gameplay in WWE is spot-on in every way. Alongside the amazing set of matches is a control scheme and gameplay concepts that play out perfectly. Beating the stuffing out of an opponent takes only a small amount of time for wrestling newbies to learn, and wrestling pros will feel right at home with the scheme. Of course, you can't relentlessly pound on an opponent and expect to get away with it. Each wrestler on the mat has a Stamina gauge that eventually wears down, resulting in wrestlers falling to the ground. Of course, a higher amount of stamina means that your character is more mobile, delivers stronger hits, and the like.The reversal system is something I grew to love, as it only requires the timed press of L2 or R2 depending on the attack coming your way. It's simple but still requires a bit of talent and timing to pull off.Visually, WWE excels on the Playstation 2 and is one of the flashiest games I've seen on the console for a while. Though there are the typical problems, like low-res textures and such, the wrestler models look fantastic and the introductions are as flashy, explosive, and extravagant as a wrestling fan could possibly want. Unfortunately the sound factor isn't as impressive. I can't even be flowery and wordy with my dislike for the announcers, who have to be the most annoying pair I've ever had to listen to in a video game. They spend so much time bickering back and forth between themselves that it actually detracted from my experience.Altogether, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2006 is a quality game. Whether you're buying the console version or the PSP handheld one, you're going to enjoy this title if you're interested in wrestling or the WWE.

Denick","summary":"A good tower defense diversion, but not the game Ratchet fans have been waiting for","reviewText":"I am one of Insomniac's biggest fans (I even carved Ratchet and Clank jack o'lanterns for them a few years back), and RC is my favorite franchise of all time. Yet, I cannot rubber stamp any game with a lombax in it... and unfortunately, \"Full Frontal Assault\" (FFA) is a bit of a disappointment for this lifelong fan (although still enjoyable).This game is fun, don't get me wrong. If you're an RC fan, it's well worth picking it up and checking it out. It's only $20, and the fact that you can play it on two consoles (PS3 AND Vita) makes it an incredible value. Qwark is here for his usual comic relief (and as a playable character!), and you just might love the different style of play, with its emphasis on turrets, mines, and resource management. If you're a tower defense fan, you should definitely check it out, as FFA provides a unique (and rather frantic) twist on the genre. But I do have some qualms with the title, which are as follows...Admittedly, I can't be too harsh on FFA, since it was marketed as a tower defense game, and it only costs $20. Yet, this does not quite feel like an RC game... it's fun at times, but there is something off about it, and the running back and forth between my base to defend it creates a sense of anxiety that is completely at odds with the sense of wonderment and carefree exploration that RC games generally instill within me. Other things have been subtly altered as well, such as minor control button changes, and a slightly \"fuzzy\" graphical approach that does not look as sharp as the \"Future\" series (perhaps compromise was utilized to make it run on the Vita?). The story is minimal, and does not live up to the high standards established by previous RC entries.Therefore, many RC fans, like me, will feel somewhat disappointed with FFA. As for gamers who are new to the series, I'm afraid that they might get the impression that FFA is what the RC series is typically like, and this is not accurate.It's been three full years since RC fans have received the next installment in Ratchet and Clank's adventures (\"A Crack in Time\" was 2009). At best, we might get one next year, which would mean a minimum of four full years between titles. I'm not counting \"All 4 One\", because it was not a traditional RC game. Perhaps I was spoiled by the days of the PS2, when we were treated to a new, full fledged RC adventure every fall.I truly hope that Insomniac gets back into supporting the RC adventures, and can give us new installments on a regular basis. I hope the lombax and robot don't go the way of other mascots, and simply release one spin off after the next. Insomniac has one of the greatest platforming formulas in the history of gaming, yet they seem to be reluctant to utilize it as of late, as they dabble in other projects. I can only hope they're working on something truly spectacular for next year... perhaps even a new RC adventure for the PS4... \"IN-SOM-NI-AC we trust!\"","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2012"}

I much prefer playing games on my PC or a big screen TV with the 360 or ps3.  Since the mid 80's I have loved playing video games, and over time the Japanese Role Playing game, and Strategy role playing games became my favorite.  The problem this generation was that for the most part they were few and far between on the 360/ps3.  Sure you had exceptions like Disgaea, Valkyria Chronicles and Lost Odyssey.  However, it was nothing like the SNES through the ps2 era.  While I love some WRPGs like Skyrim and Dragon Age, I was craving some good old fashioned turn based goodness.For a long time I was noticing decent games in those genres appearing on the PSP.  I finally broke down this year and decided to try a portable system, and the PSP had an attractive library of games I wanted.  The debate then was should I buy the Vita or the PSP?  While the Vita certainly looked great, the library was pretty small and the memory cards were quite pricey.  A few games I was interested in were also not available on PSN as a download, and so were only available on disc.  I decided to go with the PSP, and perhaps I would upgrade to a Vita in the future when the system had more games available.For those like me who enjoy a JRPG, or SRPG, you have some good games to choose from.  Lunar, Jeanne D Arc, Final Fantasy Tactics, Gungnir, Tactics Ogre, Brave Story, Valkyria Chronicles 2, Disgaea 1 and 2, Wild Arms XF, and Growlanser are just some examples. Of course some of those are found on earlier systems, but they often had upgrades unique to the PSP version.  Plus they are sometimes quite a bit cheaper than trying to find the game on an older system. I also love the fact that many good ps1 games are available on PSN and can be played on either the ps3 or PSP.  Many of the Square Enix, Atlus, and even Working Designs classics are available and play great on the PSP.Another benefit of the  PSP being so late in its lifespan is the fact that many of the games can be bought for pretty cheap right now. Make sure to compare prices between the disc and download versions.  Sometimes I have found the UMD is cheaper than buying it off PSN.  While I am a bit old fashioned and prefer physical copies, I realize download games have many advantages.  Like I mentioned before, some games are not available though on PSN.  Hopefully they will continue to add more of the PSP collection in the future.  I would definitely recommend spending a few extra bucks to get a travel case for the PSP, some headphones, and a decent size memory stick.(especially if you plan on downloading most games).I am definitely happy I finally decided to get a portable system.  The great library of games will keep me busy for awhile especially when I am on long trips for a week or two.  Even at home I find myself playing the PSP as much, if not more than my PC or consoles.  I never thought that would happen.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2012"}

Bulletstorm isn't just another typical shooter game. Well it is... but it has a twist. The game rewards you in over 100 ways to kill with skill and pushes you to be creative instead of just doing head shots all day long. The feel of the game is your typical shooter and the weapons are fantastic, I just wish there was more! Graphics and environments are absolutely beautiful. Sometimes I took a break from the action to catch my breath just to look out and appreciate the world I was in. The dialog in Bulletstorm is a riot, just fowl mouthed and obnoxiously humorous. It's an extremely fast paced game which only made the campaign mode fall a little short. Although unexpectedly I really enjoyed the story and I thought it was really well done, just wish it was a couple chapters longer. My only other minor complaint is your AI partner in this game can be annoying because he constantly gets in the way. The online mode isn't much to write home about but still fun to play with some buddies and work as a team.

It also builds upon an already firm foundation of great gun play, cut scenes, and graphics.  The criticism I have for Gears 2 is that not much in the game is all that original.  I don't want to spoil things for those who haven't played it yet, but suffice it to say most of what's in Gears 2 has been done before (ala Jerry Bruckheimer).Don't get me wrong.  Gears 2 is stunning from beginning to end.  The graphics continue to be the best I've seen on a console, bar none.  Sound design and camera work are great.  The array of weapons is improved with the good stuff left alone.  You get to ride more \"vehicles\" than in the previous game.  The story is intriguing, and it fleshes out more details about each character (especially Dom).  It's an all around treat.Unfortunately, a lot of the levels have been done before in games like Halo 3, Resistance: Fall of Man, and other countless shooters.  Is it that developers are running out of ideas or is it that there just aren't that many arenas to put a shooter in?  I don't know, but if it weren't for the great story telling and game mechanics, Gears 2 could have been a big dud.Luckily for us, Gears 2 is awesome.  I finished the single player campaign in about 4 days and loved every minute of it.

{"product_name":"B000FW87AI","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"Not as good as 2006 by a long shot...","reviewText":"I have to say... I was really excited for this title and got it instantly when it was released, but the excitement quickly faded away when I realized that this is less of a game than last year's. Far less.I'll just come out and say it. 2006 was a much better game than SVR2007. First of all, let's start off with the new control system. You know, this supposed \"Ultimate Control\" grappling system. Well, to say that it takes time to get used to the new control system is an understatement. I know how to adjust control styles easily, but moving around with one control stick and performing all your grapples with the other is a bit jarring. The hard thing about using the right control stick isn't learning how to use it (which is difficult, at first) but actually using it correctly. You may accidently pin someone when you're trying to use a ground submission and vice versa. And the Ultimate Control moves? Well, there are exactly twelve of them in total, and they aren't as great as you'd think. Sure, they may be a little helpful in Table matches or Over-The-Top-Rope Battle Royals, but limited the moveset to about half of all the moves you used to be able to do just isn't worth this liitle added effect. Needless to say, I switched the control style back to the classic mode (Type D) and I have a feeling that a lot of other people who play this game will do the same.The Create-A-Superstar is also extremely scaled back in SVR2007, leaving you with very, very limited options as for how you want your created character to look, especially compared to last year's vast Create-A-Superstar options. I'm a created character fanatic, so it was disapointing to see that this year's game leaves you with about one-third of the customizible features and clothes as all the past Smackdown vs RAW games gave you. This is really noticibly hindering regarding hair styles, bottom clothes, and any female created superstars you might want to make. (you can't even give girls pants to wear!)The scaled back features just don't stop with making your character, though. Because of the new grappling system, all of your grappling moves in Create A Moveset have been chopped down to the very smallest bit. About 60 percent of the grappling moves have been taken out. So where as you used to have ten back grappling moves for example, you now only have four. And the thing that makes these limited amount of grappling moves much, much worse is the new Weight limits of grappling moves, meaning a Cruiserweight or Light Heavyweight for example, isn't allowed to use any Power moves. Thus, making any Diva or Cruiserweight movesets is going to limit you to basically only Fury Punch and Eye Poke Old-School-Category moves. In other words, you have both less moves per character and less choices of moves to pick from! What were you tinking, THQ!?The Season Mode and GM modes of the game aren't that much different from last year, and are kind of worse. You really don't have much more of anything in GM Mode, other than the new handling of feuds. You can now choose how long you want them to last and hire writers to write different storylines for the feuds, but none of them really vary too much. And you still can't watch them actually play out in GM Mode. So much for making your own video game version of Monday Night RAW! What's real surprising though is that you still can't control other things like what towns you travel to each week and how many people you can have on your roster (the limit is still twenty.) You'd think adding these things in would be simple. And injuries are still pretty much random, meaning even if you don't pick up a single weapon in a Hardcore match or get attacked even once, your wrestler can still be injured from it by the end of the week. What the hell? You'd think what you actually do in the match would determine the injury rate, wouldn't you?The Season Mode is also kind of the same, just with different paths to take, depending on whether your wrestler is a title holder, an established star, or a rookie. It's not really any better than last year's, but this one is kind of lame story wise. At least the Locker Room is a lot better, though. This time, you actually get a two story, three room space to crash in, which looks more like an apartment than a typical locker room! There are also one and a half new game modes. Money in the Bank is a nice addition and so is the new crowd brawling area, but they work a lot better for multiplayer than anything else in the game.The roster of available superstars is kind of alright, but do we really need four Mick Foleys in one game!? They cut out Eugene and Paul London for four Mick Foleys? The legends are kind of mixed. Some are just terrible like Jim Neidhart (who?) and Jerry Lawler (now really?), while others are great to have in the game like Tazz, Shane McMahon, and Eddie Guerrero, who they didn't cut out from this year's game! I'd like to see some more people added in like The Spirit Squad, Stephanie, Vince and the three cut divas (Maria, Kristal, and Ashley) more than close to twenty legends, four of which are the same person. I'd like it if the game had a more accurate roster though than just giving us a boatload of Legends, but the roster has to be one of the good aspects of the game. All of the big name people are there and there aren't all that many excluded superstars, overall.So with a not-so-great Control Stick grappling system, a shortened down moveset, very limited Create-a-Superstar options, and a weak Season and GM Mode, I just have to say that Smackdown vs RAW 2007 just doesn't live up to the hype, at all. I'm sure that THQ focusing it's efforts on putting the game out on X-Box 360 probably contributes to a lot of this. Overall, the game isn't terrible, but it's a lot less good than last year's. Instead of getting a greater WWE experience this year, it feels like we got less.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00320JDWG","description":"","reviewerName":"A Gamer at Heart","summary":"A Nice Change of Pace","reviewText":"A nice breath of fresh air into a very stale genre - the military shooter. I had been tracking this game, and prior to its release, it looked just like yet another entry in the saturated (and boring) FPS market.  Then, I started reading all the great reviews and decided to give it a try. (this review is for the campaign only)Oddly enough, the story here drives the game. Pretty unusual for a shooter.  Your Delta team (you play with two other soldiers throughout the game) goes to Dubai after an epic sandstorm has destroyed the city. Your team mates have great character, rather than the generic loud mouths most shooters stick you with. The brigade that entered the city first (the 33rd), to evacuate the citizens, has gone missing. Your job is to find out what has happened. The game draws much inspiration from the movie Apocalypse Now, although the game is set in the near future rather than the Vietnam war. Still, the game has a very 60's vibe to it (mainly because of the music), which may not sound all that appealing but really works in the game. The story is great, and the setting of a sand ravaged city with desperate survivors, is highly unique and atmospheric.  The combat itself started off as too familiar to other games, but as the story went forward the combat really seemed to click and I found it pretty satisfying. You play third person, and pop up from cover, but the weapons and combat still felt fresh despite not being revolutionary.  Having played every major shooter in the last 15 years, I was never bored. (which says alot for me) I found myself wanting to keep pushing forward to see what was next in the story.  The voice acting was fantastic. I don't know where they find such great talent for a videogame.I hope this is the start of a new trend in shooters - having a great story that places the shooting in context and gives it some meaning.  (Like HL 2, Metro 2033).  Sure, you are still playing whack-a-mole with a billion enemy soldiers, but overall the game manages to be fresh and enjoyable. Congrats to the developers for surprising me with a really good game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2012"}

Jak II was one of the best games I played in 2003.  It is possibly the best ps2 game ever made.  The game is great and it is the way a sequal should be.  The game takes place in a controlled currupted city called Haven City.  It is controlled by the man who put Jak through hell for 2 years, Barron Praxis.  You then meet other great characters like Vin,Sig,Kor and others.  The game has alot of twist and turns.  The graphics are a huge success in the game.Every backround detailed and sharp.  The city is HUGE!  Really huge acctually.  I thought The character development was good.  One thing that made this game really awsome is that Jak gets guns.  Awsome guns!  The Blaster, Scatter, Fulcon fury and peace maker gun.  What also made me enjoy this game was that it wasnt short nor long.  I hate short games or alteast games little to do.  This game isnt like that.  THIS GAME IS EXTREAMLY REPETITIVE!  One mission took me like an hour to finish.  Also the mission variety is great.  60 awsome missions.  Some long though.  The greatness of this game is shown with pure action.And if youre looking for a game to beat in 2 days I think you should leave this title alone.

It is frustrating beyond words to fight a boss and lose despite reducing their HP to 0 because you didn't properly perform their arbitrary scripted sequence.

This isn't a big budget, high production value game, but that's okay because the game is still very fun to play if you come in with moderate expectations. The graphics are average, the color palette, very limited; the controls are fine for the most part but gets sticky at times.  The game could have come out a few years ago because there isn't any innovation here. The deal-breaker for some will be the aiming mechanic.  Like others have mentioned, this feels like Resident Evil 5 and it feels like you're aiming with a telescope.  I don't expect auto assist with my aiming in these types of game, but they could have made it more like the Dead Space series which would have been great. Head shots are cool to pull off, but you'll be spraying bullets more often than not than pulling off precise shots. I'll also note that the \"zombies\" in this game are of the slow, clumsy variety rather than the ones on speed like in Left for Dead. As long as you're in constant motion in this game they'll inexplicably miss you. I played this game on normal and it was rather easy because you can basically walk/run circles around everyone.  The boss battles aren't the best and are equally as easy, but they are long and dragged out.  There are also health drinks you can buy at about every turn and you'll have stockpiles of currency to load up on them. There's also some side-scrolling sections, but nothing worth mentioning except that they exist. The journey will last about 8 hours or so and there is no game+ so I'll leave it to you whether it's a rental or low price pickup.Now, it sounds like I'm negative on this game, but I'm not. I just want to set appropriate expectations.  The game does a great job of creating urgency and tenseness by the use of the darkness.  Your energy drains after a few seconds in the dark so you'll constantly be under duress to flip the switch back on.  But there are times, you'll need to be in the dark to solve puzzles or defeat bosses so you'll have to do this tap dance going into light and dark to avoid having your energy depleted.And I still haven't touched upon the d*ck jokes yet. The extent of your enjoyment with this game will be measured by whether you feel the pubescent humor and dialogue add to the charm of this game or is a major detraction.  If you find yourself rolling your eyes more than chuckling at the game's attempts at humor, then this will be a forgettable title for you. If you view it as a late night B horror movie, you may just have a good time.  All it's missing is Elvira doing the commentary.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2011"}

{"product_name":"B006JKAS16","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Gordon","summary":"An Essential, If Flawed, Platformer/Action Trilogy Revisited On The PS3","reviewText":"Back during the PS2's heyday, 3 Sony platformer franchises rose to relative prominence- Sly Cooper, Ratchet & Clank, and Naughty Dog's Jak & Daxter series.  In many ways, it was a no-brainer; the PS2 was a bit too underpowered to match the PC or Xbox in terms of graphical texture resolution or detail, but its polygon-pushing ability made it a natural for colorful, cartoonish games.  Of the 3 franchises, Jak & Daxter was the first to emerge, having been developed by Crash Bandicoot (the PS1's attempt to take on Nintendo's Super Mario franchise) creators Naughty Dog.  Over the course of the main 3 games in the trilogy, the tone of the franchise changed significantly.  Although spinoffs, and portable sequels surfaced, there hasn't been a full-on new entry in the franchise for the PS3.  Naughty Dog has stated that while they aren't necessarily burying the franchise, their attempts to figure out how to successfully bring a new installment into the current gaming scene have not met with success.  At least we have the Jak & Daxter Collection as some consolation.  Like other HD collections, the Jak & Daxter Collection takes the original standard definition games, and presents them in native high definition format (as opposed to simply upscaling the games).  While there is unfortunately nothing really in the way of extras, it should be noted that with the exception of a couple of odd glitches and strange graphical changes from the original, this collection does an adequate job of reproducing the originals.  Considering how many workarounds and oddball gerrymandering Naughty Dog needed to get the games up and running in the early/mid 2000s, I'm willing to forgive the bare bones approach here, as it must've been a beast to port these games.The first game here, Jak & Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, is very much inspired by the collect-a-thon approach made popular by Super Mario 64.  It introduces Jak and his sidekick/buddy Daxter, whose ill-fated trip to an outlying island results in Daxter being changed into a fuzzy animal-thingy called an \"ottsel\".  Guided by Samos and obligatory love interest Keira, Jak and Daxter set off to try to find a way to reverse the transformation, which involves doing a lot of tasks for others in order to collect Power Cells as rewards.  The world the game sets up is a mixture of Western and Asian influences, with many of the tropes you'd expect from a platformer- beaches, jungles, canyons, swamplands, snowy areas and ruins.  The story is driven by the mystery of the Precursors, a long vanished race of beings who left mysterious, hi-tech structures throughout the world.  Unlike Super Mario 64, however, Jak & Daxter: TPL takes place in one large open world, with no load times.  The gameplay in this open world is pretty straightforward platforming, punching, and temporary powering up, although there are a few diversions from that core of gameplay (such as riding lizards, fishing, and using a hover vehicle).  The game clocks in at around a svelte 7-8 hours for those with some platforming skill.While the first game did feature an open world design, it also was more or less developed before GTA III redefined what the industry aspired to in terms of 3rd person action games.  The sequel, Jak 2, ushered in a major change in tone for the series.  It was, to be honest, quite clearly an attempt to jump on the Grand Theft Auto bandwagon.  Jak, Daxter, Samos & Keira find themselves flung through time to a dystopian city in their world's future.  Jak, after being captured and experimented on for 2 years, undergoes an obligatory GrimDark(tm) character transformation, and spends much of the game brooding/scowling/making angry/rebellious statements.  Despite one's natural cynical expectations, however, the game actually avoids being a cheap imitation of GTA III, and maintains its individual character.  For Jak 2, Naughty Dog managed to compensate for some recurring clunky control issues (no camera-centering button, strange jumping/vehicle physics) with pure atmosphere and ambition.  Jak 2's Haven City is what you'd expect if animator Don Bluth went on a 2 week Mountain Dew/whiskey fueled retreat, watching Blade Runner over and over again, while interspersing it with GTA III marathons, and then decided to design a city.  Claustrophobic industrial sectors jut up against ramshackle slums that lean over poorly maintained streets, while 2 layers of hovercars zip above.  Off in the distance, you can see snowy mountain peaks peaking above the city walls of the port district, while venturing to the areas just outside the city walls gives a hint of an unending struggle between nature and industrialization.  Not satisfied with focusing on platforming, Naughty Dog threw in a large amount of variety, most notably with the addition of guns and much more vehicular action.  Other aspects, such as hoverboarding, mech-suits, and rail-shooting, sometimes make one wonder if you could even call this a platformer anymore, despite the fact that traditional platforming is still present and accounted for here.  In addition to all this, Jak can transform into \"Dark Jak\", a super-powered freakazoid.  Unfortunately, all that ambition is weighed down by not only the aforementioned control issues, but an almost merciless difficulty level that sometimes transcends \"Nintendo-hard\", and ventures almost into \"Commodore 64-hard\" (only the ability to continue keeps it from going that much old-school).  That's good news for those who are looking for a challenge, but when you die for the 20th time in the same mission because you were trying to babysit the uncooperative camera, it does tend to knock the fun down a bit.Perhaps in response to those complaints, Naughty Dog toned down the difficulty in Jak 3, while making the game's mission flow more logically story-driven.  Jak 3 also introduces even more elements into the mix, including the addition of a vast desert wasteland, the second \"hub-city\" of Sparga (Haven City is still in the game, albeit in a much more compact form), several new one-off gameplay segments, the addition of new Dark Jak powers, and the new \"Light Jak\" form, new ground-based vehicles for the desert, and multiple gun upgrades.  This time around, there is less wandering back and forth around the same city, even though the game is still influenced by GTA III.  The story's conceit, where Jak & Daxter are framed for a disaster in Haven City, and are banished to the Wasteland, gives an excuse to guide and focus the action along a more linear-feeling path, as Jak & Daxter try to establish a reputation in Sparga City and the Wasteland, stage a return to Haven City, fight off multiple enemy factions, and save the world, all while gaining new powers and abilities the whole time.  In many ways, Jak 3 is actually better than Jak 2, but unavoidably can't quite replicate the freshness that Jak 2's changes managed to bring to the table.  Still, it should be lauded for trying to bring a bit of color and brightness back to the franchise, after the gunmetal grays and overcast skies that often dominated Jak 2.At the end of the day, the Jak & Daxter trilogy suffers from enough flaws to knock this collection down to a 4 from a 5.  If the HD collection had managed to add a camera centering button, and tweaked the physics and relentlessly sparse checkpoints of Jak 2, this might've gotten a higher grade.  As it stands, the franchise still has enough heart and personality to overcome the frustrating design flaws, and should definitely be considered worth your time and money. There are plenty of memorable moments, whether it's watching day break over Sentinel Beach in the first game, watching the towering mountains and forests rotate around you as you fight through the Baron's glass-covered palace, or hurtling through a desert oasis in a dune buggy.  Just be prepared to accept some camera issues, a la Ninja Gaiden 2, and a bit of whacky physics.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2012"}

The game follows the story of an ex-bank robber, a vigilante cop, and their battle against Charlie Jolson, a notorious crime boss of London's East End.

They actually laid down actual geographical miles of a European city; London; maybe you've heard of it.London is one of the most complex cities in the world, and for a videogame Production Company to take the time to lay down actual geographical footage is phenomenal.But the game \"fun factor\" leaves a lot to be desired.

This is one of the last games, that I can think of, that didn't take advantage of the right controller stick, to turn your 3rd person view character around to the point of view of the player.  What results, is a poor shooting view, which is about 90% of the game.

He can be a pain sometimes. (Like when he abandoned his party, and felt like a total @$$ later)--Will:The 28 year old man, who uses a hammer, but uses to much magic.(What is the point of having a hammer that can crush a cinderblock at ease if you're hardly gonna use it)--Chloe:The knight with a generation of greatness before her, but she has loads of doubt and revenge in her(At one point it will, and I mean WILL piss you off)--Norma:Where would this game be without the cheerful, bubbleheaded Norma.  She brings loads of comedy, keeps the game from being completly boirng, well she's like Ed from Cowboy Bebop.--Moses:And no he's not the guy who said let my people go.  He's kinda like Zelos, and he's a bit of a goofball, and he provides comedy as well.--Jay:I swear the first time I saw this dude I thought he was a chick.  She-male lookin' sunova... Anyway, he's the least likable for me, because he always acts like he's too good for everyone.--Grune:Ah, other than the fact that she lost her memory, she reminds me of Sheena, super sexy, fights with a weird weapon, has a relationship with summon spirits, the perfect woman, a Goddess(Seriously, and she's generaly rather nice to Moses, unlike Sheena and Zelos' relationship)--Shirly:Senel's sister, and he cares for her a lot, but yet, she always seems to find a way to be a complete burden for like 2 of the game, but she's usually sweet.-Gald is hardly a problem(The fact that you usually have more than you can spend from time to time)-Skits have voice acting(Which is suprising since it wasn't that way in tales of symphonia-Nice load of extras after the game was completed-This game is a ton of fun, and is very enjoyable installment of the tales series.Cons:-No multiheal items(Only Norma can heal everyone, but it's not always enough)-No Voice acting through Character quest.(Throughout the final 35 hours the only way you can hear voice acting is through the animated FMVs or skits.  I missed the voice acting so much, I almost forgot what the voices for some characters sounded like)-No summon spirits used(Their names are mentioned but they're never used.  What happedned there)-I hate random battles(The dungeons are wayyy to long and random battles are a bit frequent.  I don't know what was wrong with the Tales of Symphonia system)-The world map sucks!  The paths are not far away, but Senel runs way too dang slow!(Not to mention there's nothing of an airship or anything like that)-Puzzle booths are annoying(The only good thing I found about it, is you don't get into random battles with them.-During character quest this game suffers from Magna Carta syndrome where you backtrack through previous dungeouns(Dungeouns I thought I'd never have to see again.  They could have gave a quick jump like Tales of Symphonia did.)-I wish you could cook after that battle and eat, and get a limited status raiser like in Tales of Symphonia(But, you gotta wait till after the battle.)-No alternative endings(That is a real downer, seeing as how it is very common in RPGs today)Tales of Lengendia is a great fun experience, but in pails in comparision to it's Gamecube predicessor Tales of Symphonia.  This game looks like it was the prediseccor, and Tales of Symphonia was the successor.  Seriously this game was inferior to it.  Yet this game is enjoyable, and PS2 owners that never played the Gamecube success, nor had a international PS2 to play the japanese version(Which was realesed on PS2 there, and had much more extras than the gamecube version, and a casino, which was messed up), should enjoy this Tales experience, altho I played better.peace","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"K.

The story is unique, the environment and atmosphere this game creates is extraordinary. I know this game is old and the graphics are dated, but it still plays better than most games released today, and most importantly, it's fun.The Story:- You are a Native American war veteran, named Tommy, living with your girlfriend on the reservation working at your guy's bar. Your grandfather shows up and says that he needs to be with you tonight. All over Earth places and people are being abducted by aliens to be harvested for food. As you are about to be killed, an escaped prisoner on the alien ship sets you free. You then go throughout the space colony destroying key parts of the ship, etc.The Pros:- Even though it's a FPS, it does have quite a bit of unique elements, such as gravity walks that let you walk upside-down, and puzzles within the levels quite like Portal.- The weapons in the game are very unique and pretty cool. Even though it's clear you have a shotgun it looks so much cooler and acts a tad bit differently.- The story is pretty original for an alien FPS, revolving around some Native American mythology.- Each level is spectacular in design and very well done.The Cons:- Way too easy, you literally can't die after the 4th level.-  There's basically only three different types of enemies you face throughout the entire game.Other:- It only took me 5 hours to get 750G, the rest is multiplayer, but that's dead (I tried just doing a one-on-one and the game told me no one was playing)Buy this game if:- It's under $10, you shouldn't really have a problem finding it under this price used.- You like Halo, this game is different but it's still pretty similar and fun.Don't buy this game if:- You want a challenge, honestly it's not very hard. The only difference in the difficulty is on berserk you have no healing places in the game (which is obsolete anyways because you can't die after level 4).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2014"}

I've owned the NES, Gameboy, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, Super NES, Genesis, Turbo Grafix 16, Playstation, Gamecube, Playstation 2, Playstation 3, PSP, PS Vita...Monster Hunter is my favorite series.I've played literally hundreds of hours across Monster Hunter Freedom Unite and Monster Hunter Portable 3rd.  I don't think it's necessary to describe Monster Hunter at this point.  In short, it's all kinds of awesome.  But one thing keeps this game from being a 5 star game in my opinion...NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER.Yes, I know that no portable Monster Hunter has ever had online multiplayer, but this is different.  This is not the PSP.  This is not the DS.  This is the 3DS and the year is 2013.  It is inexcusable to release a game that is practically MP focused without the ability to play online.It works in Japan because everybody and their brother owns a copy, but this isn't Japan and Capcom doesn't seem to get that.  This game needs online multiplayer in the United States WITHOUT NEEDING TO OWN A Wii U.That said, if you have a friend or two to hunt with, this may be a 5 star game for you.  I plan on going as far as I can playing solo, which will be a challenge.It's Monster Hunter, it's awesome, I love it, but I can't give it a 5-star rating when it's missing such a crucial feature.4/22/13 EDIT: In my review I said \"I plan on going as far as I can playing solo, which will be a challenge.\"  I've gotten pretty far.  I managed to solo my way up to G-Rank, which I'm proud of.  There's a great sense of pride in killing G-Rank monsters solo.  A real sense of accomplishment.  I stand by my original rating (because online MP would launch this game from \"very, very good\" to \"best portable game on the market\"), but don't be scared away by the lack of online MP.  This game shouldn't be missed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2013"}

Martin","summary":"The Counterstrike Remake","reviewText":"Counterstrike: Source is essentially a remake of the older Half-Life mod known as Counterstrike. Counterstrike: Source has updated graphics, physics, a better game engine, and supports much more in terms of higher screen resolutions than the older Counterstrike game does.I would suggest a degree of caution in making this purchase though, for a couple reasons. Basically the problem is that this game doesn't bring anything new to the table in terms of Counterstrike. It's essentially the same thing as the old one, but with an enormous graphics overhaul.The problem with this is that for people like me who are most familiar with the old school Counterstrike, this game may bore you to some extent since it brings nothing new to the table. The guns are largely the same, the maps are largely the same, and the game is largely the same. I'm not saying it's a bad game, I'm just saying that people who have already spent a lot of time playing its older counterpart may find few new things in this title to hold their interest for much longer.If you fall into this category like I do, I suggest you try out some of the other FPS games that this same company (Valve) makes. You'd probably get more satisfaction from one of their newer games like Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2, or Team Fortress 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2009"}

I was still so hooked on MW2 multiplayer that I really didn't need a new game, but how could I pass up a new Call of Duty? I didn't realize until I bought Black Ops that is was developed by Treyarch vs. Infinity Ward. What a difference. Although significant improvements were made to the campaign mode, Black Ops is a step backward in online multiplayer performance.On the positive side, campaign mode is longer then MW2 with a more interesting story line. There is a good variety of gameplay here. You get to control a number of vehicles and the cut scenes are well done.  In addition to the improved campaign mode, the online multiplayer has some improvements too. The player stats are much deeper, and are represented visually with graphs/charts. Huge improvement over MW2. There is also more customization of your player, with fully customizable player ID (logo), face paint, more gun camo, etc. You can even put your ID or clan tag on the gun. You can also now play split screen online (finally!). These enhancements are all welcome improvements.Unfortunately the spotty performance online makes it frustrating to take advantage of these features. The server performance has been average at best. Connections are often interrupted, games often have to migrate to a new host and sometimes lose connection in the process.  This is very frustrating, especially when it happens right at the end of a match. Although there has been a software update that improved online performance, it is still noticeably worse then MW2. Also, the load times in general are longer then MW2 (main menu loading, connecting to server, etc.).The multiplayer maps are well done. There is a wide variety of locations and sizes. Although I have noticed there aren't as many camper/sniper spots. Most buildings have multiple entry/exit points. This may be a plus though, especially for those who hate campers! Overall graphics are OK, but not as crisp as MW2.Another weakness is in the weapons dept.  I have yet to find a really accurate auto assault rifle, comparable to the ACR in MW2. Most of the auto assault rifles kick back, making them poor for mid-long range shots. There are some cool guns, but overall I think MW2 had a better selection.The bottom line is that Black Ops does some things better then MW2, but it is just the small stuff like stats, campaign mode, etc. The important stuff, like online multiplayer performance, weapon selection, graphics are worse then MW2. And that is a step backwards. If Activision is smart, they will give Infinity Ward the contract for the next Call of Duty game. It will be interesting to see where the franchise goes from here.If you like the COD series, you'll like Black Ops, but just don't expect it to be better then MW2, because it isn't.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2010"}

My time with the series goes back to the very first installment of Mech Warrior; oh, that was how many years ago? 8, 9? Can't remember. But Mech Assault is the best of the series, by far, and also the best of mech games I've laid my hands on. The environment is vast, the gameplay tight and FUN, and the framerate excellent. This latter point is important because it makes the game enjoyable, compared to old versions where the mech would move painfully slowly. This time around they fly and leap, and truly come to life.

Even after that I went out and bought Ninja Gaiden Black and beat that as well.  You can imagine my excitement when Team Ninja announced the release of Ninja Gaiden 2 for the XBOX 360.  However, as I am close to finishing this game, I must say I am a little underwhelmed by Team Ninja's apparent lack of effort on this latest release.There is no big surprise that the graphics and detail in this game are extraordinary.  Just like the first Ninja Gaiden for the XBOX, I was awed by the attention to detail and the fluidity of the character movements.  Ninja Gaiden 2 you will soon find to be much more violent than its predecessor.  You will almost immediately see Ryu effortlessly chopping of baddies arms, legs and heads all complete with blood spatter all over the ground and even screen.  There are also a few instances in which Ryu slices bodies completely in half and the game shows in amazing detail the two vertically severed halves falling to the ground.  Ryu also has an array of finishing moves usually ending in a beheading that will satisfy the gore lover in you.  If you like blood then Ninja Gaiden II has a lot of that to offer.Almost equally impressive is the sound; again just like Ninja Gaiden I.  While I think the soundtrack is slightly better in NGI, the sound effects in NGII are excellent.  The sound of metal to metal sword fighting action is quite realistic sounding as well as the many explosions.All of this is fine, but the meat of any game is the game play.  The question for me always comes down to, is the game fun to play, and sadly NGII fails to answer this question with an resounding \"yes\".  It's certainly not a bad game, but it is not as fun to play as NGI.  The main reason for this is that the game all too often resorts to cheapness and cheesiness rather than offering a legitimate challenge that one would enjoy for long.First of all, Team Ninja's idea of a challenge in NGII is just flooding the screen with seemingly countless enemies that all have a good number of cheap moves up their sleeves.  Even when just starting the game, some baddies will decide to stab you with their sword that explodes a few moments later, killing them instantly and greatly damaging you, 3 or 4 of these and you are dead.  You can obviously block or counter, but when surrounded by 10 enemies or more you can't block or attack in all directions at the same time.  There is even one stage in the game in which the game sends so many enemies at you, the entire game slows down to a crawl because even the mighty 360 can't handle it.  I thought this type of thing was left behind with the 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment  System.Yes, the black Spider clan is back with their cheap incendiary shurikens, that they throw all over the place, in addition they are fast as all get up so winning a battle against them while taking minimal damage is nearly impossible.  However as cheap as the Black Spider Clan is, the cheapest enemies I have encountered so far are the enemies on the \"Submit or Die\" level that just shoot bombs at you all day, they are always camping way out of attack range so you don't even have time to get of a well placed shot with your arrows to kill them quickly.  By the time you have your arrow charged, you never have enough time to actually aim because there bombs will hit your forcing you to start all over again.  Having to fight OTHER enemies while dodging the cheap bombs, greatly adds to the frustration factor of this game.  Most of these bomb throwers are standing by exploding barrels and many times these idiots will shoot the barrels lighting themselves on fire because the game's AI apparently isn't sophisticated enough to do anything other than being cheap.  If you are lucky you can shoot the barrels before they do, but good luck in doing that on a consistent basis.  If this wasn't bad enough there is one area on this level in which you have to walk between landmines while also dodging these bomb throwers who are now shooting out of a 3 story building.  Then when you get close to them, you ALSO have to contend with some automatic gun turrets coming from another direction!  Give me a break!  How CHEAP can this game get?Most of the bosses in this game are extremely difficult unless you get lucky.  Keeping true to form as the other bad guys, the bosses are cheap as well; they will just grab you all day long leaving you powerless to do anything to counter until they are done having their way with you.  Nippos are useless so you have to resort melee combat or try your hand at aiming your arrows.  One good thing however is that once you get killed by a boss, you can try again at the boss and not have to spend time a lot of time back tracking to get back to it.  You also restart the battle as if you never fought it before meaning that any health items or Nippos you may have used are reset to what they originally were when you first encountered the boss.  The only thing is that if you decide you are tired of fighting that boss for the day, you will have to start from the save point when you turn the game on again.NGI was an absolute gem, and I suppose Team Ninja took the many compliments they received and went way overboard this time around.  They figured we would like the increased \"challenge\", but the problem is, it's not a challenge anymore, it's just CHEAP!  Even the countless moves and techniques each weapon has to offer are impossible to effectively perform due to the cheapness of the AI and nearly all battles just end up being a repetitive button mashing affair; not fun!To me, I don't think this game has much replay value; it's just too frustrating for me to want to go back and beat it again; I just want to beat it, be done with it and move on.  I don't know what happened, but NGII does not live up to the hype, and Team Ninja did little to make this game as fun as NGI.  Rating this game is difficult because I really WANTED to enjoy it; at LEAST as much as I did NGI.  I honestly feel bad about being hard on this game, but it is what it is.  On a 1 - 10 scale, I'll give fun rating a 6.5 and the overall rating a 7.5. Rounding these values, this correlates to a 3 for fun and 4 for overall.  The only thing saving this game from a 3 overall are the fluid animations, superb graphics and sound, and despite the cheapness, I would still say it's worth completing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2008"}

Lindquist","summary":"Still Hitting Hard!","reviewText":"The original Ninja Gaiden was an incredible feat of gaming. It alone brought the franchise back in full force into the 20th century. Assuming you don't require Ninja Gaiden II to do the same thing, it will be the best action platformer of the year if not longer. This game doesn't do anything new, which in many ways isn't a bad thing at all! It takes exactly what was great about Ninja Gaiden and made it faster, stronger, bloodier, harder and more beautiful than ever before. I have to admit, I believe they did have to tone down the visuals on the environments a bit to maintain a steady 60fps (frames per second - 60 fps is what game developers strive for to provide fluid gaming experience), but this doesn't degrade the gameplay a single bit. In fact, if you would just stand there to look at the environment there is a good chance you would become headless very shortly.\"Why should I buy this game?\"  Instead of going into all the details regarding what rank the graphics, gameplay, sound, etc are 1-10 i'll just say why this game might be worth purchasing or not.WHY I SHOULD BUY: The game has solid and fluid gameplay complete with amazing visuals are great mechanics. The game is a great challenge complete with a nice variety of weapons, all providing you different fighting styles and advantages, as well as making the game extremely hard to put down.WHY I SHOULDN'T BUY: The game is a great challenge, but it's also so hard that sometimes it might make you put your controller through your TV. To some that is nice but to casual gamers that can be a turn off. The Story, though many will argue isn't important for a game like this, is almost non-existent. The Camera can be very annoying as well. Often you are attacked by people you do not even see. This can be avoided by using the left shoulder button and the right trigger button at the correct times to keep the camera behind you or looking the way you want. Eventually if you get into the game enough, hitting these buttons becomes part of your fighting style but a lot of casual gamers do not want to invest that much effort into something many other games make automatic._____________________________________________________I would greatly recommend this game to hardcore gamers and casual alike. They have an easier mode this time around for someone just getting into the world of Ryu (main character). There isn't much that goes wrong in this game but it's not for kids or those who hate gore.Go get it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2008"}

It makes the most of the DS stylus and dual screens, and allows a Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to compete in two- or four-player battles.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Simply the best","reviewText":"The most addictive puzzle game of all time doesn't miss a beat on the DS, and considering that Tetris was the game that launched the legacy of the GameBoy, it feels right at home here on Nintendo's new, innovative handheld.  Tetris DS features all the classic elements you'd come to expect from the classic puzzle game with a few new extras and twists thrown in for good measure that will make Nintendo fanboy's mouths water.  There are six modes of play in this incarnation of the game: there's the Standard mode which is just as the name implies, but the top screen features looks at classic NES titles like the Super Mario Bros. series, Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Excitebike, and a few other surprises to boot.  Catch Mode features a Metroid twist on things as you catch blocks and avoid Metroids.  Mission mode features a Zelda backdrop and is pretty fun, while Touch mode makes use of the touch screen to line up big blocks.  This mode doesn't feature much challenge, so it's not as strong as it could have been, but I disgress.  Puzzle mode is basically Yoshi's Cookie, and isn't all that special on it's own, but Push mode is where Tetris DS shines.  You are at the top, and the computer is at the bottom, as both attempt to push their opponent into a fiery inferno by letting the blocks drop.  Push mode works exceptionally well thanks to the use of the DS Wi-Fi capability, which makes it even more of a blast to play.  All in all, Tetris DS is another quality first party title for the DS that you really can't go wrong with.  The longevity of Tetris doesn't slow it down one bit, and it's easily one of the best games for the system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2006"}

I must say the graphics are incredible ,excellent rendering, beautiful background graphics . The beasts are so realistic and so massive. The people who made the monsters must of had a wild imagination cause they're very bizarre but that said in a good way. As I like strange creepy odd things.

Everyone is dissing this because of its violence and parents are swarming it in a hell of controversy, but this is really fun. I love playing a game that isn't censored or toned down, THIS GAME HAS IT ALL! Prostitutes, guns, foul language, blood, great story, and the total freedom to be completely violent and make a virtual fool out of yourself! There are tons of cars to hijack, and plenty of innocents to kill. Sure, the violence is pushing the limit, but I have never had this much fun with a video game in my life!The games takes place in violent streets of Liberty City. It is divided into 3 different ones, like in Grand Theft Auto 2, but there are ways to connect between them. There are thousands of cars on the highways, and you can steal them with the press of one button. The city is huge, and there are many places to hide and wreck hell from a distance, where the cops will have a hard time finding you. There are over 150 missions to complete, and the replay value is completely endless. There are now jumps and ramps that you can find, which are placed throughout the city. But it is not like Stuntman or Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. They are bascially things like the ruins of a tractor-trailer you blew up, a pile of dirt in a park where the cops made a mess of chasing you down, or parts of a bridge that gets bombed in the opening sequence. Doing stunts is a good challenge, but you always feel the urge to hijack a better car and do it again, and again, and again.The missions in Grand Theft Auto 3 are designed great. They start out easy, but they can become pretty hard. There are many ways to beat them, and there are always many solutions. Like if you are told to kill a guy, you can: use all your M-16 ammo and kill him, throw a grenade, blow up the car around him so he is killed in the explosion, find a place to hide and hit him with a sniper rifle, or just beat him to death with your hands. The list goes on and on, and this is part of what makes Grand Theft Auto 3 so great.Overall, this is the best game ever made. There are great, gory, graphics and there is a replay value that is completely endless. Every mature gamer should own this.WARNING: THIS GAME IS VERY VIOLENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE BOUGHT FOR ANYONE UNDER 17. THERE ARE HOOKERS, GUNS, KILLS, AND THIS GAME ENCOURAGES AND REWARDS VIOLENCE TO INNOCENTS. IT OVERLY USES FOUL AND PROFANE LANGUAGE. IT ALSO HAS EXTREME SEXUAL INNUENDO, AS THE WAY TO REFILL YOUR HEALTH METER IS TO GET WITH A PROSTITIUTE, AND THEN KILL HER AND REGAIN THE MONEY YOU GAVE HER. NO PARENT SHOULD EVER BUY THIS FOR A CHILD UNDER 17, AND EVERYONE SHOULD PURCHASE WITH CAUTION. IT IS EXCESSIVELY VIOLENT, AND WILL SHOW PEOPLE MORE KILLING AND BEATING THAN THEY EVER SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0038TT8QM","description":"","reviewerName":"AK529","summary":"Great Classic Ruined","reviewText":"I was anxiously awaiting the release of this game for months. Ive been playing the Civilization series since the first game came out in 1991. Civilization is the only real video game that I have played throughout most of my life. Every version of the game has been a pleasure to play. I have played Civilization 1 through 4 on pc, Civilization Revolution on Xbox 360 and Civilization Revolution on iPod touch. The PC series of the game has always been more complex and required more time and strategy. I did enjoy playing the xbox and ipod versions but they were much more dumb down and required less skill and time. To my suprise Civilization is much more dumb down just like the xbox and ipod versions. I also did not like the many many changes they made to Civilization 5. I did expect changes to be made but such drastic changes are too extreme. The exclusion of several liked features from civilization 4 like religion, trading knowledge,vassal states, etc. Also the addition of many features which most of us civilization veterans just don't like. One example of this is the city states feature. They could at least let us choose if want this feature or not.On the brighter side Civilization does like very nice in terms of the graphics, but, also requires a lot of processing power and ram just to run. Also the addition of the game needs steem to play is a very silly move on the game developers side. I also appreciate the new notification system of them game which is fairly nice to have.I do hope that in the future add ons that they can salvage the game and make up for their short comings. If not I guess we can always go back to good old Civilization 4 and play that for another 5 years until Civilization 6 comes out if that will be any good.I hope next time the game developer and designers actually care about us, the people that actually play the game and buy the game to play it and not actually just sit there and have wasted our money on a game that used to be great classic.Update April 2011: After owning this game since it originally came out in September 2010 it has started to grow on me a lot more. They have improved the game quite a bit since released with many patches. I do miss many features from Civilization IV like: spies, religions, being able to trade technologies and different forms of governments. But I also like some of the newer features added in Civilization V like: much improved graphics, notification system, battle enhancements, culture bombs, being able to by tiles, etc. Civilization V is still not a pleasure to play as much as Civilization IV was. With Civilization IV I could play it for hours and hours. Civilization V is still addicting but just not as much as Civ IV.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

Sun \"Sun_Jot\"","summary":"Dark souls possess souls of gaming","reviewText":"I am 6 hours into the game now and I am very happy to say this is nothing less than what I expected. First I need to clarify that I am a Demon's Soul game fan. I spent 150 hours on that game for 5 play-throughs and I am a proud platinum owner. Dark souls exceeds its predecessor in multiple ways. Again I am only 6 hours into so I can only make my review short for listing a few nice changes of the new game for those who were familiar with Demon's souls.1. The graphics look really nice. A lot of people overlooked the graphics of Demon's Souls and now Dark souls does this even better than ever. The cut scenes are visually stunning and the game pictures are clear, with plenty details and just enough lighting. Overall I can tell there are some nice upgrades from the graphics and this game looks better than before. The art direction is superb, which will give you a full taste of what it is like to be in a diabolic church or far obsolete castle.2. The sound is awesome and the music is as good as before. You do hear different sounds when you move around, footsteps can be heard from a distance.3. The game setup is an upgrade from demon's souls. Most part of the game controls remain the same as Demon's souls so you will easily pick up the game if you played the old one. Bonfire is a good idea although I need more time to make a final decision whether this change how much revolutionary (I hope so and for now I have no complaint so don't worry about this making game easier. It's more of giving you convenience than lowering down game difficulty ).4. Unlike demon's souls' linearity. The world of dark souls is more open and that's a good thing. Now I have more choices as to where to go and where to explore. A lot of times you will be surprised to find out you are just next wall to where you have visited hours ago.4. Online remains the same as far as I can tell. The souls from other players online you see in the game now turns into white which I think is less pretty than before. But it's maybe just me.Finally, I think it's worth mentioning that I received the Collector edition from my pre-order and the package did not include physical CD/video disc and a guide unlike what has been advertised initially on amazon. Instead I received an online code for downloads. I am not going to complain about free stuff and this is not part of the review for this regular version. Just felt it's worth mentioning maybe the publisher/seller can do a better job next time updating their product information.Anyway, I loved Demon's Souls and I am sure I will enjoy this one. Now it's time to dive in the world that will give you immerse feeling for an ancient, bit strange, very much intense and exciting world!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2011"}

Zer0 has an ability to make a fake copy of himself which allowes him to attack sealthly as enemies attack the wrong target.  I havent played as the other two in game players but i recently played as Gaige the new character who can summon a robot that attacks enemies, similar to Axton's but the robot can move and hunts targets down which makes it more valuable.

{"product_name":"B00008Z0HX","reviewerName":"maninblue \"maninblue\"","summary":"Not a bad bargain title. 3&1/2 stars.","reviewText":"For a bargain basement price, XIII is a great action packed shooter.  Based on a comic book, this game has a unique \"cell shaded\" appearance that looks and plays just like the player is acting out a comic book.  Your screen will pop up little picture-in-picture slow motion images of your foes taking a knife to the head or otherwise stealth fully taken out.  Often you will see mini action sequences play out in the little screen that may alert you to baddies around,  show conversations while your main field of vision is focused on what is going on in front of you, or even show close-ups of your enemies falling to their death so you will definitely appreciate that comic book feel.  The cell shaded look is also very well done and easy to look at, as it is based off of the Unreal 2 graphics engine.  While those graphics are slightly outdated by today's standards, for what its worth, the cell shaded characters and world look quite unique.The story involves you as a nameless character who wakes up with only some vague memories and XIII tattooed on your arm, but is otherwise plagued with amnesia. You are rescued by a life guard and soon ambushed by murderous thugs who seem to be looking specifically for you.  The games story takes you along a path to find out who you are and why these thugs and armed men want you dead.  Later, you will be directly involved with ending whatever evil plans they have and blowing a lot of them up in the process. The game is rather linear, but you will have the choice to use stealth to eliminate your opponents or run in there guns blazing and picking up health packs.  As you regain your memory, you will also start to regain knowledge of super abilities you once had.  This usually involves you talking to then fighting a boss you recognize and having access to an innate ability on the next level.  These abilities range from one hit knockout hand chops, steady hand sniping, super fast lock picking, med kit prowess, and other skills.  The best is probably the silent walk skill because before you obtain that, all enemies can hear you walking up behind them which makes the one hit handchop knockout skill worthless until you can get behind the enemy to use it.  The game will encourage stealth by letting you creep up and snag guards from behind and either use them as hostages to keep from getting shot at and the ability to drag bodies around and hide them.  Guards will patrol areas and find your bodies and raise alarms, so hiding them is key.  You will get your standard shooter line-up of weapons to dispose upon your many enemies who are mostly nameless thugs or renegade military types.  Most of the weapons feel very underpowered with the exception of the cross bow.  The cross bow is like a sniper rifle that makes zero noise and almost always kills with one hit, especially if you can hit someone in the head or neck.  The sniper rifle isnt much more powerful and causes alarms to sound. Enemies will react to other weapons as if you were spraying them with a garden hose.  They will stand there getting pumped with lead, pouring blood on the floor and aimlessly firing back at you before eventually falling down in a heap even if you are shooting them with an AK-47.  That is unless you pick up a throwing knife and throw that into their face.  You will get a one-hit kill for that and can knock them out if you break a chair or brick over someones head.The game was fun to play and is worth playing twice or maybe 1 1/2 times just to see some of the mystery you may have missed.  Otherwise the game play is more or less standard shooter fare with an interesting look and David Duchovney's voice.  It would have felt more satisfying to play if the weapons felt like they packed more of a punch or affected the enemies more.  I don't need more damage, just more of an indication that my enemies are taking my hits or reacting to getting shot.  You will use the crossbow the most and love it.  On the plus side, it does have some multiplayer deathmatch and a few other options to play with however there are no servers anymore.  Feel free to enjoy the bots the game offers.  They are always average in their level of AI, but if you turn up the difficulty they are more accurate and jump around more.This game scores on many levels while missing on a few things.  The save system is lacking.  The cutscenese were not skippable.  The game is linear.  It has limited replayability if you dont care about botmatch. The ending contains a clifhanger.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Bowman373","summary":"A Truly Spectacular Game","reviewText":"CAMPAIGN:The campaign of Halo 4 mostly takes place on a Forerunner planet called Requiem, 4 years after Halo 3's ending. The Chief and Cortana are stranded on their half of the Forward Unto Dawn, and eventually find the mysterious planet. They crash land onto it, and encounter a hostile faction of the Covenant and Forerunner constructs, the Prometheans, while trying to figure out what's going on there. The campaign is excellent, and is the 2nd best in my opinion, after Halo 2. There are 8 missions in it, and each is very unique and fun. The Prometheans are a very interesting class of enemy, and you'll have to form new strategies to take them down. Some of the Covenant also return (elites, grunts, jackals, and hunters), and pretty much fight the same way as they have before. The Forerunner weapons are very cool, adding a new element of weapon scavenging to the game. As for the story, I wouldn't really recommend this to a newcomer of the series, as they won't know pretty much anything of what's going on. It's still really fun, though, so you shouldn't pass this up. There are also new vehicles to drive and fly in the game, but I won't ruin the surprise of what they are. The campaign seems to be more difficult this time around, as the Prometheans are very smart and tricky. You can still play with up to 4 people in co-op, which makes for a great time. Skulls have also returned, and are available by default. The campaign is a core part of Halo 4, and should not be taken lightly. My only gripe (and a very small one, mind you) with the campaign is that it was a bit short for my taste, but it is definitely a 3-time playthrough at the very least (because of achievements, difficulty, etc.). 9.5/10WAR GAMES (MULTIPLAYER):The multiplayer of Halo 4 is very unique, in that it is a part of the main story. It takes place on the UNSC Infinity, a massive starship which is also present in the Campaign. You are a Spartan-IV recruit, taking part in lifelike combat simulations. The MP is not story-based to a cheesy degree, but it is just a cool little addition to it. Before you can play multiplayer, you have to install it for 8 GB from the second disc of Halo 4, which takes about 5 minutes or so. This might be a pain for users with limited storage, but you can pick up a hard drive of flash drive for relatively cheap. Many changed have been made for multiplayer, including sprint as a default ability, perks, and customized classes. Don't worry, it isn't a Call of Duty clone: 343i did a great job of keeping it balanced. There are 50 ranks in MP, and after you reach level 50, you can enlist in a specialization, where you gain a special ability, new armor, and new emblems. Each time you level up, you gain one Spartan Point, which can be used to purchase items for your custom classes. There are many, many things you can buy, including armor (the changes are purely cosmetic), weapons, grenades, and armor abilities. You unlock all of the weapons fairly quickly, so don't worry about getting your hands on your Battle Rifle or DMR. You also unlock armor by completing commendations, challenges which accumulate across your entire career. Some are very challenging to acquire, but you'll eventually reap the benefits. There are 10 multiplayer maps, and all are very aesthetically pleasing and fun to play on. The new game modes are very addicting, like Regicide, Dominion, and Flood. In Infinity Slayer, the default gametype, you can now call in Ordinance Drops when you have scored X amount of points, which contain weapons or powerups. These are not overpowered by any means, just a fun reward for your effort.  10/10FORGE:Forge is a game mode where you can edit the maps included with Halo 4, not changing the landscape completely, but placing structures, weapons, and vehicles. This is all done in real time, so you can be working while your friends are goofing around (a common scenario in my case). Forge has been made a lot easier for newer Forge artists, which allows for so many more creative maps to be made. You can also edit player trait zones (i.e. in this area, there's zero gravity) and ordinance drops for Infinity Slayer modes. All in all, Forge is a great mode and only a few problems are present. 9.5/10CUSTOM GAMES:Custom Games have returned, where you can edit and try out your own game modes. You can edit default player traits, starting loadouts, ordinance frequency, and points to win, along with many others. You can also play your game types with your own Forge maps, which makes for some very fun games with friends. There's not really much else to say about Custom Games except that it's still awesome. 10/10SPARTAN OPS:Also present in multiplayer is Spartan Ops, a new, weekly-based, episodic continuation of the Halo 4 campaign. There are no major spoilers here, so feel free to start whenever you want to. Every week for 10 weeks after Halo 4's launch, 5 misssions are released which can be played with up to 3 other friends or matchmade for you. You can adjust the difficulty as well. These missions are short and sweet, and although the story isn't groundbreaking, there's a wide variety of what you and your friends can do. It's optimal if you play with friends, as it isn't nearly as fun by yourself. 10/10THEATER:Halo 3's Theater mode has returned, where you can record previous games, take screenshots, save highlights, and watch the finished product with your friends. It is very easy to use, and you can fly around the map anytime during the film to check out what's going on elsewhere. Whether you're watching an awesome game, an epic failure, or seeing the enemies' tactics, it's a very interesting mode. A major problem with it, however, is that you can no longer watch or save your campaign footage. This is a major downfall, especially for YouTube channels. It may be released in an update later on, but as of now (November 10, 2012), it isn't available. 7/10OVERVIEW:Overall, Halo 4 is a fantastic game, keeping the classic Halo gameplay while adding new, modern FPS elements to keep up with its contenders, These don't ruin the game in any way, and only add to the already-awesome multiplayer and campaign. It's certainly worth your money, and is even more fun playing with friends. This is probably one of the best games of the year, and that's really saying something. So go and buy this game right now, you certainly won't regret it.9.7/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Extreme difficulty and tiresome familiarity may turn even fans away","reviewText":"The Good: Excellent visuals, great array of fun guns, leveling them up makes the game a bit easier, fun multiplayer, the series finally comes to an endThe Bad: Ridiculously difficult, Chimera still feel the same, campaign gets boring and samey about 3/4 through, uninteresting characters, not much delivery in story, crappy endingI still remember when Resistance: Fall of Man (known as I-8 back then) was shown at E3 2005 and was amazed about how good it looked. When I picked it up about 4 years later it looked like crap, was ridiculously hard, and had ho-hum multiplayer. I never finished it and skipped the second game. The third game has a new protagonist, Joe Capelli, and has a more organic fluid campaign reminiscent of Half-Life 2 than Resistance. You go from the east coast to New York to destroy the tower that the Chimera have built to freeze the Earth over. This is the last shot to save humanity, but in the mean time you get to meet some new and old (Chimera) faces.The game is still too familiar to me and will be for Resistance vets. No matter how many times you re-create Chimera they are still the same and it's pretty old by now. The same tactics work, most of the same guns are still here (Bullseye, Rossmore Shotgun, Auger, Deadeye etc.) plus a few new ones. The Cryo gun is fun, but most of the weapons are the same, and the same problems are still present in the game. There isn't enough ammo that you can hold for each gun so you have to constantly swap weapons even if the situation doesn't call for it. There is no regenerating shield (there's a reason why Bungie invented it for Halo) and health packs are scarce even on normal difficulty. The game is extremely tough because it feels built for co-op because dozens of Chimera will come after you and you will die with just a few hits. This means taking 20 steps forward only to find a horde and get pushed back 50 steps.Thankfully you can level-up your weapons just by using them and useful things happen like your shotgun spits out incendiary shells, your Deadeye will highlight heads, and your revolver will cause more damage.Despite the ridiculously difficult campaign there are some great cinematic moments but they are far and few between. The first third of the game is nicely paced with varied environments ranging from a forest, to a train ride, to the snowy streets of New York, but after you get near the tower it's the same Chimera bases and architecture that we've seen three times already (if you count the PSP's Resistance: Retribution which was equally as difficult). The game gets even more difficult, and the story becomes less interesting. The characters are pretty shallow and there's not too much delivery in story despite a few odd twists, plus a disappointing ending that makes you feel like the developers gave you the middle finger for sticking with the series for 6 years.There's multiplayer here if you really need to keep playing, but one play through was enough for me. Resistance 3 has some amazing visuals, despite some ugly textures here and there, and will satisfy fans with a difficult and challenging campaign. FPS players used to Call of Duty and Halo will probably hate this game (and the series), so only hardcore FPS fans should take the path of Resistance.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Well now i can say this is probably the best sandbox game ever, beating and surpassing GTA IV. Huge open world, great story telling and high production (gameplay, graphics, music, voice acting, incredible multiplayer and mini games like poker, blackjack, horse shoe throwing, arm wrestling, finger filet, duels, wow). It is a long game compared to others. It took me around 22 hours to beat the main story with a 74% of total completion, there are tons of side quests, challenges, treasure hunting, stranger ,missions, live ever changing environment, wild animals that can easily attack you if not aware. Taming horses, and jobs you can take through the game, many living characters in all towns across the United States and Mexico.Great challenge but achievable. Crossing the border from US to Mexico through Rio Bravo was epic. The good thing with Red Dead Redemption is that you have checkpoints inside a mission, so if you get killed you don't have to start over from the beginning of the mission like GTA IV, so this makes the game more friendly for the player. A lot of moral values like the difference between good and bad, faith, loyalty, love and betrayal.The ending was incredible, because it gives you a hint of what will be next for the franchise in the future. And after beating the game, you still have a lot of things to do and play, believe me. Everything connects, and you really care about the characters.Also an expansion is available called Undead Nightmare, which is also incredible and adds a new single player campaign and more multiplayer to the game.This is a must buy and a keeper. Also it was selected the game of the year on the VGA awards.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2011"}

As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"josak","summary":"FUN! FUN! FUN! ....

Last year, Rocksteady Games surprised everyone by not only making Batman: Arkham Asylum one of the few games that were great for a comic book license but it was a great game period, license or not. It doesn't stop there as later this year, developer Beenox is will release Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions which looks to be quite promising with its unique approach by having 4 different art styles with 4 unique gameplay styles and could look to be another solid entry in a franchise that has been very hit or miss. Now we have Transformers: WFC done by High Moon Studios (Bourne Conspiracy) and it's again another surprising entry in a franchise that's just as bad as the previous 2 licenses and like Batman, your attitude will shift from \"please be good, please be a good game\" to \"wait, this is a good game? wow, imagine that\". In many ways you can tell this studio genuinely loves the Transformers universe and they took extra care in making everything fit the license from in-jokes to callbacks to designs that looks back towards G1 rather than Michael Bay (which is a really good thing) and with a campaign featuring co-op drop-in/drop-out for up to 3 players, a Horde mode variant called Escalation and a very frantic and addicting multiplayer, this is one of the biggest surprises this year and makes for a great summer game.Story: Taking place on the planet of Cybertron, there's a huge war raging between the Autobots and the Decepticons as Megatron is trying to take over the planet and rule over everything with an unstable energy known as Dark Energon. Using the uneasy forces of sky commander Starscream, Megatron goes through Cybertron en route for the key to win the war. Meanwhile, after the leader of the Autobots is killed, their side is left without a leader so in comes Optimus Prime to lead the Autobots against the forces of Megatron. Like most installments that have accompanied the Transformers license, you play as both factions with your choice on which soldier to bring. Want to play as Bumblebee? Go for it or the badassness of Soundwave, even? And of course one nice thing is that the game has drop-in/drop-out co op so it's not like Lost Planet 2 which needed a lobby so if you see a friend playing, just join them.Graphics: The game uses Unreal Engine 3 which occasionally means there's some odd textures but you'd have to look really hard because the game looks really cool. From the awesome character designs and the smooth-as-silk animations during the transformations, the game has a very futuristic look from neon and steel in bizarre architectural patterns and makes the game really feel alien. This has a downside however in that the game at times can get slightly repetitive and unlike games with a snow level, jungle level and desert level, WFC tends to be all metal hallways with the occasional differing locales. I did notice occasional some framerate issues here and there but it's actually a really good looking game otherwise.Sound/Music: The voice acting is really stellar and when you hear that distorted voice of Soundwave and the awesome tones that is Peter Cullen's Optimus, you know you're back in the 80's again. But then again, when you don't hear that kind of weird high-pitched almost squealing voice of Starscream it kind of sticks out a little bit but the voice acting barely has any problems. Same with the sound design from the transformation sounds, the gun sounds and the game really makes the gameplay standout. It's the score I have a problem with in that it's kind of fine but a lot of times it felt like the music didn't elevate a lot of the firefights and most of the time it just blended into the background and not really take over.Gameplay: The game is a 3rd person shooter but this is not Gears of War in that you don't take cover but rather this almost has a Lost Planet / Alan Wake feel where it helps to hide behind things so you don't get shot up but you don't take cover in the typical sense. Controls are very intuitive, especially when you're in your vehicle forms and while normally you'd think it would feel clunky and too strange to control, these ones feel remarkably comfortable. The game comes with the choice of 4 classes: scouts (cars, have cloaking abilities to sneak up on people), leaders (trucks that help buff out the party), scientists (jets which are weak but have a healing gun and a turret that reveals cloaked enemies) and the soldiers (the tanks with lots of health and big power melee moves but are slow). The class balance feels really well-tuned and like Aliens vs Predator, there doesn't seem to be that \"god class\" since tanks can still be taken down by a cloaked scout whereas that class can be found out by a scientist's turret. While they're all fun to use, you might find yourself excelling more in one class so I made a bad scientist yet I did really well as a scout. The game also has that ol familiar Call of Duty approach with challenges for completing certain tasks, XP rewards for accomplishing certain things during the match (such as stopping an enemy's killstreak, meleeing people twice in a row or killing someone with barely any health left). And of course that also means perks which can help you beef out your characters with abilities. The game comes with various modes which are really just renamed and \"Transformers\" versions of your favorite gametypes so we have Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Conquest, Countdown to Extinction (bomb planting at enemy base), and Power Struggle (CTF) though of course TDM was the landslide favorite.Another mode the game included is Escalation which a lot of people will compare to Horde mode but really it seems more like Nazi Zombies from Call of Duty: World at War. As you gain kills and assists, you gain points which you put towards purchasing things for your character so since you ammo and health doesn't drop, you have to buy it and if you need access to better weaponry, open up doors and in a cool touch, you don't have to spend all your points at once so for example if you want as a team to have someone carry the healing gun but none of you can afford its high price tag, you can either periodically put points into it which accumulate or just split the difference. Here, you can play as the actual Transformers whereas normal multiplayer just as nameless ones you can paint and rename but if you want to play Escalation as Megatron then go for it. One thing you'll find however is that Escalation gets tough and frequently so in later waves. As the waves progress, more enemy types and just more of them in general show up which can range from big melee-dealing baddies to cloaked scouts to flying jets so it really helps if everyone plays as a different class but even then, health and ammo really start to drain fast and it becomes tough staying alive when your health can drop quite quickly. One slight gripe is that unlike Nazi Zombies which were instantaneous upgrades, you have to wait for a bar to fill before you can access your ammo, health or weapon and even then you have to hold X to acquire it which kind of gets annoying when you need that health drastically and you're filling up a stupid bar.Edit: In my original review, I remarked that the DLC characters was kind of stupid when they're separated by retailers (with Enslaved and Fallout: New Vegas this fall being the biggest offenders) but the first DLC has been put out for the game with 2 multiplayer maps, 2 Escalation maps as well as 5 pre-order characters including the DLC ones (Jazz, Shockwave, Demolishor) but also adding 2 more (Scattershot, Onslaught) but the thing is unlike Call of Duty or Battlefield, the community for the game is somewhat...small and the chances other people have bought the DLC too might be small so it's kind of tough to recommend it. There's nothing \"wrong\" with it per se but if you felt annoyed by stuff like Resistance 2 or Bioshock 2 where you felt not everyone bought the map packs then the DLC might not be too favorable.If you're a Transformers fan, it's hard to argue against the quality in War for Cybertron. But this isn't a case of putting with crap for so long only to find the one non-crap title and think it's the best thing ever because of it but rather this is a really well-made game through and through. From a stellar multiplayer, the addicting Escalation, the fanservice offered and the care and love the studio put into this game, this is definately a game to check out for the summer, provided you're going to be in your house at all, that is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2010"}

{"product_name":"B007FMSDUK","description":"","reviewerName":"Selindri","summary":"Wowza","reviewText":"Not having played the original game (999 is unfortunately only available on Nintendo -.-) I was skeptical in picking up a game that was far away from the usual genres that I enjoy. I am so glad that I took a chance with this game because it is one of the most fun gaming experiences I've had in a long time. Mind-bending puzzles that both frustrated and amazed me and a storyline unlike anything I had ever encountered before. Maybe it's because I'm a little bit of a science geek, and I won't give anything away in the review, but the ending was absolutely fantastic. While this game does not fit the usual linear lines of most modern-day games, it is well worth a try. A visual novel with great voice-acting where every time you get an answer to one question at least two more pop up. It's so much fun to keep on guessing what will happen next. If you haven't picked this game up because you are a skeptic like I was and uncertain if this would suit your tastes, give it a go, and within the first ten minutes you will be hooked. It's been a long time since a game has kept me up late into the night because I just had to find out what happened next, but it's a great feeling and evidence, to me at least, that this is one of the best titles available on any system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00BI83EVU","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Great game and premise with only minor bugs chipping off the shine","reviewText":"Watch Dogs is what you get when you combine GTA open-world style violence and gameplay with The Matrix, and is probably the only game where your character spends more time standing on a corner staring at a smartphone screen than driving or shooting.The story is well put together and introduced in near psychedelic style dreams and flashbacks, and follows a master hacker trying to track down his families murderers after a massive hacking score.Gameplay is tight, and is a combination of Assassins creed parkour, splinter cell style distraction mechanics and close combat, and GTA third person shooting. Driving is the only part thats not well handled, as breathing on my PS4 controller causes even my beat up van to go to maximum acceleration, and the roads are apparently always wet as even a gentle turn can cause you to slide out.Side missions make this worthwhile, and you can spend an hour oing nothing but wandering around playing with the profiler app and collecting bank account data. Some of the click points are frustrating, as you might hack the wrong person or alert the wrong target, but theres such a wealth of side and back story that its contantly an adventure. Hacking will be your bread and butter obviously, but its just so much simple fun that even the nerdy ARG games they loaded in are worth dumping a few hours on.Audio is top notch, though the propensity to make your hero constantly sound like he's gargling marbles is getting out of hand. The graphics are simply sublime. While they couldn't do the whole loop to exacting scale, I could easily recognize certain streets and buildings and the feeling of scale and distance were nearly perfect. The only fault I've found is some of the smash cuts during the hacking between cameras can be almost nauseating on a large high end screen, and you can easily get turned around.Theres only a handful of nits. The cops are nigh unstoppable Terminator like automata, and I died about 4 times on the opening mission doing nothing but trying to escape a police search zone and running headlong into a roadblock that you always cant see until its too late. Driving is too hocky pucky most of the time, and the amount of time you have to intervene in certain crime side missions is way too short.Overall, this is great. Tight storyline, entertaining gameplay, gorgeous audio and graphics, and engaging characters. Literally the only reasons its not 5 stars is the difficulty of evading police in even low level pursuits, the handling of vehicles, and the graphical overlay during some of the hacknig mechanics. A definite buy and a 4.5 stars edging so close to 5.Update: After some more play I ahd to bump this up to 5 stars. There's some more mechanics of combat that I hadnt really uncovered, and they add not only a layer of realism but also keep the game from being near impossible. It takes a moment for a enemy to spot you, and doing so doesnt mean they instantly alert every other guard. You're still limited to mostly luring and dropping enemies one at a time, but just because you're a master hacker doesnt mean you're Batman.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2014"}

Players are immersed in the role of apprentice at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy where they learn the power - and danger - of the Force. Amidst a multitude of complex and richly detailed Star Wars environments, including twice as many unique locales as those inStar Wars: Jedi Outcast, players face a variety of powerful and insidious enemies.For the first time in a Jedi Knight series game,Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academyallows players to create and customize their own characters by choosing various characteristics including species, gender, clothing, and physical attributes such as hair and facial features. In addition, players can create a custom lightsaber, selecting from hilt design and blade color. As apprentices progress in their training, different lightsabers will become available, such as the double-bladed lightsaber or dual lightsabers.Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academybegins shortly after the conclusion of events inStar Wars: Jedi Outcast. Players create a Jedi apprentice character and join the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 to learn the ways of the Force under the tutelage of Luke Skywalker and Kyle Katarn. While the young apprentice embarks on various missions to hone their skills and abilities, a mysterious group is discovered creating havoc throughout the galaxy. Until order is restored, the fate of the Jedi Academy - and the future of the Star Wars galaxy itself - hangs precariously in the balance.While players are able to accomplish more by using the lightsaber inStar Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, they also will have a variety of weapons - new and old - at their disposal including a blaster, blaster rifle, Wookiee bowcaster, Imperial repeater, and a Destructive Electro-Magnetic Pulse gun. A unique level selection system allows players to choose their own path through the game as well as the missions they undertake to improve their Jedi skills.

This review is for Jedi Academy.In yet another chapter of the ongoing Star Wars gaming empire, you are a young trainee in the Jedi School of Lightsabers and Force Powers.It seems that every new scene in this game has you running into one of the Classic Heroes of the storyline - Luke Skywalker, Kyle Katarn, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, etc. And each of the characters quotes their traditional lines - &quot;I've got a bad feeling about this&quot; ... &quot;I sense a disturbance in the force&quot; ... etc.I'm a big, big fan of the Star Wars saga but I have to admit that it would have been nicer if they left those cameos as special treats, instead of making you feel like, even though you're a brand new trainee, you were plunked right into the middle of the most important characters in the rebel alliance!The graphics are really great, with a lot of detail on faces and weapons. While it was nice that you could customize your main character, they only had 3 presets for male and another 3 for female - and they didn't match up. So while you could be a male Rhodian, you couldn't be a *female* Rhodian which is what I really wanted to be. There were only 3 faces to choose from and a few shirts. Most role playing games out there nowadays give you much more flexibility so this was disappointing.You start out with simple training sessions to learn about lightsaber use, force pushes and pulls, and so on. Your master is Kyle, and soon you and Kyle are heading off planet to do various tasks for the Jedi.While the game gives you a good mix of combat and puzzle, I have to admit I felt very much like Super Mario at times, working to jump-jump-jump up a series of blocks ... falling down if the jump wasn't timed just right and starting over again. The combat gets better in later levels but at the beginning it's easy for it to turn into a button mashing contest.Definitely a good game for any Star Wars fan to get, but I recommend the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies for anyone looking for a real RPG experience. The character creation, development and combat feels much more rewarding in Galaxies. But those looking for a quick fix will find it here!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2003"}

It may be frustrating at times, but you really have to level up the abilities. you can mend abilities together for example, fire and some strike ability, and you get fire strike. once you level up certain spells such as Cure, if you have 2 of them at max level, you mend them together to upgrade to Cura, then to Curaga (as with other spells.) And the gameplay is very fun! Also with mending, you add certain crystals to get abilities such as combo plus or HP plus, and leveling the ability at MAX gives you the ability for other use. I started the game on Proud mode, so I got really frustrated until i figured out how to use the things.*Command Board*It's like Mario Party on drugs. You play the game just like Mario Party but you level up your abilities at the same time, or if you win.StorylineIt takes place before the first Kingdom Hearts, everything is explained in a beautiful way, feels like a PS2 game, definitely.All in all, I rate the game 5 stars.

{"product_name":"B00C71034I","description":"Warner Bros. Batman: Arkham Origins 1000381341 Xbox 360 Games","reviewerName":"Ferdy","summary":"Nothing new and quite a few glitches","reviewText":"First of all, I am a huge fan of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City.  I played both through several times.  That said, I was disappointed with Arkham Origins.  I found the whole game to be basically a superficial revamp of Arkham City.  Yes, there are a few new villians but very little else about the game changed.  The premise is that Black Mask has put out a contract on the Batman and whoever brings him down gets the payoff so all the top assassins are in town and gunning for the Bat.  This takes place prior to Arkham Asylum so not even the cops are on Batman's side.  This time instead of looking for the Riddler's question marks, you're looking for Enigma's data boxes.  Instead of taking out the video cameras around Gotham, you're taking down Enigma's networks in each sector of the city.  I played through the first time on Normal difficulty and found it to be much easier than Arkham City.  I'm sure the developers are working on these glitches so some may be resolved but during the first play through, I got about 30% through the game, it froze and I got a corrupted save which forced me to start back over from the very beginning.  The corrupted save only happened to me once although I've read on some websites that some people have gotten it numerous times.  I have experienced 5 or 6 separate instances where the game completely freezes. The only way to get past it is to turn off the Xbox and restart. To say that I was frustrated would be putting it mildly.The graphics are almost identical to Arkham City.  All Batman's equipment is pretty much the same except that he gets some electro-shock gloves off the Executioner after their fight.  The gloves charge up during fights and add a \"Shocking\" element to the scenes when our caped crusader is taking on a gang of thugs. Batman's abilities and gadgets are earned as you progress through the game in the same manner that both previous games have done.I was looking forward to this game for months and actually had it pre-ordered but it sadly has not lived up to expectations.  If you're a Batman fan, you'll no doubt want to give it a try but Arkham City is still the ultimate Batman game.  If you can wait a few weeks, I'm sure you'll be able to get a better deal.  I see this one dropping in price pretty quickly if others had the same experience I did.I have only played in the story mode thus far so can't comment on any online features.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2013"}

With a title like that, it has to be good, right?Well, good is an understatement.The folks at Rockstar had the courage to have GTA5 star *three* deep and realistic characters, each with their own personalities and interesting quirks. Michael is a middle age bank robber with a long and complicated history outrunning the law. Trevor is a meth-head psychopath who has a desire to decimate anyone who gets in his way. Finally, Franklin is a gangster recruited by Michael to help them with his own backstory and opinions on things. I still haven't decided who my favorite character is, and that is a very, very good thing. Each character feels deep, and even though you wouldn't do any of the things they do in the game in person (I hope), you can't help but actually care for each person. These are some of the best antiheroes ever created, and the trouble they get themselves into is incredibly interesting to play through and watch.Gameplay is MUCH more varied than GTA4.  Instead of the &#34;drive here, kill this, get this&#34; formula there are plenty of clever side missions. If missions aren't your thing, the classic free roaming crime playground is still here on a HUGE map. When you aren't busy with the game's LONG story (which, amazingly, never feels repetitive), you can play tennis, golf or even scuba dive. Upgrading cars and buying properties is still here, but both are more detailed than previous titles.What might be the biggest new feature is Grand Theft Auto Online. In this mode, the huge world of Los Santos opens up to you and 15 friends (or random players) for exploration, racing and death matches. Unfortunately, most of the online content feels unfinished and half-baked. While there is plenty to spend money on, earning it is EXTREMELY difficult.  This has led to lots of people digging for exploits. Only tiny amounts of money can be made from completing missions or robbing small stores.  Sadly this feels like a cheap excuse for Rockstar to say &#34;But you can rob stores for money!&#34;  In addition GTA Online is full of glitches, some of which are harmless and funny, while others break the game.  Exploits that spawn money and change elements harm the experience.While the online content still needs some work, it doesn't detract from the single player's incredible tale and I give GTA5's single player 5 stars for being perfect in all respects and for improving on the previous titles in the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2014"}

It seems almost as different from Banjo-Kazooie as Donkey Kong 64 or Conker's Bad Fur Day does. The game just emanates a completely different atmosphere. I guess it's a combination of very different music, different moves, and new characters. Kudos to Rareware on that. People usually like a game that play the same as another game but feels different. I mean, it's a different game, isn't it? Who likes a game that plays AND feels the same?Ah well. Banjo and Kazooie's final N64 adventure takes them to the world beyond the valley in which they live in. It's a large world, larger than the cavern that Gruntilda calls her lair. The levels really aren't that much larger than the mammoth world featured in Banjo-Kazooie or even Donkey Kong 64, but it's amazing how Rare has fresh ideas even after creating over a dozen massive levels for the two aforementioned games. Ah well. The difficulty level of Banjo-Tooie seems to be tougher. It's sometimes harder to figure out what the heck to do for certain Jiggies, and there are so much more stuff to find this time around. Not only are there jiggies, but there are also: Jinjos, Cheato pages, honeycombs, and everybody's favorite notes! The massive amount of extra moves can also get overwhelming. Boss fights, which were MIA in Banjo-Kazooie are now here, and in every stage. The extra modes of play are a nice change to the typical Banjo-Kazooie formula. I haven't had a chance to play as Kazooie without Banjo, but I did get to control Mumbo. It wasn't really as I had expected, but fun nonetheless. The 1st-person shooter mode was obviously a chance to cash in on the successes of GoldenEye and Perfect Dark, but they were actually well done. The 1st-person shooter level in Mayahem Temple freaked me out, but hey. It's all about atmosphere.Rare has always been good at having distinct \"tastes\" to their games. I suppose what helps them are their awesome musical staff. Although the music in Blast Corps got on the nerves of some people, it definitely added to the feel for it. The somewhat-like-variations of the Bond theme in GoldenEye gave that game a unique feel. So on and so forth. Banjo-Tooie had good music that adds to its different mood, but it just didn't feel as excellent as Rare's fantastic score for Banjo-Kazooie. Maybe that's a good thing. Having the Gobi's Desert tune stuck in your head for hours is not exactly a pleasant experience. As far as sound effects go, Banjo's deep utterance for every jump is JUST NOT RIGHT! Argh! I can't stand it. Oh well. It's a good game nonetheless.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2004"}

With new dungeons, new job classes, and other exciting features, both old-school players and newcomers can enjoy this genre-defining Final Fantasy title in a portable format!","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"One of the best Final Fantasy games and RPG's","reviewText":"My cousin was a massive RPG fan in the day, playing everything from Secret of Mana to Link to the Past to Chrono Trigger. The other one that he played heavily was Final Fantasy III. It's common knowledge by now that III was the third game released in America even though Japan had released six, hence America numbering it 3. Despite the fact the game's been out for years and I even own the Anthology release, I decided to properly play the game since I never beat it before and it's still a great story, memorable characters and scenes while having solid gameplay. It bugs me that there has been multiple releases of the same game but when it's as good as Final Fantasy VI, it's forgivable.Story: Previous installments took place in a more fantasy Medieval Ages-type setting. VI shows more of an Industrial Era world with the ancient magic disappearing and technology starting its takeover. The Gestahlian Empire has been making problems for the people with resistance from a small group called the Returners. One day, an Empirical soldier named Terra is found with amnesia and they decide to take her in and figure out how to take down the Empire and restore the world to normal.Graphics: Strangely enough the graphics almost seem...sharper here. But it's basically the same thing that was on SNES and the PSX release but more cleaner. It of course looks outdated, especially when it employs the Mode-6 system and we get the 3D-esque stuff. But it's got enough of a look to keep you interested as well as some humorous moments when characters do an exaggerated shocked reaction.Sound/Music: The effects are pretty minimal but where the game shines naturally is in the music. Before composer Nobuo Uematsu started to do the whole rock orchestra stuff, he did some of the most catchiest and heartfelt pieces of music around. From the ethereal Terra's Theme (made even better on a separate piano release) to the eerie Phantom Forest to the opera favorite Aria de Mezzo Caraterre to the psycho-ish Dancing Mad, nearly every track is a keeper. But you'll notice some of it just...sounds different. It's best that you buy the soundtrack since not only does it sound better but it's just good support.Gameplay: Final Fantasy tends to be separated into 2 categories: job systems and assigned classes. Either you can manipulate what your characters can become (Materia System, Job System) or each character has a specific style of fighting (Final Fantasy IX and IV). VI has kind of a mix where each character has a specific class such as a thief, a ninja, an artist that can control the enemies and many more. However, there's a system called the Esper system where the summons (\"Espers\" in the game) can be attached to a character one at a time and you can learn the spells that comes with each one and have little bonuses.The game isn't really that difficult but it's best to level up at periodic times rather than going into grinding mode and levelling up like crazy. Some enemies are pretty easy but other times you'll find it gets tense and you'll feel relief when you win. If there is any flaw at all with the game, it's that there's tons of characters. Some of them get backstories to uncover, while others just feel thrown in there. It allows a bigger range of characters to choose from but the party just seems too stacked and full.When it comes down to Final Fantasy games and which one's the best, the general consensus is that it's either the ever-popular VII or this one. Doesn't matter which one it is but it's still a great installment and just a great RPG in and of itself.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2007"}

{"product_name":"B007A7UJ4S","description":"","reviewerName":"Flea Returns: FF13","summary":"A surprisingly deep game that delivers on all fronts","reviewText":"I enjoyed this game thoroughly. On all fronts this game delivers and won't leave you disappointed. Whether you like JRPG's or not, it's hard to discount the beauty and charm of this game. As always my reviews are split into 3 areas with story usually getting the heavier weight.Story: 9.5/10The story is great and surprisingly deeper than you would expect for one that the main character is a little boy being followed around by a fairy. You are Oliver, a young everyday boy who lives in a small town called Motorville. One day when his mother unexpectedly dies, a doll his mother gave him springs to life and tells him he can bring her back but he needs to save another world. Oliver travels to this &#34;other world&#34; where cats are kings, cows are queens, and monsters are all over. It's a gripping journey where Oliver finds himself and creates friendships that help him on his way.Really the story is very charming. It's straightforward and does a great job capturing the player and keeping the player's interest. It is a little on the kiddy side (but surprisingly the story is more mature than what you might expect). And the story is fairly straightforward. Thus the .5 deduction. I personally prefer a few good story twists and unexpecteds but the story was fairly straightforward. Nonetheless, this is a very minor complaint as the story is unique and charming that everyone should enjoy.Characters 10/10Here is the strength of this game. The characters are so developed and so well written that the player can't help but fall in love with the characters. Oliver is a boy that is mature for his age but is the eternal optimist. You may get a little fatigued with his optimism and positivity but really his character development is so deep that these things are easy to overlook. Esther, a girl that helps Oliver on his quest, is also developed well and really is a strong presence throughout the game. Her banter with Swaine (the third character of your crew) is great and feels really genuine. Swaine is hilarious and developed equally well as Oliver. The best character I feel though is Mr. Drippy. Just simply hilarious and keeps you rolling throughout the game. They knocked it out of the park with him. The secondary characters are really well written and you can really see Studio Ghibli in them. Really just an awesome cast.Gameplay: 9/10The gameplay is one of those areas that have awesome strengths but some glaring weaknesses. First the good.You will never see a more beautiful game. The artwork in this game is just beyond amazing. The world map is a thing of beauty. The animated cutscenes seem like they came right out of Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away. I could go on and on about the visualizations but really I wouldn't do them justice. I for one loved the battles. I thought the way you can switch between three familiars, pick the familiars that you want in the parties for awesome customization, and really control the tactics of your party was beyond outstanding. The whole familiar system was great too. Very similar to pokemon. There are something like 300 different familiars that can be caught. Training them, evolving them, and tricking them out with sweets is just an awesome touch.Now the bad. And it's not really terrible but it is rather distracting. THE AMOUNT OF TEXT IN THIS GAME. Oh wow was it bad. I am a fan of RPG's and i know there is a lot of text but this takes it to another level. Just for a simple sidequst you may scroll through what seems like pages of text. I almost wish they had put more cutscenes in this game just so you weren't reading everything all the time. I know this seems minor but with all the sidequests and story elements you have, you quickly get tired of reading the entire game. The other negative is some of the capture percentages of a lot of the familiars (monsters you use in your party). In short you have to beat them and then you get a random chance to allow them to join your party. Some of the familiars have a ridiculously low capture rate...almost to the point of being ridiculous. Some may have a 4% capture rate. They could easily make this more bearable by increasing the capture rate for a certain type of familiar each time you fail to capture it. Another thing that seems minor but when you have quests to capture specific familiars and the capture rates are absurd, you quickly find that this part of the game can get maddening rather quickly.Overall 9.5/10This game just delivers. I mean it has undeniable charm, wonderful characters, a gripping story, and some of the most beautiful visuals with a completely unique gameplay. It does have a few things that can get on your nerves in a major way and the story might not be the MOST imaginative thing in the world, but all in all every JRPG fan should play it and even if you don't like JRPG's this game is such a revolutionary game that you should give it a shot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2014"}

So back in 1996, the Nintendo already had Super Mario 64. The addition of the critically acclaimed Wave Race 64 made the Nintendo 64 even more promising over the then-somewhat-struggling PlayStation. Although it may be largely forgotten now after the relative failure of Wave Race: Blue Storm, Wave Race 64 opened to critical raves and is still a cornerstone of Nintendo 64 nostalgia for gamers.But you know what? I think Wave Race 64 isn't really that fun! Is it a good game? Sure, it's a wonderful game when you talk about the technology relative to the time period. I mean, the graphics are phenomenal for 1996. The water is very nice, and so are the effects. The music is great. It has that soft jazz feel that appeals to people that don't work in IGN. The sound effects are pretty good, such as the \"blub\" sound when you hit a buoy. Heh. Blub. Blub. Blub. The announcer is just as annoying as the guy in Pokemon Stadium, but having that many voice samples in a game is something not even Super Mario 64 achieved. The guy just needs to tone down his enthusiasm. It sounds terribly hokey. And yeah. The game's physics are good, what with the waves and the water and stuff.But you know? Aesop was right. If you are unable to succeed in something, then you are more likely to pass it off as irrelevant, or not worth it. The same thing applies for video games, and it is something I had discussed in many earlier takes. Games in which an individual sucks at are more likely to be labeled \"not fun\" by that individual. Well, guess what? I SUCK at Wave Race 64. I have never been able to get used to the wave physics, and I never remember specific controls. I do well enough in Normal mode, but every other mode pwns me. I was never into jet-skiing games anyways, so I am more apt to become discouraged, and I say that the game is not fun. It's a vicious cycle, and apparently the game is the victim. Oh well. I have other things to complain about. I can't do stunts, so I don't like stunt mode. (Gee. What a surprise.)

It's a beautiful game, and one of those games that just rock to play on the go.If you never played Burnout before, it's basically an arcade racer that takes you around the world.  However though, what makes the game so fun is the fact that you can run people off the road all you want.  Burnout is a fast paced arcade racer that will make you think fast. If you don't have reflexes, traffic will crash into you, you'll run into everything, and people can run you off the road.  It's mindelss fun, sure, but it's a sastisfying racing game that has lot's of explosions.Legends is basically Revenge's gameplay although some thing are taken out, but they really don't matter.  YOu don;'t  have to worry about crashing as much as the first games, because you no longer blow up just by bunping a car from behind.  Generally, you will drive around like an idiot, crashing and speeding your way through different enviroments.Gameplay is more important, but EA did a great job with the sound and graphcis department.  The music is okay, it's not legendary music, mostly screamo bands, however, they go with the gameplay very well.  Visually, it's some of the best tracks and cars I have ever seen in a PSP racing gam,e.  All cars are shiny and sleek, and the tracks are detailed and make the game so fun to drive through.  It's great to see the cars crash, pieces fly everywhere and a great wreck occurs. It's a treat to watch crash mode, with it's huge explosions.Burnout legends last great bit is the variety of content.  Besides the standard World Tour, there are standard races, time trials, 100 crash scenarios with 10 special crash cars, like buses, semi cabs, and a firetruck.  Also ther eis Pursuit and the ever fun but furstrating when you lose Road Rage mode.  The cars are also varied, as you get all kinds of vehicles.  Both Old and new muscle cars.  Coupes in all shapes.  Hotrods and Gangster cars.  Tuners, F1 cars, stock cars, all sorts of them.  They are all sleek and shiny, and you also get cop cars. You also get alot of tracks, spawning different locations everywhere.  You'll race all kinds of places.  From a sprawling Colorado like serene enviroment, around a busltling airport, a beatufil island jungle, Winery Hills, Beaches, Interstates, Docks, and downtown, you'll be able to rush past all of this.  IN fact, it's just great to time trial the game and rush past the course multiple times, crashing into things, and generally using it as your crashing and looking playground.To further top off the chocolate sundae with whipped cream, there is a Wi-Fi game sharing mode.  Too bad alot of PSP games support game sharing, because it's a very cool feature.  Send you friends a demo of the gane, trade cars, bet your cars, or just beat their  in a head to head racing duel.  It's a great mode, and everybody know that games are more fun when it's a social expirence.If you are a gearhead, this is a must get, along if you are just sceptical of the technicallty of Gran Turismo (although that game RULES).It's a worth addition to the ever growing library of suberb racing games for the PSP.  Oh and avoid the DS version.  It can't compare with the PSP version, and I am not talking about just the graphics. Most racing games don't work well on DS besides Mario Kart.  Just look at how awkard Ridge racer DS is with it's touch pad steering.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2006"}

{"product_name":"B002ZJPYHS","description":"","reviewerName":"James Lin","summary":"Really fun, polished gameplay, but amazingly short campaign","reviewText":"I'm a relatively casual gamer who's a big fan of the single player campaigns in modern combat FPS games like the Call of Duty and Medal of Honor series.  I've been playing them since they were WWII shooters, and I really enjoyed the first Modern Warfare.  When Medal of Honor went on sale on Steam, I quickly picked up and installed it.  Three hours later, I was done.Unfortunately for me, I'm a big wuss and I don't really enjoy getting schooled by 12-year-olds online, so I tend to keep to the single player campaigns in these games.  I thought Medal of Honor was really fun, and felt that it was pretty polished, but at 3 hours (including the lengthy cut scenes), it's way too short to play full price or even half price for this game.  I've played DLC that lasted longer than 3 hours.It might be a better deal if you like playing online, but if you're in it for the single player campaign like I was, I'd wait until this game drops down to the price of DLC before picking it up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000X25GW2","description":"You are Travis Touchdown, a normal guy (with an otaku geek streak) who wins a Beam Katana through an online auction and uses the weapon to start a new career as a professional killer. One day, an assassin named Helter Skelter appears before Travis and the two face off in a battle. Travis emerges victorious and finds himself in the presence of Silvia Christel, a mysterious French woman who claims to be an agent with the UAA. Silvia gives Travis official rank of 11 in the organization. Now, it's up to you to become #1. No More Heroes takes place in the city of Santa Destroy, and you are free to explore the town to your liking, taking on missions large and small to collect money and purchase new weapons as you work up towards the 10 main killing contracts. Gameplay is all about using your Beam Katana (via Wii remote) to defeat enemies.","reviewerName":"Rich Stoehr \"Idle Rich\"","summary":"The Accidental Assassin","reviewText":"If someone had told me a year ago that the Wii would bring a game that is hilariously ultraviolent, constantly irreverent, and cheerfully bloody, I probably wouldn't have believed it. But No More Heroes is exactly all those things, and it is irresistible fun.In No More Heroes you play as Travis Touchdown, an American \"otaku\" (fanboy), dirt-poor and pretty much a loser on all counts, until he wins a beam saber from an online auction and uses it to kill one of the country's top assassins.  From that moment he is on a mission (encouraged by Sylvia, a mysterious vixen who teases him with not-so-subtle hints) to become the #1 assassin in the country.The game is made up of open-world sandbox gameplay in the city of Santa Destroy, where you can take jobs to earn your entry fees, which include collecting coconuts, cleaning graffiti, and even catching lost cats. Other jobs are shadier, and entail killing either one enemy or a number of them in a specific time frame. You can also get upgrades for weapons, lots of new costumes, and do some strength training, among other pursuits.When you're done exploring, the meat of the game is in the main missions, where you fight your way through hordes of enemies to reach the next killer on your list.  The boss battles are surprisingly varied, for what looks essentially like a hack-and-slash sort of game.  Many of them involve some fancy footwork and clever use of combat moves, but a few are quite surprising in how the final boss is beaten.There is a story here, and it is clever and funny, with a surprising depth. Take the M rating seriously, though.  Lots of sexual innuendo, crude humor, swearing, and just basic bloody violence make this NOT a game for kids.That said, it is incredibly fun. It doesn't make perfect use of the Wii controls (so far, that honor belongs to \"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed\"), but combat is intuitive and satisfying. Basic combos are done with simple button presses, while special moves and death blows bring in the more dramatic motions. When you swing the Wiimote to behead one (or more!) of your enemies with a single blood-spraying stroke you feel like you've just done something pretty cool.The graphics make nice use of the same sort of cel-shading seen in Zelda: Wind Waker, but here it gives a real noir feel to the action. Motion is smooth and natural overall, and the colors are amped up to accentuate all the action. The over-the-top kill strokes result in blood spraying across the screen and coins flying all over as the enemies fall over crying for their mama (literally). It is so ridiculous it's almost funny (the game often had me laughing at some of the situations).Speaking of which, the audio of the game is equally strong, with excellent voice acting, perfect sounds effects, and well-chosen music.  The music for the boss battles, where each assassin has his or her own theme, is nicely done and adds to the feel of the fight rather than distracting from it.In Travis Touchdown, we don't have a hero. We have a gaming, anime-loving geek who most gamers can probably identify with at least a little bit. Stepping into the character and how he fights is easy, fun, and more than a little addictive. Even after you finish the game once you'll likely want to run through it again with your improved weapons and moves, just to explore the places you might have missed.Travis might not be a hero, but sometimes it's fun just to power up your sword arm and kill everything you can. If this sounds about right to you, No More Heroes is worth your time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2009"}
{"product_name":"B007XYBUBE","description":"","reviewerName":"UrFavorite","summary":"Not AAA","reviewText":"I bought this game with the impressive that it would be Playstation 3's version of Super Smash Bros. It's not, in fact I wish it was since that would make for a better game. The game tries too hard to differentiate itself from Smash Bros. The biggest issue with the game is the lives system, there isn't one. Gameplay revolves around using your Super Moves to get kills which is boring and just not fun. There is a good variety of chracters in the game, it is missing some big characters from the PS1-era though. The menus in the game are very bland and boring, you can tell it was developed by a new studio. I had high expectations for this game, this game didn't even come close to meeting them.

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"Patrick H. Nguyen","summary":"great system and a worthy follow-up to the 360","reviewText":"If you had a great time with the 360, you'll have an even better time with the One. Hardware. It's a little bigger than the original 360 console. It's much quieter than the 360. Bluray movies look and sound great on the One's BluRay drive which is slot-loading. The hard drive is now internal like with the 360 S console. Currently, it comes with a 500 GB internal hard drive but will soon have external hard drive support which allows you to install games and other things. This is a good setup because it means you can keep adding hard drives for more storage. Better than replacing the internal hard drive which means you are losing 500GB by swapping drives (i.e., with the swapping method, if you buy a 2 GB drive and replace the internal 500 GB drive, you are paying for a 2 GB drive but you're only gaining 1.5 GB of space).Software-wise, the new OS is great with some early adopter rough edges. The OS is much faster than the 360 OS. You can actually run multiple apps at once. So if you want to watch a Twitch stream on the side while playing a game, you can. Or if you want to watch a football game on the side while playing a game, you can too. The system supports standby now at both the system level and the game level. So if you're in the middle of a story campaign for a game, you can go back to the dashboard and turn off the console. Then when you go back to play, it'll quickly load to the exact spot that you stopped. It's like waking up from sleep, it's that fast. Which means the need for checkpoints is less and games launch much faster. Note that if you swap between games a lot, you lose the quickloading. The quickloading is for the last game you played. when you load a different game, you have to load that new game since it's not in cache.In the beginning, there are a lot of updates. I own the Day One console so there were a lot of big updates (gigabytes). The later consoles will presumably have less updates since they will already be installed (the updates weren't ready back in November). Now the Xbox One fully downloads updates to games and apps while your Xbox is in sleep/standby mode. This is different than the 360 where you had to launch the program to update it. On the 360, you could queue multiple downloads and the 360 would turn off when they're done. With the One, it can update and you'll never know it except for a notification when you turn on your Xbox saying that the app/game is ready. This is one of the reasons why you want to enable sleep mode (though it does use more electricity than when completely off). Then again, my TV in sleep mode uses about the same amount of electricity.The games have been great so far. Forza Motorsport 5 is awesome. Best racing game out there with incredible graphics and a ton of fun. Also have Dead Rising 3 which is zombie-killing fun. Ryse is like playing a movie. The graphics are amazing and the story is good. They used a movie director/storywriter to write the story and it shows. Also have Peggle 2, Max: The Curse of Brotherhood (must own!!!), and Powerstar Gold which are fun downloadable games. Call of Duty: Ghosts is a lot of fun and much better than the 360 version (I bought the $70 360/One pack to get both copies). Lego Marvel Superheroes is awesome.  Can't wait for Titanfall and other games coming down the pipe.I have my Xbox One connected to the Mediasonic HomeWorX HW150PVR which allows me to get OTA television since I'm a cable cutter. Works great with the Kinect controls. I just say, &#34;what's on Fox?&#34; and I see a TV guide that shows some description. I say, &#34;watch CW&#34; and it goes to the CW channel. Or if you see a show on the screen, you can say it. Like I said, &#34;watch magnum P.I.&#34; and it tuned to that show! It just knows what to do which is pretty amazing. Here's me using my Xbox TV with my voice: [...]If you like chatting, voice or video, the One is great. The Skype audio/video is amazing. full-screen 1080p. The chat is a huge step up for parties. If the 360 chat is like AM radio, the One chat is like CD quality. When my friend first heard my voice over the One, she was shocked how different it sounded, like I was a new person. It's just so much clearer. Even better than cell phone quality.There's so much to the new Xbox that I'm constantly learning new things every day. It's definitely a system you can grow with, and the improvements that are coming via system updates sound very exciting.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2014"}

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

I am only a few hours into the game so far, but it's very addicting.I love the fact that you get to customize your character's appearance and when you upgrade the weapons or armor, you get to actually see it on the setup screen on your character and in gameplay.  You can choose to be a guy or a girl so that adds some replayability for sure.  You also get to create more characters for your party (choose male or female for each one) and completely customize them as well in both appearance and job class.

{"product_name":"B0054IN5AA","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"King of Fighters is Back!  With a Vengeance!","reviewText":"I admit that I have not played KOF since the old KOF '95 arcade days.  That's 15 years since!  But I have become disappointed with many other fighting game franchises that I once loved (Street Fighter comes to mind).  Also all the crazy Marvel vs Capcom games don't interest me.  What got my interest here was the slick arcade style control that I saw on the youtube videos.  So I pre-ordered this instead of Elder Scrolls V (pretty crazy huh!), mainly because I wanted the included soundtrack (pre-release bonus).I haven spent a few hours playing and I will update this review as I play more.There are several modes to play through: Arcade, Story, VS, Trials, etc... as well as online.  There is quite a bit of depth here.  I played through Arcade a couple of times.  The storyline is nice, pretty fast paced, and interesting in the arcade version.  The last boss(es) are pretty tough and bring to mind some of Soul Calibur's crushing last battles.  If you do get beat up on, then you get to continue with the option of selecting a handicap for your CPU opponent.  I admit the first time I beat the game I had to use the 75% life bar handicap... But I plan on improving quickly!Story mode is a lot slower and pans out like a partially animated manga.  There are no voice overs, in the arcade mode, characters' mouths move (without voice), but in story, their mouths usually don't.  I enjoy story mode because it gives you much more insight into the characters and the plot.  Essential for someone like me who is new to the series.Control is slick.  Some of the moves require expert timing and control, but you can get a pretty good grasp of the characters normal and special attacks fairly quickly.  They are often standard fighting game combos.  The EX moves are a little tougher to execute, and chaining them into massive combos requires skill.  Luckily you can go to practice or trial mode to work on them.  In one of the trial modes you select a character and then must hit combos to advance.  It's harder than you think!  Blocking is easy (hold away on the stick), jumping is nice, and running/hopping forward easy to execute.  You also have rolls with the R1 button (standard button configure).The music is a real treat.  Much is typical J Rock or J Pop, but there are some nice jazzy and bluesy tunes as well.  It's a nice mix, and the tunes are pretty catchy.  They tend to be fast paced during the action and slower during cut scenes.  And I love the voice for \"You Lose\"!  It's like he's kind of mocking you, but not in an overly obvious way.  I actually laugh when I lose and hear that voice!Graphics are a mixed bag. It's a little grainy, even on my Toshiba 46\" 1080p LCD (with HDMI).  It's more noticeable with certain characters, but it doesn't really bother me.  The animation and frame rate are good.  It just looks like a PS2 game ported and enhanced for PS3.  The backgrounds are fun but with the same issue, some grainy qualities, (pixellating?), but again, not complaining.  The characters are all well drawn and pretty interesting to watch on screen.  Special moves are pretty flashy, and finishing an opponent with a special move gives a fun little screen 'blast'.So overall my first impression is that this is a fun, fast fighting game with a lot of depth, plenty of characters to try out, and lots of combos and moves to work on.  I think that it slightly edges out SSF4 just with the fluid controls and the focus on attack and combos over defense and counters.  People will prefer one style of fighting game over another, but this is one hell of a fighting game that deserves to be played!  It's just FUN!If I were to give it a rating on a hundred point scale, I would say 93/100.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Son","summary":"Lazy and Sloppy Work From Bioware","reviewText":"On its own Dragon Age II is a decent game. Next to its predecessor though, it is a shameful product. It is a slap in the face to the series and gamers in general. Its only redeeming qualities are the aspects it took from Dragon Age Origins and speeding up the combat. Dragon Age II has improved its graphics a little and the gameplay is much faster paced than the original which I personally liked although it's harder to execute strategy with this technique. The story branches quite a bit which helps to keep you interested. The game stays captivating enough that you'll want to see it through to the end. That is about all I can say that is good about Dragon Age II.Dragon Age II fails in so many ways it's difficult to tell where to start. There is a ridiculous amount of backtracking in this game. In fact, most of the game IS backtracking. You will be restricted to a very limited number of areas throughout the entire game. These areas may change ever so slightly as the game progresses but not in any way that will make you feel like you haven't done this a thousand times before. Dragon Age II also lacks story. In fact, there really isn't a story beyond a sort of documentary style of storytelling of your main character, Hawke. The threats are constantly changing and there is no overall goal or main story arch of any kind which leads me to my next problem: the characters. With no overarching plot/enemy to deal with in the game it makes absolutely no sense for most of your party members to even be following you; especially the ones that tend to dislike your decisions. Throw that on top of the fact that most of your party members are not all that likable. Hawke is a great character but for the most part, the rest of his/her party is terrible You can load a save from the original Dragon Age Origins but it serves little purpose and really changes nothing.In closing, Dragon Age II was a sloppy, thrown-together mess. This sequel will not bode well for gamers who like a story that serves more purpose and has intriguing characters that they care about which is pretty much the entire Dragon Age fan-base. Even twitchy fingered, action-oriented gamers that this game tried to cater more too will most likely not enjoy this game too much due to the lack of environments and the awful amount of backtracking. Dragon Age II is a three star game ONLY because of the branching story and decent combat gameplay which I still feel was done better by its predecessor.PROS:-Improved Graphics-Branching storylines-Fast paced combatCONS:-No main plotline-Uninteresting party members-Way too much backtracking-Only a handful of environments to go to","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2011"}

From the moment the conversations began and I saw the cutscene-style dialogue, I was simply blown away. There is not only a very interesting and involving story here, but just as importantly, it is told with the highest level of style that I've seen in a game. This is as close to an interactive movie as I've seen.The combat interface is nicely designed, allowing you to zoom in with your targeting reticle for more accurate shots. You can pause the game at any time with the Space bar and assign commands to yourself or your team members. This is very useful but I actually didn't use it that much. Soon enough you will gain 6 possible team members, and every time you leave your ship you choose two who will accompany you. They all level up simultaneously, so switching among them as needed is not a problem. You can choose to have them level up their talents automatically, so you don't have to micromanage them. Your only obligation is to equip them.For your own character, you gain talent points as you level up, and can assign them to weapons, armor, skills, biotic powers, etc. I never understood how many points you gain each level, because sometimes it was 1, 2, or 3 depending on the level. The level cap is 50 (which I gained immediately before the final battle, how convenient!). Money abounds (I finished with 9,999,999 credits, which is the max) but I never found anything useful worth buying! All your weapons and armor will be found if you explore. Another nice touch is that you don't have to loot bodies. If the enemies drop anything, it automatically gets added to your inventory! I loved this feature.The dialogue in the game is first-rate. It's all voiced, including your own character, and extremely well-written. I enjoyed the dialogue wheel, which is a circular \"map\" of dialogue choices that lets you choose what you will say. But instead of showing exactly what the main character will say, it gives more of a loose, general guide to the direction of the conversation. For example, the choice might say \"Where is he?\" but your character might actually speak \"When was the last time you saw him?\" or something like that. The benefit is that you don't have to read all your dialogue and then hear the exact same thing spoken again. The downside is that you simply have no idea what your character may actually say. This somewhat reduces the conversation to simply knowing which *sides* of the dialogue wheel to choose at any given moment. Options on the left side lead to longer conversations with more information. Options on the right end the conversation quickly. Options on the top lead you down the \"Paragon\" path, and options toward the bottom lead you down the \"Renegade\" path. Sometimes you just need to choose according to the dialogue choice's location on the wheel, which feels a little less interactive than it could have.Finally, the game seemed a lot shorter than I expected it to be. There are a lot of systems and worlds to explore, but really the main quest only amounts to 3-4 big quests that only take maybe 2 hours each. A lot of time can be spent doing the side quests (which helps you gain a higher level early enough to make the game fairly easy going), but I was surprised to find that the main quest was just so straightforward. The benefit is that the story is very tightly developed, but for whatever reason I thought the game would be longer.Having said that, I feel it's an obligation to say something about the whole DRM fiasco, which is the only thing that accounts for the game's low rating here on Amazon. I stayed away from this game for a *long* time because of all the DRM issues that people were talking about, and then suddenly I realized that this was much more of a theoretical backlash than a practical one. What I mean is simply this: yes the game was released with DRM of having to activate every 10 or 15 days and a 3-install limit (among other things?) and I'm grateful for the people who so loudly protest these things. However, much of this issue was already addressed by Bioware (no more constant activation required) and yet people continued to complain because they also didn't like the 3-install limit. I admit it seems silly and somewhat arbitrary, but it's nothing that actually affects the game itself or your computer if you install it. I was worried about DRM that could actually damage my computer, but I know of no accounts of this happening with Mass Effect.My point is simple: unless you want to continue to participate in what has become more of a \"holy war\" rather than a real, technical issue, I highly recommend this game. I can't believe I stayed away from it for so long because of the DRM scare. It's too good to miss because of that.(Installed and ran perfectly on Windows 7 64-bit)Edit: I've always been slightly bothered by my comment above, which seems to diminish the importance of the protests against DRM. I wanted to add this additional comment simply to say that I am very glad there are people out there who oppose any type of DRM, and ideally we should all be rejecting games that use it. I held out on Mass Effect for a long time until a lot of the DRM issues were addressed, but to an extent I more or less \"settled\" for some DRM just to play the game. Like I said, the game is fantastic, but I'd rather have more people like the protesters than people like me who eventually buy the game, because it's the only way the game companies will get the message.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00004XOWT","description":"If the original PlayStation was the video game console equivalent of the  '60s-era Volkswagen Beetle--economic, reliable, loads of fun--the PS One could  be considered the new Beetle--a hip restyling of those same qualities.Make no mistake: the PS One has all of the same functionality as the original  PlayStation workhorse, will work with all of the same peripherals and  accessories, and will play the existing PlayStation game library, as well as  audio CDs (also note that, like the original PlayStation, it's not compatible  with the more advancedPlayStation  2). The difference here is that this new model is quite a bit smaller than  its older brother, and quite a bit cuter, too.The system is made up of a 32-bit, 34-MHz RISC processor with 16 Mbits of main  memory, 8 Mbits of graphics memory, 24-channel stereo sound, double-speed CD-ROM  drive, and one Dual Shock analog controller. That's not a lot of power, compared  to a next-generation system like theSega  Dreamcast; but, when you factor in its very low price and the enormous  library of games that are available (more than 1,000 that are spread across  every genre imaginable), one can see easily why it's as good a deal as ever.

The controller included with the PSone is a different color than the one included in the original (original Playstation includes a grey controller and the PSone includes a white controller). One accessory that is only compatable with the PSone system is the Sony LCD Screen for PSone.

{"product_name":"B001B1W3GG","description":"BioShock is an innovative role-playing shooter from Irrational Games who was named IGN&#8217;s 2005 Developer of the Year. BioShock immerses players into a war-torn underwater utopia, where mankind has abandoned their humanity in their quest for perfection.","reviewerName":"CallMeZoidberg","summary":"Unbelievable atmosphere and strong narrative meet first-person gameplay","reviewText":"2K Game's critically acclaimed Game of the Year from last year has finally hit the PS3, losing none of its revolutionary charm, and adding several new extras to keep gamers coming back for more.BioShock begins with a plane crash in the Atlantic Ocean. As you float around the wreckage in the first person view, the immersion begins, and is never broken. Following the crash, you end up descending into Rapture, a remarkably designed underwater city. The genius behind Rapture is megalomaniac Andrew Ryan. While Ryan's ideals may be genuine, his city is an appalling failure, left in a state of decay, with the horribly mutated survivors as trapped as you are.BioShock's most impressive feat is its deliverance of a compelling narrative - an aspect rarely thought of in conjunction with the FPS genre. The game's main storyline is provided to you through radio transmissions, never removing you from the action. However, scattered throughout Rapture are dozens of audio diaries just waiting to be found, which further shed light on characters and events that have transpired.There is no black and white to this game, no clear cut good and evil. Rather, the characters are left to interpretation by the player, much as they would in an excellent novel. The characterization is impressive and the characters remarkably believable. Ryan in particular is striking. His voice work is done to perfection, but it's what he says that really leaves you questioning - one of the many astounding feats in BioShock.The game leaves you questioning and deciding for yourself who is good and who is evil, and still there is no clear-cut answer. It leaves you questioning your actions as you progress through the game. Even the mutated survivors have an astounding sense of awareness, they aren't mindless cannon fodder. The game leaves you wondering if these creatures do indeed have any humanity left; as demented as they are, they're fully functioning beings that talk and even sing, lending to some ironic and dark humor throughout.If BioShock played out like a movie, without any player interactions, it would still be worth the purchase. Thankfully, the gameplay manages to keep stride with the exceptional and powerful storytelling. The game features standard weapons one would expect to find in a FPS: handgun, shotgun, machine gun, etc, though it also features some standouts - one of which I don't want to spoil - as well as your handy wrench, which is the game only melee weapon, and remains effective throughout the game.The weapon based combat is balanced out through plasmids, which are unique powers that you can employ for equally unique results. You can shoot electricity out of your hands to stun enemies, use Incinerate to light them ablaze (causing them to quickly try and extinguish themselves), Target Dummy to distract enemies, or even send a swarm of vicious bees after your foes. These unique abilities, interwoven so seamlessly in the gameplay, keep the game incredibly fresh, fun, and inventive.The gameplay branches out further in hacking, which takes the form of a pipe minigame where you must switch the plates of a pipe to guide water from one end to another. A wide variety of things can be hacked, from turrets to shoot your enemies to vending machines for cheaper prices. Another addition to the gameplay is a research camera, which can be used to snap photos of all the different types of enemies, eventually resulting in various upgrades.The PS3 version of the game also boasts some features that may prove to improve the longevity of the game as well, such as the ramped up challenge of Survivor mode and exclusive DLC.The sound and art design are an integral part in making Rapture come alive, as well as creating one of the most believable game universes ever created. There is noticeable influence of the 1960's (that's when the game takes place), from the music to the art style on posters and whatnot scattered throughout the game. One of the most impressive features about the sound is the subtlety. Of course the voice work is top notch, the gruesome squish of your wrench against a Splicer satisfying and morbid, but the subtleties really sell the world. In any moment where something isn't going on directly with you, Rapture is still alive and moving. It never feels like you are the center of Rapture, with nothing going on without your direct involvement. Turn the sound way up in a Splicer-free area and you can hear the stunning ambient sounds from dripping water below to machine work going on all around.The graphics are top notch with the PS3 version including some new textures, though some older textures are still present. There is also the occasional slowdown period, which may `teleport' you through a couple of seconds of movement. All in all, though, the graphics are still top-notch, a year after the game's initial release. Strong technical prowess coupled with the atmospheric art design leave you hard pressed to find anything wrong with this game visually.Not having played BioShock, given its availability on three different consoles, is downright inexcusable at this point. Anyone who does not play this game is doing themselves a complete disservice. This is easily the best FPS in years, arguably the best ever, and easily one of the best games in years. BioShock reaches a pinnacle that few games can ever claimed to have reached. Its narrative, which I cannot praise enough, is truly comparable to famous pieces of literature. There aren't enough words to describe BioShock properly; would you kindly just go out and buy this game?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed.

Some locations familiar to people who have played Dead Space, and some new.  You will learn how the events unfolded, and take a direct part in setting the stage for Dead Space.  Dead Space: Extraction is extremely thick with plot points and character development.  The story is very rich, and doubly so for players (and fans) of the original Dead Space.  The story continuity is gripping and well done.Dead Space: Extraction is like watching a movie with rail shooter action.  By no means is the action in the game boring or mundane.  As a player you need to be on your toes because the camera moves around like a person's actual head might.  You'll often time catch quick glances of enemies approaching only to face another group -- but it pays to remember how the original group were laid out.  You'll find weapon power-ups, text logs, and audio logs through out the game.  Sometimes you'll get a quick shot of one, then look away, but then you'll get another opportunity to see it and thus grab it.  Sometimes you'll get a timer controlled chance to free look around for goodies or extra ammo that is laying around.  These mechanisms keep you engaged even when it seems like no bad guys are imminent.I don't have a lot of experience with rail shooters, but I would say, mechanic-wise, this one was well done.  The controls are fluid, the weapons effective, and the action intense.  I did get a gun to play this game but I found that with the wii-mote in the gun I couldn't get to the buttons I needed to play the game effectively.  In the end, I ended up using the wii-mote by itself and that worked swimmingly.I didn't experience the many glitches/technical issues that others have described, although the game did freeze on me one time.I think this is a fantastic game in pretty much every respect, and makes fantastic use of the wii-mote.  I think the game is especially worth pursuing for fans of the original Dead Space -- although I don't think that is a requisite.

In fact, aside from being in a fantasy setting, it had little to nothing to do with the original Bioshock in any way shape or form. On it's hardest setting, there was little variety in enemy engagements and very little challenge. The unique atmosphere literally only exists at the very beginning of the game and degenerates into the usual indoor environments or just locations separated by rails very fast.When Irrational (a hometown developer) ended up laying off a bunch of staff I really didn't question it...

{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"Lionheart","summary":"Revisiting Vice City","reviewText":"First, this game was not really developed as a sequel to Vice City, but as a GTA game for the PSP (which is a whole different system with a whole different set of limitations), so don't expect too much. Revamped for the PS2, it's still essentially the same title. Which is, basically, a smaller version of the original, with a different screenplay (set before Vercetti came to Vice City).That does not, however, make it a bad game. It's still Vice City, which is way more fun that Liberty City ever was. Sun, fun, and sand, early eighties music, brand-new missions (many featuring characters from the original Vice City), new races, new extras, what's not to like? And especially fun here is the gang-war aspect, which has your businesses being attacked by enemies (much like what happens in the Godfather titles). So that even beyond the missions and side missions, there are hours to be spent fending off your competition.The story is also lightened by celebrity guest appearances, like Phil Collins. Driving Phil around in a limo protecting him from the bad guys so he can sing \"Tonight, Tonight,\" at the local stadium? Great fun. And of course it's immensely satisfying to catch up on other GTA personalities, like a young Lazlo.My only problem with this game, in fact, is that it is too small. Designed for the PSP as it is, you'll get through the main story twice as quick. And then what? There should have been more missions included for the PS2 version -- surely that wouldn't have required a lot of effort?It's also smaller in other ways: fewer cars, shabbier graphics, shorter cut scenes, etc. Again, all of which illustrate not that the game is bad, but that it was designed for the wrong system. A smaller version of Vice City should have been designed for the PSP, while this one should have been made for the PS2; or better yet, held off a couple years and developed for the PS3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Adrian Cooper \"That Guy from Venus. :D\"","summary":"The best smash bros. game out in America now.","reviewText":"The original doesn't hold a candle to this one.I know I'm years and years late, with this, but I had to make one sometime!This game as well as the first isn't only innovative, it's addictive.Fun alone but a blast with a friend or three. :)I miss the days when me and my cousin could play this for 2-4 hours at a time with next to no breaks!I miss even more when another friend would come around and although he would lose most of the time, the 1 on 1 on 1 matches were almost always so damn heated.This game only brings great joy and anticipation of what's to come in 2 days....:)Fun: 4.5/5Game Play: 4.5/5Sound: 5/5 (the orchestras are the best)Multiplayer: 4.25-5 (depending on how many people)Character Choice: 5/5Replay-ability: 4.5/5 (after years of playing, or if it's only you and another, 4.25/5. it gets boring MUCH quicker.)I don't have a Wii (or want one at this point).

However, you don't need a memory card; memory storage is in the controllers. 9/10The PS2 has the best controller; all the buttons are placed perfectly, but it does not have any memory storage and needs a memory card. 9/10Gamecube's controller's buttons are very weirdly shaped, making gameplay horrible, and it also has no memory storage which makes it need a memory card. 7/10=Loyal Games=Xbox has one very loyal series which is very good in quality - Halo. 10/10Gamecube has Mario, Zelda, Metroid, Pokemon, Donkey Kong, and possible others, which went to Gameboy Advance, which is okay because Gameboy Advance is also Nintendo. 10/10As for PS2, there isn't a single PS2 loyal series that had the tendency or the resistance to STAY with Sony. Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories is on GBA, GTA San Andreas is coming to Xbox, Tekken Advance is for GBA, Gran Turismo came out for GBA, and Final Fantasy the Chrystal Chronicals went to Gamecube. 9/10=Other Gen Gameplay=Xbox, cannot play PC games although it should be able to due to the fact that it is Microsoft. 1/10PS2 can play PS1 games 10/10Gamecube can play Gameboy games, but you need to buy the Gameboy Player 8/10.=Other Playable Things=Xbox can play DVDs, but you need to buy the DVD controller. It might also be able to play Audio CDs. 8/10PS2 can easily play DVDs, and CDs. 10/10Gamecube can do neither. 1/10=The Future=Xbox 2 is due to come out in 2005. So far I've heard that it cannot play Xbox1 games.PS2 has PSP, the PlayStation Prtable, which is also due to come out in 2005 and it has better graphics than PS2, and possible better than XBox. There is also the PSX, which can burn DVDs, burn CDs, record things from TV onto aDVD-R or RW, has a builtin online play, can play PS2, PS1, and DVDs and possible even more. The PS3 is due to come out in 2006 now, and so far it seems it can play PS2, and will havebetter graphics then Xbox 2.Gamecube seems liek it will go out of business, just like all other previous Nintendo consoles. Rumors are a new console called Dolphin. There is also the handheld DS, which is pathetic compared to the PSP.Now to make a conclusion, making an in-depth comparison with PS2 and Gamecube, xbox is very good, way better than Gamecube, but it is still not better than PlayStation 2.

It's a better multi-player than Crysis 2 because of player controlled Pingers dropped into certain maps, alien weaponry found throughout the maps, the gunplay is much tighter, better connections with the servers, etc.  As well everyone has default stomp that's really cool, no matter what your build is you can stomp and kill anytime.  However, the maps aren't as great as Crysis 2, those were some great maps.  The bow is a cool edition, but I think the hype for the bow was overblown most people prefer guns in this fast paced FPS.The other thing is once again the fans, just is a small core group of fans, not near the numbers of other popular FPS'.  You can only find one or two lobbies to get a game going, that I just don't get.  I guess people would rather play Black Ops 2.

Yes, it's taken me that long to finish it. But it sure is a wonderful game. In terms of graphics, Riven was a simple step up from Myst. But Myst III adds a whole new level of realism to the franchise.The main new feature is that you can look anywhere you want in any direction withing the photo-realistic worlds when before you could only look at a limited amount of certain things. These worlds are empty but beautiful to look at and have an eerie, ghostly atmosphere to them. The graphics are so convincing that the roller-coaster ride in the middle of the game will make you feel like you're really there. Not only do the graphics stand out but sound effects pan across the sound-field when you spin around and wind whistles between the rocks.The story involves the maniacal sons of Atrus (that would be Sirrus and Achenar) continuing to wreak havoc through-out the ages. They have destroyed a world known as Narayan and left sole-survivor in exile on the island of J'Nanin. This man is Saavedro (Brad Dourif), who ultimately blames Atrus for his sons going off the deep end.Atrus (played by Rand Miller as always) calls upon you to go to J'Nanin and find Saavedro, who has stolen Atrus new age Raleeshan. Saavedro traps you into going through many different worlds, unlocking secrets, finding clues and seeing for yourself what Sirrus and Achenar did to Narayan. Each world has a different look from the last but still retains that spooky feeling no matter if your in a swamp, caverns, beach or mountaintop.But still, the most impressive thing about Myst III is Jack Wall's brilliant score, which is simultaneously haunting, beautiful, dark and Gothic. He seamlessly blends magical with choral and gives us a highly thematic score with surpasses that of most big-budget movies. Definitely the best score a video-game has ever known. And that's a pretty big statement.I got the Limited Collector's Edition of this game which comes with the score CD (now very hard to find and very expensive) a 'making of' CD, the Prima Official Strategy Guide and lots of other inserts. The game (at the time of this certain publishing) was spread over 4 discs and it became very annoying switching between them all. I minor quibble though.Overall, I highly recommend Myst III, it's not just a game, it's a journey.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2005"}

Shaolin Monks is probably the first good one, but still isn't perfect and has many flaws. You play as either Kung-Lao or Liu-Kang and the game is set in the Mortal Kombat II universe. The two champions run around different worlds such as the Living Forest, The Wastelands, The Wu-Shi Academy, and even the Soul Tombs. They are trying to stop Shao-Kahn, but the story is pretty stretched out and not very good even for MK fans. You come across fan favorites such as Baraka, Mileena, Kitana, and even Scorpion.The game is an action-adventure and has a pretty solid fighting system. There are light attacks, heavy attacks, power attacks, and special attacks. Each character has their signature power attacks such as Kang's flying side kick, bicycle kick, and fireballs. Lao has his hat toss and many others. The combat system is responsive and quick and is pretty fun to use. You can accomplish some big combos in the or on the ground. There is the option to unlock new moves via points that you get from killing enemies, and yes don't worry, fatalities are present. These are performed by performing combos and building your fatality meter. One full orb lets you do a fatality, two lets you perform a mutality, and three lets you perform a brutality. Fatalities can be unlocked by finding hidden red coins (trust me they are a pain to find without the strategy guide). New fatalities are obtained by finding those red coins and unlocking \"Fatality Images\" which are viewed in the concept art area. This can be a bit of a pain and loading and saving is slow and tedious.The game has combat puzzles that involve using your abilities. This involves knocking enemies is viscous death traps, or Test Your Might strength puzzles (MK fans will love this). Each level has different death traps such as in The Living Forest you must feed the trees bodies before passing, and in The Soul Tombs, knocking enemies into spiked ceilings, or iron maidens. The game is brutal like MK is known for and that will satisfy fans. Even the fatalities are awesome, but unlocking the best takes a lot of hunting for those red coins.Getting through the game has kind of a Metroid feel since you must find certain abilities to reach different parts of the game like double jump, pole swinging, wall run, and fists of ruin. This, unfortunately, makes back tracking tiresome. What makes that worse is some coins aren't reachable until you get said ability and this could be really far into the game and you might forget to go back. This is just one of many flaws the game has. The combat system may be solid, but it's a bit shallow and could have used some more depth. Most of the flaws revolve around the graphics. They aren't that great. Even when the game came about in 2005 they weren't showing the PS2's true potential and this is sad. The game is full of low res textures and models, and it looks worse than the franchises' staple fighting games. There are collision detection issues, and complete hang ups that require system restarts. Save points are scarce, and you don't even have to kill enemies to progress. What's up with that? There are only a few times where you must kill enemies to progress, but most of the time you can just pass them, and what I truly hate is the fact that they can respawn.The sounds in the game are ok but they could have been better. All the MKII sounds are used, so nostalgia sets in, but I would have liked some richer sounds. The voice acting is also terrible, but MK is known for that. The game doesn't look high budget even though Midway (RIP) gives the MK team endless amounts of money to make these. This disappointed me more than anything along with the super short length. 4-6 is the completion time, and some hardcore players could finish this in one or two sittings. What makes up for some of the short comings is the Ko-op mode, however, but this also makes those damn red coins more of a pain to obtain since some can only be obtained via Ko-op.The game has fun boss fights, lots of secrets, tons of MKII references, and using that universe will make fans happy. If you can see past the short comings underneath is a solid MK side game that I hope sees a sequel with a bigger budget. You can find this game for less than $10 in most places so it's bargain bin price point is just more of a reason for people to play this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

But neither has happen, and it's fifth entry is the best yet.On Tony Hawk 1, we were introduced to a brand new world. While skateboarding games before had either been ridicously over the top or bland, Tony Hawk offered the perfect balance of fun, imagination and reality into one game. Tony Hawk 2 didn't offer much more except for new level and the ability to manual. However, Tony Hawk 3, the first for the next generation consoles, greatly increased the fun factor with the ability to revert, improved graphics, super fun levels and the best music as of that time. Tony Hawk 4 came out not too long afterwards and gave us the ability to stich onto cars, but the biggest change was the whole new way to play story. Instead of having 3 minutes or whatever to get 9 goals done, you have unlimited time to skate around and talk to people and get goals to do. Now, in THUG, you still have that ability, and everything you had in every other THPS game before this. You can revert, manual, stich, etc. And now you can get off your board. When you first start playing the game and get off the board, you'll probably think what I did: &quot;big deal&quot;. But after a while, it becomes great fun to roll up a vert, go into the air and jump off you board, catching onto a ledge on the way down. You also find it is tons of fun to climb up buildings without the board.Also, as a new addition, you have to play as yourself, not as your favorite skater. I know, you might be thinking &quot;bummer&quot;, but this offers great opprutunities for you, like the chance to join whatever team you want and eventually get to create your own team with whatever pros you want.The levels are the only downfall to this game. Not all of them, just some. Vancouver, for example, has absolutely nothing special to it. Just a place to skate. Very bland and boring. However, this also features awesome levels like Hawaii (that building is so fun to jump off of, especially into the pool...at least until you have to drain it) and Hotter Than Hell...which is a Kiss concert. At first, I was highly disappointed to find that at the Kiss concert location, the only thing on the stage was their drummer's kit, but after you collect K-I-S-S (each letter is very closely located), the whole band comes out and puts on a little show for you. When they're done, just collect it again, and they come on back out. Great fun.This is the best THPS game yet, as I have already said. Great multiplayer, as always. If you didn't get this for Christmas, get the money you got from your relatives, AND GET IT!P.S.:I'm always interested to see who's on the soundtrack, so here's an extremely tiny list of who's on it, as about 50 bands are, and what track they perform:*In Flames-Embody the Invisible*Mammoth-Crusher Destroyer*KISS-Rock N Roll All Night (Live)*Alkaline Trio-Armageddon*Rise Aganist-Like the Angels*Transplants-Hollywood Babylon*Assorted Jellybeans-Rebel Yell*The Clash-White Riot...and there's a s*it load more...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2003"}

It's fantastic a perfect score, but the first one had more drama it seemed and feeling.  I specifically remember going WOW and dropping my jaw many times in the first one and not so much in this one.  In 2 I loved the new characters development and the new baddies, big dudes.  I thought the first one was harder, especially since the controls aren't as good as they are now.  I enjoyed the multiplayer, but it doesn't have HUD so you are at a dissadvantage but enjoyable none the less.Two small negatives:  1. Much brighter, too bright in my opinion, takes away the beauty and feeling, the drama, IMO.  2.  This one is a bigger stumble they didn't do automatic far shots very much to enjoy the full beauty, you have to do it manually which is good that you can but the auto far shots you really get the best scope and appreciation for the game and auto gives u the biggest in range.I finished the game in 1 1/2 days.  I was getting beat up on multiplayer cuz players are all high rated playing 24/7 cuz they have no jobs with the best gear you are at a distict dissadvantage early so use the square and fisticuff the better players to piss them off, the same button for steath choke, and to pull of buildings from a climbing position all the same button square.The first one because the cover system was flawed it wasn't really cover I give it a 9.5, the second one because it stuffed in multiplayer has gotta get a 10, eventhough I really liked the first one better cuz it was original new and u didn't know the characters so you just weren't sure who to trust and what was gonna happen.I'll say the final scene, not a spoiler, it's a legitimate kill, rather than the first one that was a button combo lame final boss kill on the ship remember that i hated that ending.I'm selling mine as great as it is for $50 i got it for [...] release date delivery free shipping and $5 future game credit so I paid $[...] and am selling it for $50, cuz i'm not really that good at these games I just want to get thru the game and see it all, and the no hud bugs me on multiplayer, plus mw2 is coming out and my 2 bball games will keep me busy until then.  Total cost $1.99 lol, but I had to give it up in a week. Later.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Tristan A. Hayes","summary":"One of the best on the PS3","reviewText":"I promise to make this 100% Spoiler free, but I must say that after experiencing that which is Uncharted 2, this game is pretty solid indeed.  If you enjoyed the first Uncharted then this one will be an extremely enjoyable experience.  This game lasts more than 2-4 hours longer than the previous one, tops the cake for having some of the best cinematics, graphics, and sound experience offered on the PS3.One of the features that I was a bit weary about was the multiplayer because I do not really consider myself a multiplayer fan,however, I must say that that which is in Uncharted 2 is enough to last those who just like multiplayer games a long time. There doesnt seem to be anyway to do offline multiplayer however, for an experience online (with up to 3 player co-op), and about 10 people in the deathmatch modes, there is little to crave.  It seems that they developed an amazing Single player experience and added a great multiplayer experience.Ultimately, with a heartpounding action packed story, a landmark presentation value, and exciting multiplayer and single player modes, I can not really find anything to criticize the game for. (well perhaps the most criticism would be the amount of logo's on the back of the boxart, or even the at times difficulty of AI).One more thing, the game has trophy support, headset support, (upcoming twitter support), a multiplayer shop system (to buy skins, and boosts), future DLC, and unlockables.Please add this game to your PS3 library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2009"}

NEEDS TO BE RE-RELEASED!!","reviewText":"If there are video games taht have truly stood up to the tests of time, it's the Sonic The Hedgehog video game series.Back in the days when video games for the most part were just plain clean fun and not the gorefests they are now, Sonic The Hedgehog was and still is the defining video game series of my lifetime.The controls are very good.While many would argue that the graphics are dated and while they may be very dated by 2004 standards, this game was many years ahead of it's time and I still love every moment of this game.One of the greatest things about this classic video game that I have enjoyed was the MUSIC! WOW! Looking back on it now, I have to say that the music was just amazing for video game music. I could very well say that I remember the music almost by heart. My favorite level music was on the &quot;Scrap Brain Zone&quot; levels 1 through 3 and let me tell you, I haven't loved video game music like I did on this level.Overall, the video game music was incredible! If only my Sega Genesis system were still working, I would still be playing this but since age finally took it's toll on both the cartrige and the system, I feel sad at seeing a great era in my life in video games come to a close. I still find myself humming to the music on the &quot;Scrap Brain Zone&quot; level even to this day, years after last playing this game.Sonic The Hedgehog is in my opinion the greatest video game series of all time. Mario and Crash Bandicoot may offer competition in this field but Sonic The Hedgehog came first for me.I find it to be one of the greatest entertainment tragedies seeing one of my childhood favorite activies, video games, decline from good clean fun and degerate into nightmare-inducing blood baths of gore, and violence.Whatever the case between Mario, Sonic, and Crash Bandicoot, let me just say that it is the sillier games like these three game series that have truly lasted as opposed to the countless gorefests that video games that are forced down our throats.I say, they should re-released the Sonic games that were on Sega Genesis onto an archives video game set for the computer or for the newest video game systems in the near future because I'm suffereing from &quot;Sonic withdrawal&quot; symptoms.If this game is put back in print, I will be first in line to regain this game so that my children can enjoy the fun I had iwth Sonic The Hedgehog.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2004"}

If you're familiar with Bethesda's other RPGs, you will have a fair idea of what to expect.  It is an open world \"sandbox\" RPG with elements of a FPS.  When it was released a year ago, Fallout fans somewhat derisively called it \"Oblivion with guns\".  Truth be told, on the surface, it is a very fair assessment of this game, but that's not a bad thing at all!  It's definitely a similar kind of game, but the setting and humor are quite unique.  At no time does it feel like any other game you've played before, other than the fact that it's got Bethesda's signature style all over it.  There is so much to do in this game that you can easily get as much or more playtime as a normal game without even touching the main storyline quests.  When you take into account the 5 add-on packs that come with this GOTY edition, the \"bang to buck\" ratio is increased quite a bit in favor of the bang.  The add-on packs alone retail for the price of this package.  If you already have Fallout 3 without the add-ons, you may as well get this edition and sell your original.  If you don't already have Fallout 3, then there is absolutely no reason to pass on this edition of the game.  It was named Game of the Year for a very good reason.

This network not only connects friends for epic head-to head pursuits and races, but also enables players to compare performances and stats, thereby setting the stage for the ultimate in friendly competition.","reviewerName":"Bbt","summary":"Frustrating and Disappointing","reviewText":"Need for Speed Hot Pursuit does so many things exceptionally well but fails to do other things even in an acceptable way. The graphics are beautiful; Cars look amazing and the weather effects make you feel like you are there riding on a rainy mountain or through a thunderous desert at night. Driving mechanics are also fun. Learning when to time your drifts and when to use your turbo is compelling. Also you'll find a terrific soundtrack accompanied by just as impressing sound effects from vehicles.So where does this game go wrong? Let's start with the wheel. No wheel support in a racing game is absurd. This point need not be argued. What next? Rock Band without guitar peripheral support?Next complaint is about the traffic. Usually there isn't much traffic in the game but the traffic is placed in the worst spots. On a two lane road, two vehicles will cross beside each other exactly when you need to pass. Nearly every turn a car appears right in your drift/ turning radius. This happens in lots of arcade racers. Midnight Club is notorious for this and it ruins the experience in that game and this one too.Another problem with traffic is the speed of the game and the resulting pop up effect. So many races I'm going over 220mph and suddenly am slamming into a car I never saw. Hills create this problem most frequently as you can't see what's beneath you on a hill. This problem also plagues shortcuts. For whatever reason the developers placed a gigantic rock in the center a lot of shortcuts. This rock usually is visible only right before your smashing into it at 200+mph.Autolog is a neat feature that interfaces the game in a competitive way amongst you and your friends. Only problem is the autolog is seemingly pointless. In the career mode most of the events are so challenging that you'll rarely have friends that do better than those times, so you may as well just chase those goals instead. Also I haven't found any leaderboards, so it seems they traded in a global system for people to compete with others for a smaller local system. It's an interesting feature that I was impressed with but why step backwards when your stepping forwards? They should have also instituted global leaderboards.There is also online multiplayer, probably the best part of the game. Rarely do you find a game where playing online is easier than the career mode, but in this case I play online to take a break from the frustration of going for various gold medals and distinctions. I typically only play Hot Pursuit online as it is most enjoyable and is the only portion of this game that a casual gamer would appreciate.Overall the game is overly frustrating as the experience is too plagued by problems aforementioned to be enjoyed or considered worth the asking price.No wheel support, no free roam, no split screen, etc...","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2010"}

The home version was a pretty good translation of the Arcade smash and the game didn't get old as quickly as other fighting games.This game took the bar up to 10. After KI, almost every other fighting game came up with some sort of combo system. Some not as impressive as KI but still, the combo system was adopted and to this day, very used by most games because let's face it, the combos add another dimension to the game. Instead of a whalloping one-hit move that hurt like hell, you could unleash vicious combos that, if done properly could wipe your opponent across the screen.I think one of the only problems with KI on the home system was the same problem with the Arcade version. It was to complicated for a lot of gamers. A lot of people could not get the combo system down and I will admit certain characters had some difficult ones. You really had to know the combo system to win at KI.But once you got decent (you didn't have to be stand up good all the time, trust me I got lazy in a lot of matches), it was one of the most fun games you had played. I believe this was on of the first games that you could play on the short lived SNES modem hook up. With the modem hook up, you could play with your friends on the other side of the country. But now we have the internet so it's not that big of a deal.KI is a keeper. I'd get it while you can.

No notice that it will eat hard drive space like candy?  No fixes for the notoriously frustratingly buggy Revelations?  3 strikes it's out.Ezio pack is for people that:* have played or don't care to play AC I& Have 18 GB of HDD free& willing to pay extra for DLC included in individual product& new to AC III and want the backstoryI'm aware game specific patches are something you're going to have to research with Ubisoft.com, before purchase and probably would never be part of the product description.  That said, status of said research, still leads me to believe we'll never see that patch.This isn't worth it.  I'd recommend getting AC I, AC:II with DLC and Brotherhood and catching up on Revelations Events through other means.  I played AC II, before AC I and I don't recommend that.  One will definitely miss features of AC II and more of I will feel limited and repetitive.  Otherwise, you could probably just catch up on AC I, same as AC Revelations.If you do play Revelations (which for me is a painful and loathsome $60 experience, I'm going to trade in):* research open bugs so you don't have to start over to get trophy, etc.,* back up your saves* neglect sending your assassins on training missions- (if you want to risk it, then only send when 100% going to succeed).* this game bugged isn't worth the damage it can cause your PS3, even if given to you for FREE!It is sad, because if AC Revelations had better quality assurance and was more finished, then I probably would have preferred it to BrotherHood(not story wise, though).  Story wise, this is the worst of the three.  Seriously,AC II is technically my favorite of the series, so far.  I prefer Europe setting and story to US and ACIII. I wish I'd waited for the III GotY edition and a 25% season pass is not good enough.  AC II > AC III > AC Brotherhood > AC I > AC Revelations, in terms of my enjoyment, so far.I care more about AC as a single player experience, so the multiplayer does not merit purchase for that alone.  If that's really your interest, don't waste time with backstory and facing off with declining expert stories, just jump into AC III, where you'll have more features and players.I get it, I'm someone who preordered this series, so these kinds of packs aren't for me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2012"}

I've owned a Game Boy Advance (GBA) for a few years, but I haven't played a single game on it at all. It was a gift from an insurance policy I bought quite some time back, and I wasn't really into hand-held consoles then. In fact, I'm still not into them, or I'd have grabbed the PSP or the DS when I was in Tokyo just a few days ago. Yet, I'm now buying a game for a hand-held console, and playing it with much vigor despite the headaches it gives me. Such is the magic of The Legend of Zelda.The Legend of Zelda was the first NES game that I completed when I was a youth (I'm still pretty young, by the way). I still remember urging my mum to buy me the cool-looking game in the gold packaging, without even knowing what it was all about. The rest, as they always said, was history. I beat the game in a week, beat the second quest a few weeks later, and started to write my own walkthroughs for friends of mine who haven't completed the battle. Life was good.18 years down the road, I bought Nintendo's re-release of The Legend of Zelda from its Classic NES Series for the GBA. I've forgotten how to play the game, and I was having a hard time just to get a silver boomerang. Life is not very good now.Still, I'm thoroughly enjoying the game, which has a rather simple concept. Basically, you take on the role of Link, who has to rescue Princess Zelda from the claws of Ganon. With an array of weapons and items, you must maneuver through various sections on the land of Hyrule to gather eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, and then finish off Ganon to resume peace.In terms of gameplay, The Legend of Zelda can never be compared with more sophisticated games from the modern era. However, considering the game's age, the fact that it allows a large variety of combat and puzzle-solving challenges is already commendable. You start off with a wooden sword and shield, but gradually pick up more items like a boomerang and bombs. In underground dungeons, you'll also gather compasses and maps that point you to the location of the fragments of the Triforce. Some of the bosses can only be defeated with specific weapons, so getting a healthy inventory is a must. What's more, you also get life upgrades once you complete a level, which is always welcomed as the going does get tougher as it proceeds. On the whole, The Legend of Zelda has some RPG elements, but a lack of a true leveling up system means that it's still very much an action/ adventure game.The graphics in The Legend of Zelda did well enough to duplicate the original pretty well. Obviously, it looks rather out-dated, but you can't expect a 1987 game to have the quality of games from recent years, can you? What concerned me is that the screen on the GBA is looks little squeezed. It doesn't interfere with play, but it does affect my eyesight a little.The audios in this game are also a replica of the original. They hold up well generally, and the sound of Link's sword flying through the air still gives me the goosebumps. The music is also vintage Zelda, and you know I love it when I've it as my mobile phone's ringtone.Now, the downside. Considering that the game is more than six months' old, I'm a little baffled that it still cost me close to $20 for it. Obviously living in Singapore counts (you know, shipping and all), but over 30 bucks after shipping for an off-the-shelf GBA game really borders on the insanity.Nevertheless, I'm not one who bothers too much about paying for what I really want. What's important is that I love this game, and you won't be surprised I'm tilting it very much higher than most other people may do. And why not, when I can relive a legend?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2005"}

I tend to get bored of them quickly. Starhawk would serve as an exception to that rule though. It really provides layers of depth not found in generic military shooters. Incorporating elements of RTS, tower defense, and mmo shooter action. This melding of genre's results in a wonderful hybrid, that provides a totally unique experience. Most importantly, the game is just fun as hell. You can fly Hawks, and ride Sidewinders, Tanks, Razorbacks, and just tear up the battlefield. The building mechanics are great, and reward tactical thinkers especially. There are many different modes, and the online community is dedicated and strong. There are also local split screen co-op options too. The single player campaign is serviceable, but the online multiplayer is where this game shines.

The story is so deep and interesting, that it will move you at times, and your anti-hero Kratos is just absolutely fantastically crafted in every detail of graphics, and personality and history behind him.Now, this collection's MSRP is $40. I paid that much, and well, its quite worth it actually! You get 5, full games, as well as the director's commentary videos that come with the 2 PSP ports, Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta. On one disc, you get GOW 1 and 2, which are PS2 ports, and on a second disc, you get GOW 3. The ports are fabulous, especially the PSP ports, and everything works great. My only gripe, is that they didn't advertise the PSP ports as DOWNLOADS, and that they didn't include a voucher for the PSP/PSVita versions. But, no biggy there, atleast for me. The cool thing that I just found out though, is that they added remote play capabilities for GOW 1 and 2, for PSVita only. But still, that's a nice addition...So, in conclusion, if you're dying to brush up on your God of War for the up coming Ascension, then this is the way to go, even if you already have GOW 3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2013"}

I have played Dead Space game before this and it is really amazing how you flexible the combat system is, and this is why I dont consider RS5 a game to recommend for real gamers only for fans of Resident Evil franchise.The Merceneray game is really fun, I only faced some bugs like bullets pass through the bodies of the attackers when they are holding back because of a hit, or being hurted in the face or limbs.

Although I always had interest in the games I never played them, but when Absolution came out I took my chance to Gamefly it. The things I noticed immediately about the game were the graphics. The cut scenes are almost next gen quality, and the gameplay graphics are some of the best of this era. This seems to be the case with other modern Square Enix games like the Tomb Raider reboot. The story spits out instantly, which can take a minute or two to catch up on if you aren't already familiar with the franchise like myself. While the story isn't anything particularly unique or special does it really need to be? You play as an assassin killing targets, pretty straight forward right? The functionality and tactics of the game are a big part of what makes it so fun. If you enjoy playing stealth you can essentially sneak your way around the entire game (this is the way the game was really intended to be played). But if you would rather run around the levels guns blazing, good luck, as the enemies pile up it can get increasingly difficult. Having many different options for how you kill enemies is a great aspect to this game and keeps it from getting too monotonous. One of the games biggest flaws is that it is simply not long enough. As good as the game is and as sound as it's story there is just not enough of it. The only other critique I have for the game is that each level could be a bit bigger. So many games have shifted to the open world interface that it makes games like this feel a little smaller.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2013"}
