{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Kyle Slayzar","summary":"To Finally Serve and Protect Those Within the GTA Universe","reviewText":"Rockstar Games isn't exactly known for its law-abiding franchises whether its Red Dead, Bully, or its flagship series Grand Theft Auto.  They've pushed the envelope many times and generated controversy worldwide with game glorifying killing law enforcement officers, hilarious in-game radio programs, and \"hot coffee\" mods.  It's no wonder that the Rockstar logo is often times associated with edgy titles that border on gratuitous sex and violence... until Saints Row 2 came along.With this in mind, when I heard Rockstar was distributing a game that focuses on the law enforcement aspect, albeit in 1940s idyllic Los Angeles, USA, I was extremely cynical.  After seeing the initial trailers and previews from the usual sources, it seemed as though Rockstar was trying a radical, if not reconciliation, re-approach to their games by taking the side of the grossly picked on officers of the law for years of abuse.  To be frank, I think gamers have killed more cops than they have Nazis in all Medal of Honor and Call of Duty games combined.However, after reading up more on the upcoming title LA Noire, I decided to break my six-month streak of not buying a new game for full price and give the game a show.  After two days in, I've been generally pleased with the game.The concept is very simple; you're a idealistic former-Marine (I know, there's no such thing, whatever) that has gone into the LAPD to \"stop the bad guys.\"  You get called into several crime scenes to solve mysteries by examining evidence, interviewing witnesses, and ultimately taking down the bad guys.  As you progress, you go from beat cop to traffic, homicide, and ultimately vice where the cases go from black and white to more complex, to downright strange.It's a good idea since few games these days actually allow law enforcement their due beyond a few very obscure titles (CSI franchise) and most of them involve the paranormal or the incredibly over-used plot device of... *shudders* an ancient evil cult (I'm looking at you Condemned 2!!).  It's time for the shield of lawmen to shine!  It was refreshing to take down the bad guys again as the long arm of the law and not an emo Eastern European or a narcissistic sociopath hellbent on the domination of Stillwater (at least until November!).The gameplay is copy/paste of the Grand Theft Auto 4 (GTA) interface.  You hold down left-trigger and you initiate brawl, you press \"Y\" button and you stea-... er... \"commandeer\" a vehicle.  Didn't take long for me to figure out the basic controls and begin raising hell across LA by running over pedestrians and getting frequent reminders that LAPD cops are sword to protect the innocent... no matter how much it is to do otherwise.  After I got my kicks in, I began the real missions.Problem was that every time I decided to head to an actual destination I discovered that the map was flippin' huge and it took forever to get to your destination.  After playing over six hours I checked my statistics page to see much of my game time was devoted to driving and I was shocked to realize that I spent well over 1/5th of the time driving to my destination.  It's ridiculous and the only way around it is to have your partner drive and instantly teleport to your destination.  It's not nearly as much fun having your partner do all the work as it cuts down time considerably and then you don't hear central dispatch calling in your help every three blocks to respond to EVERY crime possible.I would be halfway to my destination, and then dispatch would call in and beg me to respond to a call half a city map away... in the other direction!  While these events can wait, you still have to go all the way down to them if you want to improve your score and your partner only drives most of the way to them and dispatch will keep complaining until you respond.  I guess those union strikes REALLY were THAT bad since there are virtually no cops to respond or offer backup.The investigation and interview sequences are, by far, the best parts.  Whenever you're in a crime scene or an area of interest the music will begin playing to indicate that there are clues to find and then stops when all clues are found and jotted down in your trusty notepad.  After searching for all the clues you are encouraged to interview suspects, witnesses, and and detainees.  You listen to their statement and either agree, cast doubt on their statements, or accuse them of lying.  If you do the latter, you have to produce evidence to back up your accusation or else the interviewee will call your bluff.  It's more interesting than it sounds, especially with the cheesy dialog reminiscent of LA Confidential or any cheesy crime novel.The setting is very historically authentic.  As an instructor of history at the college level (I know, a gamer and a professor, shocking) I found myself admiring the atmosphere more than anything else to determine authenticity.  The architecture, city layout, billboards, music, and fashion is genuinely post-war.  Even the attitudes of people and the narration talking about families starting up and the affordability of housing is accurate.  Whenever I was in a vehicle, I heard classic big band and jazz music that made me think I was back in Fallout 3.  The pop culture references (Tarzan, Chrysler, Chevrolet, Buick, etc.) in game are authentic as well, no doubt on loan from their respected trademark owners.  It's a break from usual Rockstar games that make up their own to avoid trademark infringement.The graphics are a source of mixed feelings from me.  The facial scanning technology is as impressive as Rockstar claimed it was as the movements and interpretations of dialog are spot on.  Problem is that everything is just about as on par as the next game if not less so.  There was so much aliasing with the faces that it almost appeared as though the hyper realistic faces were cut/pasted on their respected characters.  Normally, I would speculate that this is an XBox360 issue but it's shown in the trailers as well.  It's distracting, but not too much as I'm usually trying to stay in touch with the story rather than admire the graphics.My other complaint is how LA Noire is GTA-esque but less so in terms of complexity.  For one, there are no funny radio stations.  I know, it's authentic 1947 LA but I wanna be amused too.  Come to think of it, I don't think you can change the radio station at all.  Not kewl!  Also, there are no other stops or things to gawk at other than historical landmarks (woo hoo...) and hidden car locations.  Big whoop.  I wanna be able to visit more and get some more side questing in aside from the generic short vignettes of crimes that take more time to get to them then accomplish them.My biggest complaint revolves around the \"wtf mate\" realm where I see something and I must cry shenanigans.  It is established in the first episode that the main character has the physical prowess of Altair from Assassin's Creed as he climbs up buildings, runs vast distances, and jumps great gaps in a single-bound.  HOWEVER, when I had to chase down an overweight manager that was trying to fraud his own wife, he not only gave a good chase but actually gained distance when running on straightaways.  I think male cows produce an excrement that accurately depicts what I think of that.  Even my friend watching me play had to start declaring shenanigans.  I got tired of trying to run them down and just kept shooting them, they deserve it.So, LA Noire isn't without its flaws.  It's investigative gameplay is reminiscent of other great detective games like Still Life and the dialog system akin to Alpha Protocol (the only good part about that game), and it's fun to finally play as the good guys.  However, LA Noire still needs to distinguish itself from other games like it and other games made by its parent distributor.  I'll keep playing it till I get all the achievements, but I still find other games like it more addicting.A worthy game of considering for most audiences... except for children.  It is VERY graphic as the first homicide case on the \"lover's lane\" proves.All in all, a B+.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2011"}

What were they thinking","reviewText":"Maybe all the good ideas have already been done, I don't know.  Or maybe it simply easier to copy ideas that came before, but Rage is so unbelievably derivative and boring, it's embarrasing.Like many others here, I'm a veteran gamer, and will try almost anything.  Most \"professional\" reviews are garbage, and are paid for by the developer or the studio, so they are never to be believed.  I usually make my own decisions on these things, and Rage is no different.  I was more interested in the actual customer reviews, than the paid for \"professional\" reviews, and as they were overwhelmigly negative as well as consistent as far as criticism, I figured I'd wait until the price was dirt cheap to buy it, which I did this past holiday season.After playing through a good portion of Rage, I am appalled.  This game is simply not even worth the space it takes up on my computer.  It is simply awful, boring, derivative, and has zero personality.  I am truly stunned at how bad this gigantic piece of software is.  An EPIC disaster in gaming development.  All this is even more amplified by the unbelievable HYPE and PR, as well as the uber expensive pricing when it was released.  Just a disaster...1) There is ZERO story.  It is Borderlands, yet much much worse, and far more pretentious.  The graphics and artwork are pretty sophisticated, but they are hollow and meaningless because you simply don't care about any of what you're seeing.  The dialogue and characters are painfully slow and tedious.  There's no personality.  Its dreadful2)  The gameplay is weak and boring. As far as shooters go, it is not even worth playing it to shoot things.  The console themed shooting and damage are just as tedious, and I personally never connected with the action.  The weapons are not interesting, very conventional, and the action is well.... not really that exciting.3) Driving... oh good grief, the driving.  It appears that the driving was put in in order to extend the amount of time you spend in the game.  There is NO reason to drive anywhere, other than the fact that there is really little else to do of value.  Its a collosal time wasting part of the game, boring as anything, and the vehicles are wholly uninteresting and derivative.  Dumb, just dumb.4) Linearity...  not much else to say, but you are on rails.  There is zero movement outside of the predetermined tracks the game is played on.  You drive past these ambitiously designed and drawn structures and scenes, but they are stage props.  There's nothing there.  You can't go anywhere, except the occasional sewer, which is also hyper linear.  No surprises here.5) The Stuff you pick up has no rhyme or reason.  Its wierd stuff, and some of it has value, while some of it doesn't.  If you like shooters with stuff (Borderlands, Fallout, Stalker, etc) you'll want to scoop out your eyes after a few hours playing Rage.Conclusion:  If I paid more than the few dollars I actually paid for this mess of pretentious poppycock, it would have haunted me for the rest of my life.  This game is one the most severe examples of OVERHYPED/UNDERDELIVERED products in human history.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2012"}

The game was remade using the Resident Evil 4 engine, which is honestly this game's saving grace but also its Achilles heel.  Most of this review compares the 360 version to the Wii version.CORE GAMEPLAY: The essence of the game is you are trapped in a mall filled with zombies and you must survive.  You can pick up a large variety of objects to beat them down, chop them up, and blast them away.  The core gameplay is pretty basic (kill lots of zombies with stuff you find lying around), but quite entertaining and doesn't deviate far from the XBox 360 version at all.  The sandbox aspects of the game have been streamlined and the game is much more linear now, for good or for bad.  The Wii version has fewer items to interact with as well, which is disappointing but to be expected.GRAPHICS: If I didn't know better, I'd think I need my eyes checked.  I haven't played a game this blurry since the Nintendo 64.  Character models are very low-res, generally ugly, and there is a lot of pop-in at relatively close distances (40 or 50 feet).  So far, I've seen maybe 80 zombies on screen at a time, which isn't bad for a Wii game, but compared to the 360's hundreds on screen at a time, a bit disappointing.  Even compared to other sandbox games on the Wii (Scarface and The Godfather for example), the graphics are underwhelming.ENEMIES: While I was generally unimpressed with the Xbox 360's zombie and ally intelligence, the Wii version has managed to surpass the stupidity of the 360 verion's zombies in ways I couldn't imagine.  The enemy AI is downright stupid and unaware at most times.  Reduced enemy numbers are disappointing as well.STORYLINE: This is a tie between the Xbox and Wii, because both versions of the game have a terrible storyline.  It's painful, but entertaining and humorous at times.CONTROLS: In some ways, the 360 version is better, but overall I prefer the controls on the Wii.  If you've played Resident Evil 4, the controls are pretty much identical with minor changes.  In particular, aiming firearms with the Wii controls is infinitely easier than the shooting controls in the 360 version.  The Wii version capitalizes on this by emphasizing more gunplay than the 360 version, which suits me just fine.LEVEL DESIGN: Using the Resident Evil 4 engine has limited the player's movement and the game suffers from Invisible Wall Syndrome.  Inexplicably, the character can not jump over some barriers but can over others.  The 360 version is vastly superior in terms of level design.THINGS TO DO:  The 360 version has much more interactivity with the world.  Many sacrifices were made on the Wii and there are fewer things to pick up and many items have fewer functions.  This is offset by the improved firearms system though.  One seriously questionable decision was to remove the photography element from the game, which makes no sense because the Wii's pointer controls would be perfect for that... not to mention the fact that the main character is a PHOTO JOURNALIST!OTHER IMPROVEMENTS:  Multiple save files and Check-points.  After a while I grew bored with having to re-play the beginning of the Xbox 360 version after dying over and over, especially if I forgot to save or couldn't make it to a save point.I really think this game could have been better.  While I enjoyed the 360 version of the game, the woefully bad gun controls hurt my enjoyment of the game so I tend to favor the Wii version slightly.  If you have a 360, it's a tough call which to get since both games are quite fun but severely flawed.  The 360 version is cheaper, at the moment, which is a definite advantage.  If you only own the Wii, I recommend this game but with the warning that it is very ugly.  Possibly the ugliest Wii game that I've owned.[Edit: Fixed some grammar and removed an inaccurate reference.]","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2009"}

Ex: The Hulk.b) Scrapper: Deal mass damage with a good degree of resistance to bblows. Ex. Wolverine.c) Defender: heal your companions and use your powers to control and impair high numbers of enemies. Ex. Hmm... difficult... Mrs. Richards (?).d) Blaster: deal high amount of ranged damage (fire, energy blasts etc). Ex. Cyclopse) Controller: control your enemies minds, paralyze them, have them battle each other. Probably the most powerful character. Ex: Xavier.3) Graphics: simply stated...awesome.4) Gameplay. Very good, but it could be better. Here are pros and cons.a) PROS:-There are a zillion of quests. Everytime you quest, you can do it solo or with your group. When you go in quest zones, other players out of your team can't come busting in ruining the party.-It's intrinsically cool for comic fans to play super heroes in a perfectly rendered comic book city.-People walk the city, taling to each other, talking to you... each has a name, and there are literlly thousands of civilians. Cars move around. Everything is VERY realistic.-Power effects are awesome, malking you want more.b)CONS:-Gameplay can become repetive after a while.-Game seems to be missing some basic commands (like DAOCs &quot;stick&quot;)-No objects in the game. This can kill the interest of many players.-No in game economics.-No PVP. The expansion City of Villains should address that.Bottom line.Buy this game if:1) You are a comic book fan.2) You really love MMORPGs and have a lot of time on hand.3) You like more character building than equipment hoarding.4) If all your buddies play it (with friends you will have a BLAST).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00EN1IF7C","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Great, but Only To A Point","reviewText":"When I first started playing Forza Motorsport 5, it was a magical time typical of most modern racers:  new challenges, great graphics, fun cars, and the Top Gear hosts' voiceover work (and tracks) made the game a joy to experience.  As racing games go, it's still got great graphics and fun things to do, many of which I outline here...but then some bad decisions in the game's design started to catch up to me.  For instance, menus really require me to be patient enough to move in and out of places to get what I need, like when I'm playing a series of races and can't quit until I finish loading the next race and listen to the voiceover.But the big thing that's started to spoil the fun has been the way I run into dead-ends that want me to pay my way out of them.  It's one thing to offer DLC for a price, but quite another to invite me to an event that I then find out I can only participate in if I buy the DLC that gives me the one car I need for the event...which I then need to purchase using my in-game money.  Gift me a nice car that I can't use, and I'm now likely to think this is preparatory to releasing a \"buy me\" track pack.  It's nice to be able to choose whether to spend game-money or tokens to buy things, but I'm starting to notice how tokens are the FM team's way of getting me to plunk down money to buy more tokens.  I'm also not happy with the fact that neither my Logitech Driving Force GT nor my G27 (nor any other wheel made prior to FM5's release) is supported:  you are expected to buy into the newer, more expensive generation of racing wheel hardware.For those of you new to this series, the Forza Motorsport games are a racing simulation that let you try and buy all sorts of cars, race them in many different types of competition, and as you earn money and experience, you get to then pour that into upgrades and modifications.  The graphics are just as beautiful as the commercials show you (and if you've been anywhere near a TV in the last month I'm sure you've seen them) and the variety of content and gameplay seems to suit every style.What makes Forza Motorsport 5 so spectacular is the level of control you can have over your game.  If you are deep into simulation, you can tweak every single detail about your car down to the tire pressure--and you'll feel the difference.  You can upgrade just about every part, and you can even do so simply if you'd rather:  choose a Racing Class and Forza can automatically apply exactly the upgrades that are legal for that class.  Switch upgrades back and forth:  once you buy one, it's yours to add or remove.  Playing wins you both money and Tokens, and you can choose which to spend when purchasing a car or an upgrade...however, tokens will also let you buy your way into higher levels of gameplay if you really don't want to slog through every classification tier.If you're more of an arcade-style racer, Forza will explain every step of the way as you build a career.  Make a mistake and you can rewind the gameplay, rolling it back and trying to avoid the accident this time around.  There are Driver Assists aplenty, and they can be tweaked.  For example, I don't like having Steering Assist or Braking Assist, but I do like having ABS.  Some people turn off Traction Control and drift more than I do.  You can decide if your tires, fuel, and damage should affect the race or if you'd rather be safe and just run the track without those worries.  When I turned it on, I would get detailed messages about which part(s) were damaged in a collision or when I ran off-road, and the suspension and steering would start misbehaving.That's not all though:  Forza Motorsport 5 has an online aspect that's also as much or as little as you want.  As you drive, the game learns your habits and driving patterns.  It generates a \"Drivatar\" that's a virtualized version of yourself.  When you're offline, your Drivatar will go out and run races for you, earning a bit of money here and there and keeping its own leaderboard scores against other drivatars.  When you race, the game isn't injecting AI-driven drivers:  it's generating your opponents from other drivers' Drivatars.  It appears to do a good job matching them to your level, and as I got better some of my opponents dropped out and new ones that were less squirrely on the curves started running against me.It's inevitable that you should be able to race against other opponents online...but there's also a way to compete up the leaderboards on the side, too.  As you play, you'll be offered a chance to challenge other racers' records:  play the track solo, racing to beat their time, and you'll see a ghost-car version of the player running the course with you.  It's loads of fun, and I found myself beating their record, then seeing how much better I could get with a few more laps.Each racing type has many tracks to choose from, including more than one variation of the Top Gear test track.  If you're a fan of the BBC series, the three hosts of that show narrate parts of the game all over the place.  It was fun listening to Richard Hammond talk about how Rally Cars boil down to STIs and EVOs...but both owe a debt to the Ford Escort RS.Still not enough?  Well, there's design.  Paint, decal, and stripe your car any way you want to.  Pick factory colors, make your own, save your designs and upload them for others to share.  I bought a 2005 Subaru WRX STI and for free I could pick a mirror-finish pattern someone made with Top Gear logos.Despite loving the gameplay, I have to admit that there are some drawbacks to Forza Motorsport 5.  First, any racing game is really best experienced with a wheel, and so the gamepad is only so good.  The XBox One Controller puts force-feedback into the triggers and it helps, but using a wheel makes a huge difference.  Next...if you have a wheel, it's not going to work.  Yes, this is my biggest complaint.  With XBox One, the developers made a conscious decision to only support the next generation of racing wheels.  What I'm seeing of what's to come is amazing technology and part of me can't blame them, but I still feel bitten that my Logitech G27 doesn't at least minimally work.  I would love to see an update that would grandfather this bit in.  I also don't care for the slow plod towards trying to get me to pay more to keep playing.  I've bought plenty of downloadable content in my day, but typically it's more to enhnace a game I'm playing instead of to unlock something I probably should have had available in the base game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

Luckily, this doesn't apply to Baldur's Gate 2 yet.  It still has comparable graphics and the story, voice acting and brilliant playing engine still make it better than any RPG on the market right now but that won't hold for long.  If you've never had a chance to play this classic RPG, grab it now before it's too late!  I've played RPG's since the days of the early Ultima games and Baldur's Gate 2 is probably the best one I've ever played.  Now, you do need to be familiar with Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  So if you don't know how the classic D&amp;D system works, you may not find Baldur's Gate 2 as appealing as I did.  It also uses the older D&amp;D ruleset which is good or bad depending on which one you prefer.  Ever since playing (and replaying) this title, in my mind it has set the bar for RPG's and I compare all RPG's since to Baldur's Gate 2. The expansion isn't as great as the game itself but you can't go wrong buying the collection edition which includes both.  Also, if you plan on playing the first Baldur's Gate, I'd recommend you play it first because it begins the story that concludes in this game.  But you don't need to play the first game to understand what is going on in the sequel because it feels like it's own story.  Baldur's Gate 2: The Collection is cheaper than current titles and a better play.

As far as playing it solo well on the harder difficulties its unplayable if you use the melee character.  Which is why I give it a 6/10.  This game has 2 characters and its a dungeon crawler with some mild RPG story to it.  One character is ranged one is melee.  The ranged character is allot of fun the shooting elements and spells work really well and dispatching enemies is a blast.  The male melee character just plain inst as fun I found myself dying more and going through more health potions when using him even with blocking he doesn't seem to have the right game play balance Ie one enemy can take him down in a couple of blows and when you are surrounded by 3+ enemies this inst good.  With 2 non computer players it will be better as the AI in this game sucks.  If playing solo as I did most of the game your partner will not be much help.  The game has 6 chapters each take about and hour to go through.  There are several arenas you can go in and fight in.  You can also design your own map arenas.  The banter between the two characters is fun and Lucy Lawless voices another character.  Its not a long game about 8 hours on first play through.  It worth taking a look at it.

Pairing the controller to the receiver was also easy, so don't expect any trouble. An almost effortless process really.If you wonder about the overall quality, expect the same as any other 360 controller. The only difference is the receiver, which must be plugged at all times when you are using the controller (even when using a charge & play kit).I've played games such as GTA IV, Bullet Storm, Batman (both), Mafia II and Dead Space. They all worked without issues.The controller can be used with the 360 console as well. Nothing more to say really, if you've used the 360 controller before, this is pretty much the same as the rest. A great purchase if you plan to play games such as the ones I've mentioned above.

{"product_name":"B0085L2T14","description":"","reviewerName":"pennywyze","summary":"Not really that big of an improvement","reviewText":"I bought WWE 13 about 3 weeks ago at Gamestop, and after playing this game extensively, I'm deciding now to actually write an honest review of this game.To be honest, excluding the Attitude Era gameplay and reliving some of the best matches during that era, this game offers nothing that WWE 12 couldn't of offered and feels more like WWE 12 with DLC. Here's my review-Graphics-First off, let me start off by saying if you've already played WWE 12, then the graphics should feel eerily familiar. In fact, they're recycled at best and given a few tweaks such as a few new camera angles, a little smoother looking (but not much) and that's about it.Some wrestlers in WWE 13 look really good while others I found to look ridiculous. For example, CM punk's nose seems way too long and \"poking out\" much like it did in WWE 13. Wrestlers like Shawn Michaels have looked much better in older games, and Mick Foley's character model should have been replaced altogether. One thing I wasn't crazy about in WWE 12 as with this game would be the inaccurate size of wrestlers. Big Show looked huge in past wrestling games, but in WWE 12/13 he looks noticeably shorter and too \"puffy\" looking.The graphics aren't anything to scream about, but they're not bad either. They just don't compare to WWE's past games such as WWE smackdown vs raw (the first one), SVR 2007, 2009 or 2011. The slams look about the same as last year's, which means that you get a dull thud feeling rather than the impact we've enjoyed on past efforts. In essence, it's quite obvious this game wasn't given the best treatment possible by THQ. It feels recycled.Also, WWE 13 gives wrestlers the most generic stances possible. I can remember playing older wrestling games and actually appreciating the fact that each wrestler had his/her own stance or something signature. I also feel that some wrestlers got better treatment with graphics than others. Some mid carders or low carders could look a lot better in my honest opinion.Sound-One thing I loved about WWE 13 would be the attitude era commentary. It's phenomenal. But this still doesn't take away from the fact that WWE 13 suffers from the same sound issues that WWE 12 suffered from; and that's a lack of actually being able to turn the crowd volume down. Instead, you'll have to fine tune the sound FX volume to even hear the music properly. Speaking of music, each entrance is once again drowned out thanks to THQ wanting to give you the feeling of being at the Arena. Except at a live WWE event, the music is extremely loud much like the crowd and you're able to hear both pretty good. Why not keep the same music and sound effects from previous SVR games and improve upon it? Finally, there's the commentary which sounds so dull and is recycled. Michael Cole doesn't sound the least bit interested in giving this game justice whatsoever. The only commentary that sounds exciting and lively would be King and JR.Gameplay-WWE 13 does add a few new tricks to the bag, but I'm wondering why anyone thinks catching someone mid air is anything new being that older wrestling games could do this as well. (Think SVR 2008, which is the worst entry to date) It does however give you the power to pull off a finisher mid-air and also \"OMG moments\" such as breaking the ring, smashing an opponent through a barricade, Hell in a cell drops (this isn't new. It's been able to be done in so many games. Namely, Day Of Reckoning) and some other moments. While this is all well and good, there's no reason this couldn't have been included in the lazily developed WWE 12. Afterall, even SVR 2008 gave you the ability to top rope superplex an opponent through a set of flaming tables.The moves are largely the same with a few new ones tossed in but that comes at a price being that some moves are taken away which were good ones.Aside from that, WWE 13 does do a few things right. For one, thank god THQ tossed out the crappy RTW mode that was present in last year. No more long backstage brawls that plagued WWE 12 and instead, WWE 13 has the robust but exciting Attitude Era mode which is fantastic. I really enjoyed the commentary and how the storylines transitioned. It was largely reminiscent Legends of Wrestlemania's objective based in game mechanics.The predator technology runs a little smoother in WWE 13, but it's not too noticeable.The game's roster is really good. At first I wasn't crazy about the \"clones\" of John Cena or Shawn Michaels and Triple H, but they do play much differently. Some legends are included in this game as well. It's just a shame that some wrestlers are missing from WWE 13 or require that you purchase/download them.What WWE 13 doesn't fix would be the control. You still have the same awkward system present in WWE 12 with collision detection problems that hinder game play. Instead of a round of smooth gameplay, every wrestler still has their generic side headlock grapple and it's annoying.The game's AI is either too easy or a little too dumb to take seriously. You could have a match against the CPU and get every move countered or sometimes not countered at all. At times, I wanted to irish whip an opponent and clothesline them on the way back, but instead, the ring seems so small (just like wwe 12) that you literally have to time your button presses way ahead of time.If you're looking for a game better than WWE 12, I'd only say the Attitude Era inspired mode is truly worth playing. THQ has plenty of DLC but the game's system needs to be trashed big time. People complained about the analog stick control and THQ couldn't give us the control options we had in SVR 2007 where you could choose to use both analog sticks or face buttons. Instead, they use a flawed grapple system. Hopefully, the next wrestling game gets revamped altogether being that THQ will not be behind it.This game's a decent play; but I'd definitely not pay full price for it. Perhaps half.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2013"}

The NPCs, the interactions, the quests, the general feel of the world. You can tell that years have goen into the careful construction of the world.

Stopping to write this review is hard, but, when I heard of all the 1 star reviews going up due to some temporary login issues I thought I'd hop on.Graphics: I'm playing on a top of the line iMac I bought last year and the game looks absolutely gorgeous. The graphics are incredibly crisp. Everything is very detailed and just seems to pop off the screen. It's been 12 years since the last Diablo installment and it shows. The game still has the LOOK of Diablo but it just looks so amazing. It's engrossing, to put it simply.Sound: Everything sounds great. I use simulated surround headphone and everything is exactly where it is supposed to be. The music is dark and ominous, the sounds of battle are sharp and exciting, and the happy noise of picking up some loot is always welcome.Overall, this is not just a game, it's an experience.

And after some other titles, I swore I would never do that again.Graphics = greatSound = greatGameplay = greatI'm not a huge fan of Batman, and I am loathe to read any comic from DC, but this game is QUICKLY making me a huge fan of the Bat.Throughout the game the Riddler has placed trophies and riddles for you to find and solve (respectively). Makes for good brain work. The more trophies you find and the more riddles you solve, the more points you earn for upgrades to your costume, gadgets, and fighting moves. But don't let that make you think the Joker is a lesser character. He's not. Mark Hamill reprises his role from the animated series with a bang. You'll get plenty of the Joker's antics and psychosis.There is a near perfect balance of combat, detective work, and puzzle, or riddle, solving. I do wish there was a little more combat, but I'm only 10% through the game (there is a progress indicator in the game). I can't wait to see what the remaining 90% holds.

VERY intuitive and free-flowing, just as advertised. I really do wish there were just a few more bad guys, but again, I'm just 10% through the game.There is only one downside to this game: Detective mode is too darned tempting to use throughout gameplay. And while in detective mode, you miss out on the gorgeous scenery.I put this game right up there with Metal Gear Solid 4; in the caliber of gameplay, fun, and story. Buy it! You won't regret paying full price. I really hope you can afford it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00113JSCG","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Good Ideas - Poor Execution","reviewText":"Despite being a successor to the early 90s horror series Alone in the Dark, the new Alone in the Dark game is only partially related to those old games. It has its own merits, and its own shortcomings, but does not seem particularly related to previous games and must be considered more as a stand-alone game.The story of the game involves a doomsday cult trying to summon an ancient evil using Edward Carnby, the private detective and protagonist from Alone in the Dark (the original), who has been brought to the present by unknown means and has amnesia. At first, the evil presence (marked by glowing cracks in walls that move and seek out prey as if alive) is limited to a single building, but it quickly spreads throughout the entirety of New York City, leaving Edward trapped in Central Park.As far as stories go, this is a decent one for a survival horror game, and there are a lot of good scares and surprises. In the beginning, you're trapped in a building where the very walls are trying to get you, and in addition you're also dealing with zombies - people swallowed up by the cracks brought back as malicious outlets for the main demon to speak and act through. The main demon's voice is kind of bad, though - it's the same deep monster voice that has basically become a cliche in movies about demons, and it makes the glowing cracks go from \"unidentified, unintelligent, but malicious entity\" to \"scary-voiced demon guy\". In fact, as far as scares go, the main problem with Alone in the Dark is that you're so rarely alone. Besides the short-lived survivors you encounter throughout the game, you also have a sidekick, Sarah, who comes and goes throughout parts of the game. Well, \"sidekick\" is a bit generous, since there's not a lot of cooperative gameplay involved. But the point is that there's no feeling of isolation; it's more like a disaster movie that happens to have monsters in it.The standard gameplay is a fairly regular survival-horror control system. The game is normally played in third-person, with somewhat awkward tank-style controls (IE you have to walk, then turn, then walk, rather then just turning while you walk). The camera in particular is hard to manage, and trying to look around while moving or anything besides walking in a straight line was pretty difficult to manage. Aiming firearms is done exclusively in first-person, but melee combat has a bit of a unique twist to it - it's done in third person like normal gameplay segments, and swinging melee weapons is done by \"swinging\" the right thumbstick from one direction to another. This works pretty well in most cases, and it changes depending on the weapon being used. For example, with long weapons like 2x4s or swords, you only have the option to swing horizontally or vertically. However, with heavier items like fire extinguishers, you can also use the item as a battering ram to smash down doors.Most of the enemies in the game can only be temporarily defeated by weapons, and must be consumed by fire to be fully destroyed. To this end, innovating ways to use fire as a weapon is one of the most important parts of the game. The most basic form of this is to light a melee weapon on fire by sticking it into the flames; the flames don't last forever, but they're an instant-kill to most of the monsters that you'll face, and the enemy cowers and flees accordingly. In fact, I would say that swinging a burning 2x4 while your formerly aggressive zombie enemies cower and flee before you is probably the most satisfying part of the game. There are other methods as well that must be thought up with more open thinking - things like molotov cocktails and improvised flamethrowers made out of a can of hair spray and a match. While the \"make weapons out of things to defeat your foes\" aspect is pretty much limited to fire, the fact that fire is what destroys your enemies makes it at least plausible.Your inventory in the game is represented by the holsters and pouches in your jacket. The left side of your jacket is used for small items like boxes of ammo or batteries, there's a holster for a gun and a flashlight on your chest, and the right side is used for bottles and cans of various types. The fact that there's a legitimate, actual inventory (you actually look down in first-person to access it, and it's in real-time too so you have to hurry and put stuff together instead of just calmly making a molotov cocktail during a pause) helps with the atmosphere that's being created. In a similar manner, wounds show up on your body and must be healed with either bandages or a first-aid spray. There's no health bar (as with the inventory, all HUD elements are minimal in this game), but you can get a general idea of how injured you are by the status of your wounds (which are still present after being healed, but aren't red and open). You also get a phone/PDA at a point in the game that allows you to make calls and gives you access to a GPS map of the area you are in.In many situations it's necessary to hotwire a car or activate a fusebox (which is done in real time, often with monsters closing in on you) by picking the right wires to spark together. You're often frantically pressing wires together hoping that they're the right ones but doing it quickly enough to get away from the monsters closing in on your car. This is a pretty good part of the game in an atmospheric sense. Driving the car is another thing, though; the controls are wonky and in most cases the demands of the game as far as getting away from giant apocalyptic cracks in the road are a little bit over-the-top. I spent a good hour on what is really a five-minute segment where you're trying to get away from a giant series of cracking roads and earthquakes because the car didn't turn enough, or it turned too much, or I hit another motorist and the car got stuck, or I hit something at a bad angle. The last one in particular is annoying; at the end of the sequence in question, you're supposed to go flying out through a window in a building, but the first time I got there, I assumed that was what was supposed to happen, but I hit it at an odd angle and I didn't go through (I left a mark on the glass though). The next two times I made it there, I tried looking around for other exits but got blocked off. Only on the last time did I realize what had happened and just drive straight into the glass.The graphics in the game are pretty good; the best graphics are the fire graphics, which flicker and dance pretty realistically, while the worst are probably the wounds that Edward receives on his body. The idea's neat, but in actuality they're just the same image copy-pasted onto different parts of his body. The \"slash that ripped through cloth and pierced the skin\" image looks okay when it's on his pants or shirt, but when it's on his jacket it just looks like someone slapped it on like a sticker. Also, you get the same kind of wound no matter how you got the injury. Overall, though, the graphics are decent and atmospheric.The sound isn't bad, but the music just feels wrong. It's a nice attempt at atmospheric music, but most of the time it's not so much \"scary\" as it is \"epic\", with giant sweeping musical interludes and ominous chanting that fits more with \"Carmina Burana\" than a horror movie. It just feels overstated, and not particularly scary. Furthermore, it gets old pretty quickly, too.As a whole, the worst part of Alone in the Dark is its execution. It has a lot of good ideas, and most of the elements taken by themselves are pretty sound. However, the actual execution of the ideas - the controls, the situation, the atmosphere - are all really terrible and frustrating, and the game seems more like a battle against the game itself than against any monsters or puzzles. The interactive environments seem more linear than natural; despite the fact that it's supposed to be stuff that's done in a manner that makes it seem \"realistic\", there's so many scripted sequences that it's hard to get into it.As a whole, Alone in the Dark deserves a 6/10 - good ideas, but poor execution.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

First of all I have had a lot of problems with the sound with the game optioned for Home Theater sound. It skips a lot especially during scenes with lots of action. I have a 6 month old 360 and a brand new Yamaha digital receiver. That aside, the AI is a bit weird sometimes. I have shot enemies 20-30 times with a machine gun and they still do not go down. Many of the levels end with holding off wave after wave of enemies. This gets a little repetitive. As another reviewer said, finding the way out of a level requires exact placment of your character before you can move ahead. The manual is very sparse and has very little info on the single player missions. On the pro side, the graphics are great, lots of neat weapons and fairly interesting missions.

You are part of a small team of soldiers  that are put on \"B\" company because they are the ones that are expendable.  They do all the grunt work.  There were two things that really stuck out to me while initially playing this game.  First, you can blow up just about anything in this game and it is fun doing it.  How many times have you played a game and launched an explosive at a building and it blew up and did not damage to the building?  Not so here.  If you have guys holed up in a building you can just blow a hole in the back wall and storm in and take them out.  Have a guy hiding behind a window peppering you with gunfire?  Use your grenade launcher and take out the whole wall along with him.  It's a, forgive the pun, blast.  Secondly, the sound effects are really good in this game.  I love the way the guns sound when you shoot them.  It's not just bang, bang.  They have a resonance to them that is actually quite immersive.  You feel like it's a real gun you are hearing.  The only complaint I have so far is that the missions are quite short.  You storm a town and have to take out the enemy squad and a tank, which may take you 10 minutes, then a short cut scene telling you what to do next.  Go to another area, have a 5-10 minute battle and another cut scene.  Again, I'm only a few hours into it so I don't know if this continues throughout the whole game or not.  Now, it is a fun 5-10 minutes, but it reduces the suspense you get when playing games like Call of Duty when a battles seem like they last forever.  Battlefield: Bad Company feels like a whole bunch of skirmishes put together instead of once long sustained battle.  It's still fun, but not perfect.  For the price Amazon has it for now, less than $20, it is definitely a must buy for those waiting for the next big shooter to come along.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2009"}

I loved its realistic combat, slow methodical pace and its somewhat brutal difficulty. I bought OF:DR on Steam for $5 when it was on sale and this is also a terrific game. The graphics are dry and monotone mostly but serve the purposes quite well. War is dull and monotone and this game captures it quite well. The guns are somewhat varied and you get to take on several roles. However, there seems to be no clear sniper rifles but assault rifles only with longer range.The game is also quite buggy - in the initial mission where  you're supposed to reload from a kit, my buttons froze there every game. Also, zoom in/zoom out is glitched - if you zoom in with RMB, it zooms out and you have to keep clicking RMB till it 'sticks'. The game is also very taxing on my nVidia 8800GT 512MB now and it constantly overheats the card. So cannot play more than 30min at a time. I probably need a GTX460 next anyways.Sadly, nvidia 3D vision does NOT work with this game. Its even listed as not recommended.The game is quite fun when you finally ace that tough mission. However, enemies are not randomized at random locations so its quickly trial and error to move to next checkpoint. I think you can even avoid killing enemies and get to next checkpoint.Overall, I think this is a great game and I had several hours of fun.Definitely will buy the OF:Red River as it would've corrected some of this game's issues.But most likely I'll pick it up and OF:DR for Xbox360 instead of PC or PS3.I normally only buy 3D compatible games on PC.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2011"}

Fable I was a great game don't get me wrong. But I kinda get that same vibe from Fable II as well.Let me start by saying allowing you to pick your gender was very intelligent on their part, along with just how well or badly people treat you based on your alignment. I am surprised that even with my gripes of this game that it can still just suck me in for a couple hours at a time (and yes I've beaten this game) just listening and interacting with the world around me.I don't think I have ever been so thoroughly immersed in a videogame world before. This almost rivals with a good D&D; session for time well spent. Almost. No videogame will ever truly top that level of interaction and endless possibility. Not as long as the game's creative vision is in the hands of someone that isn't you and your friends. The people of Albion react to you in varied ways depending on your actions and not even just your alignment.Heck yesterday I shot someone in the face because he wouldn't get out of the way of a door way -no matter what I did- splattered his head all over the inside of the furniture shop, two other people draw guns start shooting at me. So what do I do? Defend myself. Didn't really gain any evil for it either, heck I'm known as The Saint in that game, that's just awesome. I go back to bowerstone (I was in bloodstone when I murdered) and two guards tell me \"They are keeping their eye on me\" around five minutes later or so some random towns person said \"You will kill anyone won't you!\"It's impressive to say the least that they went so far with some of the little details like that in this game. I had caused several people to distrust me, as they heard of my dastardly deed in Bloodstone, even though I have a glowing halo over my head. I'm just left astounded with this.The other thing about this game which really impresses me is the combat system. It is very fluid and feels very natural to exectue. I would be willing to say actually it's even more simple than say Baldurs Gate Dark Alliance or Champions Of Norrath, but is by far more entertaining and dynamic.Also the fact that there is no \"going back and loading\" after a major decision point is awesome. You do something evil for the quest ending? Guess what you're stuck with that decision. Consequences. This game deals alot in those, and it seems all the more enjoyable and immersive to me that there are decisions which are \"immutable\".So what's holding this game back from a full five star? In a word Details. There's alot of polish and shine to this game but I felt that the post beaten game content could have been more existent than merely wrap up whatever you didn't finish before you beat it. Getting a castle and possibly changing your gender, and then doing repeated Bounty Hunter and other jobs, and Free/Enslave Quests. I'd have loved for some kind of \"post game story\" to have been implemented into the game.I think they could have done just that little extra more for everyone, and they would have had a game that will be forever thought of with dreamy goofy gamer smiles and plenty of nostalgic gaming on their hands.

It's not worth obsessing much over how those teeny pixels look :)Off you are launched into your world. You don't choose class or profession or anything like that. In a style that I really love, what you do determines what you progress in. If you do a ton of archery, your archery skills increase. If you do a ton of combat magic, your combat magic skills increase. It makes sense.You start off as a mercenary assaulting a village area. I have to admit that I didn't like this beginning. First off, it says you and your blue-haired elf friend have been mercenaries for many years, yet they have you hitting training dummies. I realize this is necessary for helping newbies learn the combat system, but really, they could have had a pre-assault training area, instead of landing you on a beach and then saying \"Oh wait we have some training dummies here for you to play with\" :). Also, having the instructors call you \"maggot\" and \"worm\" incessantly got a bit much. Someone was watching a few too many old boot-camp movies.However, soon enough you are free of the mercs and off on your adventure. The characters you interact with seem real, they have their motivations, secrets and goals. It's up to you which people you want to help out. I really would have loved more options in the dialogue - sometimes they only give you one option and I really don't agree with it. It made me feel like my personality was cemented in a style I did not enjoy.The combat is great, of course, and as you build up party members, you really get into some massively fun fights with spells flaring, arrows flying and swords swinging. You have to learn what area the large creatures are weak in, and exploit those weaknesses to win. You can't just hack and slash your way through if you want to do well. By customizing your party members, along with pets, you can really have the combat experience match your individual style.Add in the armor / weapon enhancements, the ability to resurrect or to have corpses brought back to safety (for a small fee), and general teleportation fun, and the game really does address many of the annoying issues that make other, similar RPGs a bit cumbersome. For example, if you leave a corpse in a field of battle, it still of course has your \"stuff\" on it. You can choose to try to wade back into battle with a \"fresh you\" to retrieve your stuff, or you can pay to have the corpse brought back into town magically.Once you finish the main game on all 3 difficulty levels, there is endless fun in online multiplayer action!Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2005"}

This controller offers pure comfort for people who play arcade fighters and vintage classics.The gamepad is a big improvement over the original Classic controller. Aside from the obvious wings that were added on the bottom, the controller has the shoulder buttons set up like a Playstation 2 controller. This makes the two shoulder buttons easier to press with your index finger and your middle finger.At first glance, it seems like a rip-off to buy a game controller that looks like a Playstation 2 controller. Most Wii players use the Gamecube controller to play games that require a gamepad, such as \"Super Smash Brothers Brawl.\"However, anyone who has ever downloaded the first \"Sin & Punishment\" knows that they need a solid gamepad to pull off all the movements with speedy precision. Players need to run side-to-side and point their cursor to shoot at enemies. The classic controller pro is the best controller that provides gamers with the tight gameplay they desperately need.Plenty of other games work incredibly well with the classic controller pro. I could never play any of the Nintendo 64 virtual console games without my classic controller. The Z button on the Gamecube controller used to really aggravate my left index finger, especially during \"The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.\" I needed to push Z quickly, without putting intense strain on my index finger. The classic controller works extremely well, because the left shoulder button isn't spring-loaded. I didn't have to hold my finger down just to get the controller to register. I could just tap the button.Hundreds of virtual console and WiiWare games need the simple grip of a classic controller, so this $20 pad is a must-buy. It seems like a rip-off, but it is the essential controller that every Wii player needs to have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2010"}

C. Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"The EYES Have It","reviewText":"I can't get the name Eye Toy out of my head.  The familiar camera for the PS2 now has a very new and classy look on the PS3.  Say hello to the mature Playstation Eye.  If you had a Playstation Eye for the Playstation 2 you are probably aware of the interactivity that was available.  Now with the newest edition Eye that is taken up one level to a whole new dimension.Getting my hands on this has been a few weeks in coming.  Deciding on whether I wanted to purchase it with a game is what kept me.  In reality I didn't need a card game so I purchased this for the measely sum of $40 and now I have this beautiful contraption.  Once you open the package there is not much to it.  Connect the 6 foot usb cord to the PS3 and go to device settings and make sure your PS3 is aware it has a camera.  No installation here which makes life that much easier.If you have access to the Playstation Network you can download the Eye Create software for free.  A rather small and unassuming file packed with punch.  I really didn't expect much from a free program but I was in for a big surprise.  The program is actually an editing program and a very simple but very good one at that.  The program allows for capturing video, sound, and pics.  You can then edit your masterpiece to create a decent home movie.  I am still unaware as to whether I can upload the videos onto Youtube or mail them to others on my friend list.  This is a great little bonus program to owning the Eye.As of now there are a couple mini games available at a low price on the PSN.  And of course they are interactive with the Eye.  The first game is actually an aquarium.  I don't know as much for a game as an interactive screen saver that would be nice when your entertaining.  The camera captures movement and gives your slight reflection as if looking into aquarium glass.  You can move your arms around to spook the fish and then you can act like your dropping your hand in the water to see the slight ripple.  Pretty cool little trick.The other game is kind of silly but the kids will love it.  The object is to save these little mindless creatures.  By using your hands to move them to safety.  The game starts off rather easy and gets more complex.  Most adults may get bored but I can see how a child would have a lot of fun with the interaction.Of course this is just the beginning of numerous interactive games that will be available for many months on the PSN.  No word as to whether they will offer these games in a collection on the disc.  The first major game to utilize the Eye will be Sing Star.  It will allow you to show off your singing skills to others.Now I have just mentioned a few of the advantages of the Eye and of course there is the Eye of Judgement game many people have raved about.  But I enjoy this camera for the ability to have video chats.  I had a video chat and the picture looked great.  Very clear and able to handle low light.  What was also impressive was it moved at normal speed thanks to the cameras ability to move 120 frames per second.  Having a conversation with someone looks normal and not like they are moving in slow motion.  The microphone picks up sound extremely well and the voice conversation comes out great.  The PS3 allows for video confrencing with 4 people.  For the quality it is one of the best and cheapest video confrencing programs available.I would have to say the Playstation Eye is a shining feature on the PS3.  If you are looking for something that will continue to reward you over the coming months with new games and the ability to actually see the people you talk to the Playstation Eye is where it's at.  Great for kids or adults it's a great value.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2007"}

Its comfortable in the series, as in this is not a sequel that steps out of the bounds of its predecessors. Its simply more of zelda with new content and new twist in that sometimes you control a phantom in the dungeons.I enjoyed this game as a whole, feeling that the latter half was infinitely more fun than the first half. If you've just started playing it, push through the first 3 dungeons, the game will get a lot better.What sucks in this game:The dialogue is horrible, especially compared to the ever changing trend in most games coming out that have real dialogue. I found it obnoxious that I have to chose dialogue options for \"link\" that consist of at most four or five words. Zelda games aren't known for their deep prose so I knew not to expect much and that's what I got, not much.The first half of the game is slow, boring, and all too easy. You could make the same claim about the game's difficulty as a whole being too easy, but I've come to expect that from Nintendo games in the past few years. Ah remember how hard Ocarina was? You really can fly through this game with little difficulty. I never died in any dungeons, only the spirit tracks by evil choo-choo trains.The graphics for the \"overworld\" (when you're riding in the train) are unbelievable awful. I'm talking incredibly pixalated and very 2-D looking. I was shocked at how bad the textures looked. The rest of the game looks great, especially in the dungeons. I just don't know what happened with the overworld. Its like they ran out of time or just didn't bother.Warping in this game blows. I felt like it took entirely too long to get from point A to point B. I don't know if they did this on purpose so you'd have more chances to catch bunnies or what but either way be prepared to spend a lot of time on the train. Previous titles let you warp to any warp point. This game has specific warp points, meaning a warp point in the forest realm takes you to exactly one corresponding warp point in another realm. You can't choose where to warp to.There's nothing new with drawing on the maps. This was an awesome feature in Phantom Hourglass; it has not changed at all in this game. I was hoping for maybe a simple toolkit like colors or a keyboard or symbols - treasure chests, an X, warp symbols. Instead its just the exact same as it was in the last game.What rocks in this game:The boss fights are always good - even if the difficulty level isn't there. The latter dungeons have some great puzzles in them that use multiple rooms and levels to complete.Playing the spirit flute is actually a lot of fun. I really did feel like I was playing it. You have to learn songs, just like in Ocarina and Wind Waker. It looks surprisingly good too. Just don't try to play in an area with noise. I tried playing on the plane and it registered all the ambient noise as me trying to blow into the mic. So I had to cover up the mic with my thumb to control it.Finding all 50 bunnies is a great side quest, especially since you get rewarded multiple times for sub-accomplishments in this quest. Likewise finding the stamps was a fun side quest that kept me looking, and the reward for all 20 is worth it.Using Zelda for some of the puzzles was great. Once you get past the obvious have the phantom block the fire, there are some great puzzles involving different kinds of phantoms. This was a unique addition to this game that made the dungeons a lot of fun. If only she would just shut up during the rest of the game.The new whip weapon is awesome, as is the race mini-game.Length of the game is good if you do all or most of the side quests. If you just do the main quest the game would feel too short. Plus, lots of the fun of exploring the overworld is doing side quests, opening up new areas of tracks, and exploring those.Overall, this is another good Zelda game - but by no means does this push the envelope. I enjoyed playing it and will probably revisit it sometime down the road. If you're a Zelda fan, you know you're already going to get this game. If you're not, this is a good quest game but don't expect much depth in the way of story or characters.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2010"}

And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime.

With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"D@rkFX","summary":"Ups'n'downs but game shines overall!","reviewText":"Pros: Huge areas to cover; nice stunts; deformations are a feast; graphics are great; the city feels alive; engine sound is greatCons: Races are not an easy win; too much rock music for an european guy","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2008"}

You can't jump from the bike to the train. I did find the cutoff and wrecked at the next checkpoint. This is where the long ride to nowhere comes in. I guess that part is fun if you like shooting a lot of guys on Bikes and in SUVs with a machine gun while trying to dodge trees and rocks. Ok for a time, but there needs to be an end. As I said, I was running full out for 20 mins., then hit the pause button and rested as my forearm was getting sore from holding down the \"x\" button. Got back at it again. Hard to stay that intensely focused for that length of time. In short, they made that sequence entirely too long.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2013"}

Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"Adam Ruining \"My reviews are genuine.\"","summary":"Nonsensical.","reviewText":"Things you don't need the nunchuk for:- \"Super Paper Mario\"- The games of \"Wii Sports\" (excluding Boxing)- Browsing weather or newsThings you need the nunchuk for:- Everything funLike Vin Diesel and Pez, highly recommended.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2007"}
{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"Dr. D","summary":"Be Damned and Love It!","reviewText":"Let me just get this out of the way first:  Dante's Inferno is most definitely a rip-off of the God of War gameplay.  That is completely undebateable and unquestionable.  Now that's not necessarily a bad thing.  God of War did set a defining standard for many future games with regard to combat systems and control schemes.  And to be honest, it WORKS for Dante's Inferno, and Electronic Arts perfected it.  So if you have played God of War, Dante's Inferno should be very easy to pick up and play right out of the box (and if you never played GoW, please do so immediately!).Just the whole concept of Dante's Inferno is terrific . . . traveling through the 9 Circles of Hell to find your long-lost love is one heck of a storyline to drive the rest of the game.  The graphics are fantastic, the GoW style is beautiful (with the additions of equipping relics and upgrading tons of stuff via Holy/Unholy Paths), and everything is just laid out wonderfully.  The enemy characters are also very well-designed, from the various demons and unbaptized babies to Lucifer Himself.  The only gripe I have is that the boss battles should have been a little more involved and not just about button mashing.  Same could be said for the puzzle component, but those points are just very minor compared to the game overall.Also, I instinctively knew that this game was going to be the first of three more to come (basing things off the Divine Comedy itself).  The \"To Be Continued...\" epigram at the end of the game hints to that, so we should expect Purgatorio and Paradiso to come out over the next few years.  If EA does that, we have a fine contender on our hands to compete with the God of War Trilogy!  In fact, Dante's Inferno is much better than both God of War and GoW 2.  This game is a must-buy.  Highly recommended!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2010"}

But, if you think Halo peaked with Combat Evolved and has declined since then this game will do nothing to change your beliefs.Single Player:While the Campaign is better than Halo 3's and ODST (and of course always enjoyable with friends) it provides little new and in some cases even recycles old levels from prior Halo games. The new abilities are fun, and the space battle was a gimmicky distraction, but there's really only a couple of new weapons and exactly zero new enemies to fight. While it's nice to fight intelligent and difficult Elites again, Reach really would've went out with a bang if they included boss battles, scarab fights (a massive highlight in Halo 3) or introduced some new enemy types that haven't been played out to death over the last 4 installments.As far as story goes, Halo jumped the shark when it was revealed The Little Shop of Horrors controls all the flood and Reach continues that nosedive.Multiplayer:In terms of Multiplayer, there are only a few largely uninspired maps available on disc that lack any aesthetic diversity or strategy (e.g. team slayer = grab power weapons and camp). Most of what you'll play are Forge World creations or maps that look and feel similarly to those (outside of the Covenant Ship level, a rehash of Halo 2's Midship). There's not a single snow, jungle, desert, rain forest, moon, volcano, tropical island, beach or mountain top level to speak of. Not even a recreation of classics like Zanzibar and Beaver Creek. Additionally, they've completely removed vehicles from 4v4 slayer and have lumped single player objective and single player slayer into one playlist called \"Rumble Pit.\" So, if all you want is the classic Halo experience be prepared to have to endure tons of annoying and poorly conceived Juggernaut and Infection game modes instead of being able to play what you actually want (NOTE: Bungie moved Infection to its own playlist, making Rumble Pit a more enjoyable experience).On a positive note, Invasion is a great game type (especially Invasion Slayer which is simply the best idea Bungie has had) and the inclusion of credits, new armor pieces and the daily challenges are awesome and keep the game's replayability up. Furthermore Bungie is an active participate in the community and makes changes based on usage data, such as putting Team Swat in it's own list. This benefits both the people that love and hate that game mode simultaneously.Firefight:I don't understand the point of Firefight Matchmaking. This was the best aspects of ODST and while that Classic Firefight option remains in a non-credit earning, challenge completing, matchmaking aspect, the main matching system only allows you to play ONE ROUND with infinite lives. Where's the fun and/or challenge in that?Forge World:Easily the best aspect of this game as it expands on Halo 3's innovative Forge design by allowing you to build your levels from the ground up in a massive world rather than be limited to existing maps. The file share system is great and though clunky at times, it's rewarding to make your own map and play it with friends.Conclusion:While there are pretty cool ideas (credits, Forge World and Invasion) the game is largely a gimmicky cash-in riddled with rehashed, tired ideas and lacks the polish, content and new ideas that Bungie's faithful deserves.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2010"}

But, one thing is evident, this ain't your same ol' Legacy of Kain game. Defiance redefines the series with its' new combat system and 'Devil May Cry/Castlevania:Lament of Innocence' camera-style. Those two things, alone, add so much more depth to things that I hope they keep them for future installments. Admittedly, the camera could use a lil more polish in areas where the environment stands in your way but, for the most part, it works. Working in chapters and following them alternately through their quest, the story begins with Kain hunting down Moebius for answers and, then, with Raziel trying to find his way out of the Spectral Realm. Those expecting another game filled with more questions than answers will be genuinely surprised. This game answers every question you've had since Soul Reaver 1. So, you definitely know who's friend or foe in this installment. Sadly, though, with that apparent-it would seem as though the series is drawing to a close. Rest assured, though, it's not. It's just bringing this saga to a close and readying us for the next.

The game was definitely not as I thought it would be. The entire game had a Bioshock-ish feel with its own atmospheric identity, which is its best feat. The set-pieces are varied.Unfortunately the plot is not nearly as good as it could be, but the execution with the Bioshock-esque recordings etc. make a mediocre plot a better than average one. I think that alone makes it a worthwhile game to play. The past few years games have been way too focused on cutscenes. Luckily, Dishonored does not have many, so I can&#8217;t complain about the plot too much. Out of all of these stealth games this generation of games, I think the controls with this one seemed the easiest to use. Naturally, with any of these covert stealth games, the controls can be frustrating and you just want to pry yourself into your TV screen because switching between the powers is sometimes not as quick as one would desire.The powers are awesome. One thing I really liked is that you can combo them to how you would like to play. Many say that the game does kind of punish you for being what you are, an assassin, which is a valid point. However, it is definitely significantly more difficult to keep the death count low, which is the point. The game length was fine. It promotes exploring.

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

I thought that the SquareEnix was going to stick to the same formula and produce the same old same old.Boy was I wrong..Not only is FFXII the best installment in the series, it also has to be the most addicted one as well. The combat system almost seems foreign compared to other FF's. Instead of the same turn based random encounters of earlier FF's, we get a free roam like combat system of FFXII. The combat system itself is modeled off of the Final Fantasy XI MMORPG. Your party targets a enemy, fights (or runs away), and collects exp and lincense points. You can pause the combat by pressing the X button which will bring up several choices that allow you to attack, use items or magic. Pretty simple and more realistic then the turn based system of old. Best of all...if you don't want to fight monster you don't have to! Think of it as a single player MMORPG with AI buddies fighting alongside you.Characters learn new skills through the license board, which is sort of like a FFX's grid system. Everything from what magic a character uses, to what weapons he can wield are decided on the license board. It makes for a great customization of a player's party.One thing I didn't like about FFX was the long cut scenes. It seemed like i was doing less playing and more watching. Unfortunately...the producers at SquareEnix still think they are movie producers and the long cut scenes have returned. The opening intro has a Star War's like story that chronicles the downfall of the Dalmasca Kingdom. I really didn't care so much for this kingdom, but if you're into deep story lines then it's not that badGraphics wise, FFXII shows just how dated the PS2 is. If you ever played games on Xbox360 or a PC then you have come to expect high quality detail in games. FFXII is no where near the level of graphics those games are. Don't be fooled by the polish look that commercials and advertisements show you. Although the cut scenes look great though.However what beats all these minor problems is the fun factor of the game. I believe at least that SquireEnix has created another classic installment to their Final Fantasy library","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

My kids LOVE it. We play \"duet\" mode constantly trading places on the dance floor.My kids are between 7 and 10 and the songs have been edited so any inappropriate lyrics have been \"omitted\". I've only seen it happen on the song \"toxic\", but I was impressed that they did that. With Just Dance, Katy Perry sings Hot and Cold and a couple of lyrics could have been omitted without losing the song.I'm also totally impressed with the variety of genres they have covered. We dance hip hop, latin, disco, techno, and electronic... totally made me want to buy some glow sticks, have a rave. Unbelievably fun workout. If we had the space for 8 people to dance, I'd get more controllers.I can officially say that this is the first game I have ever pre-ordered and it was well worth the wait! I have been using the first version as my cardio workout for the past four months and was excited, yet hesitant, for the new one to arrive. The dance moves are definitely faster and more difficult than the first version, with a great new mix of songs. I was intimidated at first, but my 12 year-old daughter and I played each song we selected a couple of times to get the moves down. We ended the session with an exhausting two rounds of Proud Mary...WOW...that one will definitely be a part of my daily workout!

I played the original 1981 arcade game at an arcade place recently, and that is lenient compared to the hair-tearing experience that the one in Donkey Kong 64 will offer you, and the player is required to not only receive a Nintendo coin from beating the arcade game twice, but the game also requires the player to play and beat Jetpac, which is actually more lenient than the original Donkey Kong, but it still can be a mess to beat. On a positive note, the levels are very detailed and beautifully designed, thanks to the Expansion Pak, but the fact that the player is required to beat the original Donkey Kong twice with only one life per attempt killed the fun, as I would put away the game because of that one impossible mini game to cool down, I even had to buy a Gameshark to beat the game the first time around; it was near impossible. I can now beat it without the use of a Gameshark, but I still find it completely unnecessary to hold such a hefty requirement just to beat the game normally, and if it gave the player a different ending I would understand, but the game forces the player to beat those mini games, and while it could add to the challenge factor, it is still completely unnecessary to just merely complete the game normally. I would still recommend the game, as it has some redeeming values such as advanced sound effects and detailed enemy and level designs, but the player must have extreme patience and be fully willing to take a couple of brutal beatings from the original Donkey Kong and Jetpac in order to beat the game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2012"}

I got the nintendo 3ds because I wanted to pick up the system and play it on the fly when I'm not home for the consoles. I saw that Ghost Recon Shadow Wars was a launch title. I thought this would be another FPS, but when I checked the info online it was a turn based game. I really never played any turn based games before with the exception of Halo Wars and I didnt really get into it. But reading the good reviews for this game, I decided to go ahead and get the game, thinking I'd try it then sell it at some loss. I've played 3 missions so far and I am hooked. I like the way you have to think before making decisions in the game. You can choose the difficulty at the beggining of missions and save your progress mid game by going to options then save game. I have not had the game crash on my 3ds as of yet, so I can not comment on that.

The graphics are really impressive, and the character customization adds a great new dimension to fighting gameplay.There are whole complex back-stories to all of the characters, developed over the game series. You can go into the 'museum' in this game to learn all about that, if you haven't been keeping up with the series. That will help you really understand the interactions between the characters. It's like being a part of a complex, epic story.The graphics are simply gorgeous. There are pirate ships, where the floor moves and sways beneath you. There are elegant Chinese temples with mosaic tile floors and lovely mountains in the background. You've got renaissance mansions in flames, cages in grimy port towns, and much more. Each environment has moving elements to add to the realism.The sounds are pretty traditional. Most of it is BASH - SMASH - YAAAAH! along with the background music, themed to match the environment. I do love this kind of background music far better than games that have rock music.Gameplay itself has good and bad points. On the good side, there are a GREAT combinations you can learn for your character, so if you are diligent you can come up with awesome fighting sequences. You can learn which combos match well against your enemy's weaknesses and exploit them. On the other hand, if you're more the type that likes to button mash, you can have a fair amount of success with that, although you will get frustrated in the higher level battles.The game is marked for teens, although it's far more tame than other fighting games I've seen. Many of the females *gasp* actually wear clothing. There really isn't any blood involved in the combat, although  some parents argue that little tykes shouldn't see swinging swords and flails at all. There's no swearing.That being said, the game is fairly challenging, and unlike the previous game, there's no way to set the difficulty up or down. If you play one on one you can adjust the difficulty so the younger person can have an easier time, but for regular gameplay you're stuck with \"hard\". I find this to be a shame. While experienced players will get along OK, it really would've been nice for new players to have an 'easy' option to go through the game in, to learn the game and have fun. They could always have upgraded through 'normal' and 'hard' later on.With the customizeable characters and multitude of opponents, you can really replay this game for months without getting bored with it. There are always new combinations to learn and perfect. Well recommended!Rating: 4.5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWBAE","description":"","reviewerName":"Bradley Corwin","summary":"A New Worthy Wii U Game","reviewText":"Pikmin 3 is the latest addition to the series for the Wii U.  The HD looks spectacular.  I would recommend using the Wii remote and nunchuk to play this game.  I tried to use the Wii U tablet but it was not as easy and more cumbersome.  The Wii U tablet adds a little bit extra by displaying the map and logs on the screen.  As far as gameplay the look and feel is just like the past Pikmin games.  This time around you get 3 crew members that you can switch between to divvy up the work.  The classic model of going until you run out of daylight still holds.  The goal is to accomplish as much as you can in a day and sacrifice as few Pikmin as possible.  Nintendo made another great addition to this franchise and it's worth picking it up if you own a Wii U.Update 1: So far this game is really fun.  Being able to split the crew up is really nice (I didn't play Pikmin 2 only Pikmin).  The controls are a lot more intuitive now.  I don't have to keep spamming A to pick Pikmin, I can just hit it once and they will carry on doing it.  There is some subtle humor especially in the naming of the items you find.  There are a few annoyances though.  I keep running around and a few Pikmin will get caught along the path and I won't notice I lose them until they die at the end of the day.  The \"Go Here\" function of the gamepad comes in handy a lot, use it frequently!Update 2: This game is such a challenge.  The path to take isn't always obvious and working with the 3 crew members can get interesting.  You really have to watch your Pikmin and use the right ones for the right situations.  Sometimes I have them all split up and I get the Pikmin under attack warning and am frantically searching for them.  You can leave fruit places and come back and get it the next day but any creature bodies will disappear.  I find myself being really adventurous and getting too far ahead of myself.  And be careful with bombs! I get carried away throwing Pikmin and then notice I just threw a bomb and blow up half my Pikmin and have to restart the day.Update 3: I've finally acquired all the different types of Pikmin and it's amazing.  The strategy to plan out your day and bridge different types with you is awesome.  I usually split Pikmin up between my different crew members, one might take the blue and pink for water duty while the others stay dry on land.  What's really awesome is using them all together to accomplish different tasks.  I feel like I'm getting closer to the end but I know it's fun enough to make me go get all the fruit before I finish up.Update 4: The end is a nice challenge.  You will need to work together with all your Pikmin to win.  I'd comment more but I don't want to give anything away.Mission Mode: You get different challenges from gathering treasure to defeating enemies to fighting bosses.  You get a medal depending how well you complete the mission.  This gives you more to do once you've completed the story and can get competitive and challenging.  This mode can be played with a friend.Bingo Battle:  You compete against a friend to see who can gather fruit to make a bingo.  You each get a \"bingo board\" with the different fruit on it.  You then try to gather fruit and get 4 in a row.  The first player to do this wins.I highly recommend this game for any gamer out there.  It has some nostalgia if you have played the past Pikmin games as well.  This is the red carpet rolling out for all the Nintendo games coming out next year.

It is also the first game in the series to have a subtitle with the actual title. Once more, it is also the first Mario Kart game to have retro courses. Don't believe me? Then skip down to the near-bottom of this review.Instead of having the same gameplay as Mario Kart 64, however, the game uses the original Super Nintendo game's gameplay and performs a major twist in it.The graphics are awesome. For the characters, they are taken right out of Mario Kart 64, but everything else is new and a sight for sore eyes.You get to start with 16 courses (The Special Cup is locked). Each course seems to have their own gimmicks, with the exception of some. The courses are greatly detailed and their designs are kinda clever.The music in the game is unlike the other Mario Kart games. Although some of the soundtrack is Mario Kart-worthy, there are several songs that doesn't fit in, yet you'd love to listen to the music. Such examples are Boo Lake, Ribbon Road, Snow Land, and the game's Rainbow Road.When racing on a track, you'll always find coins. At first glance, they look pointless to collect. But guess what? You need them. If you have no coins and someone bumps into you, you'll spin out. What's cool about the coins is that when you finish a cup with over 100 coins, you get to unlock a cup from the original Super Mario Kart! Nostalgia just beats like a human heart right there. When you enter the Cup menu, just press L or R and then it will switch to the Super Mario Kart tracks. The graphics aren't from the Super Nintendo game, though, but the tracks still play like how they used to be.With 20 new courses and 20 ones that were brought back, this game will last for a long while.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2011"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both? The choice is yours ininfamous.caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Everyman turned superhero Cole.View larger.Devastating electricity-based powers.View larger.Go anywhere open-world design.View larger.An organic urban environment.View larger.StoryEmpire City was a run of the mill metropolis, until one day a massive explosion rips through six square blocks of its bustling downtown real-estate, seemingly leveling everything and everyone in its path. Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

Events will unfold based on the role players take in them, creating broader reactions in the city&rsquo;s people and environment.","reviewerName":"FicktionPhotography","summary":"Electricity has Never Been so Fun","reviewText":"Having played inFamous through twice, once to acquire super angelic status and once to acquire super villainous status, I find myself quite astonished by this game. The replay value is sort of high, but it's not something I would dedicate much of your life to. True, you get cool powers associated with your choices and some different dialogue here and there...and civilians throwing rocks at you...but otherwise the game progresses quite nicely without having to go over it two or more times. Perhaps it's because of the decision making strategies these games implement. To choose the side of good or evil has become chronic in video games for quite some time now and it tends to get tedious. Aren't there anymore options other than saving citizens or letting them rot, sucking electric energy from downed foes (or innocents) or healing them and restraining them? Apparently not. Still, I can't help but love the game.It's a combination of Crackdown, Spider-Man, Assassin's Creed (though when you fall into water it makes SENSE that you would die) and Fable. Cole McGrath, your playable main character who sounds a bit too much like Christian Bale in The Dark Knight, has been given a super special electric ability that provides him with the ability to save the city he currently resides in. You get a grand assortment of powers that are fun, easy to implement, and slightly diabolical. Collecting blast shards, unlike Assassin's Creed's flags, actually gives you more electrical energy so it becomes a quest and not an achievement (or in this case trophy) based hope. The game is by no means easy, especially when one makes it to the second and third sections of the city. Of course, that only seems because all of your enemies have just increased in health. The bosses being one of them. ...I have never been so happy to see a health bar diminish. Particularly on Hard mode. Speaking of that mode, I was expecting something a bit more insane other than just MORE enemies or MORE attacks. The movements of the enemies are absolutely similar to one another and you can predict motions like you can predict where the sun will rise in the morning. This makes it a bit boring to replay, as mentioned earlier. And...since it was on Hard mode, you just wind up attacking for longer periods of time, getting more frustrated than elated with the sudden and ever-present danger.At the same time the game is creative, curiously interesting, and inviting. The story is not boring and it actually gives a bit more reason to the good/evil complex. It has a lovely comic book quality to it where there is mixed moments of action and subtle, emotional strain coupled with a cyclical nature. I wasn't bored with it the first time around, only the second and even then it wasn't like I didn't want to play it. It's compelling enough to make you want to play it, only wishing for something slightly more complex than simply more enemies. You have an entire city to explore and run around in causing ruckus or healing. Most PS3 exclusive games turn out to be duds, but this is not one of them. They hit the nail on the head with this one, re-instilling some faith in the Sony world.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2010"}

Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword.

God of War III is proof to anyone out there that hack-n-slash can still be fun, and more importantly, can still be fun the second, third, and fourth time through.Kratos personifies the term \"anti-hero\", frequently making it hard to even root for him.  However, in spite of all his flaws, Kratos is without a doubt, one of the best characters in game-dom and worthy of this grand send-off.  Story wise, GOW III is a great piece of literary fiction.  However, artistically GOW III is the champion of the realm.  So rarely have I ever played a game full of jaw dropping moments and Santa Monica has honed their art in such a way that, even though I have beaten the game, I still find myself enthralled by the shear scale and amazing depth of the world and gameplay.If I had known a few months back as I played Dante's Inferno, what GOW III had in store I probably would have knocked a star off of Dante's score.  Everything that Dante did, Kratos did better.  Every world that Visceral made, Santa Monica did bigger and richer.  Every action that was fun in Dante's Inferno, GOW III did easier, cooler, and a lot more fun.  In fact, I cannot recall a game in the last 3 years do it so right in so many ways.  Everything from music, to gameplay, to graphics is five stars.  There are even built in things to allow gamers more play throughs and more challenges: from Godly Possessions to Olympic Challenges, the game itself is only a portion of this amazing title.  Even average enemies are the source for amazing deaths and useful moves that help keep the fighting fresh.  It's a good thing, because you will be fighting a LOT!  Expect hoardes of beasts, bosses that will make you want to throw your controller against a wall, and puzzles to make your brain sweat.  However, in spite of all the obstacles in your way, GOW III manages to seduce you back to try yet again.If you are looking for that truly mature video game with plenty of blood, breasts, and beasts to satisfy your gaming appetite then GOW III is a must-own title of the decade.  Now, I have to end this so I can get back to decapitating gorgons and snapping the necks of Minotaurs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2010"}

I knew next to nothing about this campaign setting going into W4K: SPACE MARINE, but now I have a bit of an idea. It's a setting in which the galaxy is in a constant state of war, where entire worlds are hollowed out to fuel a galactic war machine, and space marines fight on the same battlefield as sorcerers and orcs. (Orks, that is.) It's a setting that you get by taking a gritty, war-bound, Tolkien-esque universe and throwing it thousands of years into the future - 40,000 years to be exact. I wasn't a fan of WARHAMMER 40K before SPACE MARINE, but I think I'd like to be one now.The story of SPACE MARINE picks up nine days after the invasion of a Terran \"Forge World\" by a massive Ork army. They've since taken control of the planet's orbital defense cannons, effectively keeping the human fleets at bay. So it's up to Captain Titus and a group of Ultramarines (one of many groups in the Space Marine Legion) to disrupt the invasion and keep the Orks from obtaining crucial military weaponry that could turn the tide of the war. This begins only after the player character, Titus, single-handedly takes down an Ork attack ship, just so you get the idea that space marines are NOT your average soldier; they're practically walking tanks.After that amazing opening (and it really is amazing) you progress toward your objective at the whim of circumstance and Ork counterattacks, and you get a feel for the gameplay going forward. This is where I'm going to have to stress that opinions in this regard will vary. The gameplay of SPACE MARINE feels very much like a cross between GEARS OF WAR and DYNASTY WARRIORS, in that you're either running and gunning, or hacking through waves of Orks with whichever melee weapon suits you.Playing through SPACE MARINE is not a very deep experience. There's no cover system (\"Cover is for the Weak\"), no way to get the drop on your enemies or flank them, and while there is a sufficient amount of weapons, managing them can become a pain. So you're left sorta blasting or hacking your way through a thousand enemies across very linear levels. This means that unless you'd like to play through the story again, there's not that much of a reason to return to the campaign. The variety just isn't there, and neither is story mode co-op in any form.So... why the four stars? While it's unfortunate that the gameplay doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table, it's the story, level design, atmosphere, and fierce commitment to the WARHAMMER 40K setting that elevate SPACE MARINE well above its faults. The campaign is simply an exciting thing to play through. Whether you're bringing down an Ork attack ship, defending a squadron of Imperial Valkyries (from Orks riding rockets), or clearing your way to a factory so huge that it practically takes up one of the planet's hemispheres - SPACE MARINE always found a new way to keep me engaged. Sometimes I kept on playing just to check out more of the Forge World, since each level is typically gigantic in scale with lots to see.The multiplayer is also an added bonus, though it lacks an abundance of game modes. The game also requires a product code of some kind that comes with new copies of the game, so if you're thinking of buying the game used, you'll only be able to progress five levels in multiplayer without paying a bit more.SPACE MARINE succeeds in delivering what it set out to do. The campaign is exhilarating and, at times, awe-inspiring, thanks to the scale and masterful level design. It's a shame that all the work that went into the design, writing, and lore didn't transfer well to the gameplay, though it works well enough to get you through to the ending. I think with a few more twists on the gameplay, a deeper focus on the story than destroying a thousand Orks, and maybe even an RPG element (since we're working with an RPG property and all), W40K: SPACE MARINE could've been a game to compete with GEARS OF WAR. But as it stands, this is a game where you can see the developers' enthusiasm for the W40K property throughout.While a fine game in its own right, it's also a great steppingstone into the WARHAMMER 40K universe for the uninitiated. Now I have to figure out what all the fuss about thisEisenhornfellow is about.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2011"}

Minecraft is an awesome game that the whole family can enjoy. There's problem solving, and creativity, and just plain silliness stretched out across this blocky playground that may well remind you of those early days of gaming.As much as my son enjoys the ipod version because he can take it on the road, there's no denying what a console version of Minecraft brings to the table. First and foremost, you can enjoy a much more expansive take on the world. Its just so cool to see all of these blocks stacked, broken down, and rearranged to create everything from axes to castles on the big screen. The multiplayer aspect also allows you to play with your friends just like the good old days when you would spread wooden blocks out on the floor and build together.There are still some things that just make my adult brain twitch just a bit. Things like chopping a tree down from the bottom up and having the leaves just float in the sky. And islands can float in the sky, too - complete with animals that 'spawn' on them. Its just one of those things that makes Minecraft so wierd and fun.

{"product_name":"B0050SWUTQ","description":"","summary":"Great but with Gripes","reviewText":"I'm a huge fan of the Dead Space series, so I was eagerly anticipating this release.  For the most part, the game is very good.  It's also very reminiscent of the first two games in style and tone with a feel for John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" thrown into the mmix.  What I DID NOT like about Dead Space 3 had mostly to do with the new bench/weapon construction system.  I found the construction of new weapons to be nothing but tedious and unnecessary and really not explained well at all.  For the most part I fiddled around with it, groaned that they felt they had to \"fix\" something that wasn't broken and used the old stand by guns that I loved from the first two games and mostly ignored it.  This new weapon construction business did NOTHING for me but irritate.  I miss the old way where you could upgrade in an intuitive manner and know when your weapons were at their absolute peak.  Playing the game this way just feels tacked on and takes away from the experience rather than adding to it.  I've got necromorphs to kill why would I want to spend my time jerking around fiddling with weapon construction?  My second gripe was why only two weapons?  The first two games allowed you to hold four weapons at a time.  In DS3 you can only have two.  What if you run into a boss and all you've got is a shotgun and a ripper-Two weapons not necessarily suited for fighting these bosses.  You can't go back to the bench and you're stuck with limited choices.  Why was the ability to carry four weapons so terrible they had to remove that feature?  It just makes the game a little less fun and more aggravating.  I played the game back to back the second time using new game plus.  The first time was very aggravating with just a ridiculous amount of necropmorphs and variations there of absolutely onslaughting you all at once to the point of ridiculousness.  Several times I asked myself \"are they freakin' kidding me?\"  Needless to say, being able to carry over your powered up weapons into a new game made the second play through MUCH more enjoyable.  My suggestion if you want to save some headache is to play thegame without doing any of the side missions, when you finish, play a new game with new game plus to take on the side missions during your campaign.  It's much less frustrating being a little more powerful.  Over all, Dead Space 3 is a great game, but I hate it that they felt they had to change the formula for no good reason.  If something isn't broken don't fix it.  (And it definitely wasn't broken)  It just doesn't make sense to me making changes that simply just detract from the game.  Dead Space 3 is still better than most of the games out there, but compared to the first two, it's easily my least favorite of the series.  Please, for Dead Space 4, bring back the nodes and easy to understand weapon upgrades.  No more pointless bench weapon construction please.  Oh, and give us back those other two gun slots.  The tracking robots are stupid and pointless.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000FPOJOS","reviewerName":"Chris Longhurst","summary":"Different console. Same problems.","reviewText":"Right up front, I'll point out the three most obvious things about GT5 Prologue.1. It looks gorgeous2. The AI is abominable.3. There is still no car damage.To use a lovely english expression : it's all mouth and no trousers. Look past the HD graphics and hype and you'll find Gran Turismo 1 lurking here.The Gran Turismo games are known for their accurate car handling and fantastic graphics, and GT5 Prologue is no exception. The problem is that it is all absolutely ruined by the other driver AI. Previous Gran Turismo titles have never exactly shone when it comes to the AI, but in GT5 it's simply non-existent. It's not that the AI is dumb, it's just not there. The other cars all drive on rails, irrespective of where you are. For example, on the High Speed Ring circuit - there's a challenge to get from the back of the pack to the front in a single lap. In the car they give you, it is 100% impossible to come any higher than 3rd, and that's a stretch. The driving-on-rails is so accurate and predictable that you can actually predict exactly where every car will be at any given point. You'll come up behind the Ford Focus at the end of the second turn, and don't even think about passing him on the outside because he will always jink to the left for no reason as he goes across the bridge. If you're in the way, then tough. The game will just force you off the track. At the next corner, the Mazda 6 will always follow the identical line inside the corner, again irrespective of whether you're there.The same is true in the other types of race. Within minutes of playing this game, you will find yourself making a tidy corner only to have a much faster car come right up behind you and ram you off the track because you're in the way of it's pre-programmed line. To see how truly awful it is, start a race at the back and watch the 15 cars in front of you. They'll all cut the same corner in the same way, every lap, all with the identical puff of dirt as they do it.It is simply abominable.The problem is that this issue was solved long ago by the likes of - well - just about every other racing franchise out there. It's compounded by the fact that there is still no car damage or dirt in GT5. You can stuff any car into a concrete armco at 175mph and it will simply bounce off without so much as a scratch. To think that Polyphony could put out a game with no car damage and ruinous AI on a next-gen console in 2008 just boggles the mind given how accomplished the competition is (think: Project Gotham Racing).So what about the eye-candy aspect? Well - it runs at 1080p (full HD) and it looks absolutely spectacular. The textures are crisp and don't blur out at highly obtuse angles like they would on an X-Box. The car models are beautiful as are the various effects like the real-time reflections and the colour-flip paint jobs. There is some aliasing on high-contrast areas but detail popup is minimal. There are very noticable level-of-detail swaps on some of the cars where they swap from a low detail to a high detail version. It's most noticable on the Daytona circuit where you'll occasionally see the shading on the back of a car pop noticably as the model swaps to it's higher resolution version. In fact the eye-candy aspect is only marred slightly be the fact that the game clearly doesn't run at 60 frames per second. Well - it does on sparsely populated tracks but in the thick of the action on some circuits, you'll see noticable slowdown which you just shouldn't have on a console as powerful as a PS3.What other things to know about? Well the online aspect of the game has a lot of promise but it's buggy at best. If your PS3 isn't set up pefectly on a broadband network (NAT type 1) it just won't connect to the servers. If you're lucky enough to have a good setup, then even when it does connect, the racing is a bit dodgy. It's obvious that the sample rate for your system communicating with all the others is fairly slow as you'll often see your opponents cars jump across the circuit from one side to the other, or suddenly appear to brake or accelerate at light speed as the servers catch up.When you come to use the game for the first time, be prepared for a long wait. It seems to copy the entire blu-ray disc on to the internal hard drive which takes a good 15 minutes, then as soon as you connect, it will download a huge update which will take 5 to 10 minutes to download and another 5 minutes to install. So out-of-the-box to first race is about 30 minutes. That seems a bit odd to me - I was entirely expecting the game to run off the disc like many of the other PS3 titles.So GT5 Prologue : it's great eye-candy, sure. But the two biggest, most long-standing problems with the GT franchise are still present. Awful AI and no car damage. The press previews and talk from Polyphony indicate that the full game will have car damage, but historically, they've never been known to change their underlying game engines between the 'Prologue' and the full versions of GT. They have always claimed that they've fixed the AI with each successive version of the game, but honestly - GT5 Prologue has taken a massive step backwards. They say it's better than ever but it's actually worse than ever. So when they say there will be car damage in the full game, I say 'cry wolf' I'm afraid.It's an ominous omen for GT5 later this year. Sure it'll have more cars and more tracks. But chances are it will have the same problems the GT franchise has always had, and that's simply not good enough. Couple that with the questionable frame rate and online problems and that could be disastrous.I dearly love the GT  franchise - I've had every one of them and I've been hoping and praying that they would one day fix the AI problems and the lack of car damage. If they've not done it on the PS3, then it's just never going to happen, and that is a sad indictment of Polyphony's marketing strategy. I've played this game a lot, desperately wanting to like it but I always put the controller down and am left with an empty feeling. It's just not exciting.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2008"}

It reminded me of the sky of the original UNREAL, another visually ground-breaking game at its time. PURE VISUAL MAGIC!The character (Geralt) can master both sword-fighting and magic spells (what is known as a Warlock). To some die-hard RPG fans this may seem like heresy, nevertheless, keep in mind that multi-classing is not unheard off. The movement repertoire for both practices are impressively designed. Especially the sword-fighting, it is at par to any console action game. And the spells (both offensive and defensive ones) are not less impressive.Free roaming? Yes and no. One can decide which parts of the map he will visit but loading is still needed to travel even annoyingly short distances. And since quests and side-quest still have to be completed, yes, eventually a subtle, yet ever present, directionality is present.Looting and bartering? Aaah...yes, sort of. You practically never change the sword you start off with (although you do get to improve its abilities), whereas good armor is only a little easier to come by compared to PLANESCAPE. On the upside, you get to gamble, have romantic relationships (FABLE was full of great ideas after all!) and bribe for information, so trinkets have other uses as well.Detailed character modifiers? Nothing like the AD&D; rules. You gain talents (gold, silver & bronze) which you can spend to improve your fighting or magical abilities. Pretty much like the DIABLO or the TITAN QUEST abilities systems.So, apart for the slight action-cRPG handicap, I have only two other objections. First, the...camera placement. Once more the atrocious Aurora Engine (remember NWN2...?) will keep auto-placing it where it is bound to get on your nerves - as it targets your character even if that is not the most logical option. Yes, this has indeed improved compared to the original but one cannot teach an old dog new tricks.Second, the controls. They need getting used to as the fighting combos are still easily ruined by clicking out of sync. You do eventually get the hold of it, however it keeps glitching.Nevertheless, its shortcomings are not enough to diminish the breath of fresh air this release brings to the scene. The Enhanced edition not only is a truly reworked game but it also comes full with detailed Manuals, beautiful Maps and all the extras that games used to come with in the good old days...Whereas the BALDUR's GATES saga was story-heavy but (by today standards) visually wanting and the NEVERWINTER NIGHTS series was found, well, wanting in all aspects, THE WITCHER is the dream cRPG that BIOWARE was supposed to be capable of releasing all along but never did - and its current EA bedfellows surely put a stop to such aspirations now. That game, however, is finally here - and not from whom you would expect.A tip of my hat to CDPROJECT for keeping the ART-FORM of Gaming alive. Well done indeed!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"Jason \"&#51228;&#51060;&#49832;\"","summary":"Wait till the Game of the Year Edition","reviewText":"Update # 2:i was wrong about the DLC,  they are going to add the extra ending for the game, the director of the game stated that the Be Continued at the end is for the Lightning, Snow and Sazh story DLC.  they are all in production currently.  That in mind I'd recommend to wait till this game is released as a 'Game of the Year Edition' and you actually get the full game. Then it might be worth $60 till then it's still not worth over $30.I've have gotten all the fragments 160 and the Platinum Trophy, leveled up my character to max and ran out of things to do.  It took just under 70 hours. I will say 5+ hours of my game play were in the casino serendipity.  to get the most annoying fragment possible 'Lucky Coin.' You have to win 7,777 in the slot machine.  to do this i taped my remote's L1 button to auto play and i watched a few movies, switch my TV back and i had the fragment.And yes i was right there are 160 fragments which means 160 things to do in this game, about 40 of them are from the main mission, with about 120 coming from random \"side quest\".I liked the post game much more then the actual game, mostly because i just went around beating up monsters, instead of trying to pretend this game had a good story.  also there aren't any puzzle quest at the end.  a very nice plus.RECOMMONDATION:  Wait till the 'Game of the Year Edition' comes out or get this game for dirt cheap.Update:  I just beat the game 35 hours with 98/160 fragments found.  And i'd agree with myself the game is just a ton of filler with a little bit of interesting story.  that said when the story really starts to swing, at about 25 hours of game play, its really fun. Basically the last two levels after all the middle junk.Funny thing, in FFXIII the first 20 hours were all story and no game play, this game is all game play and no story.  guess they took everyone option way to seriously.And i want to stop all the people saying this game is lacking an ending, it has one,  there's a final showdown between the hereos and the boss and it's epic.  think The Two Towers or Empire Stikes Back.  they have endings, but they also lead to a much bigger story.Also the DLC with lighting is not an extra ending, its simply the areana, and you get to use her as one of your monster.  pretty lame actually.I want to move my rating up from a 3 to a 4 star review but i paid $60 and this games not worth that much.  at best it's worth $30+shipping and if your a total nerd like me you already have it. hope you got the $20 promotionOriganal review remain below.  It was written after 5 hours of grinding and a really anoying set of puzzles.  i really hate the puzzles in this game!This game really feels like a 10 hour maybe game stretched out to be a 40 hour game, with then a huge amount fetch quest to add it up to a 60 hour game.  there is so much filler.Story:  When this game was announced it was rumored that FFXIII was actually cut short and this is the part that was cut out.  well if thats true, there a good reason they cut it out.  this story really has nothing to do with FFXIII.  Whenever you travel to a new time zone, your instantly informed of all the issues in the area.  you never get to go and figure stuff out which usually is simply some paradox that Dr. Who hasn't solved yet.Combat:  It's faster, that is true, and capturing monsters is actually a lot more fun then i thought it would be.  That said, because the the battle are random now, they way easier.  Just set up a commando group and press X and you'll get 5 stars. in 13 it was about getting the monster stagger as fast as possible to get the kill.  now unless it a boss, there really isn't any reason. also the encounter level is so high, i over leveled massively.  That said, if you played 13 then you'll realize that all the monster are the same from 13, with little changes, often a color change, besides for the bosses.  they usually new.World:  Think Mass Effect 2, with time travel instead of space travel. That and the same level repeats over and over with a simple zone change.  and when you change time zones, the item some how remain in the same exact places.  making it seem like a waste to even go back.  but no, there will be some random quest item stashed away in the same exact level you've already been to.Graphic:  Averagely as good as the FFXIII.  But there are parts that totally feel like a 720p up converted, but the nice finished vid that are the Hallmark of Final Fantasy games are almost nonexistent in the game.Side Quest:  Honestly through out the game i just did stuff.  most of the time after a bit of going, I'd realize i was side questing, and it's because side quest and the main story quest look exactly the same.  All you do is fetch quest, and some monster killing.  But a ton of fetch quest.  they get a bit boring.  oh, but the game has 160 fragments to find, and well ever time you do a side quest you get a fragment, so it's pretty safe to assume to there are about 125+ side quest in the game to finish.  you also get fragments randomly when your doing the story, usually after you kill a boss.  I got bored and haven't finished all of them yet, not even close.The puzzles and casino in the game feel like nothing more then waste of time. Also when you get to the casino your told that you need to get the DLC to play some of the card games.  So there's really only slots, or chocobo racing.  which both really aren't any fun.Pros:When the combats difficult it a lot of fun.Graphics when they make the 1080p PS3 shine.Voice Actinglots of looking for stuff, if you care to find stuff.Cons:StoryPuzzlesLot's of looking for stuff you if you don't like finding stuff.  (i personally don't, so i found it tiresome)FillerCasino is boring, unless you like slots or watching your chocobo loose.Conclusion: I feel like i played this game because i paid $60 for it.  if i paid $30 or less for it, I'd probably would have stopped after the first clock puzzle and felt like it was money worth spent.  I loved 13 so this game has been a pretty big disappointment.  good thing i got the $20 Amazon promotion with it.  makes it feel a little bit better.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2012"}

The towns are horrible you can't even enter a single house or building and there's hardly any NPCs in the towns that have something interesting and unique to say. Most have basic info on what's going on in the story and where you should go next and others offer basic sidequests. There's no NPCs with their own dreams and ambitions and their own thoughts and feelings. I began to get bored of noel and serah after the first 10hrs or so, the game is very linear compared to other true rpgs, but there is only one open area to explore -Archlytte Steppe- but all the other maps are interconnected corridors with some big spaces inbetween them and the academia is a deceiving location. Upon arrival, it looks like an epic scale town, but in reality it's only a quarter the size of a town in the first Assassin's Creed. Also, as with the other towns, you can not enter any houses, shops or buildings, also the music is forgettable, will return this game as soon as im done writing this review.Don't hate me, hate soft square, i mean square enix :)","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2012"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Craig Moller","summary":"Better than RE4?, well...","reviewText":"RE4 was a staggering reboot for the ailing franchise; Res Evil's traditionally clunky controls were discarded and scaled back the puzzles in favour of rapid-fire action against far faster and more aggressive enemies than ever before, all wrapped up in amazingly detailed visuals. More than just being the pinnacle of the RE franchise, many people consider RE4 as being among a small handful of the best titles created for the last generation. RE5 has a handful of problems, and is nowhere near in the same league as RE4 in terms of all-time classics, but it does provide a suitably similar mix of exciting action, along with some utterly gorgeous visuals.Two-player co-op can be played either online, over system link or split-screen. It's great to see Capcom supporting such a wide range of options for the co-op mode. While the general exploration and blasting of monsters plays out very similarly to RE4, the environments have been expanded a little, with many more split paths to give each player enough elbow room to fight. There are some great moments where one player can stun an enemy with a headshot, while the other rushes in and smashes them with a melee attack. It's even possible to link melee attacks together, so one player's punch will send an enemy stumbling back, then the other player's kick knocks them to the ground.RE5 also adds a minor improvement to the movement controls. RE4's quasi twin-stick movement has been upgraded to today's standard twin-stick 'turning while walking' control system. For some odd reason though, turning with the right stick is disable when you're running. As you'd expect though, your feet are still nailed to the floor while shooting, to retain the usual Res Evil tension. As you've probably gathered, RE5 mirrors the gameplay of RE4 very closely, but this can be both a blessing and a curse. As in RE4 you'll spend the bulk of your time dispatching monsters and scouring the environments for ammo and treasure. You still collect treasure from corpses, cupboards, crates and by shooting it off walls. You still spend it on upgrading the same damage, reload speed and capacity characteristics of a very similar range of pistols, shotguns and machineguns. You're still forced to waste a lot of cash upgrading early weapons, only to have to sell them back for a fraction of the price when the better weapons are unlocked.In lots of ways it's a good thing that RE5 sticks closely to RE4's brilliant template, but in other ways it's a shame it's progressed so little. A lot has happened in the games industry over the past four years and RE5 does feel dated as a result. It sure doesn't look dated, because the graphics look incredible, but it feels old. Other than the co-op mode and a couple of very minor tweaks here and there, the gameplay is identical to 2005's RE4.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2009"}

After 6 months, I totally regret the experienced as well as the anticipation for this game.Here is the pros;1. Graphics are the best in video games period.2. Music is stellar, but pop or more popular tracks are rare.3. Loading time is excellent with the exception of the installation and beginning of the game.CONS;1. Cover system is weak.  When trying to cover from enemies, occasionally you end up lean towards the wrong cover.2. Driving is laughable in a bad way.  I understand the realizism their trying to create, but driving 7 mph doesn't NOT cause a vehicle to fishtail or achieve a reverse 180 degree turn.  What? Is this Liberty City's streets covered in butter.(Rockstar won't fix that is a problem)1. The whole loading/saving procedure is annoying and tiresome.  I'm playing and I don't need to spend 7 minutes to get to a saving/loading area.2. Respawning vehicles was annoying in GTA: San Andreas and it's very annoying here.  Mercenaries(Glitch-o-mania) and Far Cry 2 have fix this problem, but Rockstar seem to think that it's fun for players to have cop cars and others to magically appear when, at first glance, looked like a clear road.3. Driving.This game is worth renting.  Wait until the price gets closer to $40 dollars than its worth purchasing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2009"}

With rich palettes of colour, eight four level worlds, spot-on play control, and expert level design, SMB was a much longer game than most of Atari's products and was a game unlike any other at that time. SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire. It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept. Also, it's one of the best. Without SMB, NES wouldn't have been nearly as big a hit in the beginning. \n\nIn the end, Nintendo came at the industry's key moment. With a powerful new console (for that time) and a very well-designed game, Nintendo resurrected video gaming.

However, the NES would soon prove to be the most revolutionary video game system of all time, thanks to a slew of quality first party games that would have overaching legacies, and possibly the best third party support until the release of Sony's original Playstation.  There are so many great games that were made for the NES, and it's simply designed controlers and the Zapper Light Gun prepheril were ahead of their time.  Younger gamers today more used to the unbelievable graphics of the XBox or PS2 will balk at the simplistic 8-bit presentation of the NES, but for the rest of us who owned an NES during our childhood will remember just how revolutionary and amazing it was in it's day.

Whether it be talking to Jonah, shooting picture, or whatever.  But you must always obtain hero points.  The sad thing is, there are only about 4 scenerios to earn hero points: get a guy to a hospital, stop a car chase, catch a guy before he falls off a building, and stop an armed robbery. Umm....after 8 hours couldn't there be more to it than just this?  The further you are in the game, the more hero points you need to get the next chapter.  I'm at a point now where you need 3000 hero points, well the actual encounters with the bad guys can earn you about 200 a clip.  That's just too many trips to make this game fun.As I said earlier, the graphics are great and the physics are good.

Probably too many hours, because the game is extremely addictive, and filled with RPG busy work. My biggest problem with the game, is that ultimately there isn't too much of a story. Essentially, the whole story is that you get shot in the head delivering a \"Chip,\" and after you need to get revenge, and then survive or join an attack by the faux-Roman army. It's really cool that you can accomplish this however you want, in fact at times I'd save the game and just kill everyone to see if I could actually do it(yes you can although everyone will hate you). I just wish there was more of a story, or more of a reason to join with the factions. In the end I just made myself the master of New Vegas, because I found faults with everyone else. Ultimately I played the way I wanted to play, but I just wanted more of a reason to play other than grinding for higher levels. The game just felt like a series of side missions, some cooler than others, but none of them felt like big important scripted main story missions. Also, there are some crafting and weapon upgrading systems, but I generally found them lacking. The new true iron sights are nice, but ultimately the shooting system is lesser than other modern FPS. The feel of the guns are weak, the sensitivity is off and there's no way to adjust it, and the aim assist is either non-existent or poorly made. In the end the iron sights just give you a slightly more accurate way to shoot enemies once you run out of AP. There are some glitches in the game, the worst one being that the game freezes pretty often. These are hard freezes where you have to get up and turn off your system, which sucks for a fat guy. :) These freezes usually occurred when the game was auto-saving, or more often when one of your companions killed something and the slow motion camera popped up to show them dying. These freezes happened a bit to often, and were pretty annoying, although with the save system you have it's possible to save very often so if you're careful you usually didn't lose too much.Ultimately though, despite all of its faults, I had a lot of fun playing the game. At its current cheap price, you can get a lot of hours of entertainment out of this game. If you have a decent amount of freetime and you don't mind fetch quests and grinding, you'll probably really enjoy this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0016PZYLS","reviewerName":"Caleb Williams","summary":"This... Is... AWESOME!!!!","reviewText":"Yes, it's that good. I got this game this morning and I noticed a few tweaks to the whole thing, some good, some bad. One of the good points of this game is that they have included air play. You know, planes, army helicopters and such. That's pretty cool. Oh and the large number of random things to do is also heavily great. You can play a game called trail blazing which is a game where you're set on fire and have to ride on a quad and hit as many people and cars as you can. Also a game called crowd control is pretty cool, you're a body guard for a famous celebrity and have to get rid of the crazy fans. How do you do this? Pick them up and throw them over a cliff.So the story is set a few years in the future (I'm not sure exactly how many, I haven't gotten that far) and you are in a prison hospital and have just woken out of a coma. This is where you enter into the character customisation which is quite dense. I chose a terrible cockney accent for the voice and haven't gotten around to changing it. Word to the wise, don't choose this voice, I think it was voice number 3. You should check.Being a few years later, you find that the Saints are no more and Stillwater has been taken over by a new law known as Ultor who have given it a completely new skyline. Now you and Jonny Gat must re-unite and get the Saints back in the ruling position they once had.Well I guess the only game comparison that can be made is to GTA 4, but honestly this game has so much over GTA. GTA has the reality factor whereas Saints Row 2 has the fun factor and that in my eyes places it above GTA. There is simply so much to do, not just in the leisure activities but there are a lot of things you can find and do that isn't even labelled on the map. That in my eyes makes this game that much more fun. Not only to find the hidden games and general secrets, but just giving you something to do aside from the initial missions. I've also hears there are a ton of easter eggs to be discovered at your leisure including a Merman and a mysterious \"Cabbit\"I have yet to try the co-op plays and stuff like that so can't really touch on it. I will update my review once I have experienced these different things.The graphics are a bit crummy, but in all honesty I would trade graphics for a dense game with a hell of a lot to do any day.

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story.

However it suffers from some of the same bad design decisions that Mass Effect 1 and Dragon Age had along with in some cases instead of fixing the problems from the previous game, just scrapping the idea all together.One of the first things I noticed was it was much less like an RPG than the previous game.  While there is some customization with limited abilities and looks, you do not get much of a choice with any of the equipment and to make matters worse you get even LESS of a choice for your squad mates as you can not touch their armor or appearance at all.  The only saving grace here was at least you could allocate their level up points as you wish.  There is none of the standard RPG elements for how you equip your character, set up stats, expanded ability options, detailed information on equipment or even having a selection of equipment.While the first game had an awful inventory system with way too many weapon makers, this game throws all of that away and basically gets rid of equipment all together.  Instead of getting new weapons, you get upgrades for the equipment you have.  In some cases you do get new weapons but they are very rare and cannot be traded in for cash.  Even with most of the upgrades, they are just upping damage o protection which is kind of like getting new equipment but it's not the same.The Characters each were fantastic.  Each had a really well thought out personality and background.  Some characters I enjoyed more than others but each was just great.  Since the game centers more on them than anything else, this aspect was really important.The story was really tight.  As things progressed it got better and better in how it really tied things from the previous games together giving the player a much deeper understanding of what is really going on in that world.  The level of detail they went into to create an entire universe rich with various cultures and histories makes Mass Effect 2 shine.However while the story was great, the game centered around collecting a team and pretty much most of the missions in the game are all about getting your crew and keeping them happy.  It would have been really nice to break it up and have done more things leading up to preparing for the final mission instead of crew hunting.  Some characters in particular are not available until very late in the game, which really limited my time with them since you have a very limited number of possible fight encounters.No respawning of bad guys is a recent trend from Bioware titles which lack the ability for random fight encounters and exploring.  In Mass Effect 1 & 2 along with Dragon Age, players have a set limit to how many possible fights you can ever get into and the areas you can explore are very restricted.  Once you take out the bad guys, they never come back.  This not only limits your experience but also is a huge limit on your resources like money.  That means you can never skip over any money or item and must ensure you always get the best deal when you buy something in a store.  Plus it also ensures some characters just never get much use, especially with such a limited number of player slots.With Exploring in ME1 the Mako was horrible we all know.  Again much like the inventory system, they just totally scrap the idea and left it out instead of fixing the problems.  Exploring open worlds is a lot of fun and would give the game a more open ended feel to it and allow things to drag out much longer if we wanted.  Fallout 3 while not perfect is a great example of how much fun an open world can be with never a shortage of bad guys to fight.  With space combat the possibilities are unlimited either being in the ship or exploring a new planet.  I had really hoped to see some ship to ship fighting with the player in control making decisions on how to attack and perhaps even boarding the other ship in search of loot but we cant have everything I guess.Speaking of Planets... scanning!  Another great idea that does not get done right... and judging from how Bioware works, instead of fixing it they will just scrap it in ME3.  The idea to pull resources out was great but all the probes and such was just a huge pain in the butt.  You had to spend tons of time just scanning over all these planets hoping to find resources.  If you even look at the planet it was then marked on your map and if you did not get the resources then, you have no way to know you did not get them out.  What they should have done is have less planets with each having a set number of resources and allowing the scanning to hunt for the major deposit only on the plant much like searching for an anomaly.  Once you find the sweet spot, you should be done with that resource on that planet.  Instead this mini game took up almost as much time as the rest of the game and at a certain point became useless as you had way more elements than needed and could not sell them or do anything with them.Graphically the ship, the planets, characters, and just everything was just really well done and detailed.  The detail on each of the characters was stunning.  You could see the grit on many things and small details like scratches and bumps.  I was especially impressed during a few of the levels where the environment comes to life like in zero gravity settings or where there was some fog floating around.  Those kinds of details really immersed me more in the fun of the game.The fighting was more FPS style and I believe the comparisons to Gears of War are accurate.  It's all about using cover and attacking from around it.  I was really happy to see some elevated cover settings in the game to give you more tactical options.  Combine that with being able to tell my squad members where to stand was great.  Many times I would spread my team out for a big bad guy and attack from 3 positions so they could only focus on one of us at a time.Overall I really enjoyed the game.  I felt it was good but could have been epic if they had done a few things differently.  Hopefully they do not scrap the things people complain about this time and instead fix them along with the things they scrapped from ME1 for ME3.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"Riyad Kalla","summary":"Decent Fun for Gamers Interested in DJ'ing, Not for Mainstream","reviewText":"Summary [7 out of 10]============================A technically challenging game that will likely only appeal to gamers that have a genuine interest in DJ'ing. DJ Hero lacks the 'campy fun' that you experience when someone thrusts a plastic guitar in your hand or sits you down infront of some plastic drums in Rock Band -- DJ Hero simulates an experience that very few of us know exist and even less of us want to try. But for the few that *are* interested, it does it quite well. I put together a short video review here for visual example of playing the game: [...]Controller============================A fairly complex controller that takes up a decent amount of table-top space to play on. The controller is split into two sides -- the left side includes your standard Xbox 360 (or PS3) controller buttons, a effects adjustment wheel and slider paddle. The right side of the controller is the turntable (aka 'record') you will use to mix.The wheel itself feels solid and very well balanced and just a hair on the heavy side -- you only notice this on harder difficulty levels when you are trying to wikki-scratch very quickly.The fade slider feels cheap and doesn't provide a solid sticking point in the middle position -- so when the game is indicating you need to fade from LEFT channel to BOTH channels (so back to center), and you flip that slider from one side to the center, you'll likely overshoot the center and slide it into the \"RIGHT channel only\" position.As someone that wasn't that great at the game, this didn't bother me too much, but if you are going for a perfect score on Hard and really want to be excellent at this, it could prove elusive.If I had to put a general tag on the build quality of the controller, I would say \"decent\", if the turn table itself wasn't balanced so well and felt a hair more plastic-ey, I would have said it felt \"cheap\".It's lacking any sort of flashy styling and does look sort of drab, like they rushed the controller out once they got it functionally working. Given the risk behind this IP, I can't blame them for not taking time to style it out like some of the fancier Rock Band guitars or drums.Gameplay============================The actual enjoyment I got from scratching at the turn table, hitting the timed colored buttons on it and fading from LEFT to RIGHT was *a hair* more enjoyable than playing a fake plastic guitar during Rock Band or Guitar Hero. The music itself just makes you want to get up and dance and the way the music and pattern matching is done, you *really* feel like you are mixing up a storm. Unlike games like Rock Band where you will play a song on Easy or Medium, and what you are actually pushing on the guitar feels nothing like the song you are watching yourself play on the television. That disappears in Rock Band as you crank the difficulty up to Hard or Expert -- then you REALLY feel like you are playing the song, but for some of us that's not an option because we don't have fingers that can dance like maniacs across a plastic instrument.In DJ Hero even on Medium difficulty I felt pretty cool right off the bat, doing my wikki-scratch business and bopping to the music a bit as I went.I did try and Hard, you can see that here: [...]-- and it was a total disaster. I just couldn't coordinate the visual insanity that were the prompts on the screen with the 6 different kinds of input that are on the controller. I'm sure plenty of folks would be able to, I'm just not one of them.I also think that is where this game fails, it's not accessible enough. It's a very hard core game for hard-core folks that know what turn tables are for. There is no way I could sit my 8 year old cousin down infront of this or give this to my mom and say \"Ok let's play some music!\" -- that is one of the things that a Guitar Hero or Rock Band have going for them -- everyone knows what a guitar or drums are for.Band Experience============================Believe it or not you can actually play this game with a guitar controller and 1 other person. I was unable to test this, but I thought that was a pretty nice addition. You aren't going to get a drummer in here or a vocalist, so the game is really designed to be a single player or single+1 experience compared to a 4-player Band experience that some other games have perfected.Conclusion [7.0 out of 10]============================DJ Hero is proof that you can't just take any aspect of the music industry and turn it into a game. DJ'ing is an inherently complex and inaccessible profession and turning that into a game unfortunately leaves you with a fairly hardcore experience that not a lot of people will find appealing -- unless they are genuinely interested in DJ'ing.The actual execution of the game and track list were very solid and the experience, while complex at times, was genuinely enjoyable. I don't think this will sell to the mass market, but if you want to dabble in a DJ'ing experience, this will surely give you some hours of fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2009"}

{"product_name":"B004CVWETI","description":"","reviewerName":"Marcos \"proletariat\"","summary":"Original, fantastic","reviewText":"I'm putting up this DRAFT of my review, hence some repetition and over saturation of ideas. A final edit will be posted:An absolute original modern masterpiece of gaming development, and an incredible story that rivals even the written word and even cinema, even though cut scenes are written dialogue (so much development in this game, its likely that memory wise they couldnt fit live cut scenes, but it doesnt need it). One of the most fantastic RPGs ever made - definitely belongs in the top 10 rpgs of all time, and on a personal note, this is probably in my top 3, and I've played a lot of RPGs, perhaps thousands, beginning with Atari and then on every mainstream and less popular console there is including handhelds and PC. And as far as Atlus goes, this may be their number one.The story is truly compelling - as a writer with a degree in film I expect a lot more in terms of storyline in my games, which are 99% rpgs. This game is one that actually has me wondering what some of the character's intentions are and how the complex plotline (timelines) will thread out instead of me knowing the formula. Of course it has its predictabilities from the beginning - you know who the wolf in sheep's clothing is from the start if you've ever read a book, etc., but as I play I'm experiencing more than just going through the motions of saving the world (which actually does happen to be your ultimate goal just like in 99% of other RPG plotlines, but Radiant Historia manages to frame it beautifully with many different plot devices - the main plot and gaming device being time travel which can often be a huge failure - and is in many games - but Radiant Historia is a brilliant exception thanks to what had to be an incredible chemistry between the developers and the writers of the game). As I said, I'm playing the game and actually enjoying the story instead of always knowing exactly what will follow - i.e. it holds the \"illusion of reality\" even for an experienced reader, and its themes run deep. Back story is gradually given to the large gammit of many different characters, and through their personality, interactions, etc. you grow to care deeply about many of them, more than I have experienced in ANY other game, and there is true, excellent character depth and development throughout the long length of the game.A massive game with massive length, side quests, and the very originally, well devised device of 2 timelines (with \"nodes\" to travel back and forth to) which is wonderful gaming mechanics and for the plot, on top of well designed world and regional maps, battle that is a crossover/hybrid of strategy grid and turn base, excellent menu system, decent graphics for DS, and a fantastic storyline and character development:SOME SPOILERS AND REPEATS (ROUGH DRAFT): The many plotline layers alone aside from the complex but seemlessly devised gameplay mechanics run very deep... Being the chosen one to avoid the end of the world is normally a very cliche plotline, however, in this game the story really holds its own - The story even goes so far as to teach younger players how politics and class struggles and war REALLY work.... desertification caused by land defilement and other mysterious forces at work such as the destruction of mana that flows through all life (more later) is causing land and resources to be scarce, hence war. Albeit the antagonist country is slightly atypically \"evil\" there are plenty of interesting and evolved dirty politics, such as the seemingly \"just\" country that you originally are a special intelligence agent for is just as corrupted and in cahoots with the other to serve the ruling class that dialogue makes evident cannot be conquered through mere assasinations but with revealment of truth and changing the consciousness of the people to destroy the institution, as they too can be replaced, tyranny disguised as democracy, demonization of the rebellion, religion used for corruption, puppet rulers, the clever use of ploys and tactics by governments working in cahoots to create an illusion of evil for the justification of war through love of country to win populous and soldier's support, a farce set up by both sides higher ruling classes together, and thus use tactics to control and earn the people and soldiers trust only to serve their own ruling class interests (if you never knew what war was really all about throughout the history of the world, this game will begin to teach it to you - on a brief side note, everyone in the world should watch the Gore Vidal documentary \"Why We Fight\")... government is really just the dividing up of resources and control of labor and currency according to the ruling class agenda. There is of course your \"neutral country\" thrown into the mix in complex ways, religion is also used (e.g. to both sedate and rally the populous) but not to the point of overkill, and their is the element of \"mana\" which is a borrowed influence from older RPGs - it is the spiritual energy that which allows all life and whose destruction is also a cause for desertification... a mysterious \"sand plague\" causing man to turn to sand... the game is certainly commentary on the real world, such as the defilement of the land via war and excess, and, as I mentioned before, the entire history of man and how war and power REALLY works throughout HISTORY or in this case HISTORIA. Other spiritual elements are that of \"historia,\" the white and black \"chronicles\" that allow Stocke the main character and another character that is unkown until later to flow through time on a standard and alternate timeline that affect one another... more coming... and a ritual that must be performed to balance the mana and stop the desertification by a chosen one originally from the ruling class that defects to do the right thing, unlike her late father whose power over the ritual caused his own ego to spiral and corrupt him to the point where he executed her brother who was winning the love of the people. It has many adult themes that run deep outside of the war and politics and the evil \"Brave new world order,\" such as an alcoholic/addicted soldier who's comrade said he was \"shaking\" before battle (DTs), mercenaries, beforementioned complexities of war, etc. etc. etc much more... the only non-realistic element is blatant magic and monsters, but they're needed for the whole of the game and doesn't break the \"illusion of reality\" and its commentary is strong.The complexities of time travel are cleverly smoothed out through the story while simultaneously creating the plot - it is more than just a clever device, and as the (mild spoiler coming up) guiders of the White Chronicle say - it is Stocke's (main character) job to find the razor thin path through the future that leads to the light - aka the correct history - aka what will not cause the end of the world, by going back and forth in time.Again, the time travel element is the primary feature of the game. You play along two different timelines, each which effect one another, and while ultimately there are definitive \"ends\" (as in means and ends), to your choices, you can play the game out in many different directions. There are side quests that don't effect the main flow of time but merely branch off but still usually give you rewards such as money or equipment etc., and there are also ones that branch off but effect the main timeline indirectly by giving Stocke key through info/tools or other means he needs to go back and fix time... you have two main timelines that you bounce between, each effecting one another, to create ultimately a third to reach that razor thin correct path where the world does not perish. There is also one other character with the same ability Stocke has, the wielder of the \"black\" chronicle, unknown to you at first, that also effects the timelines, adding more complexity. Dialogue with the mystics of \"historia\" that aide Stocke answer typical questions that come up with time travel. Stocke has his own time, and is effected by all his experiences, whereas the things he effects can be changed. Some of the more spiritual characters can detect faint memories of things that have been changed by Stocke or things that happened in a different timeline. There is a storyline that documents all that happens in each line based on a well organized set of split timelines (also displaying those side experiences that do and do not effect the main timeline or effect things indirectly as beforementioned by giving Stocke info/tools to change the mainline). The storyline is always available through the menu, however Stocke can only go back and forth in time and to \"Historia\" where the guardians are at save spots that allow him to utilize the White 'Chronicle,' whose mysteries are discovered way later in the game.Again, this game could have been a complete failure but it is instead a complete success. The graphics are fairly typical for the DS lite, not too much eye candy now that we are in the next generation of the 3ds and Vita, but eye candy isn't necessary here. Battle system is turn based and beautifully crafted hybrid of grid based and standard turn based play - you can fight with 3 members but have more in your party and choose who to use, and there are some fun add-ons to battle system without making it too complex. The game menus, in and out of battle, are excellently organized, and you can level grind/gain funds just about at anytime since you can revisit most points on the timeline.Again, you can get stuck despite going back and forth, trying to find the key to move forward, but that gives the game a difficulty edge that it needs. You have a lot of choices as the game goes on - you can choose to continue with one timeline, or go back to the other and continue with it if for instance you have fixed something that allows you to continue in that one, which gives the game - and this is ironic - a \"non-linear\" gameplay (ironic to say in reference to a game with timelines as a gaming device), and you can also work on side quests (some necessary, some not) that also require time travel. Many times you have to wait a while for an opportunity to come up to go back and fix a side quest. There are multiple endings in a sense, although ultimately there is one \"correct\" history you must define and reach via the correct actions in both the main timelines that, again, affect one another, and reach the ultimate ending.Very much an RPG for mid-teen to adults, it is a must own for any fan of RPGs. One of the best stories for the DS. Five stars all the way. One of my personal favorites of all time, and though there are many RPGs I have not played and subjectivity plays a part, this would definitely go in my top 3 ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Scottypiper \"Scottypiper\"","summary":"Best Resident Evil game to date","reviewText":"For starters, I have played and still own every major Resident Evil game in the series including 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Code Veronica, all of them being on the GameCube except RE5. Definitely one of the best video game series of all times. This game is my favorite of the group, with the remake of RE 1 a close 2nd place.Story: After the destruction of Raccoon city, Leon S. Kennedy is recruited by the secret service. The president's daughter has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult and Leon is sent to investigate. He travels to a remote village in Europe where he discovers the villagers are not normal people. Not zombies......but something else. What has become of Umbrella and Wesker? Are they involved?Gameplay: Survivor Horror third-person shooter. Gameplay mechanics are very similar to the other RE series games. You travel through each area obtaining keys and items that are needed to progress to the next area. Through some of the game, you have a partner and co-op moves are needed to reach or clear a certain area. You can interact with the environment such as jumping through windows, kicking down ladders, etc. Throughout the game, there are several treasures you can collect (more about that later). Leon will have the standard weapons such as pistols, knives, shotguns, grenade launchers, magnums, mine thrower, submachine guns, and harpoons for water areas. The inventory system has been changed. You have a case that holds X number of spots. Each item takes up a set amount of spots. You can rearrange the items in the case to better utilize the space. If an item is too big to fit in the case, you can't carry it unless you discard something else. Your case can be upgraded several times so it holds more items. Your case contains all your weapons, ammo, first-aid stuff, etc. Your treasures and special items are kept separate. All of your upgrades, purchases, selling treasures, etc. are done by the travelling salesman. You will run into him from time to time. He sells new weapons, ammo, first-aid, upgrades to current weapons, and will buy any treasures you collect. Note: some treasures can be combined to make them more valuable. Before you sell your treasures, check them to see if they have missing gems like on crowns and cups. Selling them complete will net you a lot more money.Fighting: While the fighting is similar to other RE games, in this game you have laser tracking and can shoot any part of an enemy. Enemies will react accordingly such as if they are shot in the leg, they will stumble or if shot in the head, they will grab their face. Leon can also interact when enemies have stumbled. If you are close enough to them, you are given a prompt and Leon will perform an acrobatic move such as a roundhouse kick. During several cut-scenes, you will be required to push certain button combinations to dodge attacks, run, or attack. The boss fights in this game are some of the best in the series. Especially a certain little knife fight that won an award (you will know it when you get to it).Conclusion: The environment is huge. The graphics are best I've seen on GameCube for an RE game. Controls are fluid and easy to use. Resident Evil 4 snagged the 2nd best game on GameCube when IGN created their top 25 GameCube games list. The entire RE series will stay in my collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2011"}

Featuring a completely new and innovative combat system, detailed character design, and clever gameplay,The Mark of Kriaims to breathe new life into the action-adventure genre.","reviewerName":"pennywyze","summary":"One of the greatest PS2 games","reviewText":"How this masterpiece slipped past me is nothing short of mind-boggling.Being that I'm Samoan, I appreciated the fact that this game starred a Samoan protagonist; which is a rarity.Anyway, Mark of Kri is a hack and slash/stealth hybrid and semi-platformer which features brutal combat along the lines of Conan or God of War.Onto the review-Graphics-The graphics are some of the best on PS2; and could easily pass as a Gamecube title. (though to be fair, Gamecube games look much better than this game)Mark of Kri looks like a Disney movie with all the extra frames of animation and the art style. There's even a cool transition between in-game concept sketches and the actual in-game graphics in which every level transforms from a sketch to the actual character. This is something that hasn't been utilized in gaming much. The frame rate is smooth, the colors are vibrant and the backgrounds range from a jungle atmosphere to candle lit temples with giant Dharma statues or perhaps a waterfall with lush vegetation surrounding it.There are occasional graphical problems along the lines of screen tearing or some flat textures that look washed out, but this doesn't occur often.All in all, the graphics were great.Sound-Mark of Kri doesn't feature much music; but does feature lots of environmental sound effects and dialogue. The voice acting is excellent. The environmental effects range from birds chirping or water rushing. Perhaps even insects buzzing. The music which pops up ever so often really gives you the Polynesian vibe with drumming, deep bells and a few other instruments. But nothing major. The music is actually very short and is delivered in spurts.Gameplay-Mark of Kri gives you control of Samoan protagonist, Rau. The game features storytelling in the manner of \"past tense\" which is told by perhaps Rau's pupil. Anyway, your job is to rid villages of thieves/bandits/baddies.Mark of Kri features a deep and robust fighting system that is quite different in comparison to many games. The game's engine features parrying, countering, stealth attacks, instant kills and such.The combat is satisfying and brutal. You're able to decapitate heads, stab an enemy through his neck, chest, face, stomach/pelvic area and there's even blood. Whether you're parrying, countering or using combos, the fighting system is commendable.One thing that I wasn't crazy about was the absence or the right analog stick camera control. This is because the right analog stick is used to highlight your enemies during battles and a button prompt will show over their heads so that you're able to attack everyone no matter how near or far they are. The feature's intuitive but presents problems with seeing everything around you.Thankfully, L1 is a first person camera view in which you're able to look around every where.You're also given control of a bird that helps you in every level by scouting out viewpoints or perhaps retrieving an item or activating a switch.Being that I won't spoil the story in any game. I'd highly recommend buying this game. It's cheap, has good graphics, a deep combat system and is a PS2 exclusive. This is perhaps one of Sony's best on the PS2. And although it pales in comparison to God of War or perhaps games like Genji, it still ranks alongside them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0009S4UOA","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Be a Hero... Again!","reviewText":"\"Call of Duty\" lovers will be eagerly awaiting the arrival of another \"United Offensive\" Expansion pack after finishing this stunning WWII fps. In 2004 the next best single player shooter to \"Half-Life 2\" was \"Call of Duty 1\". Needless to say COD2 brings us yet another damn fine sequel effort to rival anything else on the shelf. COD has firmly taken over where \"Medal of Honour: Allied Assault\" first got our attention in trying to recreate the \"Saving Private Ryan\" experience for us all. The COD series is built on the same concept as MOH except there is more action, more high-octane moments and a very different type of enemy AI. COD2 has upgraded the enemy and platoon squad AI from COD1 so that your comrades can identify the enemy and instead of scripting each action sequence as in COD1, COD2 depends on AI so that a rerun of any level will play differently although the situations remain the same. COD2 also has a lot more going on in terms of what you can pilot and drive although not freely but as part of the storyline. COD2 retains all the cinematic intensity that its predecessor successfully claimed and even expands on each of the earlier episodes over the course of a four year WWII period to give us Moscow 1941 - Red Army Training, Demolition, Stalingrad 1942 - Repairing the Wire, The Pipeline, Stalingrad 1943 - Downtown Assault, City Hall, Comrade Sniper, El Alamein 1942 - The Diversionary Raid, Hold the Line, Operation Supercharge, El Daba 1942 - The End of the Beginning, Libya 1943 - Crusader Charge, 88 Ridge, Tunisia 1943 - Outnumbered and Outgunned, Retaking Lost Ground, Assault on Matmata, D-Day 1944 - The Battle of Pointe du Hoc, Retreat? We're Advancing in Another Direction, The Silo, Caen 1944 - Prisoners of War, The Crossroads, The Tiger, The Brigade Box, Hill 400 1944 - Approaching Hill 400, Rangers Lead the Way, The Battle for Hill 400 and Germany 1945 - Crossing the Rhine, where you get to play as either a Soviet or a Brit or as a member of the US forces. Missions range from basic training, defending against attacks, counterattacks, planting explosives, repairing cut field wires, contacting HQ via the field phone, disabling Panzer II tanks, crawling through pipelines, taking out enemy snipers, destroying fuel barrel supplies with some of the best explosion effects seen in any game to date, destroying ammo depot supplies, gathering enemy documents, defending lower lines by using close-range weapons and artillery support, clearing out bunkers, radioing in for artillery bombardments, taking a Mosque, driving tanks, holding out for 5 minutes till support arrives, clearing the buildings in the town, sniping the artillery crews from a Silo tower, finding wounded Americans, transporting the wounded, taking a farmhouse and barn, taking out mortar crews and if that is not enough... securing a hill from a German advance. The smoke effects are absolutely photorealistic and have set a new benchmark for graphics quality. The textures might let the game down a small bit, including very blocky building designs or similar house interiors that are repeated at several points in the game but the environments and maps are genuinely war like all the way through and can not be faulted. The enemy AI and your own team AI are much more realistic than COD1 and your team is reliable. If you get too close to the enemy you will engage him in close quarter combat. Although Call of Duty was never meant to be a war simulation, but more of a 1st person war adventure, to be honest, does exactly what it says on the tin. So apart from the staged element, which actually ads to the game, it is more of an experience than a game you will turn to time and time again, however it is worth it for the experience of the single player mission alone. It is also much longer than COD1 and OU, where COD1 had a 1.5 day game span and UO had 3, COD2 will last you for well over a week if you play one mission a day. The pandemonium of war is all here in a spectacular fashion because the story is a winner as you play a mini version of BAND OF BROTHERS and ENEMY AT THE GATES. Like COD1 you even feel loss at the end but for some reason the connection to your comrades in COD1 was a lot stronger because it was more scripted. The AI detracts from that connection a little bit, but I am only cribbing.Pros:- Cinematic gaming.- Best new war game and a worthy 1st person shooter.- Awesome war atmosphere.- Smoky explosions.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2005"}

It is getting good then suddenly, some guy runs in, takes the book, force feeds you a gallon of malt liquor and makes you to play a round of dance dance revolution.  If you win, you get the book back and he will try again later.  If you lose, you get a brick to the head, another gallon of alcohol and then you must try again.This is what I felt when playing through this travesty.  Some sequences are understandable.  Tap the R1 and L1 buttons to move stuff, okay I'll buy that.  But having to fight a Matrix style battle by tapping the analog sticks to the flashing colors on the screen?  I don't think so.  I don't know about you but for me the analog sticks are not precision instruments.  I usually end up starting to run the wrong way then having to correct a split second later.  Sadly, you are not given this correction time in the game.I played through several sequences about a dozen times before I finished due more to random button mashing than actual skill.  I have played Guitar Hero, God of War and several quick time event games, but the timing and accuracy required in this one is beyond stupid.  Having to keep this up for about five continuous minutes in some cases is about the most frustrating thing I can imagine, aside from failing and having to start over completely.The in game control is not much better.  At best, your character steers like they have an advanced case of polio and have just awoken from a four year coma.  Having to interact with the surroundings (again with the stupid analog sticks instead of say, an action button) is rather irritating when my character continues walking after I let go of the controller.  Or simply faces the wrong way altogether.As you can tell, I have some issues I need to work out in this game.  It would be better if instead of the analog sticks, the stupid quick time events used buttons like the rest of civilized society.  Even better, cut the dumb things out completely.  They do nothing but break up a decent story and ruin what could be a good game.The story itself was interesting.  You play both sides of a case involving a murder.  One side, the murderer himself who is doing his best to uncover the truth of his crime and on the other the two officers investigating it.  The plot has its twists and you do actually develop some feeling towards the protagonists as the game advances.  But then you miss that stupid event and you are almost cheering their death.Sadly, the plot itself gets rather pathetic toward the end of the game.  Really the last 15 minutes actually.  A romance and a new villain are suddenly introduced.  Not a good thing to do as a writer (David Cage I am looking at you).  The \"Multiple Storypath\" concept is a bit misleading as well.  You essentially have 3 \"decent endings.\"  In one you win, in one you lose, in the other you lose but to someone different.  All of the other \"endings\" are just different types of gameover screens.This game would have been better as a book, or even as a movie as the creator obviously would have rather made.  I can only be happy that the man shows his face in the opening tutorial so that I will recognize him on the street, then slap him for his idiocy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2008"}

In this game, Tony Montana didn't die at the end of the movie. Instead, he has to rebuild his empire piece by piece - and he is VERY angry.The movie was classic for its over the top violence and fury. You need to be aware that this game is rated M for Mature - and it most definitely earns that rating. There is non stop swearing throughout the game, and a great deal of slaughter. If you thought the Grand Theft Auto games were bad, this takes it a step beyond.It's definitely intriguing to have a Cuban themed world around you, rather than the stereotypical Italian or ghetto worlds that many other games provide. There is a sense of style generated by a lot of the scenes here, and the dialogue and action is quite involving.They did a great job with the graphics, although I have to admit that the incredible detail of the Grand Theft Auto series has really spoiled me. If I see a location, I want to be able to go explore it. The Scarface designers only made certain parts of each map playable, and erected invisible force fields everywhere else to prevent you from going there. Those bug me to no end :) Surely they could have spent an extra few weeks in development to let me wander around that area, even if I didn't find anything. It would make the game seem more \"real\", and my choices more my own.Also, it would be nice to have things other to do than just mow down enemies. I like games that offer a variety of tasks, but this isn't one of them. If you get tired of the non-stop violence, you have to pop another game into the console in order to relax a bit before you go back to the game.Still, the game is great fun, and as long as you accept the mature rating and one-track gameplay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2007"}

It's loaded with characters and most are hidden so you have to play a lot to unlock them all. Unless you're a cheater and gain points other ways. One low point in this game is the graphics.

I've played and enjoyed almost all of the Mario games over the years, though many times it took me years to catch up. I had high expectations for 3D World - it was the first Mario game I got on release since the N64 - but I did not expect it to be this good. Honestly, I felt like I was a kid playing Super Mario Brother 3 for the first time. While many of the other games in the series have partially faded from my memory over the years, this game is sure to stick around in my head for as one of the greatest classics in gaming.To start off, I must say, I am no Nintendo fanboy. I didn't even play my original Wii until years after it launched, and I only bought a Wii U fairly recently. I didn't adopt a 3DS until two years after it was released. My recent games played include Grand Theft Auto V on the PS3. My current holiday wish list includes a PS4 and Xbox One. My most recent game prior to playing Mario 3D World was Super Monkey Ball on the Playstation Vita. It was only with brilliant reviews that I decided to get 3D World the day it launched.So with that said, let's break it down:Positives-Five playable characters - one unlockable - each with their own unique traits.-Princess Peach is NOT captured and is a very useful playable character. I personally used her to complete the game's final challenge and to defeat Bowser!-All levels may be completed with any character. You have full control over who you play as.-Incredible variety of levels.-Incredible amount of levels across 12 worlds, with an average of about 8 levels per world.-Tons of postgame stuff to work on, such as completing worlds 9-12, trying to get the fastest times on each level, reaching the top of the flagpole on every level, and completing every level with every character.-The power-up system lets you store an extra power-up to be switched out at any time. More can be stored in multiplayer.-The double cherry special power-up should have a whole game dedicated to it. In some levels you can find cherries that clone your character, and you can sometimes get as many as five clones. It's extremely fun and intuitive to control them, and the game rewards you for keeping them all alive with some of the levels' collectibles, in most cases.-Very little recycling of levels. No more going back to the same level for different missions. If you found all the stars (similar to star coins from NSMB) and the stamp on your first try, you don't have to replay the level again unless you want to.-Miiverse integration is done better this time around, without as much prompting and stamps to find which you can use to draw pictures easily.-Most of the hidden things in the levels are reasonable for a player to discover naturally through rigorous exploration. There are very few secrets that feel like they were just put in the game to sell strategy guides.-The difficulty ramps up very slowly, so it'd be an awesome game for any skill level of gamer, though seasoned gamers won't be challenged until much later. For multiplayer purposes, it's probably better this way.-Multiplayer is friendly to casuals and it's much easier for a skilled player to go through the game with a casual gamer or child without worrying about them running out of lives. Lives are now shared between players and there it's a lot less likely that a player will continually get killed like they would in NSMB games.-4 players can play at once, and there are a lot of safeguards to ensure that one player rushing ahead won't cause everyone else to die.-The MUSIC is absolutely sensational. I can't get it out of my head!Negatives-No online play, though there is Nintendo's social network and level ghosts where you can play against other players' ghosts to see if you can complete the level faster.-The time limit can get in the way of exploration, though it is usually generous with time unless the level is designed for speed.-The same button that is used for run and shoot is also used to pick up the other players in multiplayer. This can be hilarious when it happens accidentally, but I still wish it were a different button-It could be annoying if you run out of extra lives to go farm more, although this never happened to me.-If you die on a level where you needed a certain power-up to get something (some stars require a cat suit) you may have to go back to an earlier level to get another. It is not necessary to get every star, but most people will want to.-The game has its challenging moments even for expert gamers, but it's quite a bit easier than some recent Mario titles. For me, as a gamer since the original Super Mario Brothers, only about 5 levels gave me a serious challenge, though I did die probably 50 times over the course of the game. It is certainly not a cakewalk and will be very fun to try to complete with friends who aren't as good as I am at this stuff. I would also say that limiting yourself to no power-ups on the final level in world 12 would be one of the harder things you could ever do in a 3D platformer.-The stamps for the Miiverse tend to promote spamming so a lot of Miiverse comments are just people stamping over and over again without saying anything clever or creative. Well, welcome to the internet, I guess. I still like the Miiverse a lot.At the end of the day, most of my complaints are very minor issues and I only put them to try to show a lack of a bias. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys video games even a little bit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

After this and the upcoming Mirror's Edge I think EA finally got some brains that were full of new IP and original content. Dead Space is a superbly gruesome and atmospherically terrifying game that goes above and beyond the call of duty (no pun intended) when it comes to atmosphere, story, and game play ideas. The story is really unique and it's been ages since a great new original story has blossomed in the horror genre. You are Isaac Clarke who is a repair man sent out to the Ishimura to find out why there is no communications on that ship. The ship is known as a \"Planetcracker\" and is carrying a mysterious relic called \"The Marker\" and Isaac finds everyone aboard dead and the place deserted...well except extremely creepy monsters, a couple crazy doctors, and his girlfriend...yeah its a superb story and it'll keep you hooked throughout, but won't really unfold until the last three levels.Let's go right into game play; you can buy five different weapons (yeah this game NEEDED more weapons) they are the plasma cutter, ripper, flamethrower, force gun, and contact beam, and the line gun. They are all cool weapons yet there is a twist: They're TOOLS not guns. Isaac is a repair man, see, not a one-man-army mercenary or ex-military dude. This guy was NOT trained for combat and he must learn very quickly how to defend himself. This makes the game feel even more creepy and makes you feel more helpless since you have to make due with what you have. What I loved is that everything is displayed visually so there are no meters, bars, or gauges telling you your health and ammo. Everything is displayed on you. You have your health bar which is a bar on your suit, your stasis bar is on your back (more on stasis later), your ammo is displayed holographically when you're using your weapons and so is your flashlight.Everything in the game is easily accessible and the controls are well mapped out. You can use melee combat by stomping on enemies or punching them. While you'll not want to do this since its a bit clunky it saves your butt in hairy situations. The way you kill enemies is by dismembering them to do extra damage. If you shoot their legs off they'll crawl to you, shoot their arms off and they bite you to death, shoot one arm and one leg off they'll still crawl to you, decapitate them and well they'll still try to kill you! If you get overwhelmed just use your stasis and slow them; this is a must do for some creatures like the Twitchers who run ultra fast. The creatures are very disturbing and are probably some of the most sick and twisted things created in a game I've EVER seen. These things are nasty and you just feel the pain when you realize these were all once humans (most of them). There are also lots of cinematic sequences like when a tentacle arm grabs your leg and it's dragging you down a hall while your trying to shoot it off. There are HUMONGOUS boss fights, some turret gun sections etc.You'll NEVER get bored with the game since the scares vary so much. You'll walk down a hall and a guy will be petting his dismembered leg then fall over dead, you'll hear a nurse laugh hysterically and blow her brains out, people will be killed behind bullet proof glass etc. The game has a VERY disturbing atmosphere and you really do get scared with all of the amazing ambient sound effects that will keep you on the edge and make you jump constantly. Dead Space does everything differently from other horror games since its all so surreal because of the way its done. You really do feel abandoned on a ship that once was bustling with life. The graphics are also absolutely amazing; these are some of the best graphics seen so far and they are breathtaking. There's not much I can say except see it for yourself you'll be blown away!There are segments that are zero gravity and vacuums. Zero gravity sections have you jumping around room solving puzzles and shooting things. These are very interesting and changes the pace a lot. When you enter a vacuum you are on an air timer and if you don't have any spare air can you're dead! You can upgrade everything via work benches by finding or buying power nodes. These work like \"trees\" where you have to fill a path to that upgrade with nodes. Each weapon has different upgrade specs and you won't be able to upgrade them all in one play through. In fact it'll take about two play throughs to get all achievements. There is plenty to do in the game and the achievements are not impossible to get (like in FEAR!!! or Burnout Revenge!!!) so don't panic.All I have left to say is that Dead Space is absolutely amazing and I'd give it a higher score if there were more enemy types, more weapons, and just a bit more variety. There's enough to keep you interested through a couple of play throughs and I hope there will be a sequel (wait...it's EA of course there will be!!! Until we hate it...) There are six Dead Space comics available that you can pick up for about $15 for the lot. I HIGHLY suggest reading these since they fill you in about a few weeks before the game takes place. They have the same atmosphere and story telling as the game and they are a really good read. Dead Space is one of the best horror action games made and this will be a piece of gaming history, and I also look forward to the next few sequels.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Johnson","summary":"Suprisingly fun with two major flaws.","reviewText":"When it comes to movie games, I don't have much confidence in them being any good based on past experiences. However I downloaded the Ghostbusters demo from Xbox Live and I was entertained enough to rent it a few days later. While the game itself is pretty good, there are two major flaws that caused me to lose interest and turn the game off.I have no issues with the visuals and sound, while it isn't anything that will win any awards, they are quite good. These days, I feel too much emphasis is put on visuals anyway and not enough in more important areas like game play. The controls themselves are smooth it is a bit complicated and since the rental did not come with a user's manual, I had to rely on the on screen instructions which don't do a very good job in fully explain EXACTLY what you are doing and why you are doing it. Of course if I actually had a manual to read from, then this probably wouldn't even be an issue.From what I've seen so far, the storyline is done pretty well. You don't play as one of the original Ghost Busters, instead you play as a new recruit and you join the other four as you hunt down ghosts in various areas of the city. The voice acting is authentic and sounds like their real life counterparts, but for some inexplicable reason your character doesn't seem to have the ability to speak so I suppose he communicates with the others psychopathically. As you are playing, the game tells you how to do certain things, however as I stated before it does not fully explain why you are doing it as a manual would but eventually you should be able to catch on.Even during the first level, the game started getting a little repetitive which is what I expected eventually, but this is not the main problem I have with this game. It didn't take long to realize that there are two major flaws in the game that just often times end up with me turning the game off. First of all there is so much going on with flying ghosts as well as ground monsters that appear behind you so it's hard to avoid damage; take too much damage and you will fall to ground hoping your teammates will revive you before you die. Most of the time they revive you quickly but sometime they will walk right by you and do nothing. You also will spend a lot of time reviving them, putting your self in danger due to the fact that most monsters attack from all directions.Once you do die, you have the option of restarting from the previous checkpoint. Choose this option and you are forced to sit, wait, and wait some more through an extremely long loading screen. When the game finally does load, you will be more than likely disappointed to find out that you didn't apparently didn't kill enough ghosts or get far enough to start later in the level and you have to do everything all over again. This happens constantly during game play and it is extremely frustrating having to start all over again.I don't know about you, but I absolutely hate having to something over and over and over again, and for games that use checkpoint systems, this is exactly what will eventually happen. I haven't gotten a gauge of how far the checkpoints are from each other, but even if they are relatively close, the long loading times cancel that out. After dying for the 5th or 6th time, I honestly got tired of having to start over from the beginning so I just turned the game off and watched TV.  I came back to it later on and progressed more into the game, but the checkpoint/loading problems will be a recurring problem in the game.However that being said, the game is extremely fun to play its just too bad that the poor implementation in handling game saves and loading times take away from it.  It's definitely worth a rental, but until you can gauge your tolerance for the load times and incredibly stupid check point system, I can not recommend a purchase right out and certainly not for regular price that most all video games are going for these days.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Beautiful scenes and very immersive","reviewText":"I am primarily a campaign player, and have really getting in FPS games on PS3 with the advent of Move and PS3 Sharp Shooter.  I played KillZone 3 and Socom 4 both in campaign mode, using Move and Sharp Shooter and in 3D. I've not been very fast-and-accurate using six-axis controller for FPS.  So it's natural that I wanted to play this game.First to comment on the usage of Sharp Shooter. It's not as natural as many of the secondary weapons or tagging enemies require using the \"Move\" Button on the motion controller. That takes the left or right hand off the gun. It's a slow really awkward. Just not a good placement in the heat of the battle. As other reviewers suggested, re-mapping would've helped to alleviate this frustration. Other than that, the rest of the button/trigger assignments are in-line with other Move-based FPS games and are fine.Onto the game.  As a disclaimer, I've never played any previous Resistance games, so all classifications of Chimera, zumbies, and other enemy targets are new to me. I can follow the story in the campaign mode. The various scenes are beautifully done, and are refreshing. From battling in the small town, to underground, the prison, the wild, the cave, on the train, and various alien complexes are all refreshing. The weapons and their usage can be overwhelming, but the incremental progression in the campaign mode really help to embrace usage of each one progressively.  The weapon firing is quite realistic.The story is good. While trying to be more \"human\" with touching moments, it's hard to shed a tear for a game! I played the easiest campaign mode, and it took me about 25 hours over a period of 3 weeks to complete. Having to find healing/med kit instead of heal-with-time makes it more challenging to get pass a check point. 3D has the usual in-screen depth, but nothing extraordinary.

In this latest expansion, something is afoot in the cold, harsh northlands. The Lich King Arthas has set in motion events that could lead to the extinction of all life on Azeroth. The necromantic power of the plague and legions of undead armies threaten to sweep across the land. Only the mightiest heroes can oppose the Lich King and end his reign of terror..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }The tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman, inhabit the icy Borean Tundra.View larger.Half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land.View larger.You'll enjoy exploring Northrend and all its environments and dungeons.View larger.Explore Northrend and battle the Lich King with World of Warcraft's first hero class character -- The Death Knight.View larger.One of many new environments, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.View larger.Many strange and terrifying creatures inhabit this frozen continent.View larger.Enter the Death KnightThis expansion adds a host of content to the already massive existing game world. Players will achieve soaring levels of power, explore Northrend (the vast icy continent of the Lich King), and battle high-level heroes to determine the ultimate fate of Azeroth. As you face the dangers of the frigid, harsh north, prepare to master the dark necromantic powers of the Death Night -- World of Warcraft's first Hero class. No longer servants of the Lich King, the Death Knights begin their new calling as experienced, formidable adversaries. Each is heavily armed, armored, and in possession of a deadly arsenal of forbidden magic.If you have a World of Warcraft account with a character of at least level 55, you will be able to create a new level-55 Death Knight of any race (if on a PvP realm, the Death Knight must be the same faction as your existing character). And upon entering the new world, your Death Knight will begin to quest to level 80, gaining potent new abilities and talents along the way. This expansion allows for only one Death Knight per realm, per account.New Environments in Northrend AwaitJourney through the remote, diverse lands of Northrend and explore Dragonblight, Grizzly Hills, Borean Tundra, and Howling Fjord. Named for bones of perished dragons and majestic shrines to the fallen creatures, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.Not everything is frozen in Northrend. The lush mountains of Grizzly Hills are the ancestral home to the furbolgs, who have grown accustomed to relative peace. Although their tranquility is being challenged by trappers, goblins, and ice trolls, Grizzly Hills remains a vast and dangerous wilderness.The southwestern tip of Northrend is home to the sprawling Borean Tundra. The Horde has established a dominant presence in this icy portion of the continent and has formed a bond with the tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman. Magical energy is afoot in the region, and it has caused increased tension.High above the Great Sea at the southeastern tip of Northrend lies the Howling Fjord. Ancient mythology holds that a race of half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land, founding a prosperous civilization. They mysteriously vanished, leaving deserted villages and abandoned temples. In present times, the Alliance and the Horde have come to Howling Fjord to confront the Lich King. Strangely, this has prompted the return of the vrykul, who are attacking the Alliance and Horde settlements. Howling Fjord presents a difficult challenge on two fronts: withstanding the vrykul's onslaught and battling the evil Lich King.A Multitude of MonstersStrange and terrifying creatures inhabit the frozen continent of Northrend, such as Nerubian Viziniers, Plague Eruptors, Shoveltusks and Flesh Giants, to name just a few. Half-spider, half-humanoid, the viziniers utilize sorcery and high intelligence to emerge as the rulers of Nerubians' underground kingdom. The Plague Eruptors are walking corpses created by the Lich King's evil experiments to spread horror and chaos across the living world.Massive curved antlers make it easy to identify the Shoveltusks. These grumpy beasts are very dangerous, territorial, and best left alone. The Flesh Giants are nothing short of nightmarish abominations. Cobbled together from the pieces of giant body parts, the Flesh Giants employ tremendous strength to carry out the Lich King's wishes.The World of Warcraft: Wrath of King Lich expansion pack allows you to engage in epic siege warfare. The pack presents the first Hero class and allows you to transform your Death Knight's look with character customization that even include hairstyles and dances. You'll enjoy exploring the Northrend and all its environments and dungeons, filled with some of the deadliest creatures -- and greatest treasures -- on all of Azeroth.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemPC: Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista (with latest Service Packs)Mac: Mac OS X 10.4.11 or newerCPUPC: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlong XP 1500+Mac: PowerPC G5 1.6 GHz or Intel Core Duo processorPC: Dual-core processor, such as Intel Pentium D or AmD Athlong 64 X2Mac: Intel 1.8 GHz processor or betterGraphics HardwarePC: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transfor and Lighting with 32 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon 7200 or NVIDIA GeForce2 class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transform and Lighting with 64 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon 9600 or NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4600 class card or betterPC: 3D Graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capabilities with 128 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA 7600 class card or better.MemoryPC: 512 MB (1 GB for Vista)Mac: 1 GBPC: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)Mac: 2 GBHard Drive Space15 GB of free spaceAll Platform RequirementsKeyboard and mouse, required for controls.

Been playing the game since the day it officially got released(off and on but mostly on though). The game has some amazing lure to it. Something about the huge landscapes, serene music, medieval+modern atmosphere, great pvp opportunities, \"casual friendly\" and the fact the game doesn't take itself seriously has hooked many over the years including me.I will say I throughly enjoyed the orginal vanilla wow but I was let down by the first expansion Burning Crusade. It was missing the majic orginal wow had. There was really not much innovation in the game other than being able to fly. The quests were basically the same format of kill x and deliver y like the orginal only the graphics got upgraded. What we got was a sci-fi take on the orginal wow. Burning Crusade overall just didnt impress many and left a bad taste when it came to pvp with the introduction of the much hated Duel in a box called Arena's.Wrath of the lich king makes up for all of that. It looks like blizzard decided to go back to the roots and create an expansion that captures the imagination and inovation of the orginal. I am happy to say they succeded. Gone are sci-fi elements and what we see and feel in Northrend looks like a 2008 version of the orginal Azeroth. The graphics engine for northrend has been a significant upgrade. We have sharper resolutions, and lot more detailed world in general. Every new zone looks beautiful, expansive and pure engrossing. The quests mechanics have been a given a significant upgrade too. Though still the basic kill x or deliver y but the means to accomplish them have thankfully been inovated like we have lots of land and aerial based vehicles to accomplish the objectives plus the quests seem to follow a linked storyline and rarely we get standalone quests. In general one dont feel they are doing more of the same all over again.A new Hero class has been introduced the Death Knight which heavily relates to the general lore of this expansion and is one of the main selling point of the new expansion. This class starts at lvl 55, is plate wearing, warrior/caster hybrid very similar to the Paladin class but has more perks, inovation and generaly more fun to play. This class can be tailored to become somewhat of a fury warrior, a melee frost mage or a melee warlock. This class has been a great success judging by the numbers of them we see. Usually a new class fad declines over time but Death Knight has remained very popular all the way to lvl 80 with a very low drop-out rate. It's a testament to the fact that blizz created a inovative and fun new class. However many people have began to resent the fact that DK are more than dime a dozen and with a general and somewhat childish impression that people playing DK are sub-par etc. I think this an overeaction as everyone has to right to play what they find most fun and it doesnt make them any less skilled or more skilled than someone who decided to level his orginal class up instead.Last but not least pvp has been given a upgrade too. A open world pvp zone called Wintergrasp been added. Its kind of like Alterac Valley without being instanced and only server specific. You get to use flying mounts, cannon,land vehicles to lay seige or defend a fortress. Wintergrap has been a success and is fun too. Also the new battleground 'Strand of the ancients' is very fun too basically employing the same mechanics as WG but instanced and cross-server. I hope the battlgrounds in general would last longer but they are still fun diversion from pve and great way to try your mettle against other players. Arenas(oh how much I hate them) are still there though they are losing popularity fast as people just find them too time consuming(as to schedule with others to play{most of us have real life commitments too}) as well not in true spirit of the World of warcraft where two sides are at war.Anyways I will recommend anyone(who hasn't still played the expansion) to try it. It's well worth the money, much better than the last expansion and has that old-school world of warcraft feel to it. One word of advice though...don't rush to lvl 80, rather take your time so you can fully explore and enjoy all what the expansion has to offer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2009"}

So I'll keep my review short bittersweet and to the point.Graphics 1 to 10, I'd rank this game an 8For the massive environment, even though your path is narrow, you don't really have a lot of options when you get into the levels on how your going to tackle them. And not just purely graphics, but the worlds you travel through are pretty amazing, in scope, and detail.Sound 1 to 1010. The game does what it does well.User Interface 1 to 10I'd rank it a 7. It was a little clunky in my opinionCombat system 1 to 109. It does it really well. But wasn't quite at the sweet spot as far as your avatars response. There was a minor delay, from when I pressed the button on the controller, to when my character actually responded. That split second sometimes caused me to die. Which led to some cursing.Quick map feature, was nice. Helped a lot.The numerous Armors you can collect through out the game are quite cool. So are the weapons you can find. Amazing amount of detail put into these. I loved em.The character creator though, was quite rough... it was definitely something that could have either used more pre-set or designed characters...  or just entirely needed re-worked. Because it was clunky and your characters .. getting them to turn out correctly required a lot of effort. Well at least for me it did.This game is extremely difficult. It requires planning ahead, strategy... looking at your situation before you act... etc. And most of all, it punishes you for failing. Seriously. If you screw up, and the world tendency system , or the \"stupid ass system\" is what I like to call it. If you screw up, and it goes from white, or grey, to black... The difficulty raises a heck of a lot. I would say, to an unfair level. So make sure to save often, and pull a god mode, other wise the game will hand you your ass.Actually I can tell you, it will do that from the start unless you catch on quickly. This game is literally designed to kill you. At first I thought it was to challenge you as a player. But as I progressed, I realized, my first assumption was indeed accurate.Anyways, overall if you stick with the game, it does turn into a bitter sweet experience that will grow on you. So just keep at it, and you'll be rewarded.(hopefully)The bonuses I got with the Deluxe edition, well, the strategy guide, ended up proving extremely beneficial. The art book was pretty cool, but I would of liked a 8x11 preferably. Can't really appreciate the wonderful artwork in that small artbook.I could care less for the Music CD's that came with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0001I9YE4","description":"Call Of Duty: Finest Hour leads you back into the World War, where you will experience epic battlefield moments in the war&apos;s most legendary conflicts. Fight alongside ordinary men who fought and died for freedom and changed the world.","reviewerName":"Big Boss Games","summary":"One of the Finest First Person Shooters Available!","reviewText":"Reviewed for Big Boss Games by: L.E.G.As a lover and avid player of FPS (First Person Shooter) type games, I am probably one of the toughest critics and a game must satisfy all my criteria for me to give it a 5/5 rating. Without any doubts, Call of Duty Finest Hour has successfully accomplished this lofty goal.To start with, Call of Duty Finest Hour is entirely based on events that happened during World War II. But, ActiVision took on a bigger role than just making a video game and actually tries and succeeds in teaching us a brief history lesson. Granted it's very short and concise, but it helps to setup the game and it's many diverse and challenging levels.You start out playing as a member of the Russian Army fighting with your comrades on the Eastern Front, from the Volga to Stalingrad. The missions can be somewhat difficult to finish, but the squad leader does give you instructions (just as if you were in the army) on what you need to do or where you need to go. \"Blow up that building\" and \"Take out those machine guns\" are typical fare. And most of the time you are a member of a \"squad\", so don't try to be all \"Rambo\" and try to defeat the Germans all by yourself. You will get slaughtered!After you complete your mission(s) as one person, you are then placed in someone else's shoes and get to fight the war from their perspective. Which also opens you up to using different weapons and driving around in tanks. But, this is not Grand Theft Auto. You can't go around and jump in vehicles and take off. Your tour of duty on the Eastern Front with the Russians takes a total of 8 sometimes-grueling missions. At least the game is very forgiving and lets you restart the mission at the last checkpoint.After the Eastern Front, you are whisked off to North Africa to serve with the British Army in Tunisia. All of the buildings and backgrounds used in this game are simply amazing. There is a lot of rich and articulate detail to keep your attention. You will serve a total of 4 missions with the bulldogs. More neat weapons used by the Brits and a lot of blowing stuff up in these levels. G-D Save the Queen!And last, but not least, you go to the Western Front to fight with the American Army. As in previous levels, you get more awesome weapons to shoot and tanks to drive. Some of the toughest battles will be fought with the Americans. A total of 7 missions await your shooting skills.Call of Duty Finest Hour by ActiVision is available for the Playstation 2, Xbox and Gamecube. It is rated \"T\" for Teen and contains a ton of blood and a whole lot of violence. Since this game is based on World War II, blood and violence is to be expected. Total missions are 19 and 23 different weapons.This game is Single Player only, but does offer multiplayer online broadband only and 2-16 players. Online gametypes are: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and Search & Destroy.Overall, this game was as close to perfect as they can get with very few technical glitches. Like one time I was crawling around on the floor and trying to climb a flight of stairs and my character just fell through some empty space to his terrible death.This game was just so well balanced between missions, story, music and action that I had to give it a 5/5.It's really an awesome game, so go ahead and get a copy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2007"}

{"product_name":"B001D7T2VM","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Apocalyptic Goodness!","reviewText":"Darksiders is an apocalyptic adventure that hacks, slashes, puzzles, and entertains.Story: 9/10In Darksiders, you play as War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, who must battle the forces of Heaven and Hell to restore balance to the universe.  The story and dialogue are both well written and well acted.  The cinematics are nicely rendered.Gameplay: 8/10War kills bad guys with a sword, a scythe, a gun, a glaive, a massive gauntlet, bombs, light posts, cars, and magic spells.  Button Mashers can get by with mashing and holding the X button, while action gamers can string some decent combos together by switching weapons mid-combo (Y button) and learning the special moves (by incorporating RB).  The collision detection and auto-targeting for War are very generous.  When War swings his sword, he swings it in really wide arcs, which helps keep enemies at bay while you're pummeling a guy so you won't get cheap shotted from guys offscreen as much as Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden.  It's fairly satisfying to take out waves of enemies in the game.Darksiders features some epic boss battles against gigantic demons from hell and almighty angels from heaven.  The boss fights are all fairly well done and typically employ some action by the user to expose a boss's weak points.As you kill enemies, they release souls.  There are three types.  Green restores health, Yellow restores mana, and Blue is used as currency to upgrade weapons, spells, buy new moves, and items.  Darksiders also rewards you for exploration.  There are many hidden chests throughout the levels that you can reach through Zelda Style puzzle mechanics.Levels: 8/10The levels are well thought out and incorporate puzzle mechanics.  The world is composed of a series of connected landscapes which are put together to form a world.  Darksiders also features fast travel through magic portals.  The variety in the levels are impressive, from post apocalyptic cities, to angelic towers, to lush valleys.  There are some rather large rewards for exploration, too.Puzzles:  8/10Darksiders relies on box pushing, time slowing, object breaking, and portal using mechanics.  Many of these were taken from God of War.  Late in the game you get a portal gun and a weighted cube for some really complex puzzles.  At first, I was annoyed and was thinking, \"I didn't buy a hack and slash game to go through an hour of puzzles.\"  But the puzzles were so much fun, they actually won me over.Graphics:  6/10The graphics looked like they were inspired by World of Warcraft.  They are a bit on the cartoony side, which end up hurting the epic feel of the game.  At times, it was hard to believe that this was the same game system that runs Call of Duty, Bayonetta, and Red Dead Redemption.Sound:  9/10The soundtrack is epic, the sound effects are LOUD, and the voice acting is outstanding!Replay Value: 4/10The game is linear and are three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Apocalyptic.  That's pretty much it.  If you play a lot of action games, you can play on the Apocalyptic Difficulty.  It's not that bad.  The game is about 16-20 hours long depending on how much you want to explore the environment.  It's pretty long for an action game, but the game is a linear story driven adventure without a multiplayer mode.  There really isn't any reason to replay it once you've finished it.Maturity: The game is rated M, and features fantasy violence.  There are decapitations and dismemberment on cartoony monsters and that's about it.  If you watch anime, you can handle this.Overall:  8/10Darksiders is a fun blend of action, boss battles, exploration, and puzzle solving.  It does all of these things well, but no particular part of the game feels great.  The World of Warcraft Art Style prevents this game from being truly epic and instead the game feels like you're using your imagination and playing with McFarlane Action Figures (if people ever took them out of the boxes.)At this point, the game is about thirty bucks.Buy it if you want a fairly easy hack and slash adventure.Buy it if you liked Dante's Inferno, Devil May Cry, or God of War.Buy it if you love the art style of World of Warcraft.Rent it if you have about 16-20 hours to finish the game.Avoid it if you are a graphics snob.Avoid it if you hate puzzle mechanics.If you like this game, check out Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, Dante's Inferno, or God of War.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0H79C","description":"Gears of War 3","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"Fully loaded and worthy of a place on your shelf","reviewText":"For the price you'll pay for this game, whether you buy it at launch or at the inevitable discounted price further down the road, you get so much value and entertainment for your cash that it would simply be a shame not to pick this up. I'm here to tell you that this game pulls out all the stops and I'll try to keep it short.The graphics are gorgeous. I've read people's comments on forums saying that the Gears series is no longer impressive due to the usage of an \"outdated\" graphics engine. Wow, really? On more than several occasions, I stopped just to take in the surroundings because they were just that beautifully rendered. For what it's worth, this is the best looking Gears game yet.The sound is top notch. My subwoofer definitely got a workout playing this game and the sound design is very, very nice. If I had to pick one thing to comment on, I love the echoing calls of the gas barges. You'll know it when you hear them.Storywise, this one is the most consistent throughout its playthrough. There may be some melodramatic moments and a couple of bad line deliveries peppered throughout but not once did I roll my eyes or pray to myself that the game would end already. It was a fitting end to the series and the fact that co-op play has been bumped from two players to four make this a worthy purchase on that facet alone.Horde mode, the 2.0 version. I'm going to tell you here and now that this is where you'll get your money's worth. I simply adore the fact that they took the original horde and shaped it into something that the fans wanted and would be satisifed with. It is very obvious that Epic took this mode, which was already great to begin with and took every suggestion and consideration to heart when crafting this new, updated version. I've sunk most of my playtime into this mode and with good reason. It's intense, it's violent, it's insane... and it's the best wave-based gameplay you're likely to encounter. The bar has been set incredibly high with Horde 2.0 mode.Look, that's not even mentioning all the different versus modes and the all new Beast mode which lets you play as the Locust Horde in a sort of reverse Horde mode. If you're a stat junkie, I can't think of one statistic that this game DOESN'T include. The online play is absolutely delectable, with the games running off of dedicated servers this time around.This game is nothing less than a thank you to fans of the series, old and new alike. At a time when games seem to be giving you much less bang for your buck, think of this game like a suitcase that you can't close because it's been overpacked. Normally, that's a bad thing but most definitely not in this case. Fans of the series, rest easy. Epic has closed out this trilogy with fireworks, flying colors... however you wanna say it.Easily and most highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2011"}

Johnson","summary":"Something IS missing.  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ boring","reviewText":"The game starts off with Samus crash landing on a planet after responding to a distress signal. After landing, you have given control of her, you are fully upgraded, but that won't last long, you will eventually lose all of your weapons, after losing a battle with the mysterious Ing. After that, you know the routine, find weapons, upgrades, solve puzzles and defeat bosses.Graphics:The graphics in this game are almost identical to the original Prime, but that is a good thing. The detail in this game is nothing short of amazing. The lighting and environmental effects are so real and life like. The enemies are also very interesting. They move like they were patterned after real animals.Sound:There is nothing really new in the sound department either, again not a bad thing, because the sound in the original was very effective.Gameplay:While the controls are very intuitive and responsive, the actual game play does make it seem like something is definitely missing that made the other Metroid titles such a blast to play. I am an old school gamer, and I beat the first Metroid on NES as well as Super Metroid in the SNES. I also played the Metroid on the very first gameboy, until someone stole it. Anyway, the first thing I noticed is that this game focuses much more light and dark versions of the same world, rather than distinctive worlds. This game does have different worlds, but to me they seem to blend in with each other and you really don't get that feel of a true environment. A good portion of your time is spent cycling through the light and dark worlds to solve puzzles; it gets VERY tedious and boring. Oh yeah I did I mention you have to solve puzzles? While I like a challenge sometimes, this game has gone entirely too far with the puzzles. In the later stages of the game, you have to solve puzzles in nearly every room you go to just to get to the next door. Even a good number of the later mini-bosses are really just more puzzles you have to solve. Imagine fighting a boss while your in the morph ball for the entire fight, and you have to move Samus onto spaces that are a tenth of her width, and THEN bomb up into a bomb slot in a space that is barely big enough for the ball to fit through in the first place, oh yeah you have to activate 3 bomb slots before the hidden timer resets or you have to start all over again from the first one. If you die, then you have to spend 5 minutes getting back to the boss. What fun is that? Imagine having to switch between the light and dark world, over and over and over and over and over again just to get one missile expansion.The game in general is harder this time around as well as the bosses. Aside from the annoying puzzle bosses, the boss battles are the most fun part of this game. I am really finding solving puzzles in worlds that are already uninspiring to get very boring. Even though this game plays exactly like the first, it just doesn't have that \"Metroid\" feel that I have come to love. This game as all the elements to be an awesome game, but they just don't come together as they should. The developers went WAY overboard with all the puzzles; you do more puzzle solving than actual fighting! I like solving complicated problems here and there, but not for the entire game! I shouldn't have to turn on my echo visor and shoot 5 beacons to open a door, just because the game decided it wanted to lock it in front of my face for no apparent reason. If I wanted a puzzle game, I'd get Wheel of Fortune or play Tetris. To put it bluntly the game is boring. Its possible to spend a good hour with this game before you discover you only actually advanced three rooms because if you mess up ONE single thing in a puzzle, then you are forced you to start ALL over again. Wow that sure sounds fun doesn't it?One thing I must add is that I also agree that the limited saves in this game can be a problem. I didn't find this to be much of an issue until I spent 20 minutes unlocking three locks to get to a boss, only to find that I couldn't save my game after the locks were open. Needless to say the boss really handed it to me first time around, meaning I had to spend ANOTHER 20 minutes unlocking the same locks just to fight the boss again. I beat him the second time, but BARELY; I was down to my last energy tank with 15 health left in it; which is not that much considering every hit from him takes 30. Now before I get to a boss, I backtrack and save just so I don't have to solve the annoying puzzles again. The time spent backtracking to a save point is sure a heck of a lot better than having to solve EVERY single puzzle again just to get to the same boss that beat you for the 7th time!I agree with the other reviewer that said something seems missing from this game. When I got the first Metroid Prime, I played it ALL the time, because it was just so much fun. This game plays almost exactly like the first, except for a few new weapons and items. Despite this, I have a hard time getting involved in this game. With the original Metroid Prime, I played it every day, this one I play once or twice a week for a couple of hours or so, then I get bored and turn it off. I will eventually beat it, but it is not on my list of priorities. And after I beat it, I can say that I will NEVER play it again, EVER; and thats even if I don't get 100% scans. That says a lot coming from me, since I'm usually the type to beat games over and over again. But once I beat this one, I don't even want to think about playing this boring game ever again. Recently, I even picked up the strategy guide, so I can beat it faster and be done with it.I finally got to the last boss today, and unsuprisingly, he is super hard, you have to beat 3 forms of the same boss using your same energy for all three forms. After 15+ tries and 3 hours I finally beat him. After beating the last boss, the countdown timer started. I was escaping to my ship, then all of a sudden dark samus shows up more powerful than ever. You have to beat her before you can continue and yes, the timer is still going down while you fight her. Needless to say I lost, thinking I would have to start over from the original final boss.  I was about to throw my last controller out the window, but was realived to see that I was able to start from the countdown sequence.  I FINALLY beat the game, but not without breaking one of my controllers.  After completing it, I found out I got 99% complete my first time through, bummer.  This game is way to frustrating, long and boring to warrant another go at it for 100%.  In fact I was so frustrated with the last bosses I didn't even bother scanning them, I just wanted to beat them and get it over with.If you haven't played the first Prime, then I would highly suggest getting that first. If for some reason you have never played Metroid at all, then I STRONGLY suggest playing Metroid (NES) and Super Metroid (SNES) Those two titles to me are the best in the series both very worthy of 5 stars. Prime is close behind with strong 4. Prime 2 is a weak 3, with the ONLY thing saving it from a 1 or 2 star rating is that great graphics, and the Metroid name.  Honestly, I will think long and hard before subjecting myself to antoher Metroid Prime game after this one, I just don't think I will have the patience to put up with something like this again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2005"}

Ages ranged from 7 to 69 years old.  At first the game was entertaining but it got repetitious and boring real quick.  It seems to take a very long time for the games to load.  Sometimes it would take longer for the actual picking of individual game options than the actual game play itself!  There was one game that took only 3 seconds to play and it was over! Don't get me wrong, there were a few games the older players really enjoyed like the \"Silhouet\" game where you have to try to get the bodies of the players to cover the space of an animals or objects shadow in a specific time period.  I also had fun playing the \"Pumped Up\" one where you have to copy body builders positions.  We all laughed our heads off looking at the photo album feature.  All the action photos are saved and you are even able to upload them if you want.The younger kids really enjoyed playing this game a lot and did not get tried of it.  I finally had to pry them away from it. The teenagers and older adults lost interest after the first few games but it was fun to watch the young kids play.  I highly recommend this game for children to age 13 or 14.The Kinect sensor responds to game play quite well unlike other Kinect games we own. It does get a little hectic when trying to choose a game to play or trying to go back just like every other Kinect game out there.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2011"}

Fulkerson","summary":"The best video gaming machine there is!","reviewText":"I've had this system for six months now, and I felt it was time for a review that isn't based on three hours of gaming but a serious look at how it performs after an extended time of heavy usage.  I can say that, for the most part, this machine is outstanding in every way.I bought it mainly for playing video games, and it performs extremely well 99% of the time.  Once you install your games to the hard drive load times don't take long at all.  The graphics to games such as Uncharted and Metal Gear Solid 4 are outstanding to say the least, and the games flow well graphically inside this powerhouse of a machine.  The fan in the back of the PS3 works well and is relatively quiet.  You can tell that the fan works harder with games that demand a lot of graphical performance such as Madden 2010.  It isn't loud enough to distract you, but you can hear it occasionally.  The Playstation Network has a great interface, and it's very simple to navigate through despite many people complaining about its setup.  The best part is that you get to play online for free, and the PS3 comes with integrated wi-fi at no extra cost.  The only issue I've ever had with the PS3 was with Madden 2010 in which it shut down in the middle of gameplay.  It was odd as I'd been playing the game for a full month up until the malfunction, but it only happened once and hasn't happened again.As a blu-ray and DVD player, this machine is great.  It loads quickly, and the picture is outstanding.  Depending upon if you have a HDMI cable (the PS3 does not come with one) your HD TV will detect the optimal resolution through the PS3 and give you the best available picture without doing anything yourself.Another great addition of the PS3 is that you can use it to surf the internet.  It also comes with a few USB ports for storing anything you want.  I won't cover these features as it seems that many others already have, but the storage options you have with the PS3 are very impressive.I know some people are disappointed that the PS3 is not backward compatible, but that doesn't bother me in the least.  I already have a PS2, and if I want to play a PS2 game I'll just plug it in and play it!The PS3 has been very dependable over the six months I've had it, and I can't recommend it highly enough.  If you're a video gamer the PS3 is worth the purchase for the games Metal Gear Solid 4 and Little Big Planet alone.  The upcoming exclusives for the PS3 like The Agent, The Last Guardian and Demon's Souls make the PS3 a must have.I've already put many hours of use into the PS3, and it's well worth the money.  I only wish I had waited a little longer to grab it....it's much cheaper now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002V16T0Q","reviewerName":"A Gamer at Heart","summary":"An Unusual, Highly Atmospheric & Creative Journey","reviewText":"I have been gaming for a pretty long time.  Because of that, FPS games can get pretty stale for me because they are all so similar and repetitive.  Every game seems to borrow or steal from every game that came before it.  I am particularly sick of military-based FPS shooters because they are all the same - run, duck, and shoot countless enemies while you yourself are seemingly invulnerable.With that background, I have been eagerly searching for a breath of fresh air, something unique in a sea of familiarity.  I had tracked Metro 2033 when it was released last year but had passed on it because of several mediocre reviews it received from mainstream gaming sites.  Having now finished Metro 2033, I can only conclude 2033 was dinged a bit for being so different.  To me, however, that difference from other games is what makes it so great.  I also think Metro 2033 was somewhat lost in the sea of big name releases last year.You should know that Metro 2033 is actually based on a Russian book - I assume that is why its story is so strong.  Sure, a post-apocalyptic theme is nothing new, but its implementation here has never been done before.  Survivors live in the vast underground subway station network of Moscow.  Each station is akin to being its own tribe, with its own political beliefs and culture.  The detail present in each of these separate stations is breathtaking.The atmosphere in Metro 2033, both above and below ground, is just stunning.  The lighting, the sounds, the weapons, the way you must manually hand-crank an electrical charge to power your equipment, it all just sucks you in to feel like you are really struggling to survive.  Its cold on the surface - your goggles fog up, you need a gas mask, and the blizzard winds make you sway back and forth like you are in a real storm.  Ammo is scarce, your weapons are not super-uber, you are fragile, and because of all those things, every battle really feels like it matters. This game has what most shooters lack - it's not just battle after battle, wave after wave of enemies.  Instead, it has pacing, atmosphere, and a story; it feels like your are playing a good science fiction movie.Be warned, however, this is not an easy game.  I died a lot. Many of the reviews I read referenced that fact, and contributed to some of the lower scores.  I played on the standard difficulty and still died a lot, but I didn't mind, because the difficulty is part of what made this game so good.  Know these things going in, and you will have a great time with this game.  The current price of the game makes this sleeper a great bargain.  I recommend it, and  really hope there is a sequel.UPDATE MAY 2011:A sequel has indeed been announced.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"More addictive than Caffeine...","reviewText":"As I've mentioned in many Wii game reviews: I'm not a primary Wii player, and most Wii games have been pretty poor.This game changes both!I picked this up for my wife after she read online reviews from [...] .  I let her play for about 10 minutes, then commandered the controller for the rest of the night!The skinny - in this game you pretty much knock stuff down, blow stuff up, and create fantastic digital messes out of blocks and balls.  It's very easy to compare to Jenga, though pulling blocks out of towers is only a portion of what this game will make you do.  Most of the time you'll be slinging bowling balls, tennis balls, baseballs, or even rubber bouncing balls at ornate and elaborate piles of blocks trying to knock down some or all of them in the quest for bronze, silver or gold medals.  A gold might require doing so in a certain period of time, or using a minimal number of throws.The game is simply addictive beyond belief.  Most puzzles are easily accomplished, but earning Gold can be quite difficult, take multiple tries, and require lots of time to analyze.  This is far from bad however, as the thrill of discovery and success strongly outweighs any frustration by far.Probably the most engaging part of the game is the creation mode, which allows you to build a puzzle entirely on your own.  The learning curve is very easy, and though it took me four hours to build a puzzle encompassing over 7 chain reactions, it was an absolute blast the entire time.  Folks, this is digital legos at it's FINEST.The ONLY gripe I have is that - when building your own puzzle - you can't really advertise WHAT the purpose of the puzzle IS.  For my puzzle, my goal is to free an extra-large gem block from a humongous pile of wooden blocks with just one throw of a baseball.  It can be done, though it's anything but clear how to do it.  Now finished, I can send the puzzle through the Wii Connect internet service.  But when my friend receives the puzzle, there's no way to tell them what my goal is!  I can tell them they only have one throw, but as soon as they throw the ball, a window pops up that says \"You have met the goal\" and ends the game!  You can't even watch to see what happens.  The only way around this is to remove all requirements (such as throws or time,) and accompany the puzzle with an email or message (not sure if Wii even allows this) to explain what the challenge is.But, that being said, I replayed my own challenge over and over again because the explosion at the end of the chain reaction was simply awe-inspiring.  The realism of the physics is quite convincing - large blocks are harder and slower to move than small blocks.  Large \"bomb\" blocks yield larger explosions than smaller blocks, etc.With over 300 puzzles included in the game, plus the ability to create countless more, Boom Blox is a game that rewards players of all ages with hours and hours of entertaining and challenging fun.  These are the games that remind us we don't need guns and gore to entertain.Lastly, the inclusion of multiplay opens up Boom Blox to group fun - though it should be noted that it's better as a competition than a co-op game.  Though co-op is possible in the various Jenga stages, it's simply not quite as much fun.  There's also arcade-style shooting games, but these get old very quickly.  The competition series involve bombing opponents castles with bowling balls, and is a LOT of fun, though we quickly learned that while I could sling a bowling ball into a castle with catastrophic amounts of damage, my wife couldn't seem to get as much power behind her throws, and thus was never able to keep up.  There are other competition games which require you to push your blocks into colored score zones.  These too are a lot of fun and rely more on strategy than strength.The game also has an entertaining soundtrack of catchy arcade tunes and hilarious animal sound affects.  Get Boom Blox - I truely believe this game has something for everyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2008"}

I was watching the gameplay footage upon release and I told myself that I have to get this.  I haven't played SimCity since the SNES version and SimCity 5 peaked my interest again into the series.  When I found out you have to always be online to play this game due to EAs draconian DRM measures, I decided against it because it makes no sense to always having to be online to play a single player game.  So therefore I downloaded SimCity 4 instead, and now I am addicted.I didn't have any issues this far with the monitor settings, it automatically adjusted to the optium setting.  As for the download, it was fairly quick and the installation took a mere 5 minutes.  Once I booted the game up I did the tutorials so I could get familiar with the game.  While the tutorials are somewhat helpful when it comes to placing schools, and other buildings, it never mentioned neighboring cities.  When I loaded up my first region my industry demand was really high and I was creating a lot of pollution in my city really early in the game.  Then I realized that you can connect neighboring cities and put all the industry in there, therefore reducing pollution at where your sims live.  But once you get that going and start building your city slowly but surely you will have traffic jams, demand for fire stations, and start building schools.  There a lot of details that you have to watch out for that a casual gamer may feel overwhelmed at first, but if you are patient, you will naturally learn how to expand your city as it grows.Gameplay 4/5The presentation of this game felt clunky at times.  I didn't know what all the icons stood for and it was hard for me to find out where to micromanage your funds at first.  Once again the tutorials were lacking a tutorial of how to use the the interface.  I would highly recommend watching a few youtube videos of people playing this game before you go into it.  Even after 10 hours into the game, I still find certain interfaces that I had not idea about that could of been really beneficial when I started building my region.Presentation 3/5A lot of people are stating they are having issues with their monitor settings, especially with widescreen monitors.  I have not yet experienced any issues and the game automatically optimized all my graphic settings to high.  The graphics still holds up even though this is a 10 year old game.  They aren't the best but they are good and fun to look at.  Graphics do tend to get choppy from time to time in a heavily dense area, but they smooth out fairly quickly.  If you bought a computer within the last 5 years, I think you should be fine in the graphics department.Graphics: 4/5Overall:  I think this game is great and it is very addictive.  Instead of building a city, you are building a region with connecting cities.  There are no limits to creativity with this game.  It is sad to see EA and Maxis going the always online DRM route because SimCity 5 looks more sharper and the gameplay looks great, but I refuse to pay for $60 to just rent a game.  Not to mention I heard there are a lot of micro-transactions within the game itself.  This game, you don't have to be connected, their are a ton of community mods out there and I will be trying them out soon, and after 10 years of this games release, it is still supported by a great community of gamers.  If you are looking for a great city building game, look no farther than to SimCity 4!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2013"}

Bakehorn","summary":"Tickle me pink","reviewText":"When Nintendo announced that they were bringing a new Super Mario Brothers game to the DS, the majority of gamers out there rejoiced. Critics ranted and raved, Mario's upcoming game would be the true return to platforming that has been long overdue. But Nintendo unveiled Super Princess Peach as well, and it looked as though Peach wouldn't get any sort of praise for her would-be platforming goodness. Well, I'm here for you, Peach. Super Princess Peach is actually, and you're hearing this correctly, a good DS game with few gameplay problems to speak of. Once you put down your chicken-boobs-and-beer manliness and adapt to the pink, fuzzy, cute Peach charm, you can learn to love the gameplay concepts found within.Peach plays almost the same as a typical Mario game, but Peach's lighter weight makes her a little less likely to cause harm by jumping on the heads of incoming attackers. Instead, Peach uses a trusty umbrella to attack everything in her way, as well as four different \"vibe\" powers that are activated by touching large buttons on the bottom of the screen. Throughout the typical platforming levels, which feature tons of enemies, simple but clever puzzles, and elusive collectible items, Peach can find coins that can be spent in Toad's Store for even more abilities.The vibe powers that Peach has are interesting aspects in themselves. They're used for attacking, travel, and puzzles, something that definitely goes below the surface of the \"travel from left to right\" gameplay that Mario and Sonic games have so often supported. One of Peach's vibes is the \"Joy\" vibe, which sends Peach happily floating in the sky. This vibe lets her float, fly, and conjure a cyclone to blow things away. Another vibe is the \"Anger\" vibe, which sets Peach on fire when activated. Peach's fiery body incinerates enemies while she stomps along. The stomping even allows Peach to hurt bigger enemies (like the Wiggler boss) and stomp on switches. The third vibe, the \"Sad\" vibe, sends peach wailing, her tears being used to douse flames or water plants. While crying, Peach travels very quickly, allowing players to run and jump around at higher speeds. The last of the four vibes is \"Calmness\", which restores her health at the sake of losing some extra Vibe \"juice\", the fuel that powers her ability to use emotions.Despite the amount of moves and abilities players can gain in Peach, one shouldn't assume that it's a difficult game. Every level is rather easy, even in the later parts of the game. Finding the Toads that are lost in each level (just one of the several \"elusive collector items\" I mentioned earlier) is just a matter of searching each room until you come across a very obvious, large, pink, and bouncy box. Some of the boss fights required effort, though Wiggler was particularly annoying, and it took me about four lives to put the angry worm down. Sadly, this is the place where Peach breaks a nail; the gameplay is fun, but the game isn't very long at all. I would estimate that the average player could beat this game in a few quiet sittings. All of the unlockable items are an added bonus to those gamers that want to get everything in the game, but going back through every easy level to find hidden items isn't necessarily the most enjoyable thing to do.Sadly, Peach also isn't the most technically advanced game. The graphics want to scream \"old-school\", but if the DS is capable of recreating a Nintendo 64 classic like Super Mario 64 with improved visuals, certainly Nintendo could do a little more than make a fresh Peach sprite and new sprites for enemies like Goombas and Koopa-Troopas. Peach is like that moderately-attractive girl that is appealing once you get to know her, but doesn't look like anything special at first glance.Super Princess Peach isn't just a game for your little sister, or your daughter, or your girlfriend. It's an entertaining platforming game in its own right. It may only take a few hours to complete, but it goes to show that the plumber in red isn't the only Nintendo star who can steal some limelight. I'd highly recommend this game to DS owners, especially those of you who enjoyed Super Mario 64, Kirby's Canvas Curse, or Yoshi's Touch & Go on the handheld. Until Mario steals the show with the \"New Super Mario Brothers\" later this spring, Peach is your best handheld platforming outlet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2006"}

I asked her to pick up the 360 version, but whatever the game is still cool... Even with the inferior PS3 controller. I have yet to notice the glitches that everyone else has, but then again I have only played the game for about 12 hours. The graphics, in my opinion are decent; certainly better than most people here have said. The one annoying thing that I have noticed is how the the ai keeps repeating the same little phrases over and over again. It doesn't really get to be a problem, it's just something I've noticed. Also, I wouldn't purchase this game looking for a really deep story line or anything like that. Like the title of this review says, it's all about blowing s--t up. try Bioshock for a deep story, buy this game for good drunken fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000GE7O9K","description":"Oblivion is the most richly detailed and vibrant game-world ever created. This new chapter uses next-generation technologies to create a fully immersive gaming adventure.","reviewerName":"R. Awbrey \"cbandico\"","summary":"Excellent Game","reviewText":"I know, I know...everybody loves this game, right?  Well there's a reason for that.  Oblivion is a superb game.  Along with Gears of War it is an absolute must buy for any 360 owner regardless of genre preference.  The grapics, gameplay, and storyline are all extremely tight.That being said there are a few downsides but they are nearly all in comparison to the prior episode in the series, Morrowind.  1) The number of factions within the game is reduced.  This naturally reduces the number of questions, storyline interactions, etc.  2) Between the various factions there isn't the same level of consequence.  In certain quest of Morrowind, completing the quest either got you expelled from another faction or prevented you from join it.  This added a more realistic feeling and made you get more creative in quest completions. 3) Training has been extremely limited.  You're only limited to 10 total training levels per character level.  This may just be me but I don't particularly like that.The other two things are more personal preference.  The \"level\" of enemies and items can go either way.  I see why Bethesda did it but I liked the other way better.  The other thing is a lack of multiplayer.  I don't personally want a multiplayer aspect in this type of game but some people might.Again, overall a fantastic game.  Definately a must buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2007"}
{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"Joe Rhodes \"JR\"","summary":"Great, not epic","reviewText":"Skyward Sword is basically the hybrid of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess.  All 3 games have pros and cons, I like them all about the same.  None of them are as great as Ocarina of time in my opinion.  But let's talk about this game. There are a couple spoilers in here about the final boss, for Skyward Sword virgins.What I liked:Bosses.  These bosses were definitely a lot more challenging and creative than predecessors.Dungeons.  The dungeons were also very challenging and had me stumped a few times.Remote.  It can be very frustrating getting used to, but it is pretty fun once you do.Creativity.  This particular Zelda, although similar to others as I mentioned, delivers a creative world with new features that I really liked, like the silent realm.What I didn't like:Music.  The music in my opinion is crappy compared to previous Zelda games.Story.  The basic story is nice, but nothing is really revealed to you about \"Demise\" and the history besides the beginning and end of the game.  After beating the game, I didn't feel as satisfied as I do with other games.  Maybe because Demise doesn't really make a big impact at all (I mean come on the guy doesn't really seem to care once you beat him)Harp.  Blows compared to the ocarina.  Playing it was a pain in the you-know-what too.There are other little things I didn't like, like the item check and shields in the Bazaar.  Also, how about how Zelda looks?  She's hot in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess, but in here 'not so much'.Tycoon wallet is another thing that's ridiculous.  It holds 9000 rupees, and you can't get it until the end of the game (when you purchased basically everything).Looks like there's a lot I didn't like, and it is true, sadly.  That said, trust me in that Skyward Sword delivers another great adventure for Link.  I beat it in about a week and even though the story wasn't as compelling as I would've liked, the gameplay makes up for it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B005EQE0YM","description":"","reviewerName":"Patrick H. Nguyen","summary":"Great stereo headset!  high quality, long cord, strong sound, great mic","reviewText":"I can't believe I forgot to review this headset!  I've been using it for almost a year now and this headset is simply fantastic.  The setup is pretty simple but there are a lot of wires.  You connect the headset to a USB port to power the headset.  You connect the audio as a passthrough between your 360 console and your audio output (speakers, receiver, etc).  And lastly, you connect the headset to your 360 controller for the mic.  The headset has a breakout box for controlling volume and bass boost as well as a mic mute toggle switch.  You also have a volume control for the chat function as well which is really useful to set the right balance between hearing your friends and hearing the game audio.Note that if you're using HDMI to connect your 360 to your TV, you may need to purchase a $5 audio adapter.  If you don't want to buy the adapter, you may be able to use the RCA outputs on your TV or receiver if they have that feature available for output.  If you're using VGA or component, than the $5 audio adapter is not necessary as those cables already have stereo RCA outputs.The length of cord is extremely long.  You can play across the room with this cord so it's great for a family room setup when you're many feet away from the TV.  I do have a twisting problem with the cable which is annoying.  I tried to hang the cable so that it would straighten out but as soon as you bring the cable down, it'll twist all over the place.The headset is pretty light and comfortable.  It does go over your ears so if you're gaming for extended periods of time, your ears will beg you to take breaks so they can breathe.  The mic boom is extremely long and extremely flexible.  You can put it in virtually any position you can imagine.  The mic is extremely sensitive and will pick up everything, from the creaking of your chair to people talking in the background.  There is zero noise cancellation with this boom.  In fact, the mic is so sensitive, my friends complained when I put the boom directly in front of and near my mouth.  So I basically have the boom going completely straight and I sound great to my friends.  No more the days of having your cheap 360 headset boom practically in your mouth.You can also rotate the boom up and out of the way during the times you don't need to chat or when you want to listen to music.The sound is great for a stereo headset.  The bass boost is effective and while you'll never mistake these for audiophile headphones, you'll enjoy them in your gaming.  Note that these are only stereo so positional sound is not so great in gaming.  This headset will not give you any sort of gaming advantage over external speakers.  However, if you combine this headset with a surround sound audio processor, this headset does offer a great competitive edge.  For 5.1 surround sound, I have my X12 headset hooked up to my DSS2 processor which is an awesome processor!  Check out my DSS2 review for further details.  With the DSS2 and X12, you can pinpoint where all the bad guys are.  I was playing Left 4 Dead 2 and I could hear spitters, boomers, etc. to the point that I could hunt them rather than wait for them to pounce on me.  I could tell if they were above and behind me, in front and below me, etc.  They couldn't hide!  It truly is amazing to game in 5.1 surround.You'll love this headset.  A great benefit of course is the big sound as well as being able to play loud games without bothering other people in the house.  Being wired, you never worry about having to recharge or replace batteries.  I wholly recommend the X12 headset as well as the DSS2 processor.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2012"}

The elevator battle towards the end of the game is the most poorly designed aspect in recent memory.  After more than 20 tries, I just couldn't beat it.  Whenever that happens, you know that a game is fatally flawed.Let's break it down, shall we?  You encounter this elevator battle about 80% into the game, and you're stuck in it with Farah trying to slay hordes of monsters.  You not only have to stay alive yourself, but you also have to make sure that Farah doesn't die (an impossible feat).  If you don't die, she does; and if she doesn't die, you eventually do.  It's a lose-lose situation, especially within the confines of such small a space.There are fountains on either side of the raised area within the elevator, but do you think you can use them to restore your life during the battle?  NO!  That's flaw number one.  Number two:  the camera angles are AWFUL.  Every single time at some point(s) in the battle, the camera would move behind a curtain, thereby obstructing your view and leaving you open to needless attack.  Three:  this game has HORRIBLE jumping mechanics.  Where you want the prince to jump, he jumps the other way.  Performing precise wall-run attacks during this battle is near impossible to execute on point each time.  Then, vaulting over enemies doesn't work all the time either.

They've changed the formula quite a bit, to the point that it kind of loses whatever it was that made MvC2 such a classic among fighting game fans. But is that such a bad thing? It may seem so at first but believe it or not, the game is actually pretty good once you sink your teeth into it.The graphic presentation obviously makes up the biggest difference here from MvC2. The game uses the MT Framework engine used in Resident Evil 5 and no matter what you may or may not think about that game in particular, there's no denying that it had spectacular graphics. Same goes here with the characters being rendered in full 3D models that fight on a 2D plane, very much like Street Fighter 4 did. This allows for some pretty spectacular specials and a veritable light show taking place in just about every match. Some may cry foul that they've moved away from hand drawn sprites but as long as the game isn't trying to play on a 3D plane, then we're good as far as I'm concerned.The character roster takes a hit and I was pretty sad to see a lot of my favorites get left out. You're bound to find characters you will enjoy playing with and some surprising additions. I thought M.O.D.O.K. was actually an inspired inclusion, even if his character controls horribly. It does suck that we've lost something like twenty characters, give or take but if there's one thing I can freely say, it's that the game actually feels a lot more balanced than MvC2 does. MvC2 was capable of some truly one sided mismatches on many occasions and it doesn't really feel like that's a problem here. Granted, there is some cheapness with some of these characters moves and tactics but overall, they did a really good job of making sure the game is more or less balanced.The gameplay has been dumbed down a bit, with the controls being relegated to three attack buttons and the addition of a \"special\" button that serves as the pop-up initiator, whereas before you had to press down and hit them with a fierce attack to setup the air combo. I liked how it was initially because it felt like you had to work to pull it off. A properly executed air combo is still a thing of beauty when done right, its just been made a lot simpler to do. It feels like the game in general has been simplified quite a bit to usher in newcomers in the audience but don't let your fears get to you as the game is still quite deep. Calling in your teammates has been made simpler too and once you get used to it and how they work in terms of pulling off team specials, it becomes second nature. There are a few general additions to the gameplay that make getting ridiculous combos a lot more fun, like three tiered air combos where all the characters on your team can get involved. You also get a license card that allows you to look at your stats as well as anyone else playing over Xbox Live. Very nice touch there. In the end, yeah they've changed the gameplay but if you can get past that, you'll enjoy the game very much.It took me a bit to warm up to it but I think this game has a lot more going for it than people might suspect upon first playing it. I know some of you are upset that Guile was cut or that the graphics are all \"3Dish\". I say, just let the past go. You can still go back and play MvC2 whenever you want. I would definitely suggest getting your hands on this because its a hell of a lot of fun and still a blast to play with your friends and enemies.Last but not least, the music is INFINITELY better than MvC2's. And they somehow managed that while keeping the \"Take You For a Ride\" song in there in a remix form.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"GTA V Is a Great Game, Still Lags Classic GTA Titles","reviewText":"Well, I'm not sure how much good my review will do. There are currently in excess of 600 reviews for GTA V for the PS3 on Amazon so this will likely get lost in the shuffle. I recently completed GTA V's main storyline and logged in about a dozen hours on GTA Online so I finally feel qualified to write a review.As my title suggests, GTA V is a very good video game though it isn't perfect and in my opinion lacks some of the major elements that made previous GTA titles so addictingly fun and endearing.--------------------GAMEPLAY:One of the major changes to GTA is that for the first time the game features three main playable characters - Franklin, Michael and Trevor. Each character has their own story arc and start independent of each other though at some point during the main story they start weaving together until they're working as a team on various missions. The main story is both excellent in terms of entertainment value (missions are interesting) and in terms of production quality. All of the voice acting and writing is top-notch stuff and my wife even commented that the game resembled a television show in more than one way. Rockstar definitely knows how to put an interesting story together and in that sense GTA V does not disappoint.For GTA fans the gameplay in GTA V will be immediately familiar. The camera returns to it's behind the player/above the shoulder perspective that's held true since GTA III on the PS2. Major elements such as shooting and driving remain very similar to the original formula as well though tweaked and refined.The major change in my opinion from GTA IV to GTA V is the vehicle controls. Mainly, they're better in GTA V. Vehicles in GTA IV always felt a bit like they were being driven on ice. And while that can be the case in GTA V, the controls are noticeably tighter and improve along with your character's experience.That brings up another major element - experience. Each of your three characters has experience in major areas - driving, shooting, flying, stamina, stealth and a few more. As you drive vehicles for example you gain experience and notice that cars will handle better. Instead of spinning out when making sharp turns at high speeds you'll find yourself better able to take risks while driving and having those risks pay off more often than not.Missions are presented in the traditional GTA fashion but the most exciting new element is the addition of \"heists\". Heists differ from run of the mill missions in that they require much more preparation, have feature multiple ways to accomplish the heist, and feature better rewards - namely greater sums of cash. Before you can start a heist for example you may need to steal uniforms or a fire truck to blend in with first responders. You may have to scope out a bank or jewelry store to \"case\" the establishment. Finally, you have to recruit NPCs to join on your heist. Each member of the team gets a cut of the take and the better the NPC the more their cut. NPCs can be found by completing missions, introduced by main characters or found by accomplishing random events that pop up as you traverse through Los Santos.--------------------GRAPHICS:I'm both a console and PC gamer. I get that the graphics in GTA V may be disappointing to hardcore PC gamers but given the age and limited hardware of consoles, Rockstar has put together a really good looking game. Character models, vehicles and the environment are sharp and vibrant. GTA V also features a full day/night cycle and weather cycles that add realism to the large world they've crafted. Tearing across a city scape with cars exploding, police on your trail and citizenry fleeing for cover is as impressive as ever.Vehicles feature a slew of customization options including everything from wheels, paint jobs, window tint, performance tunes to the engine, transmission; armor add-on's, bullet proof tires and more.--------------------GTA Online:Right now I'm not a huge fan of GTA Online. The groundwork is still being set and Rockstar seems ambitious about plans including heists (large operations that result in large payouts) and more missions but right now GTA Online is about racing and doing some odd missions with strangers. There are a lot of griefers out there with nothing better to do than ruin your fun by crashing into you, killing you and just being a nuisance overall. Rockstar has implemented a reputation system where folks are marked as \"good sport/bad sport\" and eventually bad sports are supposed to be lumped together but I've yet to run into many \"good sports\".In addition to performing missions online you can also buy properties in the form of apartments. Each apartment costs money and features everything from basic units to sprawling luxury units with 10-car garages.Again, the groundwork is there and rumors are many heists are incoming so this is a feature that I expect should get better with time.--------------------THE GOOD:(+) Excellent production values including voice acting, mission structure, and writing.(+) The missions are varied and overall excellent providing an engaging and entertaining story.(+) A LOT to do especially compared to GTA IV that was horribly deficient in side-missions.(+) Graphics are great(+) Missions can be replayed instantly right from the in-game menu.--------------------THE BAD:(-) The character customization options in GTA: San Andreas is deeper. What happened to the ability to workout or gorge on food that impacted your character appearance?(-) Vehicles can be customized but again lacking compared to San Andreas. Where are the lowriders Rockstar?(-) Elements like pizza delivery, ambulance, police and RC plane/copter missions are still missing from GTA V and are missed.(-) Many and varied radio stations yet still the weakest music lineup of the modern GTA games.(-) Some technical problems continue to plague the game - vehicles and aircraft still disappear from my garage which is aggravating given the expense and difficulty in acquiring some of them.(-) GTA Online needs more TLC before this becomes a '+'","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

Sam Fisher is geared up to infiltrate high-security strongholds, seize critical intelligence, destroy threatening data, and neutralize the enemy--all without leaving a trace.","reviewerName":"Christopher J. Martin","summary":"Incredible game that's so very deep!","reviewText":"The best aspect of this game is that every one of its eight missions is extremely deep and takes a good long while to finish. You can't finish the game in just one night at all.Some missions require more stealth than others, including one mission in which you're not allowed to kill anyone at all, simply disable them.The graphics in this game are absolutely incredible, nearly the quality of SOCOM or SOCOM II. The drawback is that each mission is linear and can only be completed one way, in contrast to SOCOM's &quot;free ranging&quot; style. That's especially frustrating when you're encountering particularly difficult enemies, and they usually pop up just before you get to a point in your mission where you're allowed to save.While each mission is very long, don't fear, if you die you don't have to go back and complete the entire mission. There are several &quot;checkpoints&quot; in each mission and if you die, you simply go back to the last checkpoint and begin again, but with more knowledge on how to complete the level.The storyline is also quite engrossing and relevent to today's world. Your character is Sam Fisher, a NSA operative that needs to help save the United States from cyber terrorist attacks sponsored by the deposed President of the former Soviet republic of Georgia. You also have real life weapons or prototypes of weapons that will be in the US arsenal in a few years, as well as the use of infared and night vision scopes.For those that like shooter games, this game isn't always all stealth and sneaking around. You've got plenty of levels where your entire goal is to kill any enemy you come across and don't even have to worry about hiding their bodies or anything.This game really has it all.The only drawbacks I think in the game is the aiming just isn't very precise and the game lacks the ability for your character to go prone and shoot, it only lets you crouch. Even when you're carrying a weapon with a sniper scope and crouching, your scope just won't aim correctly for more than a second or two before it bounces off target. Each level also seems to never allow you enough ammo so you find yourself having to invent ways to kill enemies when the best course of action would be a shot to the head...but you're out of ammo.Even despite those drawbacks, this game is a great buy. The next version of the game will be out in 2004. In order to understand the premise of that game and your character Sam Fisher, you really should pick this one up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2003"}

We forgot to make a Mario 2 for North America!\"So they made one out of Japan-only game Doki Doki Panic. And everybody liked it...until they found out what was done to make it.Super Mario Bros 2 differed a lot from the first Mario game. Mainly because of its origin. You throw veggies at your enemies, there's a mini-boss at the end of every level, you get to choose from 4 characters, and Bowser isn't the main enemy. And you know what? All that was awesome. The music and sounds were kind of what you expected in a Mario game, but note: Doki Doki Panic had the same music and sounds.The graphics, while of course, used from Doki Doki Panic, were still pretty impressive.Overall, while this wasn't designed to be a Mario game, it was a lot of fun like one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

Nintendo has been in the industry so long that many of us grew up with a Nintendo console in the home. Nintendo revolutioniized the gamin industry with the introduction of the Nintendo Entertainment System back in the 1980's. Bottom line Nintendo has been producing games and consoles for over 20 years and they are the seasoned vetrans of the gaming world. You can't go wrong with a company like that.Nintendo released the Gamecube in November of 2001, thats two years ago to this date. Since then sales of the \"Cube\" as some call it, or \"GC\", have fallen like a boulder. However in September 2003, Nintendo announced that they would reduce the price of the Gamecube to $100. In the first week sales doubled and just recently they annoucned that their weekly sales in October had quadroupled. Its kinda sad to see that people waited so long to purchase such an excellent console.Now with the reduced price, sales are going through the roof. Parents and yound adults are looking in the direction of Nintendo, attracted by the price cuts. Normally their glances would have left out close inspection and they would have looked at that black tower, or the giant green X. But $100 is attractive to anyone and upon closer inspection they found an excellent console that was much much much better than any other console out there.GAMESNintendo produces quality games. No human being can deny that fact, they have always released quality and visually impressive games. However, when compared to the Playstation 2, the Gamecube may seem not to have as many games, but it sure does make up for lack of games with quality. Even if a console did have a huge selection of great games, how many people out there have enought money to purchase all 99 of those so called \"great games\"? Not me and I doubt anyone else is unlike me. So, by coming out with quality games, Nintendo has a few games, but nearly all of them are excellent.-Mario Cart: Double Dash!-F-Zero GX-Mario Sunshine-Star Wars Rouge Squadren Series-Mario Party series-Mario Golf-Zelda SeriesKeep in mind folks that all of the above games are exclusives, meaning that no other console out there features the game. If you want the oprotunity to buy these games, the Gamecube is the only possible solution. Most games are kid friendly, making this an excellent choice for the parent worried about their kids. I have no idea where the \"kiddie\" conontation came from. Nintendo has never been a \"kiddie\" company, and I am outraged that many folks haven't bought a Gamcube because of this.CONTROLLER-Nintendo produces the best controller on the market and also are the only company to produce a first party wireless controller; The Nintendo Wavebird.CONSOLE-The cool looking cube is visually attractive and comes in Black, Blue, and Silver. The small compact design is awsome for anyone who wishes to transport the console over to a friends or parents home. A carrying handle is permanently attached to the cube.Well thats pretty much it. I recenlty bought a Gamcube in August right before the price cut and I love it more than my Playstation 2 which I have over 61 games for and have had since Chirstmas 2000.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2003"}

You can use a sword, a bow, daggers, a staff, magic, and use can use like 4 different types of weapons at once.  You can block with a shield, roll, go in sword swinging, use stealth and do a silent kill with daggers, lots of options for varied combat.The character models look good.  I play as a female and the armor makes her look like a female even her helmet.  And some of the swords are as big as the character.Tons of quests and enemies and big bosses.There are combos you can use and allot of character customization from the look of your character to increasing different attributes and learning combos when you level up.The tutorial is integrated good into the game so it does not seem like a tutorial.Just about everything that they could have done right is in this game.If you like rpg's but need some fast fluid arcade like combat this is the game for you.The game seems huge.  Been playing for 5hrs and finished 4 or 5 quests.  Only 1 mission based.  A lot of the quests have more than one part and this makes them seem better than just killing this guy or getting this item.  They seem more like an adventure.  I would say so far good story.Loading times are quick.Also something rare for a 3rd person game.  So far no bugs.Usually when I get a game I am thinking about the next big thing that is coming out.

I also grew up in the Boston area, and thought it would be fun to play a video game based in that city. The historical setting definitely made for a unique gaming experience. I also enjoyed seeing famous figures from history such as Franklin and Washington in a video game. The variety of fighting environments (such as a tall ship) was fun as well.As many have reported, the amount of glitches in the game was slightly annoying. Riding a horse was especially frustrating. Also, being a newcomer to the series made a lot of the cut scenes irrelevant or nonsensical to me (especially the modern day sequences). I wish I had read more about the back story before starting the game.Finally, I'd have to say this was one of the easier games I've played. There are really no challenging missions.  As a casual gamer, this is something I actually appreciate.Overall, I wouldn't classify this as a superb game, but it is worth checking out if you are interested in this time period.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2013"}

The characters are well known, and rendered graphically with great care and are completely true to the original.2. The story is tied in very well to the original movies - whether it is Evil Dr. Pork Chop, or Rex's attempt to beat Zurg in a video game - everything finds a nice tie-in between this game and the movies.3. The game is challenging enough, but not too much. At every stage, there are innumerable hints to get little players unstuck. In addition to an outline of the particular move, the specific key combinations that are necessary are also provided.4. The game does not get boring - it takes the form of a number of mini-stories. Each mini story is complete in itself, and has a goal to achieve.5. The game is also very forgiving. A character's death has no effect on the story. You simply begin right where you left off, with no penalty.6. There are various \"flavors\" - shoot 'em up arcade, first person like interactivity, or third person over-the-shoulder action, and even straight forward platformer. It really amazed me how many types of games were mashed in so seamlessly.7. In addition to the linear story line, there's an open story line, called Toy Box mode, where you can wander around in an open world, accomplishing missions, and collecting points, coins, and ammo.Overall a very competent and well designed production, and ideal for its core audience. Recommended without reservations.Happy Gaming!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}

But it's still full price. Still, I gave it a whirl.As is the case with the previous two installments, the songs are all covers. Some are 80s icons and done really well - \"Burning for You,\" \"Radar Love,\" \"Turning Japanese.\" But many are done poorly - as a classic metal fan, I was sorely disappointed with the Iron Maiden classic \"Wrathchild\" being, in a word, terrible.Remember all that extra stuff you could buy in GH2? Yeah, it's not here. I played the game on medium and unlocked almost everything - Grim Ripper and a few guitars. There's no extra songs or costumes.Basically, this is a GH2 expansion pack marketed as a stand-alone game. There's enough here to keep you occupied for an afternoon, but then it's back on the shelf while you play any other version of Guitar Hero because Rock the 80s has so little to offer.

Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"Faceplant","reviewText":"It seems incomprehensible that Logitech would take the time to build such a heavy and well put-together piece of equipment, ensure sound body construction, turnable guitar pegs and even a false bridge, and fail in the ways that are actually important.#1 - Fret ThisThe biggest and most glaring problem with this guitar is the fret design, feel, and functionality. This and the strum bar are like the most obvious parts of what I think should be considered when taking the time to build a guitar controller, but I guess I have to explain it when talking about this one.I understand that when building guitar controllers, it is all about trade off. Do you make the frets raised or flush, loose or sticky, how far apart do you space them? The first thing I noticed when I took the guitar out of the box was how far apart the fret buttons are spaced. However, I then realized that thinking they were spaced further apart than the normal Guitar Hero guitar controllers is just an illusion created by the extra width and length of the neck of the guitar. The problem is that even though the guitar is the largest controller I have ever used, the buttons are the same size as every other guitar controller from the Guitar Hero people. If you're going to make a larger guitar, make the buttons larger too. They don't have to be abnormally large, but it makes it very difficult to do hammer-ons and pull-offs when the frets are spaced as they are.The second problem with the frets is their shape. They are almost rectangular, which isn't a problem, but the fact that they have sharp sides is. What this means for someone like me, who plays on Expert, is that when I have fast hammer-ons of pull-offs, it's hard to slide my fingers down or up the neck of the guitar. I'm sure in time it is something I could learn to adapt to, but it seems like something that wasn't even considered. A smart guitar controller would be easy to use for people playing on beginner, but be advanced enough to meet the needs of someone playing on expert. The frets should have been more tapered at the edges, and either closer together, of just generally bigger to accommodate faster finger movement.Lastly, as far as the frets go, I have also already experienced problem with the blue button not registering when playing a chord. This is something that takes time with the guitar hero controllers to break in, but honestly, we're about four years past the release of Guitar Hero 2, it's time these people designing the controllers get with the program. From the get, Rock Band guitar controllers have never had problems with the fret buttons. They are plagued by their own set of problems, but the frets are something they do absolutely right.#2 - Strummer? -- I don't even know'er!There isn't a whole lot to complain about as far as the strum bar goes. It is stiff like I like it (that's what she said?), and there is a satisfying click when you strum (I know a lot of people prefer the silent strum bars, and I understand that, I'm not knocking this guitar for trying to please people on both sides of the aisle). This next part is going to be difficult to explain. I, and I don't know how many others do it like this, strum THROUGH the strum bar when I play. I guess picture someone playing the string of a real guitar, brushing their thumb against the string to play the note. That is how I play these guitar controllers. And while I have not yet had any trouble with over-sensitivity (strumming once and having the game read it as a double-strum when the strum bar springs back into place), when I strum through the notes, the controller makes a weird FLOINKing noise that is even more grating than the loud clicking that accompanies most of the first and second gen. Guitar Hero controllers.#3 - A Little Rough Around the EdgesI understand that this controller was designed to mimic a realistic (albeit still scale) guitar. But when you're going to sacrifice comfort for realism, my question is why? I play for maybe an hour or so a day, using this controller has hurt my right wrist, left forearm, and the bottom joints in my fingers. The neck of the guitar has pretty hard and sharp edges, and when you are moving your hand up and down the neck a lot, it is going to hurt your fingers. I ended up taking sandpaper to the edges to round them out and make it easier and more comfortable to play. This was not difficult to do, but the fact remains that it is something that should have been taken into consideration when designing it.Second, the butt of the guitar is the same way. While more rounded, there is no comfortable position to rest your strumming arm on the guitar without rubbing your forearm raw. Again I ended up putting a piece of foam held in place with double sided tape, to stop my arm from getting hurt. If you don't play on expert, you should really be fine with this guitar, and shouldn't experience very many problems, but this thing really wasn't built for the serious guitar gamer. That sounds dumb to say, but it's the truth.The spacing of the frets, and how loose they are, makes it so that you want to press down hard on them to ensure that you don't miss chords because the guitar isn't reading you as pressing the button down enough, really has hurt my wrist as well. The longer neck and the spaced frets places your wrist at an awkward angle. This is the first guitar controller that really has hurt my wrist, and that is a problem. When there are so many stupid problems plaguing something you're going to be using a lot, you eventually start to see that it just isn't worth it to keep using.In conclusion, if you don't play on expert, you will probably love this guitar. It's heavy, solid, and really cool. I mean it really is, I'm not denying it. But it really wasn't built with function at it's core. It's more showy than actually practical.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2010"}

The graphics are nice, but that's not enough. In the same way as Sony's PS4, Microsoft decided to remove many key features from this iteration of their next console (standard on the 360) without really any explanation.Pros* Controller sits in your hand nicely* Controller uses AA batteries which will give solid battery life* Tiles interface is similar to Xbox 360, works nicely (though a little dumbed down)* Snap App is amazingly awesome, can share videos on Skydrive (after rendering them)* Has CD player app* Has Netflix, Hulu, NFL, Skype* Ryse looks great at 720p* Forza looks great* HDMI pass through is an awesome new feature but... (see cons below)* Comes with Kinect (for that extra $100 kickup)* Blu-ray playerCons* Console gets very hot and it seems to have no fans* Controller trigger are too high up on the controller, should have extended further down* No audio on the controller* No touch pad on the controller* White lighted icon looks cool (on cont, xbox, kinect), for first 5 minutes then gets annoying really fast* Console is much bigger than Xbox 360* Tiles interface can make it difficult to find settings and other controls as they get lost* Kinect always-on camera is a creepy bit of privacy intrusion technology* Xbox One will not automatically log into accounts without using Kinect* Snap app doesn't support still snapshots (app is completely misnamed)* Has an insanely huge power brick* Kinect is klunky, heavy and huge* Cannot rip CDs to media library => instead requires network library to play media (or Xbox Music app)* Copying game disks to hard drive is not intuitive and is extremely slow* HDMI => have to leave the Xbox turned on and in TV mode to use it, doesn't work when the unit is off* HDMI lag is definitely noticeable when passing through PS4 or Computer* Cannot HDMI pass Xbox 360 as the 360 goes into 480p 4:3 mode, all others I've tested stay 1080p (can't MS test their own stuff?)* Limited launch titles* No Bluetooth (which means no keyboards, headsets or Bose Soundlink Minis)FeaturesFrankly, I expected a whole more out of this console than the PS4. While it does seem to deliver some new features like the HDMI pass through and a Blu-Ray player, Microsoft chained those features to some odd limitations, odd new choices and turned what should have been a gaming console into a Frankenstein-like device I dub the Frankenbox.  It tries to be too many things and fails at truly being any one of them truly well. Other than gaming, which is what Microsoft should have been solidly focused on, they created this Frankenbox. Microsoft tries to make up for the lack of games with other 'new features' like Snap or by touting Netflix, Crackle or Hulu (as if these weren't on every other TV device out there). For example, Snap tries to be the 'sharing system' similar to PS4, but does it so poorly. The PS4 does it so much better by offering live streaming to Twitch, uploading videos immediately and sharing stills to Twitter. Xbox One requires sharing videos to Skydrive (that no one uses) Worse, sharing a single video requires spending half an hour in a video app converting each video to a viewable formats and then uploading.  Such a waste of time.I realize this is Day One edition in every sense and much can be enhanced by software updates, but some of it cannot be (like heat dissipation).TV ModeWhen using the HDMI input connector to watch video from an external video device, you will find this part extremely buggy. You will find the whole Xbox will outright crash and reboot. Other times, it just shuts off. Sometimes it works perfectly, but because the HDMI pass through is actively processed by the Xbox One, there is a noticeable lag between the output from the other device and the display to your screen. This is not optimal if you're trying to pass in computer screen input. So, mouse movements are slightly off.To top it off, if you hook up the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One HDMI input, the Xbox 360 goes into forced 4:3 480p mode. So you can't even chain the Xbox 360 through the Xbox One. Though, amazingly, you can chain both the PS3 and the PS4 without video sizing issues. Though, the crashing remains constant.The UnitI was surprised to find how hot the XB1 runs. So hot, in fact, that when I touched it I was startled. To help combat the heat, I had originally bought a smallArctic Breeze USB fanto cool some external hard drives, I have since grabbed it and plugged it into the side USB port and it's now blowing across the top of the XB1  to cool it down. I don't understand why Microsoft didn't put fans in it. Considering the heat dissipation problems with the Xbox 360, I am most definitely concerned over the longevity of this unit. Also, I really don't need any more heaters in my room. If you plan on buying an XB1, here's some tips. Don't stack anything on top of it. Don't put it inside an enclosed cabinet. Make sure it has plenty of ventilation. For good measure, you might consider anArctic Breeze USB fan(or two) to help cool it down when playing games.The included Kinect is difficult to install. Yes, they put a tripod mounting hole on the bottom, but where are you supposed to use that?  I'm not sure what Microsoft was thinking here, but it's clear that the Microsoft engineers did not look at current TV flat panel designs to understand how to create a proper mounting bracket. There's just no place to properly secure the Kinect to today's flat panels.GamingWhile the games, so far, seem enticing graphics-wise, the gameplay is really subpar. For example, Ryse's environments are stunning, but the gameplay is average. Worse, in fact, than some games I've already played on the 360. So, while it's great we can slap a new pretty bow onto the games, the bow gets ripped off and tossed really fast. What's left (at least for Ryse) is the actual gameplay which, unfortunately, is below average. This is the same exact problem with Bioshock Infinite.  Eye candy all the way, but the underlying game mechanics were not in any way next gen ready.While the bad game mechanics issue is not technically a next gen console problem, you would think that someone would lay down some gaming laws to force developers to produce not only fabulous looking games, but games that actually have much more realism in the character mechanics, the motion capture animations and in the way the characters interact with the environments. Instead, we're left with a rail fighter using low def mocaps ultimately leaving Ryse far less realistic than it looks.OverallThis day one edition is definitely designed to be the Frankenbox of the console world. I also believe that the Xbox One is running a stripped down version of Windows 8. While Microsoft can easily send updates to improve on the tiled UI interface and features, the physical hardware limitations require a do-over (i.e., no Bluetooth). In fact, I'd expect a new version of the hardware to be available by spring to address the cooling and other missing features.  Ignoring the limited new features, this console is really a step backward from the Xbox 360 today. A lot of the features you came to know in the Xbox 360 have been stripped from this console. What has been added to replace those features are not enticing replacements. The Xbox One is basically bare bones basic.Don't jump into this console thinking you're going to get an Xbox 360 experience. You won't, likely not for many years. You'll be disappointed if you do. Considering it will not play Xbox 360 titles and has extremely limited title selections, I'd highly recommend waiting for Microsoft to improve the Xbox One (at least several months) and allow developers to release more games before jumping into this console.By all means, if you must have the latest greatest console just to see the graphics, then buy one. But, that's the only reason to buy one at this point or unless you really really have to play Forza or Ryse. You will be surprised by its lack of features, the bugginess of the TV feature, the 'big brother' privacy stealing Kinect and the heat. The Xbox One is definitely the future of Microsoft's gaming platform. What concerns me is not the long term viability of this console, but this specific edition of it. It's definitely early and it shows. $499 is a lot of money to spend to get a less experience to what can be had with an Xbox 360.I'd actually give this console 2.5 stars due to the above, but I'm rounding it to 3 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2013"}

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

Engaging and entertaining narrative dialog. I got it cheap off STEAM with 50% discount weekend for around ten dollars. Default controls are simple and work well.Cons: No actual physical media (case & disc) when purchased off STEAM. No DRM that I notice or agreed to during download and installation even though STEAM is already a form in itself. A very BUGGY Xbox 360 console to PC port and inconsistent textures even on Very High setting at 1680x1050 resolution. It's obvious this is a console game first port graphically. I like the RPG elements but very slow game and not for everyone. This game is way OVER HYPED by media fanboys most likely because it's a XBox 360 console game exclusive like all 360 exclusives.I've invested around 10 hrs into this game and most of it is dialog fetch quest related and seldom much action sequence in between. I spent most of my time just completing filler quests one after the other to accrue money. I've got all but one last ally (alien lady) at the moment. The action is okay and unsatisfying mostly due to clunky TPS mechanics, but the dialog interaction is pretty good and similar to Oblivion. This game has an identity crisis and doesn't seem to know if it wants to be Gears of War or something else in the action department. The action mechanics aren't completely bad but weapons cool down and so forth versus quick enemies is just never good combination. So far the action has been easy but the squad ally NPCs are awful and die often (probably intentional as the game is easy at the moment).The adventure aspect is also unsatisfying as non-main quest planets aren't all that interesting. The tank vehicle's controls are also awful similar to Halo jeep third person control but worse and it's action is also unsatisfying.Others: Personally, I like what I've experienced so far overall but this game is far from being as great as the hype surrounding it. Even with STEAM updates the PC version is extremely buggy and I reloaded several times too many. Like Oblivion, this game is over-rated and not for everyone. I've played many JRPGs and several Western action adventure RPGs (Diablo series, Guild Wars, Oblivion, etc.) and this game is just average material.I like the dialog options that changes outcomes of certain events but that alone does not make a game great. I felt Xbox 360 owners (media included) who started playing videogames late are easily impressed by games like this and Bioshock. Overall, I would recommend this version to any PC gamers with a system capable of running it. If you own a 360 you'll probably get a better experience playing it on console with an HDTV because not being able do \"High-Very High\" graphics PC setting you'll be staring at fugliness through all the face cutscene dialogs.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0016NRS8M","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"It's not Oblivion but much more playable than the first Two Worlds!","reviewText":"Let's go in this from the start and say that you need to play this with any expectations to match up to Oblivion will be gone.If you go into Two Worlds II with low to average expectations, you may actually have some fun.This game did nothing more that take bits of Lord of the Rings and Star Wars and mashed it into a pedestrian RPG that may be ok for the dry months of gaming until more AAA titles come along and by the time you have forgotten about this game, Elder Scrolls V will be here.So far it's more playable than the original version. I bought the first one with high expectations and within 3 days I took it back.  This so far looks and plays better and it's MUCH better than Gothic 4 which just came out 2 months ago.The story is somewhat interesting where your character is actually so far working WITH the orcs that occupy Antaloor. It almost starts like Oblivion where you have to escape the King's dungeon and figure out how to rescue your sister Kyra with whom you share a mystical bond with. King Gandohar is torturing her to find out how to get her power so he can become a god and of course, you are what's stopping him from doing so.As per usual, the first few levels act as a bit of a tutorial for you to learn the mechanics of the game. One of the issues that arises of course is there are still some things you have to figure out on your own, one being the lock picking mini game the other is how to create spells for the spell book but at the same time the game takes it time to show you have to kill multiple enemies with a bow.Another little surprise is the ease of switching gear in the game. I was mixed about the fact that I have 3 slots in which to mix and match armor and weapon setting and that you can switch it on the fly.  While it may seem like a good idea in some instances, it takes away from what is usually standard in RPGs that when you go into combat, you go in with the gear you have on and not be able to 'pause, change and fight'.Something else that I caught is that the setting for this game isn't your standard medieval type setting. Most of the game feels more of an African/Middle Eastern/ Asian type of flair although most of the armor looks standard for this type of RPG.Also it's one of those games where your choices do seemingly affect the outcome. For instance, early on, you get a mission to try to get through a gate to get to another city. I have so far the option to: fight my way out, get someone to forge a note, pay someone to smuggle me through work with town leaders to earn their trust to let me out. Not all of them work of course and depending how you do certain sequences, you relationship may change with one or several NPCs based on what you do...that's a big plus for this game.Graphically speaking, it's a fairly decent game but part of the problem that I have with this game is that during daytime sequences, the back drops looks too washed out from the sunlight and no matter how much I adjust the graphics settings, it won't change. But when you do find a happy medium, the game looks pretty decent other wise. There is a lot of texturing and bump mapping that looks just great, when it works the lighting effects really work with the background. The buildings are very well detailed also.  In some places it does tend to look better than Oblivion but considering that was 5 years ago it should! Some of the character models are outstanding including one who has some serious headlight issues going on!!!The character creation is fine and a bit more detailed than what imagined and if it had more hairstyles to choose from it may have even beat Dragon Age in this category.As far as game control goes, it's the one main reason why i have not given up on this game yet. It's pretty easy to get around, use in combat and do what you need to do to get through. Some games of this type fail because they try to make the control scheme overly complicated. But once you get it figured out, you are pretty much set.The only combat issue I have to far (and I will have to refer back to the instruction book) is that creatures you come across you don't always know how and what you can beat. I have beaten things as large as an Ostrich, as fast and numerous as baboons, but a fire ant kills me in two blows...there is an unbalance in that somewhere!That is the other quirky thing with this game. While you still have a number of bizarre monsters to kill, nothing will bug you the most than the fact that you are in a fantasy safari hunt and you track down wild boars, and rhinos.  Well it beats having to always fight dire wolves or enraged rats in other RPGs...LOLThe voice acting in this game is just bad, bad baaaaaaad. It's laughably bad. The guy in the cemetery, the street beggar, heck even your character who sounds suspiciously like Geralt from the Witcher (I mean Two Worlds 2 is another Polish game) try but they all don't quite fit. One leg up it does have is that your character has his own dialogue through out the game.  But this again comes back to that this is not a game done in America by the tops of the industry. There are a few other minor issues where the cut scenes don't quite fade right when transitioning, lip synching sometimes is off and the music rises and ebbs and some of the most peculiar of moments but the bottom line is that this game is more playable than the first one was but you have to be willing to give it a chance. You get tons of gear, an easy crafting guide, on the fly customization, multiple missions and side quests right out of the gate and even a multiplayer side which I have yet to try and it's really a decent package. I repeat if you go in not expecting this to be on the level of Elder Scrolls, then you can do ok.

The problem is the designers tried to pack too many kinds of responses into the the qucktime events, so, you'll often find yourself fumbling with the controls. While you may make decisions you're happy with you'll end up losing a character because you tapped the square button too slowly. When I finished the game, I ended up with probably the worst possible ending, and just sat there thinking, \"What a total waste of time.\"Graphics: 9/10 sometimes 10/10 sometimes 7/10Game play: quicktime events can range from fun to frustrating, using you'll need a combo of button mashes then have to tap a button, but the prompts all start looking the same so if you have to tap something along with other reactions, you're gonna most likely failStory: Story was entertaining, but had some giant plot holes, as well as things that were obviously red herrings, but went unexplained, so they seemed more like plot contrivances. Other things unexplained, lead you to have no clue whether or not they are pertinent, IE one of the characters is a drug user, should you go through withdrawals or not? this choice will either get him killed or allow him to live, which is fine, but the way it is implemented,just feels cheap when you make the wrong decision. Also, this game is more unforgiving than Dark Souls. If you make a mistake, you have to start the game over or live with the consequences, which most often means losing a character (and a big chunk of story and fun)Verdict: 7.5/10When the game shines, it shines, it can be an exhilarating experience, and a cool mystery to boot. But once you've completed the game, there is little reason to go back and play again. You know everything, and 90% of the entertainment is watching the plot develop. Once you know everything, you'll have to be pretty darn bored to go back. I seriously don't want to go through making the dude get up, pee, shower, brush his teeth, and shave again.What could have really saved this game would be the ability to replay each chapter, or at least at the end of the game an unlocked option to do so. Being able to go back and replay a chapter and then continue the game game from there, where you messed up and a character died because you didn't hit up, x, square, L2, L1, circle, triangle, hold square, then tap x rapidly would have made this game so much better, an 8 or 9. Like I said earlier, I got the worst possible ending one could get, everyone died (most at the end of the game), the kid died and the killer got away...very unsatisfying, very unsatisfying indeed.It felt like I got to the final boss and died, then the game said, start over.Still I hope they keep making games like this, I miss the old point and click adventures, but I hope they go more in the direction of Shenmue, for lack of a better term, a pseudo-sandbox-video game novel","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2012"}

Together with the addition of new enemies, characters, weapons and environments,Dead Space Extractionsets a new standard for action horror on the Wii that is sure to please both those new to theDead Spacegame universe, and those anxious for more..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }New FPS perspective.View larger.New characters, weapons...View larger.Two-player co-op and arcade style challenge mode play options.View larger.StoryDead Space Extractiontells the untold story of the Aegis VII Colony through a handful of survivors battling to reach the orbiting USG Ishimura amidst a horrific infection and the initial invasion by a violent alien race known as Necromorphs. As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"An interesting side step for the series","reviewText":"The Good: Creepy immersive atmosphere, lots of weapons, great story tellingThe Bad: Repetitive, very hard, may turn Dead Space fans offDead Space is a surprising new gaming franchise from EA that was actually original, in depth, a just really amazing. The whole story behind Dead Space is just so surreal thanks to all the different forms of media from movies to books to comic books. Dead Space is about an alien artifact that somehow unleashed a deadly race of aliens onto a planet colony and found its way to the Ishimura which is a planetcracking ship.Dead Space: Extraction sets itself between the comic books and the first Dead Space game. Think of this as what happened before Isaac Clarke entered the Ishimura. Extraction may intially throw you off guard since it's an \"on rails\" FPS kind of like old arcade games. This may turn Dead Space fans completely off since you don't have control of exploration. While this does hamper the score a lot there is so much fun and fright to be had in Extraction.The main focus in Extraction is getting the hell off the Ishimura and finding a shuttle. You play as several characters throughout the game, but your main guy is Nate. He is a P-SEC officer who is working with his sergeant to get as many people to safety as possible. You really only see your reticle to the main focus is to point and shoot. The controls are really great and laid out for both regular use and the Wii Zapper (or any other gun attachment you may have) so I will be reviewing this game off of the Zapper control scheme. You have a lot at your hands besides weapons and this includes your Stasis (slows down objects), and your telekinesis which will pull objects towards you. You also have a swipe attack for melee and cutting things throughout the game.Most of your weapons arsenal is tools and all the weapons from the original Dead Space are back with lots of additions. Some of these include the P-SEC pistol, welding gun, and nail gun. The nail gun is standard and has unlimited ammo, but each weapon has a secondary fire. For example, the pulse rifle has a shotgun blast that must be charged, the P-SEC pistol has a spray shot, and the flamethrower can shoot fireballs. All of these weapons will be needed and strategically used for certain situations.Most of the game plays through the creepy and eerie story with the character moving on his/her own. While this is immersive and cinematic it can be boring some times since several minutes can pass with just looking around at nothing.The game moves at a slower pace than you would want, but it fits the atmosphere. There will be times when creatures will grab you out of the dark and you must shake your Wii remote to turn on your glow worm. You will hear strange voices, and creepy visions that pop up out of nowhere. While you're roaming these halls you need to act fast and use your telekinesis to grab ammo, upgrades, health, audio/text logs etc. All of these are tallied up at the end of each chapter and you are scored.When it comes to creatures I can't really recall any new forms. Every single form from the original Dead Space is here, and even some environments. The devs recycled a lot of content and this felt like a big no-no to me. While there are some simple mini games such as a rewiring game where you can't touch red circuits, a turret section, and some parts that have you nail stuff up to keep things out. The game is riveting and exciting, but by the time you get through all ten (long) chapters you just want it to end. This is partly due to the difficulty factor and the unbalanced ammo versus creatures problem. Scrounging ammo is very difficult in this game even on the easiest setting, and it makes you wish the devs would just stop doing that.I however highly enjoyed this game and found it to be worth the $50 purchase. With the amount of weapons, decent length and amazing helped make this game easy to chew. There is just enough mixed around for you to stay on the edge of your seat, and that's what keeps you playing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00002STGL","description":"A first-person shooter that mixes spy and sci-fi,Perfect  Darkis both a thoroughly engrossing one-player experience and a  riotously fun multiplayer romp. Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"Poo Poo Pooey","summary":"multiplayer is fun but nowt else","reviewText":"...the actual game is okay but certainkly isnt on par with goldeneye. with the exception of the man dan carrington the characters are wooden and the story is very poor, you never feel into the game's story at all. the level design in general is bad, like the supposed 'stealth' mission in chicago where every enemy knows where you are anyway so there is no stealth involved whatsoever. some of the levels though are fun with inspired design like the sniping levcel in the snow but it doesnt make the game good.what does make the game worth playing is the multi player modes, although the graphics take another turn for the worse they are acceptable in 2 player but with 4 you cant see anything at all without a massive tv. the multi modes make pd, beating the hell out of simulants in slow motion can be fun and sure beats the game. this is what you should be buying the game for, not for the story mode. the trouble with this is that the pd arenas are poor and its only the graphically altered goldeneye levels that are worth playing. a bit lazy on the developers part.overall: except for the inclusion of mr. carrington the story mode is a bust so unless you have enough mates to make the multi worthwhile dont buy it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2001"}
{"product_name":"B001TD6SK8","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","summary":"Sea Salt Ice Cream: The Salty-Sweet Mana of Friendship","reviewText":"I've long been a fan of the Kingdom Hearts series, but after being disappointed with Chain of Memories (a friend brought it over for me to try out and I knew after an hour that I wouldn't be buying that one) I wasn't holding out high hopes for this iteration of the series.  Well, after finishing it, I must say I'm pleasantly surprised.  It's not as good as the PS2 originals, but it's certainly a fine game and worth playing.Graphics (score 10/10): The graphics are pretty darn good for the DS.  Everything looks almost between PS1 and PS2 quality, which is quite impressive for a handheld system.  I'm thoroughly pleased here and have no complaints--there's even some better rendered cutscenes interspersed with the already-good normal game graphics.Music (score 8/10): Well, how much you like the music will be entirely dependent on how much you like KH2's music, because it's the same.  The intro song is the same, and the other songs sound the same.  If they're not exactly the same, then it's some sort of very slight variation.  That being said, the music is still good, and I love the intro song.  Still, it was kind of lazy of them not to make any new music.  Lazy bums!Characters (score 10/10): The main characters (Roxas, Axel, and Xion) are pretty well developed.  The organization members don't get as much screen time, but at least you learn more about them than you did in KH2.  Plus, you get to see them just sitting around on couches talking to each other about their daily schedules and how they all need a vacation.  It's surreal and funny at the same time.  There's even a moogle Nobody that sells you stuff in a little cloak and hood!  Cuteness!!!  Most of the character development focuses on the friendship of Roxas, Axel, and Xion.  Squeenix has decided that ice cream must be the path to true friendship because they basically eat ice cream every single time they hang out together.  Some people seem to really hate these repeated ice cream scenes but they didn't bother me.  The ice cream really serves as a tangible visual symbol of their deep friendship and is a recurring plot element throughout.  I thought it was pretty clever but I do agree that they ran that into the ground just a little.  Anyway, this game really lays the groundwork for Axel's motivations in KH2 and I imagine replaying that game will be even more poignant now that I've played this.Story (score 10/10): Have you ever played an RPG and thought about how interesting it would be to be able to play from the villain's perspective?  And I'm not talking about the crappy trend of having a \"moral\" system available for the protagonist so you can do random good or evil acts.  I mean actually getting into the mind of a fully developed antagonist character who has real thoughts and motivations.  For example, imagine being able to play through Final Fantasy VII as Sephiroth and being able to finally get behind those pretty green eyes and fully understand why he became so unhinged.  Well, the great thing about this game is that now you can finally play from the villains' perspective!  You play as Roxas during his time in Organization XIII.  And you will meet just about every organization member at least once.  Honestly, they were not fleshed out well in KH2 and this game was desperately needed to flesh out their personalities and motivations.  And honestly, you'll become oddly attached to them, even the dickish ones.  I suppose once you get to know these characters it makes you more empathetic with them.  Aside from that the story mainly follows Roxas and his friendship with Axel and Xion which ends rather tragically.  Still, it's an excellent story and any game designer who can make a clich&eacute; like the theme of \"friendship\" seem appropriately dramatic and heart-breaking (and appropriate for children too!) deserves an award.  Also, as a note for anyone who's wondering, do not play this first if you've never played the PS2 Kingdom Hearts games.  You will not know what is going on and nothing will make sense.  I mean sure, you can still play this and beat it if you know nothing about Kingdom Hearts, but I don't recommend it.  It would be like watching a movie in a language you don't speak without any subtitles on.  You might get the gist of what's going on but you're not going to fully understand it.Battle System (score 9/10): When I heard that this game wasn't featuring card battles, I jumped for joy.  Damn card battles.  As an added bonus, this game features absolutely no use of the touchscreen.  Thank goodness.  Nothing's worse than when a developer decides that they need to shoehorn in touchscreen controls for a game where they don't help, and may even hinder, gameplay just because it's on the DS.  And they've managed to adapt the PS2 game's control scheme fairly well here.  You can glide, jump, dodge roll, lock on, smack things with your keyblade, cast spells, you name it!  It's all here!  However, because there were fewer buttons available for them to work with, you'll have to put your magic in the shortcut menu to effectively use it.  As with all Kingdom Hearts games, the camera can go a bit wonky on you.  It generally works fine enough, although it works best when you lock on to your target.  A.I. controlled party members make a comeback here too.  You'll either be alone or sometimes a party member (other Organization XIII members) will accompany you in battle.  Each Organization XIII member has a different weapon and mode of attack.  A.I. can be set to have your allies focus on the enemy Roxas is attacking or on other enemies, or they can focus on healing and support.  I personally set them to attacking Roxas' target.  Generally, they do pretty well (better than KH1 and KH2, although that isn't saying much), but they sometimes just stand there like idiots and do nothing.  Even in attack mode they will occasionally heal you but I really wouldn't count on them for that since their support seems really spotty.  Overall, I'm very impressed with how well the developers managed to take the battle system from the PS2 games in the series and adapt it for use on the DS.Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  This is where some of my complaints about this game come in.  Yup, the same two complaints everyone has about this game: the mission system and the panel system.  First off, this game is mission based.  This means that there is one room in the Organization Headquarters where you can buy things and talk to Saix for missions.  Basically, you just select the mission you want to go on and then it takes you there.  You do it, then return to that one room and choose another mission.  That's the pattern.  This can get really repetitive over time.  However the designers really tried to spice it up with different mission types (recon missions vs. combat-oriented missions) and to reward you with cutscenes after most every mission.  Not to mention, every time you start to get bored the game throws something new at you, be it a unique mission, a new world, more plot, etc.  Still, I think it would have been more fun if the game was more exploration based like the other entries in the series.  Maybe the DS was too limited for them to make it that way?  Oh well...  The other complaint has to do with the Panel system.  Basically you get little squares (kinda shaped like tetris pieces) which represent various items, abilities, weapons, and magic.  You get a grid of spaces and you must fit equip these things by fitting them into the grid like a jigsaw puzzle.  I didn't mind equipping the weapons and abilities, but equipping the other things was not really a good idea.  For instance, you have to equip a panel for every single magic spell that you use.  Yes, you get x4 panels later, but it still feels like you can't cast nearly as much magic as you could in KH1 and KH2.  It's really limiting.  It's the same way with items.  You might only have space for 6 potions.  What really sucks though is that you have to equip levels.  Seriously, you have to equip levels.  Every last one.  This will take up the majority of your space by far.  I could've handled having to equip everything else, but levels should've been something automatic that you keep regardless.  That's really my biggest complaint.  My only piece of advice is to play on Beginner mode and don't level up excessively.  Then maybe you'll be able to fit decent amounts of potions on you're panels.  Oh, as final notes of interest, there's new game plus content of sorts and multiplayer.  The new game plus lets you view cutscenes if there's a cleared file on your cartridge and it puts you back at your final save before the end boss so you can replay any mission you want.  As such it's not a true \"new game plus\" since you can't replay from the beginning, but it's something at least.  Multiplayer allows a friend to take control of one of the organization members during mission replays.  That's pretty much it.Overall (score 8/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  All things considered, this is a solid entry in the Kingdom Hearts series and should not be missed by fans of the games.  I only wish they had named it something different.  \"Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days\" is one of the most awkward titles I've ever had the displeasure of trying to carry on a conversation with a fellow gamer about.  You're not going to see that lend itself to a catchy acronym anytime soon.  I say we change the title to \"Kingdom Hearts: The Ice Cream Chronicles\".  C'mon, who's with me?!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Zardshark","summary":"Best GameCube game I've played","reviewText":"This is an amazing fighting game in which you can play as a lot of the nintendo characters.

{"product_name":"B0043B5SLI","description":"","reviewerName":"N. Johnson \"Pyrochaos\"","summary":"There is just something about this game...","reviewText":"I am an avid action RPG (console) gamer.  I love games like this.  Sure, it isn't without it's flaws, but what do you expect for a title that started at $40 brand new and is from a smaller game developer?  It best compares to the original Fable, in my opinion, than any other recent game.Story:  The story in this game can be cheesy at times, but overall it's pretty good.  It is pretty straight forward, but not linear.  You basically unlock more and more areas, and can go back to them at any time.  There isn't a new game plus, or free roam mode, which is disappointing since there are things like treasure you will want to go back to.  But they are pretty clear about \"The Point of No Return.\"  So as long as you create a separate save before the final boss battle, you can go back and do everything.  There are also 3 different endings, depending on whether you went out for revenge or love.  And one somewhere in between.Gameplay:  Overall the fighting and powers works pretty well, you can quick map only 5 things.  This is limiting when it comes to magic, but once you start playing you find yourself only using about a couple of different spells.  The swordplay overall is pretty basic.  Lock-on, attack, roll, ect.  You can choose between a sword, two-handed weapon, spear and shield, or your moonblade which is with you at all times.  They all play a little differently.  The game is damn hard though on normal and hard.  It can even be a challenge on easy in some areas.Graphics:  The graphics aren't the best on this game, but it can really shine in some parts.  The caves and catacombs look amazing, but sometimes the city can look generic.  It's hit or miss.  The character design is pretty cartoony, similar to Fable, but it never really bothered me.  The enemy design isn't too varied, as each section you go into has only a few sets of enemies.Sound:  The background music works well with the game, and the voice acting is also hit or miss.  Some characters, like Death, the bosses, as well as Scarlett, do a fantastic job.  Some of the NPCs aren't up there.  With some just shouting out random sayings, to really odd conversation.  Overall if you can look at it with a humorous eye you will have a good time with the NPC dialog.Overall it is a pretty good action RPG if you take it lightly, and don't expect it to be a Dragon Age or Elder Scrolls quality game.  If you were a fan of Fable 1, this is a must buy.  The humor is there (intentional or not) and there is a certain charm to the game that made me love it.  I definitely recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00B67ZTUW","description":"","reviewerName":"Bryan","summary":"A really great all-around game and a must-own for RPG fans.","reviewText":"Tales of Xillia is not just a good JRPG, it's a flat-out great game once you give it a chance - one which doesn't fade as it goes on, and improves upon virtually every bad system that plagues most major console RPGs. I've been playing RPGs since the original Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy on the NES, and I've been playing Tales games since the very first installment, Tales of Destiny. Tales of Xillia ranks up there with the best of them.Notable features in Tales of Xillia:-Plot twists that were genuinely unexpected-Antagonists that you can relate to and whose motivations even match your own at times in the story; no one-dimensional bad guys.-Constant character development - even side quests develop the storyline and often have spoken dialogue. Characters talk to each other as you travel the game's dungeons, extensively.-Random loot scattered on the world map encourages exploration; loot regenerates so you always have a reason to explore again.-Side quests are very easy to discover, and a travel system that makes it easy to backtrack. Loading times almost nonexistent, so warp to every town in the game at any time no problem.-Instead of a crafting system, you supply shops with materials to improve the inventory. Not complex at all, but still allows for a huge variety of items to collect, and always a reason to collect them. The game will not limit how much you can improve the shops at any point.-Action-packed battles with genuine control over the flow of battle and development of the characters. Link system allows you to choose partners in battle and switch partners and party members on the fly at any time-All party members are easy to keep equally powered up. EXP is shared evenly at all times.-Auto-item programming allows you great control of when your party will use items in battle so you don't have to remember to use them yourself.-Huge number of skills able to be set to quick-buttons so you don't have to go to menus to use skills. I believe you can have 16 skills set at one time!-No worrying about running out of MP; the game's MP system (TP) allows you to actually use your skills in normal battles. You can restore TP simply by using regular attacks and through various passive skills.-Four difficulty levels available right from the outset, so the game can never be too easy or too hard for you.-Some of the music is incredible. The main map theme sounds like something out of classic Metroid games. I haven't enjoyed a RPG's soundtrack this much in ages.-Maps are not simply loot hallways, but have legitimate branches and entire screens that exist simply for the player to explore or for sidequests. Sometimes you can just walk into areas that are meant for higher levels - no hand-holding. Plenty of save points, though!There are only a few negatives:-The plot takes a little while to get really good-Some sidequests are missable-Too much time spent choosing character stats when you level up.-A few characters are extremely annoying, though they are mostly minor characters and some of them get what's coming to them.-The \"choose your protagonist\" gimmick simply serves to rob the player of some bits of storyline rather than get used in a truly interesting way. Each character really only has a few hours of differing plot. Not a big deal, but I guess it does give some motivation to play the game through twice.-The AI can sometimes be pretty idle while linked up with other AI. It doesn't necessarily do anything stupid, it just isn't quite as aggressive and quick as a player controlled character would be. The AI is very good at healing, buffing, and using items, though.One thing I'll mention that was a big point of animosity for gamers when this game came out is that you can't set it to use Japanese voices with subtitles. After you play the game, it should be very obvious why this likely is: the amount of spoken dialogue is MASSIVE. There are very few times in the game where your characters aren't speaking. I'd be surprised if they could fit all the voice data for both and English and Japanese set of voices. I found the translation to be extremely good, and most of the voice actors seemed to do a good job.Overall the game is just the best RPG to hit the major consoles in a long time, and well worth the purchase especially as the price has been dropping. Do yourself a favor and pick up this game if you have even a passing interest in role-playing games. Heck, pick it up if you like action games with story. The battle system is interesting and more about learning to do real-time combos and chains of special moves than choosing options from a menu!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2013"}

Garcia","summary":"It just cannot compete.","reviewText":"I've always been a Sony fan, but the ps3 just cannot compete with the competition today. There are only two problems with the system, however, these two problems pretty much make up the entire reason a console is bought.The first problem with this system is the pricing. At 400 dollars, this console dwarfs others in terms of price. I could easily buy two x-box 360s for the same price. The games must also be factored in; 60 dollars for new releases will add to the pile spent. You'll also be tempted to buy a larger hard-drive. Game demos easily reach 3 gigs in memory. Eventually, the avid gamer is going to have to buy a larger drive. You also have to remember the price of controllers (assuming you'll be wanting more than one).The second real problem with the system has to be the game selection. With the Wii you get the motion sensing games and the standard Mario/Zelda stories. Xbox has it's Halo, Left4dead, and other really good titles. There are few games exclusive to the ps3 (MGS4 being the only good one coming to mind). Even Grand Theft Auto and Final Fantasy, which have long been Sony's backbone, have gone the way of the 360 and Nintendo.  The announcement that Final Fantasy XIII would be ported to the 360 was perhaps the nail on the coffin for the ps3.In all, what you're really buying is an expensive xbox 360 that may work a little better but has fewer games to choose from. As much as it pains me, I simply cannot bring myself to like this system.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2009"}

Who needs overpriced and oversized gaming consoles that can play Movie-DVDs and even BluRayDisks when most good games are released for PCs as well and they look and play better on them? And I was mostly right. However, the NINTENDO Wii is a different breed.Gaming on the Wii is an experience one has to live at least once - but preferably whenever he or she feels blue. Sure, it may not sport the cutting-edge graphical capabilities of a SONY PS3 or the game titles selection of the XBox.

It wasn't until Christmas of that same year when I finally came to own a Wii. To be completely honest, I was very impressed with the Wii's ability to detect my movements simply with the flick of the Wii controller.When I first looked at the console itself, I noticed it was extremely tiny compared to the Playstation 2 or the Xbox 360. At the same time, however, it is much heavier than it looks--as Nintendo made use of every single space they could find in this system.I've always seemed like the kind of person who couldn't sit still while playing a game--and this system only quenches my thirst to move while playing games. Games like Super Mario Galaxy, Sonic Colors, and Godzilla Unleashed all require me to move my body in order to emerge victorious in the game.While it is a pleasure to know that this console gives me the ability to interact with my games through movement, older Nintendo fans may be pleased to know that you can insert and play Nintendo GameCube games thanks to the Wii's backwards compatibility with its predecessor. All you need to do this is a GameCube controller, a memory card, and a GameCube game itself.

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Gradient Vector Field \"subjectedtometal (dot)...","summary":"Are you Morbid?","reviewText":"I know this isn't a Celtic Frost album, but I thought the title was apt.  After having many people inform me that I must play Bioshock, I finally have.  This game is dark in theme.  Incredibly dark.  It's one of the darkest themed games I've ever played through.  Good thing for me because I like it dark.  It really brings you into a world of questionable ethics and morality and I fully enjoyed every second of this twisted world.Be prepared to explore the dystopian world of Rapture.  A city built underwater by Andrew Ryan and veritable geniuses whom make incredible advances in science and technology.  It's interesting to note that it seems to be set in the 1950's, so there's a heavy 1950's atmosphere in the game, somewhat akin to what we'd see in a game like Fallout.  Only Bioshock is not post-apocalyptic.Anyway, the overall themes are actually pretty gruesome.  Basically this group of elite people, post World War II, wanted to get away from society.  They didn't want to have any ethical or moral restrictions on their work.  It's interesting to see all of this, from my perspective, because in most of the worlds I travel science is often lauded as being a wonderful thing.  Bioshock takes that and kind of puts it to the extreme fringe.  Here science went out of control.  People became obsessed with making better people.  Genetic modification and testing on children was not taboo at all!  The person in charge of that is an ex-Nazi scientist, whom winds up helping you!  Though she apparently wasn't too fond of the Nazis, their priorities were not hers, apparently.  Despite this ethical split, there were amazing breakthroughs.  This made all the work totally worth it.  At least that's how the people of Rapture justify it.People wanted to be beautiful and plastic surgery seems to have been rampant.  One of the first enemies you'll face is a surgeon who's obsessed to the point of madness to make people look \"beautiful\".  You see the aftermath in the blood splattered walls and mutilated corpses throughout the first level.  A lot of your \"enemies\" are people that have had significant reconstructive surgery and they look very strange.  I put enemies in quotes because ultimately they really are just regular people.  When things started getting out of control it looks like people were put into a situation where they'd do anything to survive.  It's not uncommon for you, the player, to walk up to someone and shoot them in the head if they're not paying attention.  Rest assured though that they would have attacked you if they saw you.  Very quickly you learn that you are playing the role of the anti-hero.  You are even faced with decisions concerning the life and death of children in this game.As you can see these are extremely adult themes and this is clearly rated M for a reason.  If this overly dark atmosphere isn't for you then I would recommend you leave this behind.  You will be killing other seemingly innocent humans.  Their bodies will twitch when they die.  This is an incredibly creepy game even without these elements.  But the themes and concepts are so prevalent and so consuming that you can't help but get into it.  You must find out the purpose behind all of this is, not to mention how'd you even know to go down there?Lots of deep aspects, naturally.  The game mechanics are really great.  You can move around most of the things in your environment.  You can search through desks and crates for useful items.  The levels for this game are massive and there is a lot to explore.  Luckily there's almost always a Nav point at the top of the HUD that points you towards your goal.  Despite this, I often wandered off to explore my environment a lot.  I highly recommend doing this because there are certain things you gain.  You'll find more ammunition and maybe new weapons.  Later on you can even stumble across these service stations where you can upgrade your weapons making them more powerful or hold more ammo.  Your character has special powers when they gain abilities through things called \"plasmids\".  You can have more than one ability and you gain these upgrades throughout the game.  This RPG kind of element worked into the game is really cool and gives you much more dynamic weapons to mess around with.  This is a great aspect because you'll have enemies coming from all over the place.  They'll come up behind you and some can crawl on the ceiling so you'll need to look up to find out where some went.Overall I really liked playing this game.  It's not the most fun FPS I've ever played, but it's one of the ones with one of the most immersive environments.  For some reason I kept having the feeling like it was an incredibly morbid version of Myst.  Maybe it was the mix of the old time feel blended with high grade technology, but for some reason I kept having that feeling.  I highly recommend this to people who can handle the themes.  Viewing some of the negative reviews it's pretty clear this isn't the kind of game everyone can get into and that's fine.  However, you've been forewarned about what's in here, so don't say you didn't know what you were getting into.  See if you can survive Rapture!Overall Rating: 4.5 out of 5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2009"}

I was weary purchasing it because of the mostly negative reviews from game critics. GameSpot and XPlay were in the minority giving Assassin's Creed a high rating. Their reviews usually align with my tastes and I thankfully listened. When I look at a game like Zelda Twilight princess for the Wii (which shares attributes to AC) where IGN gives that 10 year-old outdated design a 9.5, and then gives this game a 7.7; I have to wonder what they are smoking. AC is hands down one of the single greatest achievements in video game history. I could not stop playing this game from the second it hit the disk tray and XBOX live updated the software.  Assassin's Creed can be summed up like this: An adult version of Sly Cooper 2 & 3 with the visceral feel of Ninja Gaiden. All of this while attaining the greatest graphical fidelity and beauty in video game console history. Here are the categories:Graphics -I have yet to see better graphics on the XBOX 360. Having played Mass Effect, COD4, and BioShock, I can still say this with confidence. The world is huge and the graphical detail is mind-blowing throughout the macro to micro stratification. A few hours into the game when you pull up on your horse overlooking the ancient city of Damascus, your jaw just drops. There is no draw-in distance that I can see usually present in massive world adventure games. I did not witness the visual glitches others have mentioned. It could be that the software update fixed those, but there may also be a misunderstanding of said glitches. Without giving away too much, I believe it is pretty well known that you are playing in a virtual world. It turns out that visual \"glitches\" were programmed in to give the player a cue to switch camera perspectives during cut scenes. You can control a limited camera during cut scenes very similar to what Metal Gear Solid 3 utilized, for those familiar.Sound -Environmental sound and the implementation of surround sound is blockbuster action movie quality, as is the voice-acting and musical score. The quality is on par with BioShock and God of War 1 & 2 for PS2, which had stellar audio attributes.Gameplay - Wow, refreshing. Though the implementation of the gamepad is tricky at first, once you learn the controls, they are butter. Combat is simple yet innovative. Words cannot describe the exhilaration you will feel the first time taking a running leap to plunge your hidden dagger into the neck of a roof guard and watch that animation unfold. It's Ninja Gaiden-visceral for those of you played that epic title. When jumping and climbing on the roof tops of these incredibly well designed cities, it felt like Sly Cooper 2 & 3 for those of you who are familiar the designs of the cities in those great titles.Story - Good concept. It won't win any Academy awards, but everything else in this game is so superb, you really cannot fault the premise of the story.Summary -Stop any further hesitation and buy this game now! You will enjoy an epic experience on par with the greatest games ever made.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2008"}

Choose from a wealth of officially licensed cars and real-world locations, then go careening through gravel, dirt and mud, doing whatever it takes to bring the trophy home.","reviewerName":"ChomskyKnows \"ChomskyKnows\"","summary":"Good racing sim; fair review","reviewText":"This has been called the \"prettiest\" or \"best\" racer on 360 so far. I think Atari's Test Drive Unlimited is more involved, more open, larger, has more to do. EA's Burnout series is more fun. Those really aren't racing \"sims\" (in TDU the sim is actually the island, not the racing) but they're racers, so a comparison can be made. I suppose a better comparison is versus PGR and Forza. While I'm not sure that DiRT is any better than Forza2, it might be a bit better than PGR3, but PGR3 is a much older title so a better comparison might be when PGR4 arrives soon.Criticisms:- It is pretty, but I found some graphics issues I haven't found in other racers or other games. I can only call them \"refresh\" problems as I'm not sure what the actual problem is (I can only describe it as a visible squiggly translucent line coming down from near the top of the screen toward the bottom that looks like the frame rate or screen is refresh)...Again, if this is my 360, my 1080p HDTV, or the cables, it doesn't appear on other games, and I have tons of them.- Any racer can be utterly frustrating. You drive for several minutes and right when you get toward the end, something goes wrong, someone hits you, etc, and you lose the race. It might take you awhile to learn to use the \"reset vehicle\" in this game to combat this (which feels like cheating).- The gigantic career mode pyramid gives a false impression that these are all separate tracks. Many are reused.- Extremely annoying co-pilot during rally races who shouts \"left 3, right 4, left 5, 100, blather blather\" (he sound like a quarterback before the ball is hiked) to try and tell you what's coming up. But these races go so fast that you're your brain will be switching back and forth within split seconds watching the race and looking at the map above to see where the next curves/turns will be, that also focusing on what this guy is saying is impossible or annoying. Is what he saying even accurate? Thankfully, you can turn this guy off in the options.- It should be noted that \"DiRT\" implies off-road racing only. There are plenty of non-dirt tracks here.- The ads show a lot of crashing, rolling and banging into other cars (because that looks like fun), but if you do that, you'll lose most of the time. Often, if you so much as gently touch another car, you spin off to the side while watching everyone else pass you. This isn't Burnout.End Result: the combined press rankings are at 8.4 which is where Need for Speed Most Wanted ranks. I think that's a fair assessment. The critics rank Forza2 and PGR3 higher than DiRT with Need for Speed Carbon ranking much lower.Look for Need for Speed ProStreet, PGR4 (with better dynamic weather effects), and especially the new Burnout: Paradise, with a more open world (like Test Drive Unlimited except you get to crash into `em).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000TUZCQI","reviewerName":"Rezivor","summary":"Still as good as it was in the 80's!!!!","reviewText":"The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) single handedly saved the gaming industry in the 80's. And among the NES' many classic games, is Super Mario Bros. & Duck Hunt. This cartridge has both games....Duck Hunt is a fun game even to this day. It was played with the NES Zapper/Zap gun (which won't shoot on new LCD's,Plasma,LED's). You have a dog that tags along & jumps into bushes. Scaring the ducks to fly into the sky. If you successfully shoot the ducks. The dog grabs them and shows you the ducks. If you miss, he laughs at you. As you progress through the game. It becomes faster & more challenging. You may also shoot clay that is launched into the air instead ofducks.Super Mario Bros. is a game that I would sya has legendary status attached to it. You play as Mario (a plummer) the option for a friend or sibling can play along as Mario's brother Luigi (also a plummer). You must save the princess from King Koopa. Along the way, you encounter various foes ranging from Goombas ( living mushrooms),turtles, winged turtles, venus fly traps in pipes (some pipes you my go down to find coins,mushrooms to grow,flowers for fire power),a turtle riding a cloud that throws spiked characters @ you. Also characters that can't be hurt by your fire power. They look like a beetle of sorts. Or, if Darth Vaders helmet came to life maybe, lmao! Fish, squid, and also you face the Hammer Brothers. They are turtles that throw hammers @ you. Also you face versions of Koopa. The breathe fire at you, some throw a bunch of hammers.....This game is awesome! Is a bit repetitive, yet doesn't come off as that. There are some levels (castle levels) on the last level of each world (example 1-4) you go through level 1-1,1-2,ect....till 8-4. Some of those castle levels are mazes. If you don't go the right way,down the right tubes...You start @ the beginning of that level. Yet your time continues to clock down. You can do some cool things in this game that I believe are glitches.Since I was a kid (in the 80's) I would do the following in this game.Extra guys: On the levels where turtles are coming down stairs. You can jump on one while it's on a stair. Continue to hit jump & your points add up quick...Which in tern start to generate extra guys \"1up\" as you continue to jump (timing is part of this) you'll quickly gain a bunch of extra guys. You can get so many it'll show a crown & a ice cube for you amount of lives.- world: a world (that's water) and has no ending. you get to the end & it just starts over with the time still clocking down. To get there,  you must be on level 1-2. When you see the elevator looking platforms you'll jump past those & encounter a pipe to end that level. Instead of going into it. You can ride the elevator and run on top of the bricks above it. You'll find pipes that will let you warp. But to get to the - world, you must get on top of the pipe to 2-1. Walk to the corner where bricks are a wall and above you. Hit the 2nd & 3rd brick from the wall. Then jump backwards towards the brick standing out next to the wall. Make you head go through the brick and continue to gide Mario/Luigi through it. Within a few tries, you should end up \"moon walking\" through the bricks. Continue to face the pipe you we're on. Keep your character backwards once out the walls.  You'll be by thepipes that warp. Jump backwards onto the nearest pipe & hit down on the D-pad (direction pad). There ya go!Fire power when your little: This is the least known trick. Many don't even believe it's possible! What you do is get big with a mushroom, but don't get a flower for fire power. When you get to a castle level and face a Koopa. You must jump over. Him. Get right by the axe that cuts the bridge. He'll start to aproach you....Time it just right & jump up. You must hit the axe & Koopa at the same time. If done successfully, you'll slide on one leg up to the character Toad Stool. The following level don't get touched (you'll die) you still look big....Now continue to hit all the boxes with question marks (while still not being touched, but you can jump on bad guys) & you'll get fire power when your little. Once you hit a box that'd have a mushroom or flower. When you get it your little & have the outfit of fire power Mario. When you shoot fire power, you appear big for the second you fire. If you get touched you grow. And get touched once more you'll die (like when your little). This game is still as fun to play 26yrs later as it was back in the day. If you have a NES this is a game you should definitely have!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2012"}

But if you've played the original, it's hard to justify the price. The PS4 is a bit more justifiable because it runs at ~45-60fps, on-top of all of the improvements. The XB1 version still runs at 30fps (same as the original version). That said, the XB1 does have pretty much all of the same improvements found in the PS4 version such as TressFX etc., but it falls a bit short of the PS4 version (some textures, texture filtering are worse, and it drops to 900p from 1080p during cutscenes). For a technical analysis, check the digitalfoundry comparison at eurogamer.So if you haven't played it yet, definitely pick this up. If you have the choice between PS4/XB1, definitely go with the PS4 version. I would give it 3.5 stars considering the price. I would give the PS4 version 4 stars. If it was more reasonably priced, I would give them 4 and 4.5 respectively.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2014"}

Red Faction II features a revamped Geo-Mod engine to provide dynamically destructive environments, an elite squad of soldiers and 14 weapons of destruction to aid your overthrow of the tyrant governor!","reviewerName":"bayou_hannibal \"bayou_hannibal\"","summary":"Testosterone: The Game","reviewText":"\"Red Faction 2\" is a very enjoyable, action-packed, and somewhat mindless shooter full of big weapons and lots of explosions.  Were it not for the mediocre graphics and short length, it would be a five-star shooter.Like the first \"Red Faction\", this game uses the Geo Mod engine, which allows you to destroy stuff and blow holes in walls.  The Geo Mod feature is used extensively in this game, unlike the first \"Red Faction\", and it adds a lot to the game.  It does a good job of feeding that primal desire that you have to blow stuff up.  A lot of the game's environments are destructible.  You can take a look around the room sometimes after a big battle and see all of the carnage that has been done.  In some areas, you may attempt to find cover, but if an enemy has grenades or rockets, then he can blow your cover away.  You can get into a few extra rooms and areas by blowing holes in the walls.The action for the game rarely bogs down or gets boring.  After a few shooter levels, you usually get a vehicle ride, during which you get to ride in the gunner's seat and mow down bad guys with a heavy turret or a rocket launcher.  In one scene, you get to ride around in a tank blasting away with the cannon while your wisecracking driver rampages through the streets smashing up buildings.  The game has the console checkpoint save system that we all love to hate, but the save points are spaced so close together that  you will hardly even notice.The plot for the game is simple, but it is enjoyable, and it actually has a decent twist or two in it.  There is no attempt to be something that it isn't.  The entire game is like a B-movie action film, complete with macho taunts and death lines.  The script is charmingly cheesy, and the voice acting is decent.  Lance Henriksen, in fact, voices one of the important characters in the game, and he does a very good job.  The different squad members in the game actually have enough variety in their personalities and traits to give the game some character.The game is so short though, that it is hard to justify paying full price for it.  The first time through, I finished it in about 8 hours, and the second time through, I finished it in about 6.  The game has different ending cut scenes, depending upon how you play through the game, but I still probably won't play it again.  Another problem that this game has is outdated graphics.  They are about 2 years or so behind the curve, and even with low object detail, the frame rate sometimes bogs down.  Some of the cut scenes in the game are AWFUL.  Lip-synching is nonexistent.  Characters move their mouths worse than talking mechanical dummies at an amusement park.If you played \"Red Faction\" and were kind of disappointed by the lack of use of the Geo Mod engine, then you might want to pick up \"Red Faction 2\".  Or, if you just need something to satisfy your urge for a good shooter, then it will be a good purchase for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2003"}
{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"Victor Mariscal \"Roguemaster83\"","summary":"I wouldn't trade the time I spent for anything.","reviewText":"As you all know, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess was not only a launch title for the Nintendo Wii, but ironically it was the swonsong for the Nintendo GameCube. The only differences between the two is that the lands are inverted, and Link is right-handed in the Wii version instead of left. It was the first game I bought for the Wii, and the first Zelda game I've ever beaten. It took me 50 hours according to the save file, and honestly, as hard as it was, I wouldn't trade it for anything.This game takes place about a century after Ocarina of Time, and Hyrule is once again in jeopardy. A mysterious twilight covers the land, and our main character, Link, who is a farm boy in this game, is thrust into the middle of it. After he is asked to go to Hyrule Castle to deliver a tribute from his village, he is pulled into the Twilight Realm, which transforms him into a wolf. He receives help from a mysterious being named Midna, and soon Link realizes that he must save land of Hyrule from being pulled into the Twilight Realm.That's the story in a nutshell.All things considered, the Wii's unique control scheme combined with the storyline of Twilight Princess compliment each other well. All you have to do is swing the Wii Remote to swing the sword, and using the Hero's Bow has never felt so good. An intuitive control scheme makes this game so great to play. That's not to say that the GCN version isn't great, since it's exactly the same game.I did get frustrated with this game at times, but I enjoyed the hell out of it! The storyline was dark, and sometimes I like it dark. I've played Ocarina of Time and The Wind Waker and while they're both amazing they don't compare to this. Twilight Princess rocks like no other!One of the things I loved about it was that while it took a long time to finish, it never disappointed. The storyline in which Hyrule is being swallowed up by the Twilight Realm is one of the most engrossing and intriguing storylines ever. The fascination with Midna is an integral part of the story, as well as how Ganondorf fits in (yeah, he's here too).The weapons and items were no joke either. The Gale Boomerang, the Spinner (no, not like those on cars), the Iron Boots, and several others I won't name, since it would just ruin it.I warn you. This is not for just any casual gamer. If you buy this and intend to finish it, get ready to put in a lot of hours. I strongly recommend getting the Strategy Guide along with this. If you are a Zelda expert, you may not need it, but considering how long it took me even with the guide, you may need it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2007"}

The game was pretty enjoyable the first play through but I doubt It would be any better in the second. The story for the most part is pretty gimicky in a Western/Treasure Hunt kind of way full of love triangles, betrayals, violence, and greed. Almost none of the characters are likable and the dialogue can get very cheesy. It'd be better weren't it for the subpar voice acting which can sound like nails on a chalk board after awhile. One of the brothers you play as has an over the top Southern accent and the other sounds like he's talking with food in his mouth. The visuals are actually very good though but that is still disappointing given that the areas the game is based in look very little like they do in the game. As a side note I had no idea that Navajos lived in tipis or that Apaches decorated their villages with totem poles.The gameplay is a mixed bag. One of the most frustrating aspects to it are the quick draw boss sequences. I can see what the designers were going for but it feels broken. Guaranteed you'll die a lot and maybe end up not playing the game anymore. It was tough for me but I kept at it, though I'll admit I got more than just steamed by it. Another odd bit of the gameplay are the free roaming missions. While these can be fun they don't offer much in gameplay as you'll find yourself roaming around an empty space with random bandit attacks spawning at you from nowhere. Still the game was pretty good, and the cover mechanics worked very well despite it being a first person shooter. You can also save up what money you loot or earn in bounties/odd jobs and upgrade your arsenal. While I didn't take the game very seriously it was still fun in an over the top Western sense. Still if you want a really good western game you should stick with Red Dead Redemption, otherwise you can pass the time or go achievement hunting with Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2013"}

I enjoyed it so much that after several months I decided to buy it in August 2011. Turns out I didnt enjoy it as much as I did when I played it at my friends house.The graphics are good, controls are straight forward, weapon selection is okay. The game takes place during the 60s. I like more modern weapons however. The campaign is so-so. I beat the campaign only 3 times since I owned this game. It got very boring, very fast and I didnt really like it. The zombie mode (which is what got me to buy this game in the first place) wasnt as good as I thought. If you die, you start all the way from the beginning. Why no checkpoints? Although some people may like that idea, I didnt.The multiplayer mode, which is the main reason people buy this game, is good but some people on there is stupid so that is not the place for me. I really dont care for the multiplayer feature of this game anyways.I traded this game in at amazon's trade in program and I am glad I got rid of it. Modern warefare 2 is better to me than this.Overall if you never played the game I highly recommend to rent it first and if you like it then I guess you can spend the $60 this game still costs.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2012"}
