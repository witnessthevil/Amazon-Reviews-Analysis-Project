{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"dgdbear \"David\"","summary":"A game entirely in its own league - Not for everybody but a classic for me ! ! !","reviewText":"L.A Noire is a world apart from any other game Rockstar have produced, instead of mindlessly tearing up towns, destroying vehicles and seducing the odd prostitute. In fact Rockstar has gone in entirely the opposite direction. In L.A Noire your good cop who is on a path of righteousness amongst the stagnant corrupt police force and society you work for. Set in the 1940's this production certainly creates a new feel to the free roam style games that we all know and love.Your character is a rookie, to start off with, named 'Cole Phelps'. He is a Los Angeles detective and his role's as you would expect do involve car chases, Gun fights and the odd apprehension of a pervert or a thief, but the body of the game is what sets the pace as a slow, methodical, detailed attention sapping game.Chapter after chapter your job is to interview witnesses and suspects alike, pay great attention to the facial expressions and body language as their dialogue, as you would expect is bound to be misleading. You must provide evidence if you declare someone a liar and be careful when doubting someone who is telling the truth. Despite the accuracy and attention span needed to spot every lie and truth, you will still stumble inevitably through the game regardless of how good your detective skills are. As this game isn't rated on how good of a shooter you are or how fast you can drive across the city in an explosive car without taking any damage, the game demanded to be aesthetically pleasing and challenging and it is most definitely both of the above.In true Rockstar style there are lots of the little side missions for you to get stuck into, Hidden Classic Cars from the 40's and random items scattered around the city for you to hunt down and the odd attire customization. Although a lot of people may have felt that this was going to be the next GTA, they will be pleasantly disappointed. The free roam option gives those gamers a little blast from the past but like i said at the start, L.A Noire is in a class of its own, it finds a sweet mid-point between the complexity of crime scene clues from CSI and the free flowing action that Rockstar is famous for.To conclude, the storyline and the interweaving of the cases make for a strong storyline, the graphical cinematic aesthetic quality and the originality (Like intuition points to help you separate the lies from the truth) could make this game a perfect buy for the right type of gamer. I can't help feel that even those gamers who love a slow paced puzzle crime solver will get bored of the repetitiveness that arises as the game goes on. Either way I was not disappointed although I like many others thought it was going to be more like GTA.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZD18","reviewerName":"Marshall W. Carter \"Ornery Gamer, Fiend Club ...","summary":"Really kind of a great little box...","reviewText":"The OUYA gets a whole lot of bad press, and I honestly don't know why. Maybe it's the unrealistic expectations of the early adopters. Maybe it's the deluge of promises from OUYA that it would cause a tidal wave of disruption to a stagnant gaming industry. Maybe it's an unimpressed, jaded gaming press that doesn't care unless your hardware has the latest GPU installed. Maybe it has something to do with how thus far, OUYA's marketing has basically alienated the mainstream gamer with a \"we don't need you\" mantra when the fact is, in order to sell enough units, they really do need them. Regardless of what it is, I find myself liking OUYA's little gaming box, even if it does have a lot of rough edges. I like rough edges.To be fair, the OUYA has had its issues. The controller lag made a lot of games unplayable (this has largely been taken care of thanks to tons of software updates), the lack of native streaming apps for Netflix and Hulu make it a hard sell as a streaming box for most people (no matter how well XBMC works), wireless performance has been horrid for some (though I've oddly had no issues with my release-day unit), 8GB just simply isn't enough storage for most users (this has been remedied, again through software updates, although the external storage features are still in open beta) and a lot of the games people want to play just aren't on the platform (though that's a selling point for some it seems). Whether these are negatives for you will really depend on what you're looking for, but if nothing else, it shows that the OUYA team is committed to resolving issues, as the little box is a whole lot more stable now than it was from day one.Streaming is a mixed bag on the OUYA. My personal experience with XBMC (XBox Media Center for the uninitiated, which these days has very little to actually do with the XBox) streaming via TVersity has been a positive one, as it's largely been able to playback most everything that I've thrown at it. Some files have required me to re-rip/re-encode them, but that's an issue on any box. The lack of native apps for Netflix and Hulu remains an issue and one of the most glaring ones available for the platform. If those were available, the OUYA would be an easy sell as an Apple TV or Roku alternative, but without them, XBMC alone just isn't enough. You can sideload apps for those services, as I've done, but the touchscreen interfaces those Android apps were designed for just doesn't make for a great experience with the OUYA's controller. Sideloading is also something the average consumer just isn't going to want to have to do. If someone wants to go out and buy a media box for their HDTV, they want something that's going to work right out of the box. They're not going to want to have to jump through the hoops that sideloading demands.OUYA is kind of difficult to wholeheartedly recommend as a gaming box as well, not because I don't like the gaming experience (I do), but because a lot of the \"indie\" games available for it just aren't that great. I love the platform for some of the obscure indie (and even free) titles that are available (Bombsquad, Maldita Castilla, Donkey Me and Amazing Frog! come to mind), but a lot of other standout OUYA titles are also available on other platforms (Sine Mora, Saturday Morning RPG, TowerFall, Final Fantasy III, 100 Rogues, The Cave, etc.). That OUYA has released a platform where anyone can make a console game with minimal financial overhead and a streamlined means of releasing titles on their marketplace is great and a boon for indie developers getting their feet wet on console development, but having them continue development for OUYA after that might prove difficult given the comparatively small customer base (something you need to sell more OUYA boxes to improve).All that said, and as negative as it might sound, for $99, the OUYA is still kind of hard to resist. It might not be the best at accomplishing any one function, but a small $99 box that will stream media, play games, provide a stable development platform to indie developers and give customers the ability to sideload any number of Android apps to it is still going to provide a whole lot of entertainment (and learning) to a whole lot of people. Whether or not that number of people is ultimately large enough to continue OUYA's \"disruption\" of the gaming industry remains to be seen, but I'm hoping that they'll be able to carve out as much of a niche in the current generation as they can so that they can ultimately stick around for some time to come. As long as they're part of the game (a sometimes cutthroat industry that's scene once-great console makers like Atari and Sega fall to the wayside), they'll have a chance to make those dreams of disruption a reality.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2014"}

And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"Laura","summary":"Mario is back","reviewText":"I love all the Mario Kart games, this one has some of the coolest tracks.

{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"C.E.","summary":"I wanna be a ninja!","reviewText":"See, I just dont see the point in writing reviews of products before they come out.

While the first level seems a bit slow, it is all a set up to get you familiar with the controls and the system of movement.  This game is a visual masterpiece.With an impressive frame rate, and a blindingly fast character, prepare to be amazed.Gameplay is just as frenzied, fast, and furious as the visual presentation.  The levels are quite large, and in later levels can get quite complex and difficult to traverse.  The story is engaging as well, and the voice acting is pretty well done too.  This game is not one for the casual weekend gamer.  Shinobi will require you to invest some time in it...most evidently in the later levels.  With your sword hungry for blood, you need to keep eliminating enemies in order to keep it satiated, if not- it will turn on you and start to deplete your energy.  So you need to find a balance between fighting the enemies and just rushing past them to the end of the level.I read a review of this game in a popular playstation magazine, and was startled that it got less than glowing reviews.

The problem is, Maximo's a more modern take on GnG but offers gameplay that's marred with frustrating control, a lack of dual analog stick action and some of the worst draw distance I've actually seen on the PS2. (Matter of fact, the only other game that suffered with such frustrating controls would be a game called \"Spirits and Spells\" for the Gamecube which was considerably worst)The main problems of the game would be actually judging the distance of a well timed jump or judging the distance of an attack against an enemy right in front of you who more than most of the time DOES NOT GET HIT.The enemies have a great system of fighting and their techniques vary. (Not so much with what they're doing, but when they actually do it) Maximo himself is armed with a sword, shield, armor and some neat powers such as a flaming sword, longer sword, a lightsaber-esque looking sword variation and so on. But I found that no matter what I was armed with, the best gameplay approach was TAKING MY TIME. Because not only are the enemies hard and in overwhelming numbers, but levels are riddled with traps such as the ground collapsing on you, arms reaching from the ground sapping health etc.With that said, here's the good news.The graphics are good.The game resembles a gamecube platformer rather than the usual \"jaggy\" games on the PS2. It's smooth, the colors are crisp, rich and vibrant and it really takes advantage of what the PS2's capable of; which is an incredible feat considering this is an early title. Certainly, it doesn't look as good as some PS2 games like Jak and Daxter or Rachet and Clank, but it certainly ranks very high and looks tons better than a good number of PS2 games.All in all, I enjoyed this game. If it wasn't for the frustrating controls and lack of dual analog sticks, this would've gotten a better score from me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2012"}

But I was leery at the beginning because the only thing that drew me to Call of Duty was the online game play. Well I thought I would give this game a shot because I personally like World War games like this one. I was in for a big surprise when I booted this game up.Presentation...The overall feel of the game I believe is great. The audio and graphics everything is set up in a good manner of everything. I think the game is a little dark however I think it has to be with the amount of everything going on. The game feels and looks great, nothing to complain about here. I give this category a 5/5Graphics...The graphics in this game are awesome. The amount of blood when you shoot and or stab someone is a good amount. The guns look real which is a plus they are spot on with guns bused back then. There are night mission and they look cool. Overall the game looks pretty good. I give this category a 5/5Audio/Sound...The audio in this game is fantastic, the certain songs that play during the game such as the war marches and so on are spot on and they sound awesome. The sounds of the guns and the voice over's are also done very well. Also in the \"Nazi Zombie\" modes there are songs in that game mode which are pretty catchy as well. I give this category a 5/5Game play...Now this is where a few problems come into the play, it is basically the same game play as Call of Duty 4 which is a downside because there is no cover system and no cut scenes. Now I know a lot of people can careless about that but not this gamer, I think those two little things would improve the game by a lot. However the campaign and multiplayer along with the hidden Nazi Zombie mode add to this games fun factor, I think this is a game that can be played a long time after it was release. I'm still playing it. I give this category a 4.5/5Story...This story kicks some major butt. It completely blows any story that Call of Duty has done out of the water. The amount of mission is just enough the characters are well played and developed, you don't jump around as much which seems to happen allot in the Call of Duty franchise, and the ending is just awesome!! Great storyline. I give this category a 5/5The Wrap up...This game is classified as a classic in my eyes. The campaign is one of the best that I personally have ever played and I like games set back in this time period. The guns look just like they did back then which is a big plus. Plus the Zombie mode make this game have a high replay value so you can't go wrong with this game.

It pleases me to report that Kirby's Epic Yarn not only breathes new life into the Kirby franchise but also marks a return to Nintendo's roots of stylish graphics combined with innovative game mechanics.The game is very easy to control and players from ages six to ninety-six should have no problems learning how to play. You hold the Wii controller sideways so that the D-Pad is on the left and the 1 and 2 buttons are on the right. Button 2 controls Kirby's jumping and other movement functions such as turning into a parachute when falling. Button 1 is Kirby's action button and is used for attacking, latching on to various objects, throwing enemies and even shooting projectiles. The controls are very intuitive and responsive. You won't need to think about how Kirby moves and jumps, it really will come naturally to you.As you most likely know, the graphics follow a fabric theme. After an unfortunate encounter with a sorcerer, Kirby loses his classic abilities and is transformed into a creature made of yarn. He finds himself in a strange kingdom called Patch World. The developers really ran with the fabric theme as the game looks like a big fluffy bed. Backgrounds are made of pieces of fabric. Buildings and other items are patches. You don't so much open a treasure chest as you pull it off of the fabric to reveal the treasure hiding underneath it. Kirby can also manipulate the environment around him. At one point you may be working your way up a tree and pull on a certain button which will cause the whole tree to collapse to a more manageable height.The game also sounds great. The whimsical music reminds me very much of the Forrest Gump soundtrack and you'll hear pianos, flutes and other classical instruments in what turns out to be a very pleasing playlist of melodies. The game sound effects sound cartoony, particularly when unraveling enemies into bits of yarn but are very appropriate to the atmosphere.I hesitate to refer to Kirby's Epic Yarn as a sandbox game but those elements are certainly present. You can wander around a palace, go to the plaza where you can listen to the game's music or watch videos, collect rare items or even decorate your apartment with furniture. As Kirby you wander across Patch World and must walk to a level and select it in order to play. Various patches and items reveal new levels as Kirby hunts for bits of magic yarn to stitch Patch World together.The game does have some very challenging moments but Kirby's Epic Yarn may seem relatively slow paced compared to some action games out there. This game is very reminiscent of classic Nintendo titles in that regard.I feel that this game is a very worthy addition to the Wii library and have no problems recommending it to my friends as well as the younger members of my family.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2010"}

They ALWAYS go over to the last place they saw you at, so you can come at them from a different direction & take them out however you see fit. I'll be playing this game twice for sure!Then to add to the longevity of the game, there's also a co-op thing you can do with a friend.

Honestly, my gaming skill level and enthusiasm probably don't rise to that if the highest reviews here.The puzzles are fun and challenging, the combat is gripping. But certain parts of the game got a little redundant for my taste.  The game's final battle is the best example of this.  After hack, hack, hacking away at Zeus THEN unleashing a barrage of earthquake magic THEN using the golden fleece about ten times to throw his bolts back at him, THEN toppling SEVERAL stone columns on his head, I felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment. HELL YEAH! I GOT HIM! FINALLY!Then I quickly learned that the game STILL wasn't over. The final death stroke took several tries and finally he went down.Honestly, I thought this last act was a little too much and it could have just as easily ended in the previous round.And the game STILL wasn't over: I had to go back downstairs, activate the magic mirror, then go back through it.The game seems to go on forever. That's not a big deal, unless of course it becomes noticeable. And for me it did.I guess what I'm saying is that this game felt more like work than fun.The typical pattern for me was this:1.  Clobber the bad guy with 100 or so fierce strokes from Kratos' blades2. Unleash a deadly barrage of earthquake magic, damaging the villain even further.3. Hurl the bad guy's firepower back at him  20 times with the Golden fleece.I'd spend about ten minutes doing this, and to my astonishment, the enemy was still very much alive. I kept saying \"hurry up and die already!\"It didn't make it more difficult, per se- just tedious and frankly a little boring.I'm giving it four stars because, my personal feelings aside, it's still an incredible game in terms of graphics and combat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2010"}

(the \"white Phosphorus\" is a great example)my only gripe with the single player (and I knew about it)is it's really Really short.. 3-5 hours tops. and it leavs you wanting more a lot more because it's really good!the multiplayer seems slightly too crowded ( you will get shot Often even of you're one of the uber shooter players) and if you didn't get gamestops unlock pack you'll have a bunch of difficulty in the beginning. it's NOT very Noob Frendly.after unlocking some new goodies (to which there are TONS)you really start to get a \"feel\" for the weapons and the game engine. the weapons all have a \"unique\" feel and sound quite good with Loas of attachments that shooter fans will be familiar with. the best part about this shooter is it doesn't take 50 shots to kill another player, 1-3 shots tops and snipers will love the sniper rifles since they're deadly as heck! lots of preset loadouts that can be customized too right down to weapon camo! the controlls are standard Battlefield/COD controlls so everyone will love that. ammo runs out Really Fast so that's a bit of a pain. to get more ammo, you'll have to Spend Battlepoints (the games currency)you also get experience like every other FPS. the maps everyone will love with lots of sniper areas (really high perches) and the ability to go Prone is excellent. I can see this multiplayer will have lasting appeal for a very long time. the maps are Gigantic compared to most shooters wich are a welcome change.the graphics are average with nothing that really stands out and makes you say \"wow that's Impressive\" and the non destructable environments make the game feel really last gen.the Battle commander is excellent putting a bunch of pressure on the best player in every match since it puts Missions (like a bounty) on the best killer. the games vehicle reward system is brilliantso you NEVER get a vehicle stolen and you also choose to spawn in the vehicle or in a gunner chair which is great. no one mobbing the vehicles (except to kill em')RPG's are fairly overpowered and if you hated BFBC2's Helicopter prepare for true hate here, the helicopters are insanely powerful here. in my First match I got mowed by it dozens of times while I figured out where to hide. it's a fairly hardcore shooter that non FPS fans should avoid. this is for COD and Battlefielders.the most fun to be had though and the gem of the package is the goodies, you get new gun unlocks, battle point buyables, loads of buyable perks, drones wich are an absolute blast to use, both ground and air. tanks I'd have preferred BFBC2's Cockpit view (sighting down the gun is awkward) otherwise it's the most solid shooter to come along in a very long time. be sure to set your turning sensitivity up since it's default is a little sluggish.Graphics: good but nothing new nor impressive 3 of 5 starsSound: satisfactory with decent ambient sounds 4 of 5 starsGameplay: with so many perks, good controls, vehicles and dronesit's a blast and controls very well though a tad sluggish also HUGE Maps and 32 players (though 32 players is a plus and minus)4 of 5 starsOverall: a solid shooter from THQ that hardcore FPS fans will definately want to play 4 of 5 stars overall.Buy Homefront here:Link:Homefront(PS3 Review Only)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2011"}

The layout of buttons and analog joysticks feels nice to the hand.  For lack of better words... it has a nice grip for long play.If you have small hands then this one may feel a bit clunky and cumbersome.  I have long fingers so the added girth of the handles was perfect whereas the PS3 controller always felt a bit petite.  Charge time was rather quick at 3 hours but don't expect to play while being connected because the supplied cord is just too short!  I was ready to come on here and bash this equipment because for the first couple of times playing it felt as if the controller was unresponsive or lagging.  We made sure to fully charge and it happened again.  Now it doesn't seem to have that issue any longer.  I wish I could give a reason for the change.  If the issue does arise again, then I will update my review and star rating to reflect that.Another minor issue is that the HOME button no longer turns the system on.

I gave it 5 stars because of all the inovative ideas put into the game. I also raved about its excellent surrounding environment in the different planets you can chose to play in. I now take back what I have said with Part 2 of my SWG review.After noticing the fact that I used to play an hour a day, I was still just a novice pistoleer. Why is this? Because you have to play a LOT to become anywhere good in the game. A huge flaw in this game is that it takes no skill at all whatsoever. The entire game is based off of the amount of time clocked into your life to play. Your grandmother could play this game the rest of her life, knowing NOTHING about video games, and still do very well. Once past the steep learning curve in the game, all that stands in your way is time itself. If you have the time, then go ahead, no-lifer, play, play, play, and play, until you become a master marksman, or medic, or whatever.This isn't the worst problem though. The game is extremely repetative. Sure, going out with 15 people in Lok killing space bunnies with many different types of players is fun at first. Then you start to realize taht you can only make money by doing pointless missions and crafting weapons/armor for bigger and more extreme players. Alright, that isn't so much fun. Then we have the skill system. Possibly the only good part about the game, the skill system is a great way to mix skills to have more unique characters. Ok, you can be a master medic and a master pistoleer and a somewhat good creature handler, but what's after that? I don't know, absolutely nothing. Once you max out your skill points, the only thing else to do is to give up skills and start new ones (or if you are THAT good of a character, redo your skills again). Great, I am paying 15 dollars of my hard-earned money every month to learn max out about 12 different professions... Fun...And about that 15 dollars a month. Even within 2 months of release, servers are frequently down getting updated. Those 15 dollars are not going to the right places. When I had technical problems with the game, the SOE reps on the phone were not only giving me a big headache, but were so unprofessional that they were wasting my time, thus the 15 dollar phonecall to California that day. Atleast use that money to get better reps and to get people that actually know how to make good patches for the game. Then I might have considered keeping my account.Earlier I discussed repetativeness. Did I mention that there isn't one single vehicle that you are able to freely drive in this game? Sure, take a shuttle port to different cities, or a starport to different planets. GOOD LUCK walking 10,000 meters away from town for an 800 credit mission. Doing so will require you to use auto-run, thank god that was implemented. (For any players reading this review, it is the numlock key). I was able to watch the first quarter of The Screensavers on Tech TV and still have a few minutes before I got to my destination. The best players will be the ones with nothing else better to do than sit around holding the forward key, or watching your stupid character traverse across the world. Fun fun fun.All of this for a rediculous price of 15 dollars a month. I can easily have more fun playing Disney's new ToonTown MMORPG, which costs 4 bucks a month. Yay. I can even include a subscription to planetside - a critically acclaimed MMORPG - to still have a lower cost than ONE account to SWG. And I would probably have more fun playing these games as well.To conclude, the game was fun while it lasted. Now I am selling my perfectly conditioned game back to the store for 1/4 of the original price and moarning over the loss of 30 dollars, which I could have spent in much better ways. This is the last of my money Sony Online Entertainment is getting from me.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2003"}

This game on Xbox 360 is great, the graphics are a big step up, and the gameplay has quite a few added features.The graphics, had to be one of the biggest step ups in this game. There is more going on everywhere, which uses alot of the 360's potential for its graphical abilities. When playing this game, first off youll notice the deep enviromental look, the player models are definately enhanced in this game also. Explosions, just everything graphically is enhanced, a major plus.The sound is again great, just like the previous Call Of Duty games. The music first of all, matches the scenes perfectly with whats going on in the game, plus that old World War music. Another plus for the sound, is when in battle, you always hear your allies yelling and shouting about something, notifying you of enemy presence or just yelling at the enemy. Great sound effects from things blowing up, guns firing, and soldiers make the sound in this game a major plus.The controls, again really easy to handle. Theres some added features in this game, that werent in Call Of Duty 2. But ill explain a bit later. But basically, the controls in this game are exactly the same as the controls on Call Of Duty 2.Overall, Call Of Duty 3 is really fun just like COD 2 was. The single player takes you across campaigns spanning from the US Army, Polish, Canadian and English. Therefore, you get a taste of the action from quite a few different sides. I think that the single player campaign could have been quite a bit longer than it was, but it was decent length. Some additions I think were good in this game was the hand to hand combat in single player. When you come around a corner, a nazi will jump at you with his rifle and try to attack you, you can push him back with it and eventually hit him with his gun and take him out. Doing so, youll need to press certain buttons to finish it. Another addition, was the bomb planting. You have to also press certain buttons and move the thumbsticks plant them. In COD 3 you can also use Mortar guns, its a bit difficult sometimes but you can catch on quite easily.The multi-player in this game is crazy and a HUGE step up from Call Of Duty 2 big time. You can play unranked games, and ranked games. Everything in gameplay, is just so balanced, the shooting and the game types it makes it an overall enjoyable experience. Despite this, there is quite a few bugs that have plagued the online play. Sometimes, you wont even be able to join an unranked game because it says you cannot connect when there is no reason why you shouldnt be able too. But if your looking for ranked games, you should have no issues.Overall, I highly reccomend this game to Call Of Duty fans, or First Person Shooter Fans. If your familiar with COD 2, youll catch on to this game easy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2007"}

It looked fantastic, used every single hardware feature, and had well crafted puzzles and dungeons. Spirit Tracks continues that with trains, more clever puzzles, new weapons, and a longer game. Despite Spirit Tracks holding up to Zelda standards, it does have some flaws that hold it back a bit.You start out like any other Zelda game near Hyrule Castle. You're a train engineer and need to go to the graduation ceremony performed by Princess Zelda. Zelda gets captured by an evil guy and you have to save her. Typical Zelda and Nintendo stuff. The story is simple and not very interesting, but everyone loves Zelda for clever puzzles and dungeons. Spirit Tracks has plenty of those but before you dive into a dungeon you are introduced to driving a train. Like the seafaring adventure of Windwaker and Phantom Hourglass, Nintendo thought it would be nice to do something by land. You can draw your route on the touch screen and then you can adjust your speed. It's kind of cool at first, especially when you get passengers because you need to follow all the road signs such as blowing your horn (done by pulling a string on the touch screen) and adjusting your speed. However, you aren't just enjoying the scenery, you will get attacked on the tracks. The Spirit Train is equipped with a cannon to solve these issue and your train has health. You can also shoot rocks around you for health and rupees.Once you get into a dungeon you are in the meat of the game. They start out pretty easy with simple puzzles, but they get extremely tough later on. The phantoms are back from Hourglass -- you need to collect 3 Tears of Light in the dungeon to be able to let Zelda possess them and help you out. Yes, Zelda accompanies you in ghost form. The dungeons are multi leveled. You will need to ascend and descend floors to access new parts of other floors. This back and forth was very confusing in Hourglass, but is a bit less so here. The dungeons also get bigger and more complex. Towards the 6th and final temple I had to resort to a walkthrough because I was completely lost. Some puzzles are so obscure you will never figure them out. The various weapons you get are fun to use, but having to try all of them to figure something out can be frustrating.Combat is also a bit frustrating. Some times the touch controls don't do what you want. Using your whirlwind, bow, whip, sand wand, and sword are not just for puzzle solving. Some enemies are only weak to the boomerang while others are weak to the whip. Some need multiple weapons to be defeated, but the menu system is annoying. Let me have a radial menu by holding the weapon icon, don't make me go into a menu like I'm playing an SNES game. Same goes for platforming. Half the time I died because Link would jump where I didn't want him to. The game just gets so hard and frustrating towards the end some people may not finish it.At least the boss fights are fun and clever. They make use of both screens and require fast reflexes and timing to defeat. These bosses are just a lot of fun and feel satisfying to fight. There's another neat thing which is using the Spirit Flute to play songs. Once you complete a few dungeons you will start to notice repetition setting in and the game starts to feel stale. It mainly has to do with having to drive this train so damn much. You have to return the rails by finding rail maps in the spirit tower which are a whole new set of dungeons. In all there's 16 dungeons which is about 10 too many. Not to mention all the monotonous and pointless side quests spread throughout the game like stamp collecting, rabbit hunting, errand running etc. I passed all these up because getting around on the train is a major pain. You can warp to other parts of the realm but you still have to drive a long way to get there. It doesn't help that there are enemy trains on the track and some times it's hard to predict where they are going. You can't reverse fast enough so if you get hit you end up starting at the beginning of the map again.Despite the minor flaws in Spirit Tracks it's very enjoyable and charming to play. When you get into the dungeons and dive into them they feel very cleverly put together and are pretty fun to explore and solve. However, the length of the game isn't fitted for portable play. Each dungeon takes over an hour to beat which isn't setup for quick plays. Any Zelda fan will fall in love with Spirit Tracks, but the impatient won't.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2013"}

I myself consider Super Metroid one of the greatest games of all time, and I was wondering all these years when a follow-up would arrive. After eight years, the wait was finally over.Mertoid Prime isn't really a sequel, since it takes place between the events of the first Metroid and Metroid II. Basically, Samus lands on a frigate in high orbit over Tallon IV. She realizes that the Space Pirates are up to no good, so she (for anyone who didn't know, Samus is female) investigates, and when the ship is about to explode, she sees an old nemesis. Upon landing at Tallon IV, she investigates further, learning more about the Pirates' plans, the Chozo, and other things. The Space Pirates' master plan: to use a mutagen called Phazon to enhance their ranks and create stronger forces.The Graphics are so polished and so good that you'll think it was Metroid all over again. It's only up close that the quality falters, but it's negligable. The game also supports Dolby Pro Logic II, which is as good as its Digital counterpart, and also supports progressive scan. The control mechanics aren't hard to master, and are somewhat based on the mechanics of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. You'll be using the Scan Visor a lot. You have to in order to get the best ending.Grand Theft Auto: Vice City needs to step aside. I can understand why it and GTA III were so successful, but, was anyone even paying attention to the graphics? I've seen graphics like that on the N64.This game is an instant classic, and has the potential to be the greatest game of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2002"}
{"product_name":"Logitech G500s Laser Gaming Mouse with Adjustable Weight Tuning","description":"","reviewerName":"Jen \"Geek Girl\"","summary":"Fantastic top-end gaming mouse at a great price","reviewText":"I picked this up for use when I'm on the go as an alternative to my G600, and I'm so glad I did. When not playing MMO's that require the extra buttons that the G600 provide, this mouse is the absolute best out there. I love the variety of weights included. I've never had such a customizable weighted mouse before and it makes a HUGE difference in my gameplay. Finding just the right weight has increased my control and precision dramatically.The dual-mode scroll wheel is also something I never knew I needed but can't live without now. It is extremely useful when playing games like WoW where when you're hanging around town you want the click scroll, but in PvP you're much better off using the ultra fast speed scrolling. Being able to switch between these modes is pure genius and I find myself really missing this feature when I go back to my G600 for raiding.The DPI surprisingly goes beyond any gaming mouse I've ever had, most which top off at 7000. Paired with my Razer gaming mouse pad, I never ever see that dread mouse skip which can mean life or death in an intense battle. Being able to change it on the fly without flipping through cumbersome menus is great as well. Knowing that all this is saved on my mouse and not on the device makes it absolutely perfect for travel. I have several laptops for different purposes (work, school & play) and I love not having to reconfigure it every time I hook it up to a new machine or take it to a friend's house for a gaming session.Overall I think it's a fantastic buy. It feels sturdy and well made and looks great at the same time. I don't miss any of the flashy lights or fancy designs of my other mice when using the G500s. All that matters is performance. I really like the new Logitech logo also. It was time for a change! My only regret is not having more time to enjoy it with finals right around the corner! I can't wait to spend some quality time with my G500s come winter break. :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2013"}

Young \"Hello\"","summary":"Good but Flaws","reviewText":"This is an ok game. It plays like everyone else says it does, but there are definately some programming flaws throughout. They mostly happen when you do things in an order the game does not expect you to. One area for example, you must kill the musician to get your creatures to stop dancing in a trance. I did that. I left the area for something and came back, so they started dancing in their trance again getting killed by the locals. Well the musician was still gone, no music playing, so I had no choice but to watch them die.The game is very linear. Yes, no map is horrible and yes, you can and do walk around in circles. Some areas, everything looks the same.It is an addicting game so far, but if you play this, you have to admit that no matter how cute some of the sayings are, they get rather annoying after a few hours. They say the same things over and over and over. Many areas, the sayings are triggered by where you walk past, so every time you walk past the same area, you hear the same saying over and over.I would put this as a game worth closer to $40, not $60.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2007"}

Fortunately, with some key personnel back on board, the folks at Crystal Dynamics and Eidos have put together Tomb Raider Legend, a game that's much more true to what made the series actually attractive in the first place.Of course, Lara Croft is back as the well-endowed and athletic protagonist, and this time she's going to delve into a mystery that involves her parents, long lost friends, and plenty of ancient ruins to explore through.Unlike past Tomb Raider games, Legend goes back to its roots with a healthy does of exploration and puzzle-solving. You'll still use your dual pistols, complete with infinite ammo, to take out plenty of bad guys throughout the game, but the killing of various wildlife is pretty much gone. There will be a leopard or an attack dog to kill every once in a while, but mostly you're going to be fighting various commandos that also want whatever Lara's looking for in those ruins.Combat is much more stylish than in the earlier games. Lara can still flip, dive, and roll while shooting, but now she's got even more acrobatic moves. Charge an enemy and slide at them while shooting, and you'll pop them up into the air, ragdoll-physics-style, and keep shooting them. Jump at an enemy and then jump again once your feet reach their face, and Lara will do a graceful, slow motion backflip off of the guy's head while shooting him simultaneously. We've seen this kind of stuff in games before, but the delivery here is very satisfying. And Lara isn't just limited to pistols; she can carry very powerful grenades, and she can carry an extra, limited ammo weapon on her back, like an assault rifle, grenade launcher, or shotgun.Lara's got plenty of moves she can employ even when her guns are safely in their holsters. When it comes to acrobatic moves, Tomb Raider Legend has picked it up habits once again from the Prince of Persia series of games (the Tomb Raider games have borrowed plenty of platforming elements from the original Prince of Persia games from the late '80s and early '90s). Lara moves gracefully as she hops, climbs, flips, and shimmies around. The animations are great, and the situations Lara gets into can get intense. There are a few dramatically scripted sequences, complete with a \"tap this button right now or Lara gets crushed or falls to her death\" element, which will keep you on your toes. Some Tomb Raider purists might scoff at these part-Dragon's Lair, part-Shenmue moments, but I think it's a good way to make sure that players are paying attention to the action at all times, even if it's during a cutscene.Mixed in with the platforming and action elements are some new sequences on a motorcycle. Although Lara can shoot from the bike, you will find quickly that you really have to watch the path in front of you. Every bump against the wall or a rock costs you plenty of health, so watch the road! Well, in this case, watch the dirt path. These sequences are kind of fun but leave something to be desired, especially the very, very short motorcycle sequence in Tokyo.Most of Tomb Raider Legend's difficulty comes from the puzzles that are laid out in many of the ruins. Combat is usually pretty easy since everyone but Lara is a terrible shot, and most of your enemies stand still while you're flying around the room, and the controls are pretty sharp and easy to get used to. That leaves actually figuring out what to do when the game presents a puzzle, and the first major one will test your logic skills right from the start. Sure, Lara has some crazy binoculars that can \"scan\" items like what we saw in Metroid Prime, but the game still doesn't tell you how to solve anything. You'll have to figure them out for yourself.The addition of a grappling hook makes for some interesting gameplay in Legend. You'll need to use it to pull things towards you, smash things open, pull yourself towards something else, or even swing from the ceiling like Indiana Jones on his whip. That last bit only happens in specific spots, though, so you can't just use it to go all Tarzan to escape an area.While the developers seem to have tried to make sure that there aren't any major frame rate issues that pop up in mid-jump or during combat, it's a little disconcerting having the game slow down significantly just because you decided to swing the camera around a bit.The locales you'll be visiting in Legend range from the Ghana rainforests to Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Tokyo, and even Peru. The developers have done a great job mixing up the pacing, sending you back into ruins just before you get tired of shimmying around the edge on a Tokyo skyscraper (and vice versa). While Lara's adventure this time around is pretty short, the exploration elements, great visuals that the Xbox 360 can produce, and even the surprisingly interesting story all come together to make a pretty solid game anyway. Those who aren't big on finding hidden bonus items or replaying levels in a \"time attack\" mode might find that the price is too high to pay for six to eight hours of gameplay, but there's plenty here to satisfy both those who like to rent or buy their games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2006"}

The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance.

There aren't enough games of that description coming out anymore, and even Square's Final Fantasy series doesn't really fit the mold anymore. The problem isn't with the underlying system, which hasn't evolved much since 2001 and doesn't need to, but the balance of the game. Somehow, and I have no idea how this happened, Dark Dawn manages to have very few random battles and simultaneously be easier than just about any RPG I've ever played. I'm not asking the game to make me grind, but at 15 hours I have yet to use an item for healing. I also have yet to have a character knocked out. The last 2 boss battles are the first ones where I've needed to heal at all.I never thought I'd complain that an RPG had too few random battles, but here it is; Golden Sun: Dark Dawn has too few. Since they're so easy, one can blow through them by tapping A over and over again to use the regular attacks with no strategy, no peril, and no challenge.And that's not getting into the lack of boss battles. It used to be standard procedure- finish a dungeon, there's a boss. The bad guy shows up? Fight his underling, and/or him. Creepy plant look at you funny? Kill it dead. But for some reason, modern RPGs miss this, and Dark Dawn is a particularly bad offender. Somehow, the developers thought that after a long conversation with the game's villains, we would be all geared up to... exit the dungeon and return the world map. How hard is this? Color swap some late-game enemies, add a single line of dialogue (\"Enough talk! Face this thing I found under my sink!\" or some such), and cue the special music. You can even skip a couple of those steps if you're lazy. Just give me more bosses! Or stronger regular enemies! Anything to make the game more challenging!The basic strategy for any boss battle can be summarized by this; unleash all your djinn, cast the highest-level summon you have, and if the boss is still alive, attack until the djinn are reset and repeat. I've fought one boss so far that lives through the first step. I assume the game thinks that unleashing djinn is a trade-off to the increased stats that they grant, but honestly? I never even noticed. A risk-reward system of this type would be an interesting was to improve on the old RPG formula, but it's a wasted opportunity here.And that's not even touching that statuses hardly have any affect on gameplay; I've been \"wrapped in delusion\" more times than I can count and I still don't know what it does. Locking an enemy's psyenergy sounds useful, but why bother, since the game is so easy? And once again I have the question of why regular attacks don't wake sleeping enemies or party members. The game also seems to think that packing dungeons with items that heal these will somehow balance this, when really it just makes me think, \"Aw, I wanted new armor.\"AND money is a joke. I never had to sell equipment or anything else in order afford new equipment, and the one time I couldn't afford new equipment for everyone, it didn't even matter because the game is so easy. Since there's no point in buying healing items, and the statuses that actually do something (like being haunted) can't be cured with items anyway, I am sitting on a big pile of money that can't be used. The buying and selling interface could be better, too, but it's a minor complaint among these others.But let's step back from all that. Golden Sun: Dark Dawn's dialogue is wretched, even by JRPG standards. I expect some of this. I expect people to talk too much in these games, as a rule. I still don't know what happened throughout most of Final Fantasy XII. But that game was great. There's a sequence in Golden Sun: Dark Dawn, in which the characters indicate that they are rushing to save someone's sister, and that she will be boiled alive if they fail (really). During this section of the game, the characters WILL NOT SHUT UP. Forgive me if I can't sweep this under the rug of \"RPG conventions,\" but can ANYBODY play this sequence and doubt for a second that the sister will be rescued? Can anyone think that their actions will matter in the slightest as to whether the sister will live or die? There are times I can buy this; I understand that Sephiroth's Meteor will hit earth \"sometime soon\" even as I endlessly force chocobos to mate for my amusement. But there are sequences in that game that involved real urgency, where the player's actions could actually make Cloud and friends fail.It doesn't stop there. Dark Dawn's dialogue endlessly repeats itself, even when it writes in sequences that seem designed to avoid doing so. An example; the character Sveta can read minds, and once she does, what does she do? Repeat the same thing that all the other characters in the room, we, and everyone else in the game world ALREADY KNOWS. AND THEN THE OTHER CHARACTERS, WHOSE MINDS HAVE JUST BEEN READ, REPEAT IT TOO. Who can defend this writing?The game's puzzles are marginally better than its dialogue. That is, until one picks up the \"Insight\" psyenergy, which literally puts a filter on the screen that shows you the solution to puzzles. Some of them overcome this by being about positioning and/or some other cleverness, but they are the exception when they should be the rule. Stuck? Use Insight. Now you're not.The looks great and sounds pretty good (though many of the tunes are less memorable than in the first game, and the color palette seems a bit muted compared to that, too), but art design can only go so far. At this point, we need better than competent and good-looking. The only reason to consider Golden Sun: Dark Dawn is if you're like me; starved for a traditional JRPG on a portable system. Lord knows I won't blame you for picking it up, but if you do so before getting the infinitely superior Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 4 remakes, you've lost your will to be entertained.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"Skitz","summary":"The PSP Was Better","reviewText":"This is the PS2 - PS3 scenario repeating itself ALL OVER AGAIN. The same way to the PS3 will never measure up to the PS2, the Vita is milestones away from its predecessor. The most powerful systems have never been on top through out gaming history, & history repeats itself once again. What did the PS2 have that the PS3 didn't? God-like 3rd party support! But not just that! It had the most important aspect of all, BALANCE! Power means nothing to a game console. Games mean everything. Attracting people with power instead of gameplay mechanics and games is the easy way out, & it's the route Sony is taking. On The PS2 you could get ANY type of game, literally. It had all the different genres, & the best in their respective fields. It's why the PS2 was so successful, it appealed to everyone. Western styled gamers got their fix of sports, shooting, and racing, while us Eastern inspired gamers also got our fix of jrps, strategy, & weird over-the-top japanese games.PS2 had it all, as did the PSP. Heck the PSOne had it as well. Nintendo had me by the horns in handheld gaming til the PSP showed up. Best portable gaming system ever made. The PSP had the same support PS2 did. ANY type of game you could think of, in abundance, & top quality at that. The PS3 however instead of staying 50/50 like it's predecessor did, it went something like 85/15. Could even be worse than that. The eastern-ispired library for the PS3 is so tiny I could count it on my hands and feet. Sony has gone almost full-swing westerner, over flowing their systems with the same type of games over and over. They've realized the average westerner is narrow minded and would play the exact game over and over if it had a gun in it or followed up on sports. Western gaming ain't going very far in terms of variety, & now you have the biggest franchises over here being shooting and football games etc, with Sony putting out statements on how \"that's the market now\". It's not that the market for eastern-inspired games ain't there anymore, it's that Sony's following the money trail.The Vita is the same thing. Compared to the PSP it fails hard. Yeah it's powerful, Sony's stuff will always be powerful, but as we can see, they won't always be the best. The Vita could rightfully be called the best portable media device ever made, but not the best portable gaming system. The good games are so few and variety is as dull as the PS3. It's a portable replica of the PS3's mistake. I had high hopes for the Vita but it let me down big time. There aren't enough good games to go around. No wonder it's jam packed with all that other non-related gaming stuff. Now as a result devs are getting lazy/sloppy knowing they can do the same things over and over and make a fortune. Go back to your roots Sony. Push for variety. You're dominating one market but you're failing severely in the other. This is not the Sony-way we have all gotten to know & love.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

As with all releases in theDead Risingseries, it is a survival horror game. Players take on the role of an all-new character, with equally new motivations to survive and resources to do so. These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode, an optional prologue to the game available as downloadable content and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"Louie the Italian Jew \"Lou da Joo\"","summary":"time management=frustration.","reviewText":"I've been playing this game for the past 8 hours or so, so I feel I can give an unbiased review. The reason I bought this game is because I just wanted to mindlessly kill zombies. The commercial made it seem like you can just roam around, change into clothes, and combine weapons in a free world. Then I found out about Katie. Katie is Chuck's daughter and she needs to be given Zombrex every few hours. In order to get Zombrex, you have to defeat some overpowered bosses and rescue people to power up. You can also receive money to buy Zombrex by playing the online mode of Terror is Reality. Terror of Reality is a great assortment of Wii type minigames that are actually fun, with Slicecycles being the best of all. The only problem is that I was sitting in the lobby 6 or 7 times and couldn't get 3 other players to join. When I did play, the session of 4 mini-games, I was allowed to cash out and invest it in the single player funds. After the sessions were over I was forced to quit TIR. The problem I found was after I quit, I couldn't get another 3 people to play. Anyway, this is how I collected my money to buy Zombrex at the pawn shop for each level. There is also hidden Zombrex in the casinos, but there isn't any way somebody can figure out that you must hop across the lights to collect it, without looking at a video on youtube that received 200,000 hits. I wasn't the only one. LOLSo now, I have the Zombrex, the combination weapons, and I go after the bosses. I feel hopeless because as soon as I get hit, the boss demolishes me. Some of the bosses have a hiding spot that you can't go in (like a locked bathroom stall) and will appear for a few seconds coming out at a different location with high powered weapons that drain your health bar in a few seconds. It's almost unfair.On a brighter note, you can keep your current level and replay the game to try to beat the psychos. Also, I found out that the way you tame the tiger (Snowflake) is by throwing her steaks. I saw the youtube video on this, so I'm excited to tame Snowflake, and start the game over for this reason. Another interesting part of the game is mixing drinks. You can mix drinks that gives you a quickstep (walk faster) and other concoctions.There have been parts that actually have gotten me so frustrated also. Here is the situation, you're trying to have a survivor follow you, and you have to keep hitting the B button to speak, and the Y button to skip. Sometimes, in the middle of them speaking, you're fighting off Zombies. I'm thinking to myself, why would I want to read this text? I just want the  person to join me. It's at least a minute process, but feels like a total waste of time. I don't care about their life story, I just want them to follow me, so I can attack the next objective. Then, just to make things more frustrating, they walk slow or stop, and need to be carried, while you're already at the next location (the locations without separation by doors). So..., you have to go back and wait for a 15 second loading screen to get them closer to you, and another loading screen at the location you were going to originally. FRUSTRATING!So, if you're attempting to finish all the missions, you won't have time to browse in the stores, try on outfits, gamble etc. You can do that, but you're going to have to play the multiplayer TIR (if you can find a match)to collect money for Zombrex and fail a lot of the missions. This isn't a game that was meant to be finished the first play-through IMO.There is so much there for this game to be excellent and a game of the year, but there are just too many frustrating moments that focus too much on the time management aspect instead of the free world roam and killing zombie aspect.More save points, and an option to not play the missions would have made this game much more fun IMO.Tip and some combos>>>Tip: You can defeat most psychopaths by attacking them with the Knife Gloves (Bowie Knife + Boxing Gloves) while under the effect of the Pain Killer drink (Beer + Beer or Vodka + Vodka).50 Weapon Combo Cards (use these to level up faster)>>Drill Bucket - Power Drill + BucketI.E.D. - Propane Tank + NailsMolotov - Whiskey + NewspaperPole Weapon - Machete + Push BroomAir Horn - Pylon + Spray PaintGem Blower - Leaf Blower + GemsFountain Lizard - Fountain Fireworks + Lizard HeadHacker - Flashlight + Computer CaseRipper - Cement Saw + Saw BladesElectric Chair - Wheelchair + BatteryFlaming Gloves - Motor Oil + Boxing GlovesHeliblade - Machete + Remote HelicopterFire Spitter - Toy Spitball gun + Tiki TorchBeer Hat - Construction Hat + BeerSticky Bomb - Lawn Dart + DynamiteDriller - Power Drill + SpearDefiler - Fire Axe + Sledge HammerHail Mary - Grenade + FootballFreezer Bomb - Dynamite + Fire ExtinguisherKnife Gloves - Bowie Knife + Boxing GlovesRoaring Thunder - Goblin Mask + BatterySuper Slicer - Servbot Mask + Lawn MowerHandy Chipper - Wheelchair + Lawn MowerDynameat - Dynamite + Hunk of MeatElectric Rake - Rake + BatteryParablower - Leaf Blower + ParasolBoomstick - Pitchfork + ShotgunAuger - Drill Motor + PitchforkInfernal Arms - Training Sword + Motor OilPorta Mower - Lawn Mower + 2x4Super B.F.G. - Blast Frequency Gun + AmplifierTesla Ball - Bingo Ball Cage + BatterySpear Launcher - Leaf Blower + SpearBllitzkrieg - Electric Chair + Assault GunFlamethrower - Water Gun + Gas CanisterRocket Launcher - Lead Pipe + Rocket FireworksTenderizers - MMA Gloves + Box of NailsPower Guitar - Electric Guitar + AmplifierLaser Sword - Flashlight + GemsBlambow - Bow and Arrow + DynamiteFreedom Bear - Robot Bear + LMGPaddlesaw - Paddle + ChainsawSnowball Cannon - Water Gun + Fire ExtinguisherSpiked Bat - Bat + Box of NailsWingman - Queen + NectarBurning Skull - Bull Skull + Motor OilExsanquinator - Vacuum Cleaner + Saw BladesPlate Launcher - Cement Saw + platesBlazing Aces - Tennis Racket + Tiki TorchHoly Arms - Training Sword + Nailsedit 11/15 (changing 3 star rating to a 4 star rating since it's only fair)I just reached Level 25. I have a question for the developers. Why couldn't you allow the character to walk this fast at the beginning of the game, and just allow for certain weapon combos to be unlocked at the higher stages? The game is SOOO frustrating at the beginning, and doesn't give anybody without a lot of time on their hands to enjoy this game. I now understand why some review sites were giving this game a 9/10, but the beginning stages without being able to walk fast deserve much less. Why couldn't a gamer level up by playing without having to play the missions? There should have been an option to play DR2 without playing the missions. This could have given gamers the ability to enjoy the game without the time management, and for the gamer to experiment without having to complete missions. Anyway, looking forward to completing the game now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"The_Scrutiny","summary":"A bad start to a great series","reviewText":"Uncharted. When you think about the PS3, this is probably one of the first series that comes to mind, and rightfully so. The Uncharted series has a reputation for incredible storytelling and mind-blowing setpieces. As a huge fan of the second and third games, I'm sad to say that this first entry does NOT do the series justice. In fact, this might even be one of Naughty Dog's worst games. Here's my review:Story: 5/5As Nathan Drake, you and 2 others travel to an island to find El Dorado, a large treasure that the Spanish and Francis Drake, your ancestor, were after. Using Francis Drake's journal, you'll attempt to find this famous gold statue while surviving the onslaught of men who are also after it. This is a well-written story filled with memorable characters, both good and evil. Here, you'll find mystery, plot twists, and everything else that makes a story superb.Setting: 5/5The island you'll spend your time on is well-designed, but don't think that since it's a jungle setting, you'll stare at trees the whole time. You'll ride a jet ski upriver, wander through catacombs, and solve indoor puzzles in addition to taking in the sights of the jungle. There's a wealth of visual variety to be had here. With all the effort put into this island, you might even begin to think this is a real place.Gameplay: 2/5----Combat----At its core, Uncharted is a shooter. And as much as I enjoy my occasional shooter games, I thought this huge aspect of Uncharted was an enormous failure. You will gun down HUNDREDS of enemies that the game throws at you by the truckload! It's completely outrageous! When there are 7 waves of enemies in the SAME area, it really shows poor design. Granted, the enemy AI is admirable. These guys will run to the side of your cover, lob grenades at you, and move in ways to avoid gunfire. But cover shooting grows terribly old after engaging in your 500th encounter. You literally cannot go 3 minutes without facing enemies 90% of the time. I only wish that were an exaggeration. At least you get a hefty variety of weapons to wreak havoc with.----Puzzle Solving/Platforming----Compared to the rest of the game, puzzle solving plays a very minimal role. Off the top of my head, I can remember 4 large puzzles, 3 of which were basically mimicking what you see from pages in Drake's journal. That's right: no thought whatsoever. I did, though, appreciate the incredibly smooth climbing mechanic; leaping from ledge to ledge is nice and effortless.Objectives: 2/5The game is split into 21 chapters that are easily replayable from the main menu. There is of course, your main objective the whole time. This is a linear game, with the only thing to do on the side being treasure collecting. I just didn't find any importance in doing so though. The game doesn't give an introduction to treasures or even explain why you're collecting them in the first place. But essentially collecting treasures and performing other tasks earns you Medal Points used to modify gameplay. You can tweak the game by enabling Fast Motion, Slow Motion, or even select any weapon at any time. Again, though, there's no feeling of significance in treasure hunting. Why should I care what the name or appearance of my treasure is? Bottom line: You'll come to this game for it's main objective and nothing else; treasures are NOT fun to find.Overall: 2.5/5It's disappointing that a game with such a stellar story has to be marred by an over-reliance on gunplay, mixed with mindless puzzles. Treasure hunting feels pointless, so all you'll ever want to do is advance the storyline, taking in the genuinely interesting scenery as you go. If you've yet to jump into the Uncharted series, I'd say go for the later entries, or pick this up cautiously, knowing that the most you'll get out of it is story.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2013"}

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"Sigmund Freud","summary":"Someone new to RTS","reviewText":"I played RTS games before but usually its just a demos and such, I would find myself loosing interest fast. I saw this game at the store for less then $10 and gave it a shot and at the time I was looking for a different experience in a different genre of games.I was a never a die hard halo fan but I appreciated the series good sci-fi settings and characters. And in this game its a prequel to all the other halo games, which gave me another reason to try out.The game surprised me because I found myself interested from the get go, thanks to some high production from the cutscenes and voice work.The gameplay is going to be divided for many who are familiar with this genre. For starters the game is very bare bones, its a very stripped down real time strategy game. And I can see why if the game got anymore complex the game would have to be shipped with a mouse and keyboard.The controls can get confusing if your new to console RTS and it doesnt help that your limited to options when it comes to said controls. You cant configure controls in anyway.The game looks and sounds fantastic especially in the halo universe you'll see and hear familiar locales and sound bits.There are also characters that are precursors to the later halo game characters. Its very interesting especially to someone like me who is still new to the halo lore.I will honestly say that this is the game that really got me into halo, I did play and beat HCE and enjoyed it but I really didn't get how big the scale was of the universe and just saw it as another great sci fi game like doom and half life, this game shows you the war in a prequel setting.Avid RTS fans i would say pass, I didn't get to try the multiplayer at all.

Even things like billboard jumps are made as specific challenges online that encourages you to do some of the specific tasks that you may not do while playing solitary.If I have to complain about one thing it is the length of the single player mode, all the races and unlocks can be completed in few hours and they are super super easy to do. If you compare the races to the PSP era burnout games they are far far easy. But the variety of goals and game modes online will give very good longevity. There are tonnes of un-locks and things to try out including getting all the trophies and climbing up the leader board.  Very well designed and good work by criterion as usual, I hope they will support with DLC content similar to burnout paradise.If any one who played burnout paradise and had issues with open world racing and short cuts, dont worry. Once the race begins the actual race path is clearly marked, you will not get lost. In between races you can roam around trashing gates, breaking billboards and finding new cars. Once you have participated in a race you can jump directly into the race with any other car or re-start the race without having to drive back to the starting location. So in way they have addressed all the complaints from burnout paradise and need for speed most wanted. It is a very refined game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2012"}

Such a question must have been on the minds of the Assassin's Creed designers.  Assassin's Creed I was an award-winning game, and also one of my favorite games of all-time.  Its beautiful replicas of Middle Eastern cities, fun gameplay, and intriguing storyline drew me in.  Months after I finished it, I would think about it - and even bought Prince of Persia to have a similar gameplay experience (also fun times).  When I was in Cairo, I actually started thinking about how Altair would scale some of their minarets!Assassin's Creed II does the impossible - improve on perfection.  The game wasn't changed as much as it was enhanced.  The gameplay is very similar to the first game, where you play an assassin and much of the gameplay involves climbing, jumping and scaling buildings, much like Parkour.  The fight scenes are just as spectacular.  I loved that the first game never allowed you to die - just \"desynchronize\". For some reason, this aspect gave me the bravery I needed to try things out that in other games, I wouldn't - knowing I would \"die\".  The game has the same mini-games, such as races, and collection games, in this case treasures instead of flags.  As in the first game, you are limited to a small section of cities at first, and then it is expanded - but these cities appear to be much larger than the last game.So what is new?  Well, the setting for one - renaissance Italy.  I have been to Florence and Venice, and this game makes a very good re-creation of those places.  It was thrilling to ascend Il Duomo when I have been inside it in real life.  The story is a bit more personal and compelling than the last - you're not just an assassin - you are a wronged member of the Italian gentry, driven by vengeance.Also, the game added some other key changes - the ability to change armor, weapons, and your appearance.  You can buy these things rather than waiting for new weapons to be given to you during gameplay. You get money from treasures and from looting bodies. You also get to have a villa that you can improve, a homebase.What I like best, aside from jumping across rooftops and scaling towers, is just how beautiful and realistic the setting is, from the stunning graphics - particularly the vistas from \"viewpoints\" - to the language spoken.  After a session of playing this game, I start planning my next trip to Italy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2009"}

I appreciate all the people that take chances on games and pay the $60 and take the time to write an honest review on the games.  The detail in this 2006 game is unbelievable.  The graphics blew me away.  Little details like seeing the characters mouth move in sync with the words while his back was turned.  The way the characters would turn and look at one another while speaking while they were running for their lives or standing still.  This is all new to me.  The enemy AI in both the games were good.  The enemy was really hard to kill in the first game.  Some of them would take a clip and a half to go down. The dialogue was very, very real. To hear them trash talk to the enemy and amongst their team was very entertaining.  The sound effects and the musical score were spot on.  I really loved the griminess of the scenery in this game.  I played this game on \"hardcore.\"  I will try \"insane\" down the line.  Your teammates AI was better in the second game.

I'm starting to like 3rd person shooters more than 1st person shooters.  I like the ability to be able switch from 3rd to 1st.  Also, I like the hand to hand combat.

He is completely lovable and just a great character all around.  You can make your Sackboy your own.  Decorate him or her with stickers, dress him or her up, do whatever you want to make him your own personal creation.After you have done that, you can play one of over 60 premade levels that are brilliantly created and full of life.  You can play with up to 4 people online or offline.  One of the coolest things I think is that I will be playing a level, and all of a sudden a friend of mine will jump in the game with me mid level, and we can talk over headsets and solve puzzles together.Next, you take your Sackboy (and up to 3 friends) and go into create mode.  You can used seemingly hundreds of tools, stickers, options, and sounds to create your own levels!  (You will be able to create levels with online friends in a future update.)  There is tons of space for your creations, and you will be amazed at what you can build.  The in-game tutorials make learning how to create your own levels a breeze, so don't worry about not being able to do it (its simple, yet time consuming).After you have made your level, you can publish online for others to play!  You will get feedback from others on how they liked your levels and how to improve them.  Watch your level climb the rankings of most played of most favorited level.  It's addicting!Also, you can play others creations online.  There are many brilliant levels online and they are so much fun to play.  This means the game is pretty much never ending.

{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"Dave","summary":"Solid but lacking","reviewText":"As I play Batman, one thought keeps floating across my mind.....this COULD be so great.  The stealth and combat in this game are very well done, aside from the occassional hiccup with grappling to the wrong area or not grappling at all.  Overall, the fighting feels good and some enemies require much more than simple button mashing.  The boss battles are intense, and the game really makes you want to punch Penguins face in.  What keeps it from being a 5-star perfect game you ask??  Darkness and repetition.  What Arkham City desperately needs is a more vibrant, livelier city.  I just never felt like a superhero while playing.  All Arkham City is, is darkness and thugs around every corner and on every block.  I understand the theme behind the game is the entire city has become a prison, so this is what you'd find there.  BUT, how great would it be to be in an actual Gotham City?  An actual city with regular people doing regular things....imagine stopping a mugging, or saving bank employees from a hostage situation by smashing through a plate glass window and bashing a few armed thugs.  How great would that be?  That would make me feel like I was playing as Batman.If they threw in the Bat Mobile to drive around in, or the Bat Motorcycle even how great could that be??  It would be nice to perch atop a building and just watch traffic go by, knowing that you can swoop down at any time and cause havoc if you were not a hero.  When I took out a group of thugs it felt satisfying, but how much more satisfying could it feel if you were bashing the heads of three guys robbing an armored car?  There are so many missions they could have, this game just feels lacking in that it's constantly dreary and there is no one around who isn't in prison.  Again, I understand the game is in a prison....but use your imagination.  I'd love to see almost a Batman, GTA hybrid with an open city to explore and missions you can get involved in if you choose to be the hero, or just ignore if you want to just get the main quest over with.  When I first read they were coming out with Arkham CITY, I was excited.  After playing this game, I feel let down a bit by what could have been one of the greatest games ever.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2011"}

Together these two seamlessly translate the player's realistic physical actions to those of the character on the screen, allowing the players to fight however they choose. Keep it clean with standard jabs and punches, or fight dirty with headbutts, headlocks and more. The choice is yours as you take on 12 fighting venues filled with thugs and bosses and eventually take the fight online to unleash the skills you've learned against live virtual opponents.Fight the Way You Want with PlayStation MoveGrab your PlayStation Move controllers and step into the dark and gritty underground of bare knuckle brawling inThe Fight: Lights Out. A launch title for the PlayStation Move motion controller,The Fight: Lights Outis a one-on-one fighting game featuring single player and multiplayer play options. Players utilize two Move motion controllers, one for each hand, to accurately track your rapid blows while the PlayStation Eye tracks your head as you duck, evade, outmaneuver and knockout anyone that has the guts to throw down with you. The precision and versatility of the controller/peripheral combo allows you to decide how you want to take down your next challenger. Get them in a headlock and throw elbow drops to the skull, or go ballistic by throwing nonstop haymakers. Fight clean or fight dirty, it&rsquo;s entirely up to you because there are no rules.","reviewerName":"M. Donnelly","summary":"The main reason I don't regret owning a PlayStation Move","reviewText":"I own a PlayStation Move.  I was an early adopter, and honestly, while the technology is solid, the games being produced are the same as Wii games.Enter The Fight: Lights Out.  If it wasn't for this game, I would probably sell my PS Move used to someone else.  First, let's get out of the way the fact that you need two PlayStation Move controllers to play The Fight, plus the PlayStation Eye camera.  It's quite the investment.This game winds up not only being the most fun I could have with the Move controller, but possibly the best workout I could get, as well.  For me, there was a pretty big learning curve playing this game.  You need to stand in the right position, and try not to move from that position as you play--stepping forward, backward, or side to side causes your punches to go out of alignment (your position relative to the camera has changed, so your punch angle and direction will change in game).  A simple button press recalibrates your position, but after some practice, it becomes easier to stay in one place.When you first get the game, you are plunged into a tutorial fight.  Honestly, I played for about an hour, and was completely inept and unable to complete this first \"gimme\" fight, on the first night I played the game.  I came back at it the next day (optionally--you can skip it next time you start the game up) and was able to beat it easily.  I am extremely happy I put a little more time into it.  I now absolutely love The Fight.Throwing punches...throws punches.  Your arm will be reflected on screen very close to where it is in real life.  Blocking is done by holding your hands in front of your face.  Danny Trejo boldly (in an entertaining, over the top manner) tells you how to perform these and other moves in the tutorial and when learning new \"dirty moves\".  Head tracking allows you to duck and lean to avoid punches.  I have found the head tracking relies heavily on having decent lighting.  You may need to experiment with your position relative to the camera and light sources of the room.  You will also need a good amount of space to play this game--the recommendation is ~6-8 feet I think.  You'll do better if you have more space, but I have played with around 5 feet without major issue.  The setup is what makes or breaks the game.  If you're not flexible in terms of moving the camera, yourself, or lighting sources, you may want to see if you can borrow or rent this game first.Playing the game does increase in difficulty as you progress through the story mode.  Enemies get harder.  Better at blocking, harder hitting, and overall more difficult.  You learn moves as you progress through the games, which are scripted and activated by holding the Move trigger and performing a gesture with one or both controllers.  Relying on these helps in a pinch, but real fun comes from learning to play without these dirty hits.In addition to the championship/story mode, there are training games.  Training consists of various activities you might find in training a boxer--heavy bag, speed bag, sparring, etc.  The game tracks the number of calories you burn, approximately, in training and story mode, allowing you to use the game as a fitness tool.  (Finally a fitness game that's not strictly a \"fitness game\"!)  They have added several more training activities since the game launched, making it a bit more varied.  It is possible to \"cheat\" at some of these games, but there is little reason to do so--you'd only be cheating yourself, really.Finally, there is online play.  However, it is hardly the main feature of the game.  Ultimately, The Fight is best viewed from the perspective of a single player game.  At least, from my point of view.  The multiplayer is a nice addition, but the bulk of the game is single player.Ultimately, I completely recommend this game for anyone who has a PlayStation Move, as long as you're willing to sweat a little bit, and as long as you're willing to take some time to set up your gaming environment for this game.  You will need light, you will need space, and you will need 2 Move controllers and a PlayStation Eye.  If you have these things, and can find the \"sweet spot\" in your setup, this could be the best motion game you've ever played.  It's deep enough to provide extra play time.  It's got training mode in which you can simply exercise using the game as a tool.  It's got a lot of value for what it is.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2011"}

Mysterious portals have appeared in them, leading him to disturbing alternate worlds. This game is a terrifying experience that fans and newcomers will never forget.","reviewerName":"Robert N. Kallister","summary":"The Horror Still Lives","reviewText":"As a long-time fan of the Silent Hill series, I've been anticipating the release of Silent Hill 4 for some time now.  I've followed it for months with screenshots, teasers, and even a short preview movie.  Finally, when it was released, I bought a copy and set foot once again into the horror that is Silent Hill.You play as Henry, a loner who lives in room 302 of an apartment complex, and for the past several days has been unable to leave.  His front door is securely chained up from the inside by sources unknown.  As you walk into your living room area, a horrific scene plays as a ghost crawls through your wall and begins to approach you.  Then, you seem to black out and awaken with everything back to normal.After walking into your bathroom, you notice a hole in the wall.  You pry a steel pipe from in front of it (your first weapon), and crawl down a long corridor, eventually ending up on a down escalator into the subway system.  From here, the plot thickens as you combat vicious monsters, explore the twisted environment, and meet up with an assortment of different people who are either there to help you, or to destroy you.The storyline is very strange and complex, but at the same time intriguing.  Henry has the ability to return to his apartment at any time by using special \"portals\" drawn with a red symbol (called \"The Mark of Samael\") where he can store excess items from his inventory, and towards the beginning of the game recover his health.  The puzzles are usually not that hard to solve, though there may be times when you get stumped on how to get through a certain one.  A bit of advice I can offer is that if you can't seem to solve it, try returning to your apartment and find something to interact with there.  This was one of the more clever elements to the game, and I thought it very innovative.Just like any game, Silent Hill 4 is not without its drawbacks.  You will encounter certain enemies in the game that are literally unkillable.  You simply have to put up with them, and it can get very irritating.  Also, the actual control system is a lot different from the other Silent Hill games, and it may take a while to get used to it.  Once you do, however, it actually will feel a lot better using it.  Last but not least, the non-linear elements of the original Silent Hill and Silent Hill 2 are completely gone.  Now the story is a straight-and-narrow journey as opposed to letting you wander around the town, looking for hidden loot, or just trying to pick a fight with random baddies.Overall, a 9 of 10 for Silent Hill 4.  I recommend a rental to anyone who's interested in playing it, but if you're familiar with the ones before it, it's a definite buy.  The terrifying universe of the town of Silent Hill will have your mind bending and will haunt your dreams for years to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001CMIUYS","reviewerName":"Joy","summary":"Take out the \"Final Fantasy\" in the title!!","reviewText":"Okay, This is just going to be a bottom line, to the point review. I have been playing the Final Fantasy series for years and have played just about every Final Fantasy game from FFI and even some off titles like Tactics and Crystal Chronicles. Now, when FFXI came out, I couldn't play it since I refuse to pay every month in addition to paying for the game itself. When FFXII came out, I had mixed feelings but it still had enough stuff in it to make me keep playing and even though it really lacks in story, it's not a complete waste. I still like a lot of it.So here we are now with Final Fantasy XIII and I can honestly say, without a shadow of a doubt, this is NOT Final Fantasy! This is some random bare-bones RPG that someone made that is only a demo of a game. A shell of a game. That's how I feel about this. It's unfinished. This isn't the hard work of Square, the company Square who has always delivered 100 percent into the Final Fantasy series. This isn't the work of that great company who delivered the masterpieces like FFVI, FFVII, FFVIII, FFIX, and FFX. This isn't the company who put tons and tons of hard work into the towns and shops and talking to npc's. Final Fantasy doesn't make you buy items from a save point. Final Fantasy is about going to towns and going into shops and going up to the shopkeeper and buying the items. And this certainly isn't the company who really delivered with battling and gameplay. Fighting is no longer fun. There is no more fun battling enemies anymore.  In FFXII, I accepted the A.I. but enough A.I.! I want to control all my characters!! It's not that hard to ask for, to want to be able to control all my characters in battle. Especially in an offline RPG.UPDATE: I have to add something here that I also just found out. I found this on another site:\"This also echoes similar comments Kitase made earlier this month, when he said that it's \"very hard to make games on PlayStation 3 in the same style as the games in [FFVII's] era had. Making graphics will take an enormous time.\" He explained that's also part of the reason FFXIII is more linear than past Final Fantasy games.\"Okay, What you just read is completely unacceptable and just flat out laziness and stupidity! So because we have amazing graphics, the gameplay has to completely suffer!? I'm sorry but that's just total BS! Excuse my language but this is just completely irresponsible and unacceptable for a gaming company who has always delivered 100 percent in the main series, especially before FFXI released. Now, if I have to sacrifice gameplay for amazing graphics, then I don't want any part of it!! Just bring back the old graphics but I know for a FACT that if they can spend years on graphics alone, then they can deliver an epic FF in every other area! Come on! This is pitiful. Just downright sad and pathetic.This is just shameful. For about twenty years, Final Fantasy has never let me down. But this game is just a demo, just a demo of another random RPG with the words Final Fantasy on the cover. If this was truly Final Fantasy, I wouldn't be rating it so low and having to write all these things. But it's true, this is no longer Final Fantasy. Everything I have loved about Final Fantasy is gone. Sure, there are chocobos but you can't even ride them until late in the game. The only thing this \"demo\" of a game has going for it is the graphics. That's it. Square are ripping all it's long time fans off and so many people are just buying into it. I will NOT give in to their less than capable work. If and when they return to their roots and give 100 percent of their time and effort into a true Final Fantasy, only then will I support them again.I know that Final Fantasy XII was a big departure with the totally different battling system and removal of random encounters but for them to completely change everything that made Final Fantasy what it is, well, there's just no excuse. They just became lazy and are making money off of it. Even Final Fantasy X-2 had more effort and work put into it. Don't let Square make you a victim of their laziness.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2010"}

I'm glad it still works. I can't believe I missed this great game when it first game out. I mean, we all know that after Smash Brothers Melee, we got interested in Fire Emblem upon Marth and Roy's inclusion in the game.In terms of difficulty, this game takes the cake. You get normal and hard mode for all three protagonist but even then, its a set difficulty such as because Lyn is the prologue protagonist, her difficulty is easy by default while Eliwood is considered normal and Hector is hard. If you want a challenge, this game gives it to you in all of its glory.The characters in the game are a lovable bunch and because of the support system (which I find difficult in this game), you can learn more about them with ease. The problem with the support in this game is that they have to be standing next to each other or near each other to get points working in that direction and you can only support 5 times (which is a standard for Fire Emblem games making it the incentive to play over and over again) so some supports are nearly impossible to get unless you waste away on said space. Personal favorite it Matthew of course (and thieves aren't that bad in this game surprisingly).You have many types of missions in this game ranging from defending a certain area, routing the enemy, defeating the commander and so on. This will always make you have to think ahead and so on.Overall the entire game is compelling and is a must buy if you can find it somewhere. I swear Fire Emblem games are so hard to come by these days.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

Posey","summary":"The Witcher 2 - An RPG for the adult gamers","reviewText":"It's not often I say this, but I think I finally found a new RPG to make my top 5 games of all time.  Yes, that's right, The Witcher 2 is that good.  The sad thing is that a lot of people aren't even going to be able to play it since it's a PC only game.  If there was ever a reason for you to upgrade your PC to play a game, this is it.  Why am I so enthralled with The Witcher 2?  Read on to find out.For starters, The Witcher 2 really succeeds because of it's story.  If you played the first game you know that it's about a guy named Geralt who is a human but is sort of a mutation.  Raised from a child to be a Witcher (one who fights monsters) these children have a rough upbringing as they train their body to withstand potions that increase their skills but that would kill other full grown humans.  By the time they are adults, they are a sort of human mutant with cat like eyes.  Ostracized by the people but regarded by kings and noblepeople as ones who get jobs done, they are pivotal members of society.In the first game you were introduce to the world of the Witcher.  In part 2, you are thrust into an hour of gameplay revolving around the end of the Witcher 1.  As soon as that's over, it's a whole new story.  So, if you didn't play the first, no biggie.  I actually never finished the first and I'm still loving it.  The first thing you will really notice about the Witcher 2 is how pretty the game is.  It's not going to rival Crysis or anything, but it's still a very well made game with amazing graphics.  Polish devs CD Projekt really put their heart and souls into the game and it shows.  As you travel around towns you almost feel like the game is a living world.  The blacksmith will end work in the evening and you can follow him home where he will make dinner, eat, and then go to bed.  At dawn he will wake up and go back to his stall for another day of work.  It's like clockwork and it's a beautiful thing to see in a game as deep as this.The gameplay in The Witcher 2 is similar enough to help you out in the beginning but difficult enough to make you want to get better.  For instance, Geralt must use potions that he creates throughout the game to battle certain enemies and traverse certain terrains.  The cat potion allows you to see in the dark while the mongoose potion increases poison resistance thousand fold.  There are potions to increase vitality, strength, and other aspects of the game.  You need to use them for certain aspects of the game but for others you are left to decide on your own if you will use them.  Normally they last 5-10 minutes each so you need to use them sparingly enough to have them for the more difficult battles (or you can just farm resources to have them whenever you want.)Combat is controlled with the mouse by left clicking for fast attacks and right clicking for harder attacks.  You can mix the two up and use signs (sort of like spells witchers can use) to round out your arsenal against humans and monsters alike.  The Witcher carries two swords at all times, one silver and one steel.  The steel sword is for humans and the silver sword is for monsters.  If you auto attack on a target, Geralt will pull out the correct one but if you want to be prepared you have to click 1 or 2 to decide between them.As mentioned earlier, the story in The Witcher 2 is amazing and is basically the main draw.  It's so good that I've begun reading translations of the original Witcher novels that have recently been translated to English.  In the Witcher, a king is killed and Geralt is blamed for it.  Geralt must hunt down the kingslayer while also tending to the politics of each region he enters.  As a witcher, his services will often be requested to take down monsters and humans alike and this journey will take him across many different lands.  Be sure to read all of the quest objectives and background info because there is a hell of a lot of information to be had here.So, who should pick up the Witcher 2?  Everyone who is able.  The game is an RPG but it's so good that even people that aren't usually RPG fans will most likely find themselves enjoying a genre they typically avoid.  The adult content (full blown nudity, foul language, etc.) and the fast paced combat and amazing story all weave together and interesting tale that gamers aren't usually used to.  So, if you are looking for something different, this game comes highly recommend from me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2011"}

If you have followed parts of the tv show nothing is spoiled for you and if you have not you will be able to understand the story fine. When I first started playing the game lagged incredibly to the point where it was unplayable and would often crash after a small update that went away and the gameplay experience was very fluid.

{"product_name":"B00004U1R1","description":"Made in Japan. For this game pak to operate, you must have an N64 expansion pak(sold separately installed in Your N64).","reviewerName":"Carlos Santiago","summary":"New and improved","reviewText":"I'll skip the introduction of the game since it has been perfectly explained by the other reviewers.I think Mr. Miyamoto's intention when creating this adventure was to improve the overall game design presented in Ocarina of Time (OOT) while taking advantage of the more advanced options available with the 4MB Expansion Pack. If anyone thought that OOT's design was creative and challenging, just wait until you get your hands into this one.I am positive that Majora's Mask is much deeper, entertaining and complex than its predecessor, and I think the complexity was a necessary addition in order to attract the attention to the majority of us who played / completed OOT.  Therefore, those of you who haven't gone through OOT should do so first before tackling this one.  It will save hours of frustration.  Although Majora's Mask has several helpful introductory and explanatory scenes within the adventure, it doesn't teach you the most basic control skills as detailed as OOT did (e.g. the use of the C buttons/ walking, running, jumping, Z-targeting, the fanfare when grabbing a C-Item such as a Deku Nut/Stick for the first time etc.).  On the other hand, there is a very useful added feature in Majora's were you can obtain a brief explanation of your items, weapons and masks by pressing the A (blue) button at any time on the game Sub screens.  With all the masks and items available, this feature is absolutely a nice plus.While there are only 4 dungeons to conquer in this game, I believe that they are more than enough, considering that there are an abundance of mini-games and plenty of challenging sub-quests that will keep your adventure thirst quenched.The addition of special masks that actually morphs Link into a completely new character, with added abilities (and weaknesses) also introduces a whole new depth and challenge in game play.  Then you add the realistic touch of time-flow and the many different events triggered when wearing different masks at different times on different locations, and you absolutely have a whole new ball game.The Bombers Notebook is also a pretty convenient feature added to the adventure.  Here you keep electronically the schedule and requests of every character you meet in the game.  This makes it almost unnecessary to have your own set of garbled paper notes that many times were accidentally thrown out to the wastebasket.Game controls are identical in Majora's and OOT, making the learning period much quicker for those of us with previous experience.  Most of the adventure characters and items are very similar in both games as well.  Even some of the mini-games and masks are simply some sort of an improved variation from OOT.  These characteristics I just mentioned make this game more of an extension to the OOT adventure, which is actually great.By the way, I also complained initially about the whole time concept put into game play.  But it turned out to be a quite clever addition.  This actually makes you plan ahead instead of just letting you wander into the over world collecting stuff and getting frustrated.  If you think about it, considering that the 72 hours in Termina go by in a bit in over an hour in real time, you are certain that any quest you get into, such as a dungeon, should not take you more than that.Nintendo has accomplished another big hit, unique with its new challenges while keeping the same interface and many of the characters and features that made OOT a huge hit.This is definitely another classic with many hours of game play and a lot of replay value (if you play without a guide). A must buy and 100% recommended","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2001"}

Yes it does push even high spec machines, your hardware will want to be in good order to run it and certainly you should at least be using the v1.52 patch (you must download it from the internet) to have a bug free gaming experience (that still has some minor bugs) the fact is that the game is so vast and so big, these minor glitches are easily overlooked once you get into the swing of things.Spanning some 3000 years between 1000 BC and 2000 AD you go through every civilization from the dawn of early man to the creation of a space station, with Spock (Leonard Nimoy) narrating, you can build worlds that will eventually compete in military campaigns with one another, the volume of historical information, famous quotes and important pieces of history all mash together to the point of having a modern tank squad up against Roman horseback spearmen, it puts the world we live in today into such clear perspective that this is one of the best family friendly games, not to mention game, of all time.

Once again the Princess gets whisked away by a Galactus sized King Bowser (this gal gets captured more than Nancy Drew) and Mario is off to save her.  Storyline wise, I'm kind of confused as if this is supposed to have anyting to do with the first one at all.  But this is Mario, let's not let something as trivial as \"storytelling\" get in the way of a good time.This game is just as much a hoot as the first.  The level design is nothing short of amazing.  The boss battles are probably even more fun and imaginative than the first one as well.  And I found those original battles full of both.  I would say that I am very fond of the drill that shows up early in the game, I thought that was neat.  The old powerups are all back, including a couple of new ones, including the neat-o cloud Mario and the insanely awesome rock Mario.  I could still probably go through an entire game without being Bee Mario and and not lose a lot of sleep over it.

Yoshi, as always, is a helpful little dinosaur and I don't think I'll ever not get a kick out of watching him eat a red pepper.  Go, Yoshi, Go!If there's one nitpick I have, and yes, I realize its only a nitpick, it is the new World Map.  I kind of miss the whole Hub World idea from the previous 3D Mario titles.  Now we've gone back to Side-Scrollin' Mario's World Map where we go along a line til we get to the planet we must conquer next.  Of course there are splits in the road, so you do get choices, but it just kind of loses that little feeling of freedom a hub world gives you.  Like I said, just a nitpick really and has nothing whatsoever to do with the fun factor of actually playing these deeply imaginative and super-designed levels.If Mario ever decides to take another trip out into the galaxy, I won't hesitate to follow him.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0009UYZ84","description":"First CD video game system by SEGA.","reviewerName":"J. Jongeling \"slice of heaven\"","summary":"An interesting add-on to an already legendary console","reviewText":"The first thing I want to say is that as a consumer, one shouldn't consider this another platform. It is a platform but in the lightest sense. It has plenty of different games, and different types of graphics, but as a whole, to me it has always acted as an add-on to the already uber-cool Sega Genesis platform.If you are a newcomer and have never experienced the Sega in the 90s, or are unfamiliar with the Genesis or the 16-bit era as a whole, chances are you will be disappointed in the Sega CD Console.Why? The graphical interface is not like your Xbox. It is often cheap 3D, pasted-on, with lots of oddities here and there. Occasionally you can find a truly remarkable game that looks beautiful in every way - Sonic CD, Phantasy Star.However, on the other hand, if you remember the early 90s, you will not continue to see a shoddy, run-down graphical interface. You will see and experience nostalgia.For me it was the 2nd grade, every Saturday going to Video World to rent one title for the weekend, video card and cool chain eagle wallet in hand, and the smell of fresh hot popcorn and subs next door filled the air. The floor was a creaky, crooked floor, and the store was manned by a single, quiet clerk reading a book behind the desk. Passing by all of the vhs and laserdisc racks, I made my trek all the way to the back where they had the \"VIDEO GAMES\" sign in the corner and about 50 titles on silly red wired storage racks.There was no such things as Xbox or Playstation. There were Super Nintendo, Sega, and Sega CD Games. Incredibly simple.  All of the art had been printed on copy paper in black and white. So cheap, but so inviting.In those days Sega CD seemed so exquisite simply because they were on shiny discs. Discs were something fairly new and it wasn't something you'd throw around like a cartridge. Handle it by the edges, ok, will do, and put in the case as soon as you are done playing, check.Though not breathtaking in the least by today's gaming standards, it remains a milemarker in time where cartridges were at the dawn of becoming an alternative in home video gaming.Don't buy it for graphics. Buy it for classics and let the good times roll.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2011"}

Why? Aren't the 360 graphics just incredible? yes they are, but that is not enough in some cases. Consider this....over the three installments of the series, the graphics have gotten better, that much is true. But they have stripped features from each installment, without exception. Far fewer customization options, no entrance effects or entourage anymore--none of the extra features that really made the first game fantastic. It wouldn't be such a big deal if those features were never in the game to begin with, but explain to me why you would take it away? NEVER take steps back in video games.The other often praised feature of this game is the lack of power or energy bars and its apparent increase in realism. This is garbage and I'll explain why. In a real boxing match it is true that there are no bars to tell you how well you or  your opponent is doing, and you must rely on your own observations in judging the condition of your opponent. But the silly part is that in a real boxing match you would be able to FEEL your own damage, fatigue, etc. You would know how much a flurry of punches would tire you out because you could feel it. So although you think the absence of the bars is more realistic, it isn't, because you will never have the ability to feel your own boxer like you could in real life. Those energy bars allowed a close approximation. At least make them a feature that can be toggled on or off.In short, the game is solid but losing serious ground compared to the second game, and they've both lost serious ground compared to the first. Fit and finish on the first game is what made it great. You saw your guy walking to the ring and could really customize him from head to toe. Not anymore. I think they need to stop ruining what should have been a fantastic continuation of the franchise.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2006"}

The game is by far the best Final Fantasy for the Playstation and the second best in the nine game series (fans will remember FF6). In honor of FF7, super attacks, called Trance, have been brought back. Basically if the enemy beats on you enough you become super powerful for about two or three turns. The music is absolutely beautiful. Nobuo did an excellant job. The graphics are nice eye-candy and are only rivaled by the beautiful CG animations. The characters are very innovative as well. You can have a black mage, a guy with a monkey tail (why does he have that anyway), or a big freaky-looking guy with red hair, to name three. Abilites and spells are gained from pieces of armor and weapons. The same piece of armor can also hold three different abilities for three different characters making it important to figure out who gets what when. Another good idea as it keeps your characters from becoming god-like very quickly. To all those who liked the old !school version of Final Fantasys, who could like the modern ones all that much, 1-6 will enjoy the nostalgia of this game. I, for one, can only hope that SquareSoft keeps with this idea and keeps the series from becoming more Sci-Fi than medieval. Anyway, I can't say that there is anything negative about this game. So why are you still reading this. Buy it now, Amazon seems to never run out of this game and I'm surprised that it hasn't become a greatest hit yet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2001"}

The fully 3D battlefields allow players to move freely and control a party of three simultaneously, utilizing the advanced real-time battle system. Players can execute synchronized attacks and collaborate to unleash a deadly blow to the enemy. While moving from one section of the game to the next, fully polygonal graphics create a magnificent environment for one to explore.

The entire experience inStar Oceanis also enhanced with Dolby Pro Logic II sound.Set in SD 772, four hundred years since the climactic battle with the &Ograve;Ten Wise Men,&Oacute; humans and aliens now co-exist together in both advanced and less-developed societies, as the Galaxy Federation continues to research the cosmos to gain more influence in Space. The story begins asStar Ocean&Otilde;s protagonist, Fayt Leingod, brings his family and childhood friend, Sophia Esteed, to the Federation-managed resort planet Hyda for a vacation, but the dreamy holiday is abruptly ended when Hyda is attacked by an unknown space military. In the heat of the attack, Fayt is separated from his family and Sophia, and he begins an emotional quest into the unknown to find his loved ones. Along his journey, he gets caught up in the war of an uncharted planet, but in the end, he learns the terrible untold secret about the world and himself.","reviewerName":"Ryan H.","summary":"This game is extremely addictive","reviewText":"Wow! This game is awesome from the moment you boot it up. You see an awesome CG showing the history of space from the first satillite launch to where the story takes place in a very futuristic world where we have met aliens and have found other solar systems even.  You play as a young man named Fayt, who is getting nagged at by his friend, Sophia, because he was playing video games while she was waiting for him (does this sound like you, because it sure fits me).  But in the future gaming is almost like a sport, you can actually get stronger from it (take that people who think gamers can't stay healthy).After convincing her to join you in a game, your resort is attacked by an unknown enemy and must evacuate immediately.It is an exciting start and it kept me hooked, so far I'm only about a couple hours into the game, but it is more addictive than anything I have ever played.  The storyline is one of the best that I have ever witnessed (even though I'm only a couple hours into the game ^_^) and it makes you want to stay longer and longer.Okay I could go on and on about how the story's great but then that be no fun for those who are reading this.  Your combat is similar to the GC game 'Tales of Symphonia' where you enter a battle but are forced to play it like a third person action game.  You can have partners that can watch their own hide, which is a good thing because I don't like escort missions.  Another unique feature is the bonus meter which feels up when you attack the enemies.  Once full, you battle and get different rewards, for instance triple EXP or increasing the % of getting a better item.Pick this game up if you loved Tales of Symphonia or if you like any action game.  Personally, I like this game better than the any of the games in the FF series, but that's because this game has an awesome storyline that isn't predictable and it has an awesome battle system.Pros- Awesome storyline- Multiple endings- Beautiful CG scenes- Cool Battle system- The way you communicate with your partners will determine how they think of you in the future- Music is awesome, although it is weird listening to rock music in some ruins.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2005"}

This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"michael jordan \"sucks\"","summary":"Please quit making these games.","reviewText":"I recognize 4 RE titles and those being 1,2,3 and code veronica, everything else is pure crap.

{"product_name":"B00005V6BB","description":"Medal of Honor: Frontlinemarks the debut of the Medal of Honor franchise on the PlayStation2. InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"N.

Rising Sun's only advantage is the multiplayer mode.  Criminally, the PS2 version of Frontline doesn't have multiplayer, yet the X Box version does.  It's an awesome feature that they cheaped out on.The opening on D Day is amazing.  They haven't topped it yet.  The game is a decent enough challenge.  One complaint is that it's too linear, like the EA Bond games.  You can't steer the wrong way, period.  The violence is top notch, but this being EA, it's rated T so there's no blood, no gore.  I don't understand how you make a WWII game with historical accuracy and a ridiculous amount of killing and then try to clean it up and sanitize it like a comic book.  This was WWII.It's actually fun playing with older weapons in a fps and comparing the American and German arms.  The sound is great, especially in the opening.  You also hear plenty of German from the enemy and a little bit of swearing (in German) apparently.This game is still highly recommended.  It's a lot of fun and provides a decent enough fps challenge.  It's superior to Rising Sun for sure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2003"}

This is such a simple thing, and yet it got through production and design....it just shouldn't be. Other than that, the charge lasts long and I have not had any problem with the batteries. I would easily give it 5 stars if not for the design flaw. It doesn't weigh down the controller much, and is easy to remove and replace from the controller. It's nice not to use batteries, but it stinks that if you don't place it exactly right on the charger, you won't get it charged. One other little annoyance is that color of the lights, blue and green. I don't know why they didn't just go with Red and Green to show if it is not charged or is charged.....that's just a personal preference.

Blazeblue, Darkstalkers and of course the SF series and all of the variaties attached to them. But after being a lifelong gamer, I quit playing fighters. Games evolved, sports and racing games became more realistic and this generation's arcades live long and prosper under the names of Battlefield and Call of Duty. And having friends over for a party game is no longer limited to fighters and sports, but singing, mini-games, etc.MvC3 does some things great. For my money's worth, this is not only the best looking fighter ever, but one of my favorite games ever from a graphics standpoint. The characters have to be seen in motion with the insane speed and fireworks exploding at all times. For some it could be overwhelming, not for me.  Visually stunning is an understatement.The controls. This is a bit of an issue. Because the game moves so fast and Capcom loostened up the controls (allowing sloppy input to still generate the desired move) the game very quickly can devolve into a button masher. It is too easy to accidentaly trigger your mega-ginormous-screen filling-finsiher when your simply trying to swap characters. After carefully building your \"Maxx\" gauge for that end of match push only to burn two levels while your trying to swap teamates is very frustrating. My 8yr old loves it. Talk about pick up and play. Anyone, including a 3rd grader, can take a quick peak and the moves list and light the screen on fire. For casual gamers, that's terrific. For a hardcore fighting fanatic, that it is heresy.I gave the game 5 stars for fun because it really is. But 3 stars overall for lack of depth and replayability - hence the title. The characters are eclectic, but different. As DLC has already been announced, I fully expect to see more popular characters show up over the upcoming months. No where near as revolutionary as it's predescessor but an enjoyable game non the less.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}

Carter \"Ornery Gamer, Fiend Club ...","summary":"Castlevania: SotN - If I could only have one game...","reviewText":"No other series quite conjures the atmosphere associated with Konami's Castlevania series. Hearkening back to the days of the original Castlevania on the NES, the combination of classic monsters, from Frankenstein's monster to the Price of Darkness himself, coupled with a decidedly Japanese feel made for quite the gameplay experience, and luckily for us, the classics just keep coming. The latest in the series (sorry, while the 3D Castlevania games on the N64 are adequate, they just don't carry on the tradition), Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, is the first to not feature a whip- weilding member of the Belmont clan as it's protagonist, but rather the all-too-vampiric son of Dracula, Alucard, last seen helping Trevor Belmont in Castlevania III on the NES. Playing more like Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest, or even Super Metroid on the SNES, Symphony of the Night adds some RPG elements like the ability to gain in strength by levelling up, equipping items and an occasional NPC. While the gameplay is a bit different than previous games, this is a good thing, as it adds depth to the already tried and true play mechanics of the series.The first thing you'll notice upon beginning Alucard's quest, is that this is not your usual Castlevania title. More closely resembling Castlevania II: Simon's Quest (NES), or to be quite honest, Super Metroid (SNES), SOTN sprinkles the tried and true play mechanics with a good many RPG elements. The ability to equip multiple items (weapons, armor, items, etc.), level up to gain strength and the ability to purchase potions, maps and other items, even conversing with the occasional NPC (namely Maria), are all typical to RPG's and their addition to the Castlevania formula results in a game that's very much more than the sum of its parts. Dracula's castle and the catacombs underneath are a huge area to navigate, requiring some time in the early going (you'll soon open warp portals to speed your quest later), and as such, the map is invaluable as far as finding areas you have yet to explore (again, they took it straight out of Super Metroid). The thing is that to unlock certain areas, you'll need to acquire items or abilities. Indeed, the true challenge in SOTN is not only defeating Dracula, but being able to explore the entire castle, both normal and inverted. And lest you think all this will be a tedious chore, let me assure you that controlling Alucard is a small pleasure in itself. While his movement is very fluid, he controls wonderfully, and while it will be second nature to any Castlevania fan within movements, the additions of certain spells to Alucard's repertoire make mastery a bit more involving. And for those who would rather control a belmont, Richter is selectable later on by code, although the going is considerably tougher for him. Konami could not have delivered a more complete experience.While I refrain from calling Castlevania: Symphony of the Night the Playstation's best game in the face of games like Final Fantasy VII, Metal Gear Solid &amp; Xenogears, I must admit that if I was forced to choose but one, it may very well be it. I will say that it is an amazing title in all aspects, and sadly, as things seem to be unfolding, perhaps the last 2D Castlevania title. The latest two Castlevania games, both on N64, have been in 3D, and to be honest, quite lackluster. As fate would have it, the only other known Castlevania title in development is also in 3D, this time for Dreamcast, and while I can only hope it can recapture in some small way the splendor that is SOTN, one has to suspect that the inherent problems with the titles is that they are not 2D, which is the soul of the series. If you want a post 16-bit title that is truly Castlevania, there is only one route to take, and that is Symphony of the Night (or the Saturn import version known as Nocturne in the Moonlight, which actually has a couple of extra areas and a playable Maria).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2002"}

After playing though this It really seems like they were planning all this from the start. After beating some of the other games and replaying this, I could see connections they made with each game tying into each other. True, this could just be me imagining things, but after seeing the secret ending I really do believe this was all planned.Story:Sora is just trying to live a normal life hanging out with his friends, when everything hits the bricks and he has to rise up and be a hero. I really enjoyed the story, and it's the strongest part of the game. When I first played this game, I never really looked at Disney the same. It made me enjoy some of their series I had never watched and reinforced the ones I had.Each world we visit one at a time and in order to get to the point you need to go through a Gummi Ship battle section to clear the heartless between the worlds. Majority of the worlds follow the lines of the movies they are representing, with the Heartless/Sora factor added into them. It's pretty cool to play through these areas and seeing how the heartless affects everyone.Gameplay:It's pretty hard to get into the combat of this game since they have improved it so much in ten years time. I felt as though I was always battling the camera, and even than I couldn't use the right analog stick to move it (Had to use R2/L2). This to me makes absolutely no sense to me since the right analog stick works perfectly fine for the PS2.If you die during a boss fight you can't skip the scenes so you have to watch them over and over again if you stuck. If you die in most of the boss fights, you're put in the area before that, so you have to move through a group of enemies and zone in every time you die. This doesn't apply to the fights where you fight multiple bosses in a row.I personally think the Gummi Ship is Squares greatest mini-game they have ever created. It's a simple idea, fly a ship shooting enemies and avoiding blocks, but it's a ton of fun. When you kill enemies you get parts for your ship (More wings, guns, rockets etc) and a chance to get their ship design as well. You fly a ship in-between every world, and each has multiple areas to blast through. I really do hope this feature returns in the future.Soundtrack:Man is this soundtrack a classic; I love all themes they made for each of the Disney worlds. I feel as though it fits them well and is memorable. While playing through this game again, I instantly recognized the main character themes and they are so powerful that it extends through multiple games. I personally thing Yoko Shimomura is a great composer and is just as good as Nobuo Uematsu. Also the main song fits the series perfectly and I personally love it.Graphics:For a game that came out ten years ago, the graphics have aged pretty well. I played this on a 40 inch tv and while it did stretch a bit, I was still able to read everything fine, and everything was clear. The CGI cut-scenes still look great, but the future games obviously do have better scenes. The Disney characters look the same as they do in the movies and look awesome in battle. Speaking of battles, the animations, spells and abilities were designed really well that some animations made it to future games.Verdict:I know I might have been a bit harsh on the combat, but it's because they have improved so much that it's harder to play this after playing the others. If you play this first, it will be an awesome game with an epic story that you will remember for a long time. Throw in the fact that either Square is great at tying in all their game or they have planned this from the start; either way you're entering a great series with a mind-blowing storyline.~ Written: 04-12Positive:* Great story that makes this game a classic* Fits in well with all the games* Amazing soundtrack* Sephiroth and Moogles* Gummi Ship battles are a ton of funNegative:* Had to fight the camera all the time* Can't skip scenes* If you die in most boss fights you are put in the previous zone, not the start of the encounter","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2012"}

This game is approaching a decade in age and it is doubtful that anyone even thinks about it anymore.Still, I feel compelled to say that, having played dozens of FPS/TPS over the years, including the wildly popular Call of Duty series, this game, SOCOM: US Navy SEALs, still amazes me.  I have played both SOCOM II and SOCOM: Combined Assault, and in my opinion neither of these games lived up to the original.  They added some extra \"stuff,\" but they were missing the feel and the character of this stunningly good series leader.Being that this game is \"ancient\" by now, I won't elaborate on various options; online mode is all but completely dead at this point, and as for the headset that was revolutionary at the time of release, I barely used it since I got this game second-hand without one.If you have an old PS2, though, and are looking for the \"best\" shooter to buy, look NO further than this game, as it excels in nearly every category.This game is designed to be taken slowly and carefully.  It's about stealth and planning, not running in with guns blazing.  The game developers wanted to give a good impression of how tough the SEALs have it in real life:  there are NO checkpoints and NO health regeneration for you or your team.  If you make a foolish or rash decision, you will get shot and die and the mission is over.Pros:Incredibly realistic character movementAmazing levels of detail and graphical realismDiverse selection of real-life weapons (with altered names to avoid copyright infringement)Difficulty ranging from moderate to extreme depending on \"rank\" when playingHuge list of commands allowing precision control of teamExcellent, highly intelligent Bravo teamRich, vivid environmentsSmart but not infallible enemy AIRealistic mission objectives (except for mission 11 which involves detonating a nuclear device on purpose)Melee option is still one of the best I have seen (rifle butt to head or knife to throat depending on angle of attack)Cons:Alpha team wingman, Boomer, is nothing short of a complete moron who may get you killed at any timeSome enemies seem to have unbelievably heightened senses and know you are coming from miles awayVery obvious \"spawn triggering\" system which causes enemies to appear before your eyesNo weapon customization or reload animationOften glitchy around walls, resulting in weapon misfire, difficulty in moving character, or unusual AI behaviorAll in all, considering its age, this game is extremely good and I would not hesitate to recommend it even today.  Yes, single player is all that you will be able to do, but you will spend hours mastering these 12 levels with careful stealth and strategy.Bonus note:  My favorite not-readily-apparent detail is the \"door kick\" feature.  Normally, approaching a door allows you to open it with the action (X) button by prompt.  However, if you hold X while running up to the door, then release it, your character will kick the door open.  And that's cool.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2010"}

The maps are fun, weapons and upgrade system a blast and all of the customization available makes the game really enjoyable.There is a big negative. As mentioned in my original review - connection is a serious issue. Lag, framerate drops, freezes...pretty much any connection problem you can think of applies. Patch 1.04 is on the way from Treyarch to address some of these issues, but connection certainly mars what is an otherwise great online experience.***END UPDATE***I'm about 42 hours into the game. I would consider myself a hardcore-console gamer (if there is such thing). I logged 25+ days on MW2 and have spent time with BFBC2, Killzone2 and pretty much every other game that involves shooting other people in the face - online. The review is aimed at people who may have been turned off after MW2.Campaign mode - I wouldn't know cause I don't play it. I hear it takes 6 hours, so probably just a rental if that's all you're interested in.Online* The fixes - noob toobing, commando, stoping power, one man army, boosting, tactical insertions, stacking killstreaks, explosive radius nerfed - ALL GONE. If that means anything to you, then you already love this game.*The Mechanics - best in the console market. Period. The guns are NOT all the same. No more UMP45 across the map kills. It also requires more hits to get a kill. This is good and bad - see connections below.*Graphics/Sound - The maps look phenominal, but the player models are mediocre. The music ambient sound effects are great, but I'm not impressed with the sounds of the guns.*The Maps - my first impression is that they are amazing...BUT... and this is one big but - they are not sniper friendly. I'm not a sniper, so I don't care, but I have some friends that already hate the game becuase the wide open lanes in MW2 are non-existant. There are varied levels, tunnels, etc. - but camping just seems much more difficult.*Connection - still P2P, no dedicated servers, and that sucks. Ultimately, regardless of skill level, connection will be the deciding factor in your enjoyment of the online game (also why I give it four stars)*Wager Games - also known as online crack. Being able to wager your money (which is required to purchase the items you've unlocked and their attachements - it's not automatic anymore) is like playing poker online. There are multiple game types, all very new and add a whole seperate dimesnion to online shooters. Definately the best innovation for FPS's in a long time.*Split Screen - for all online modes is awesome. I have 2 PS3's in the house and can accomodate 4 players with them in an online match. It's about time that option was available.Overall, this is a must buy if you are a COD fan. If you were turned off by MW2 - which many were, and rightfully so, at least give it a try. The Zombie mode, Training mode and wager matches are a blast and give everyone a shot at having a good time - not just experts and 12yr old, foul mouthed racists.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}

While it took me about a month to beat the original Legend Of Zelda game this one like Ocarina Of Time kept me busy for several months just to reach the final boss. A lot of the gameplay mechanics, level designs and boss fights set a standard that influenced other games that came after it such as Ocarina for N64 and Twilight Princess for the Gamecube/Wii.This game is long but easy enough for the average yet dedicated gamer as well being challenging and deep for  the pros such as the ones at Nintendo Power who love it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2009"}

The game allows you to freeroam but there is very little to do in the city which makes the freeroaming system almost broken. There are a few side missions but that's it. The missions themselves are relatively fun to play and driving around the city dealing cocaine never really gets old. Also it can be fun buying new assets and pimping up your mansion.

This version of the Civilization franchise was a quick fix, but ultimately suffers from reduced game mechanics and simplicity.The good:* Graphics are fantastic! Love this simplified direction.* Sounds are sim-style grunts - all around the sounds are very nicely done.* Quick to get into.The bad:* Dumbed down game play leaves very little in the way of strategy. This feels very much like an arcade port.* Very little customization - you can only choose the country/leader you want, map, land age, all those settings we are used to in Civ games are removed.* Map size (singular) is incredibly small.* Where as I remember taking over a week or two on a really nice Civ 3 game, I'd be amazed if anyone takes longer than a couple of hours on one of these.* AI has two modes: wait, and destroy. There is no real negotiating besides giving your stuff to them on demand, or going to war on refusal.If you are new to the Civ franchise and felt like you hadn't had the time or attention to get into the previous incarnations, then this game might be a good choice for you. For an experienced Civ gamer, it's more of a disappointment than anything.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZE2G","description":"","reviewerName":"Jaha","summary":"Overhyped","reviewText":"I don't really understand all the hype over this game.  I got a DL code as part of a video card purchase and I haven't played Farcry 2.  Played the original way back but dont remember much of it.  I thought this game looked pretty cool and it was a nice way to test my new Radeon 7850.  Well, honestly, the game is pretty mediocre and as far as my tastes go it's forgettable.  It emulates sandbox type games mixed with FPS.  Cool concept but I guess because I am older I found this game to be as much of a drag as Borderlands.  The story is absolutely ludicrous, the play mechanics are horribly clunky, the graphics are nice at times but glitchy in others, and the overall feel of the game is that it was unfinished.The good.The overall graphics are nice.  The environments are cool in the jungle and the vistas and walking around at first can be real nice.  However over time the beauty of the island is spoiled by the lack of creativity and diversity.Character building is cool, even in FPS games.  Adds a bit of progression to the game.The bad.A lot.I found the graphics to be slightly off in many instances.  Almost as if I could never get the resolution quite right.Controls are insanely clunky and worse you have to \"unlock\" basic abilities like reloading while running.  Things just never seemed to work smoothly in the game often times making combat frustrating.Hit detection is dreadful.  Point blank shots to center mass or the head will miss frequently.  Worse, enemy health is absurdly high.  Empty a whole clip into a stock enemy or a bear alike and most likely they will keep charging.  Headshots are crucial for basic enemies while animal kills are pretty much luck of the draw if you can get enough shots in but most animals move too fast to really mess with.  Many basic human enemies will have terrible aim.  They will stand in front of you and miss wildly but then in certain fights they will rush right up to you and kill you in a split second.  Its completely unpredictable when the enemy AI will be good or not.Combat is always a mess.  Its hard enough to see in a jungle but the enemies can hide in the bushes easily but still see you even though you cant see them.  If you break stealth in a fight it summons an endless wave of respawn baddies.  Pretty lame honestly that you are on a remote island with an endless supply of bad guys who just magically appear.  Your reinforcements are worthless.  THey never show up when they say they will and they rarely kill anyone.  You pretty much have to do all the work then if you walk 10 feet out of an area and turn around they will all be back anyway.Since this is an FPS stealthy is a messy execution.  Sure you can crouch and sneak in for knife kills but thats about it.  Stealth pretty much boils down to you crouching and walking around enemy fields of vision.  Metal Gear this is not.The progression system is pretty poorly executed.  Sure its nice to feel you are building a character but FC3 pretty much just seems like work.  You need to kill X number of boars, Tigers, Bears, etc to craft items to help you out.  It's pretty absurd that you have to leave cash laying around because your wallet will only hold 2000 bucks or whatever.  You have to unlock additional weapon slots and ammo pouches.  Its slow going at first and a pain.  Hard to find the required animals to make the items you need and you cant skip levels.  By the time you do actually craft most of your items you don't really need much money anymore.  Having to craft health kits pretty much just makes healing more of a chore than fun.  The crafting menu navigation is a true exercise in patience.  Whoever thought up the navigation of these menus should be fired.  It seems heavily console focused and on the PC having to jump back and fourth between items is just a cursed mess.  These menus could have been so much more intuitive but their current execution renders the whole crafting element to the game that much more unlikeable.Driving is pathetic.  Not mush else to stay.  It's a tropical island but you would think its all ice.  The cars are all the same battered jeeps and they slide all over the place and handle like garbage.  I pretty much avoided driving as much as possible.The story was the lamest thing I have seen in a while.  Granted I dont play nearly as many games as I used to but I certainly could care less what happened to these characters.Overall.I just don't understand the hype for this game.  I'm not a massive FPS player but I do enjoy them.  This game has a ton of fans but I dont see the value.  It's a frustrating FPS drag with a lame story.  After a few hours into the game I just felt like it was work rather than fun.  So many other more enjoyable titles out there.  I play RPG games for \"work\" feel.  FPS games just don't seem capable of pulling off the modified RPG feel and if Farcry was going after Grand Theft Auto for the sandbox king they failed miserably.  They missed all that GTA did well and put in all the boring junky grinds mixed with less than polished combat physics.If this game had been given a final coat of polish by the devs before release it could have been better but in this state I think it's just one more example of a completely over-rated mass marketed FPS stinker..","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2013"}

You can do archery, frisbee, swordfighting, golf, and more. Lots of fun!There are twelve basic categories of games. These are: swordplay, wakeboarding, frisbee, archery, basketball, table tennis, golf, bowling, power cruising, canoeing, cycling, and air sports. Within each category are mini-games. So for example in the swordfighting area you can do duels, speed slice challenges, and showdown challenges. Most of the games are fine single player, but some do require multiplayer to work.As with most games of this type, different areas will appeal to different people. I know some friends who adore the golf area. I happen to adore the swordfighting challenges and the air challenges - i.e. flying an airplane around the entire island. That's the beauty of the large selection, that something is sure to appeal to different people in your household.The controls are easy to learn. You want to slash your sword? Just draw it down in front of you as if your Wiimote was an actual sword. These are games that anybody can pick up fairly quickly.Also, they're suitable for all ages. A grandparent and grandchild can have fun playing table tennis against each other.It's important to note that you need the Wii MotionPlus component to your WiiMote. Newer WiiMotes have this built in. Older WiiMotes had to have this plugged in as an add-on in their base. So be sure to check the WiiMotes you own to make sure they can handle the MotionPlus.Are there any down sides here? The games aren't very intricate. If you are a hard core golf fanatic and want to play realistic models of Pebble Beach, this probably isn't the game for you. But for what the game is intended to be, it's great. It's easy to play, fun to replay, and gets you up off the couch.Well recommended for all ages.Rating: 5/5I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2012"}

One of the major disappointments came when I first tried to get the co-op working. You'll have to play for 30 minutes or so before the second player is allowed to join in. That's because the training mission is solo, and last about half an hour. If you don't realize this before turning the game on, then you might think you bought the wrong product.

It has a HUGE number of battles to fight. It can get a little repetitive at times, but then many JRPG's are this way.There are a lot of items to make/craft. Some of the components drop randomly so just keep trying! At first I wondered why there were so many healing and restorative items to craft. Well, later in the game, battles are a wee bit harder. The Inventory allows for only 20 items of a given typs. While healing berries are fine early on, around mid-game you need more restorative items than just 20. So, start crafting early, and get those components as well!The only thing I found annoying were some of the voice actresses. Their voices are sometimes very high-picthed and soft. It kinda annoyed me, so I did not use those characters very much.This is neat.

At times you can also kill enemies using the enviornment (explosive canisters and overhead signs mostly.

Did they succeed in this?  Well, yes they did, with a lot of heavy borrowing from Final Fantasy X's combat system.  The bigger question, though, is, should they have done it in the first place?  I don't think so.  You are playing an RPG where the ending is already basically known, and since you are supposed to be following and assisting the Fellowship the whole time, you really don't have the chance to do anything in the way of sidequests.  You are forced into a linear game of continuous combat with minimal character development, and the end result is a game that, although it looks great and plays well, is ultimately unsatisfying.First, some of the good things about the game.  As I mentioned above, the combat system is lifted directly from Final Fantasy X.  However, this is a good thing.  FFX's combat system was great for strategic play and it allowed you to make the best use of your various characters' strengths and minimze their weaknesses, and The Third Age replicates that nicely.  The music for the game is lifted directly from Howard Shore's soundtracks for the films, so naturally it is excellent.  My only complaint would be that the music bits that accompany the end of each battle are way too repetitive.  Graphically, the game looks great.  As you find new armor and weapons and equip them onto your characters, their looks change appropriately.  Also, there is a feature that allows you to instantly evaulate the stats of a new item and see how it will affect your character before equipping it.  This allows you to avoid equipping a new item that will make your character weaker (which doesn't happen too often, but it does indeed happen).  The backgrounds and environments are, again, based on the films and look excellent.  As you play through the game, you will occasionally encounter characters from the films who will join your party briefly, usually for a boss battle.  Having Gandalf or Aragorn in your party is a pleasure.  You will not encounter any of the hobbits, however, which is strange.  It would have been very easy to work in Merry and Pippin, at least.I was able to play through the game and do everything in less than 30 hours.  So the length of the game, while not exactly epic, was enough to make me feel that I got my money's worth.  There are several chapters in the game and plenty of save points, so the frustration of losing hours worth of work because of one wrong move during combat should never happen in the game.Another great thing about this game is the fact that the various members of your company each have their strengths and weaknesses, and they all have support abilities that will further assist you in combat.  You start out with basic skills, and then as you progress through the game you unlock more powerful moves.  Different enemies require different approaches to battle, so you can't just go through a battle on autopilot.  If you just charge in with sword swinging into every fight without any thought given to buffs or support abilities, you will be looking at a \"Game Over\" screen in a hurry.  There are a few items in the game that allow you to severaly de-buff the enemies to make them easy to kill, but such items are very rare and must be used sparingly.Now let's talk about some of the negative parts of the game.  As I mentioned above, you are locked into a straitjacket story-wise throughout most of the game.  To make things worse, the characters you have aren't very interesting.  Some attempt is made to give them some backstory, but it doesn't really work.  Berethor, the Gondorian you start the game with, has perhaps the most backstory, but it doesn't really make any sense.  I don't want to reveal too many details, though, so you can judge for yourself.  At the other end of the interest spectrum is Hadhod the dwarf, who is so obviously a Gimli-clone that I kept forgetting the difference.  As many RPG-players will agree, without a great story, the game just doesn't work, and that is the case here.  They try to inject some story by the insertion of movie clips and narration (admirably done by Sir Ian McKellen, who played Gandalf in the films).  But there are way too many of them and they are repetitive to the point of annoyance.  Also the ending of the game is absolutely horrible.  Again, I don't want to spoil a whole lot of details here, but rest assured that any Tolkein purist will have a stroke during the final battle of the game.  Another flaw of the story is that the characters from the films use a lot of the same lines from the movies.  At the very end of the game, when Aragorn claps Berethor on the shoulder and says \"You bow to no one,\" I cringed.Bottom line in my opinion - the mechanics of the game are excellent, the story is severely lacking.  Replayability is nil, as there is no room for exploration or sidequests.  The ending is abrupt and unsatisfying.  All in all, worth a rental, but that's about it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2005"}

I'm gonna stop and take a moment to realize that I just used ORIGINAL and EA in the same sentence.  ...  Ok, the apocalypse didn't happen.Mirror's Edge is a fully immersive first person parkour / free running game where you play as a runner named Faith.  She works for an underground resistance against a corrupt government.  Beautifully rendered Urban Jungles are her playground as she dashes from rooftop to rooftop, wall running, jumping, and climbing along the way.  The first person (3d view) free running in the game is pretty amazing.  You actually feel like you are doing all of these amazing things and it's incredibly exciting.Mirror's Edge also shows you exactly where you need to go.  It highlights the 'trick lines' red as you get near them.  Success depends on timing and correct button presses.  Most of the time, it's easy to figure out where you need to go and it's a blast getting there.Here comes the bad...  The checkpoints are fairly generous, but you die for any slight mistake.  If your timing is a bit off, you die.  If you hit the wrong button, you die.  If enemies are shooting at you and you slow down, you die.  When there are enemies shooting at you, it's literally a hail of gunfire.  It doesn't matter if you turn a corner, they fire nonstop.  It's like there's a floating barge of machine guns just behind the camera.The combat is also bad.  You can perform martial arts on the cops and you can kick out of any free running move.  Wall run kick, sliding kick, jumping kick...  The problem is that there are a lot of cops and if you try to fight one, the rest end up shooting you.  You can press a button to slow time and that helps you disarm them, but that's all you get.  If your timing is off while you are disarming an enemy, they kill you.  At one point, I took a cop's shotgun, put the cursor over his face and pulled the trigger at point blank range... and missed.  The cop killed me.The game looks beautiful, but when it plays a cutscene, it's completely cell shaded.  They look like Esurance Commercials.  I expected someone to yell, \"Quote, Buy, Print!\"  I dunno who was in charge of this, but cutscenes are supposed to look BETTER than the gameplay.There also isn't much chance to explore the levels and unlike Assassin's Creed, the game is very linear.  Replay Value is pretty nonexistent, unless you want to try the time trials, where you play through the levels fast.The game is 9 Chapters long and should take you about 7-8 hours to finish.Overall, when you create an innovative game, you don't have the time to solve all of the original problems that you find and the execution ends up being flawed.  If they do a sequel, it will probably be really good.Who should buy this game?Buy it if you are a fanboy, a collector, or you love Esurance.Rent it if you liked the demo, have a low threshold for deaths, and want to experience free running.Otherwise, avoid this one.Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed are better.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2008"}

The missions really remind me of Just Cause - which is a good thing, because Just Cause and Just Cause 2 are GREAT games. The only difference is that this one is much, much bigger. I mean, HUGE. I'm sure The Google will know how big the map is (in terms of square miles) but it is properly huge. The ENTIRE thing is packed with missions, things to find, things to hunt and things to gather. The finding, hunting, gathering theme is deeply reminiscent of Assassins Creed (which I just finished playing AC3), as well as a somewhat clunky kill-from-above skill, and patting down bodies after you've killed to find loot.There's a RPG-like skill tree; you earn skill points as you gain experience. There is a crafting section where you can make medicines, potions, craft new things to carry stuff (holsters, backpack). There's a great array of weapons. There's great voice acting. The action is intense. You can proceed with guns blazing (sometimes) or with stealth. Although, as I mentioned, there isn't really anything inherently new here, it's huge, fabulously well-made, easy to play, and a LOT of fun.It's still not quite like the first Far Cry. That was one of my top 10 favorites of all time. But it is definitely a hugely entertaining game, especially for folks who love open-world FPSs. It seems like a lot of the big-name games are starting to inherit a similar blend of features, which is good and bad - there is a VERY high standard of freedom, mobility, and fighting dynamics that most or all \"good\" modern FPS/TPS games have. The down side is that you really only end up having the same mix and style of fighting/shooting, main mission and side missions, big, detailed open-world maps, and character skill improvements adopted from RPGs. The only thing that really changes is the scenery - the environment - and the quality of voice acting, artwork, cut scenes, and engaging storyline. Are we nearing the pinnacle, the 'perfect form' of good/great games on consoles? Limited perhaps by both hardware and the controller layout?Well, I digress - just waxing philosophic for a moment. The point is, this game is great. Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00320JAWY","description":"","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"Above average shooter. Gripping and compelling story","reviewText":"When I first played this demo, last year, I wasn't overly impressed. The graphics were generic and overly saturated, as most 2K developed games are. Overall, part of this game intrigued me, but not enough to consider purchase, especially at $65. A few months ago, I saw that this game won an award at E3 for best story. I became more intrigued because it told me that this game was more than JUST another shooter. Then, I recently stumbled upon a review of this game. Not to mention, I saw the game for $20 or less on this very website. Therefore, something told me to go ahead and give the game a shot. I am glad I did.CAMPAIGN/STORY: This is the bread and butter of the game. I've never played a military shooter with a story that is QUITE as immersive, heartfelt, graphic, and as compelling as this game. You'll play as Cpt. Walker, who is a part of the Delta force. Walker is teamed with Lt. Adams and Sgt. Lugo. Six months after a massive sandstorm in Dubai had passed, the team is sent on a recon mission to find survivors. Upon arrival, some grim discoveries are made. For one, fresh corpses of the 33rd Infantry Division -- who were initially sent to evacuate the city -- are found. Interestingly enough, players will be more surprised to see who's responsible for their deaths. Then, the story just takes hold of you and doesn't let go. What is most interesting about the campaign is players will be faced with decisions that could have a bearing on the outcome of the game. That makes for an automatic replay of the campaign. The bottom line is players will see exactly why this game won an award for best story because it IS.GAMEPLAY: The gameplay is not the BEST, but it is very good and unique. For example, much detail is used in the interactions during gameplay. Sometimes, the environment can be used to take out enemies. Sand-filled walls can be shot out to create a sandy avalanche on the enemy. Structures that enemies are standing on can be shot, which leaves enemies to fall to their deaths. My favorite is the interaction of a grenade throw. If a grenade is thrown and the enemy is not killed, the dust from the blast can blind enemies, which can lead to some easy kills. This is the type of interaction and details that I have yet to see on other military shooters.Movements can sometime be smooth. Others times, they can be a pain, especially when grabbing cover. I could press a button to grab cover and the action might be unresponsive or my character will start sprinting. It's not that much of a problem, but I've played games that had smoother movements. Shooting weapons is smooth with no issues. Enemies go down with a couple of shots, as they should. Scoring a headshot is cool because upon hitting an enemy in the head, the game goes into a brief slo-mo.The melee in this game is very brutal, gore, yet exciting at the same time. Melee an enemy with a weapon will only knock him down, not kill him. Therefore, walking up on the injured enemy will bring up an option to perform an execution. I would say the actions rival the one's onArmy of TWO The Devil's Cartel. Enemies are very smart and aggressive in this game. Players will endure various kinds of enemies, who do not just attack and grab cover the same. Some may aggressively move, shoot, and grab cover. This same enemy might just decide to pull out a grenade, if he cannot take you out with initial actions.GRAPHICS/VISUALS: The game's Unreal engine runs on a 720p output. Unfortunately, players should not expect the game to look as good as games, such asMax Payne 3or games in the Uncharted series. The colors are vivid and sharp, but the close-ups of the character models during cut-scenes look oversaturated, as if they were in a painting. However, the graphics and visuals are pretty good have their own identity because of the details in each levels. In fact, in some levels, the graphics seem like they could have a 1080p output. It is cool to see many of the textures and vividness of the sand, destroyed apartment and office buildings, museums, as well as other structures that were untouched by the sandstorm. There's even good detail, when heavy sandstorms arrive in the game.MULTIPLAYER: The multiplayer is similar to that ofTom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier. However, the environments can be used to take out enemies. Nuff said.SOUND: The sound is in Dolby Digital Surround. The weapons sound very realistic, as well as explosions. The voice acting of the characters in the game is VERY good. Hearing enemies' talk amongst themselves is very crisp and clear.TEAM A.I.: Your teammates are a great help, instead of a hindrance in this game. In fact, in some firefights, they might be the best option to use. Orders can be given to your team ala Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon: Future Soldier. One of the coolest orders to give the team is to throw flashbang grenades at the enemy. The light just blinds the target(s) and makes for some very easy kills. Sometimes, players can order the team to take out an enemy and they may do random actions, depending on the circumstances. For example, if a player orders a long range target to be taken out, a teammate will pull out his sniper rifle and do so. If the enemy is at mid-range or close quarters target, the teammate will could throw a grenade or try to get as close as he can to engage the target with a weapon.VERDICT: This game is worth a purchase, ESPECIALLY now due to the $20 or less price tag. Gamers, who want more than just another meaningless shoot'em up game, will feel like they struck gold. This game actually has a movie-like story to go along with shooting enemies.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Chitown Lurker","summary":"This game will haunt you","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying that if you played and did not appreciate Demon's Souls, then Dark Souls probably is not for you. The basic gameplay is 99% identical: players must be cautious, cannot just button-mash as in typical hack-n-slash games, and must accept that the game never, ever holds the player's hand. And like Demon's Souls before it, death is an expected part of the game. As players would spend the majority of their time in \"spirit\" form in Demon's Souls, they can expect to spend most of their time as \"hollowed\" in this game...i.e., playing at a slight attribute disadvantage vs. the ideal human state.There are plenty of reviews describing the gameplay in more detail here, so I'll just focus on pros and cons:Pros-Hyper challenging-Requires thought...this is a thinking person's game-Open world, unlike its predecessor-Much like its predecessor, players needs to figure out for themselves where to go next...the game will not stop you from going somewhere unwise.-Same great combat as Demon's Souls-Lots of mysterious locked doors to remember and come back to later (unless you select the \"Master Key\" (basically a skeleton key) as a starting gift-Amazing sense of exploration. Everything area in this game is meticulously designed and laid out. Nothing feels random or empty. And yet there is so much to see. There is a clear sense of exploratory heritage between this game and classics like the original Zelda and Metroid, in that the game generally won't stop you from sticking your nose where it doesn't yet belong, and any obstacles it does put up generally have some means of circumvention.Cons-Less adventurous gamers may be put off by not being explicitly told where they should try going next. This game takes it for granted that players will look for assistance both in the form of in-game messages that others leave on the ground, or will go online and get help from discussion forums. Or, failing that, just explore for themselves. This game is about the journey and the feelings evoked, and surprises can often be found even in areas you thought you knew. This is unique among modern games, and modern gamers might be taken off guard.-Relative to Demon's Souls, the messaging system FAR less flexible...i.e., there are far fewer phrasing and word options, making it tougher to provide meaningful assistance in-game-I'm seeing far fewer players recommending messages than in Demon's Souls, and it's also harder to find people to summon or to get summoned. This could be due to the peer-to-peer system and supposed multiple lobbies that this game uses, resulting in smaller pools of prospective strangers to interact with at any given time. I find this a bit troubling, because some boss battles are significantly more difficult without assistance (and if you receive NPC assistance but that NPC dies, he won't be there to help you again). A lot apparently depends on being lucky enough to be placed with a busy lobby when you sign-in.-Related to the last point, this game has had a much more publicized release, meaning more casual players are likely playing than was the case with Demon's Souls. This may be resulting in less effort by the average player to learn all the ins-and-outs of the game's somewhat dense and mysterious gameplay. This can result in the players you do cross paths with to be less likely to understand the community features of the game.Everything else has already been said.

It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends.

First off, at first I thought that the controller would be pretty clunky due to its size. But in actuality, it is fairly light and fits nicely in one's hand. Bigger-handed people might have a problem, though. What I REALLY like about the controller is that ALL buttons are accessible without having to remove your hand from ANYTHING. Unlike that stupid N64 system that has buttons in the most unreachable places in the heat of battle. I didn't see the point behind the little video-game screen on the controller, though. To me, it just weighs it down more and--let's face it--why bother playing pixally games when you can play your Dreamcast? One thing that I like about Playstation is that the memory cards are inserted into the system, not the controller. Wise move. But unfortunately, Sega didn't have the foresight to do that. As for the system, it is slightly smaller than a Sony Playstation. Graphics run really well on this system and I'm surprised at what it can do. There is one thing that I have to say about the 4 Megs of Video RAM on Playstation /PS2 versus the 8 Megs of Video RAM on Dreamcast. When I watch a Final Fantasy FMV on Playstation, I know that they are pushing that system TO THE ABSOLUTE LIMIT. If Dreamcast has TWICE the Video RAM, then I expect to see something TWICE as impressive, something that is so graphically intense that it threatens to overheat the system. But sadly, I haven't seen any Dreamcast game do that. In fact, some of these games look like the regular Playstation could handle them. Overall, this is a nicely designed system, but now that Sega is putting an end to its Dreamcast games, it's not worth buying. I'd buy a Playstation 2--Metal Gear 2 is around the corner (and FF X) or maybe a Nintendo Dolphin.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2001"}

AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends. Our note to the cost-conscious: If you have a Dreamcast system, you just don't need a separate CD player or a separate computer. Dreamcast does it all, and does it well.--Mike Fehlauer","reviewerName":"Kevin T.

Who would have thought a game about a running blue hedgehog (Sonic The  Hedgehog) would be so fun?  Or that a worm in a power suite (Earthworm Jim)  would be so challenging?  And after all these years of us having to deal  with lousy 3D games that have no deapth (Most of them 3D killers of 2D  classics), SEGA finally rises to show us what games SHOULD be like!  &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; is probibly the first 3D game I liked that was  originaly 2D (Very unlikely that happens)!  Plus with some of the best  games on the system that's out there, I see a bright future for SEGA!  So  what about the the other companys (Nintendo, Sony)?  Well I was for years a  big Nintendo fan, untill they made the Nintendo 64.  What a waste of a  system.  I see promise for their Gamecube system, but I'm going to be  cautious about it after what happened with their last system!  And Sony is  trash!  Always has been, always will be!

This time, you'll come up against Alma's powers from the perspective of special forces operator Michael Becket. After an enormous explosion has devastated the city of Auburn, you'll quickly discover that what seemed like an ordinary mission to retrieve and interrogate Genevieve Aristide is anything but..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Ghoulish supernatural enemies give F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin a horrific, cinematic feel.View larger.You'll explore and do battle in the dark corners of the ruined city of Auburn.View larger.An enhanced graphics engine offers more dramatic effects.View larger.Improved enemy AI means you'll need better tactics.View larger.Project Origin Run Amok: Alma's BackgroundFans of the first game will be familiar with the suspenseful story surrounding the psychic Alma, a peculiar and disturbing odyssey that adds depth to her devastating quest for revenge and immediacy to gameplay. Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Oldtechnohobbiest \"Mr. Nobody\"","summary":"Screwed/toasted/robbed/doomed;","reviewText":"I really hate reviewing a game program without getting to play it, but I think you might agree with my actions after I give you the quick overall reason.1.

I assume the same will happen with Halo 4. I say this because my only complaint thus far is that \"there aren't enough maps or playlists\" but I realize it just came out. Anyway, the graphics, for one, are amazing. Watching it in HD is a treat, but I'd imagine it'd look pretty good on most TVs. The music is also lovely to hear; very full of passion and feeling, even though it wasn't even the same guy who composed it as the other games. I like that sprint is always a possibility, and there are many different armor effects, some of which are pretty useful. The gameplay is still very similar to previous games, so it doesn't feel like a totally different franchise. I'm not sure if some people may be disappointed by this, but I was glad to feel like I was still playing a Halo game.There are new weapons, and there are indeed new enemies. The story also was very captivating; it seemed to have a lot more cutscenes than previous titles, but they interested me more than previous games' scenes had. I felt like we were getting to know John a little better, and Cortana seemed a lot more lifelike than ever. The campaign had less missions than other Halo titles, but it was still fun, action packed, beautiful, and interesting.The multiplayer is fun, as well. So far there are only a few gametypes, but I know that will change. A new map pack was just released (but I'm not reviewing it here). Even though the multiplayer gets a little repetitive due to there not being as much content as say, Halo Reach, it's still a lot of fun. I haven't really found any glitches or anything of that sort. Flood is a fun gametype that is exactly like Infection, but you are Flood instead. There's SWAT which is personally my favorite gametype.The last thing I'll discuss is Spartan Ops, which although some have said it is lacking, I enjoy it a lot. For one, there are a ton of episodes and chapters. The graphics and gameplay are just as great in these missions, and it's a lot like Firefight, only \"with a purpose,\" as 343 promised before the game came out. When I'm getting tired of matchmaking I sometimes play Spartan Ops because it's still action packed but a bit easier (depending on which difficulty you play).I would say that this game is worth its full price. I eagerly anticipate new content and gametypes that will come about, but it has still offered me endless hours of play already. I'm happy if a game gives me an hour of play per dollar, and this goes above and beyond that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2012"}

First there's the campaign option, its fun having to navigate maps with objectives in mind and it gives the game a sense of desperation. Two, there's the hero option which was great for many reasons unlike the almost unbeatable jedi in the first one (you could run then over with a speeder bike or blow them off a bespin or Kamino platform), finally there's space battles.

The problem is that they are very heavy and get uncomfortable after extended use.  Here is some *KEY* information:These come with the controller adapter, so you there's $25 of the value right there.A really cool thing about the adapter is that you can set the game volume to voice chat sound ratio, and then change the master volume. This makes it convenient when you have to lower your volume because unlike before, you don't have to set the correct ratio when going back up, it's already set.The headset sounds pretty good, and if you don't already have a good pair of headphones with a mic, then I suggest getting them.With that said, if you purchase the $25 adapter separately, then you can use any pair of headphones to listen to game sound.  And if they have a mic, then you can speak with them too.  I wanted to have turtle beaches dedicated to my Xbox One, so that is why I got them, but I have a pair of Sony MDR-1RBTs that I can plug into the adapter and use just as easily.  I returned these XO Sevens, however, and got XO Fours.  For most people, I would suggest using a pair of headphones with a mic that they already have, with the adapter.  For anyone without a headset, absolutely get these.For a comparison with the XO Fours, read on.The XO Sevens are nice.  They sound great as well.  There's one issue with them, however, that got me to return them to Gamestop.  The XO Sevens are just too heavy and the material is not breathable. They get irritating after long use and the weight does not help.  They do sound superb though, so if you don't mind slight discomfort after extended use, and you don't mind the price, then go with these.Otherwise, the XO Fours are your best bet. They are light, and they are comfortable.  After hours of playing Forza, they are still easy to wear. They sound almost as good, and they don't make the area around my ears sweat. I would say the XO Fours are the better headset, and they're cheaper!I hope this helped, and if you have any questions, please feel free to email me or leave a comment.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2014"}

Your mission isn't terribly new (infiltrate a terrorist base and blow everything up), but the gameplay is: your numerous enemies are watching for you, and you are encouraged to sneak rather than simply charge in. Every level brings new challenges. You fight snipers, invisible ninjas, psychic warriors, and even an M-1 tank! As the father of the modern spy game genre, this game is an instant classic.Your allies and superiors speak to you via a cool, implanted radio,  monitoring your progress, offering  tips--but failing to give you the full story. The combination of a mysterious and engaging plot and high in-game tension makes this a thrilling ride. Campy humor also abounds as you rescue beautiful women, verbally spar with your allies, and blow up enemies in the bathroom.

Let me explain myself:It's a third person action/adventure game, that requires you to utilize stealth to survive.  As Solid Snake, a lone warrior, you have to single-handedly infiltrate Shadow Moses Island, a base recently taken over by terrorists to develop a nuclear capable walking robot, codenamed Metal Gear Rex.  Your job is to make sure Rex never launches by any means necessary.It sounds like a typical third person action game, but there's so much more to this game.First off, the plot is flawless.  Hands down the most intricate, well thought out, and moving plot I've seen in any thriller movie ever made.Your main enemy, the enemy most commonly seen in the game, is the Genome soldier.  The Genome soldier is a member of a genetically engineered army.  If you stay out of sight, you'll never have to have a physical encounter with one of these guys.However, the boss fights cannot be avoided, and thus, it's a darn good thing they're so enjoyable.  Bosses range from normal human beings with dreams of revenge to individuals with slightly supernatural powers, which adds an interesting twist to the game.  Every boss is fighting for their own perosnal reasons, and their own motives.The game will take roughly twelve hours to complete the first run through without a strategy guide.  I advise you to listen to all the Codec conversations and watch all the cinematics because this is where the game truly shines.  It's story.  With six times the lenght of the average Hollywood thriller, the story is developed much more, and the characters are fleshed out far better than in any film I can think of.This game has my highest recommendation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2003"}

I liked them but felt they were overhyped. This game is amazing and deserves all the hype its getting.  I am halfway through the campaign and about 18 hours deep in online play.So far the campaign is easily the best in the series and very entertaining and varied. The characters while pretty memorable from the first two games were not very much more than cardboard cutouts. In this game the characters have a little more depth and you get some pretty interesting backstory on them. I have not been able to enjoy campaign co-op yet but imagine it will be a blast this time 4 players can co-op in the campaign, and awesome upgrade from the first two games.I was not expecting to love the multiplayer, but so far it has been flawless, except for one small prob. Team Deathmatch and King of the Hill which is basically capture the flag are both well executed here because of the amazing weapon balancing and awesome map designs. There has not been one time when I felt like I got killed by some cheap tactic that the other player was exploiting so far the game has been extremely fun and fair the shot guns are deadly at close range but the lancers are also deadly at distance. I did not participate in the beta but it looks like Epic did and awesome job utilizing feedback they got from it.Horde 2.0 and Beast Mode are awesome as well with beast mode being a reverse Horde where you play as locust. Beast mode is not really quite as deep as horde mode in terms of tactics but it's a fun mode. Horde 2.0 is the same mode from the last game with some awesome updates like command posts that you buy defenses for with cash you accumulate by killing locust in a round. Also every 10th round there are bosses in part of the horde making it very challenging.  It is deeper and more challenging than before. Also the sheer amount of different types of enemies is awesome it seems like every time I play there is a new enemy type. . The one small issue I have so far is it seems like there is slow matchmaking in Beast and Horde mode. Prob just cause its launch week though no big deal.I cant say enough about this game and how awesome it is. This game is not a hyped game that will disappoint. This has an awesome campaign so far and a multiplayer that seems to have been tested and tweeked to perfection by Epic. Buy this now if you have a 360.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0H79C","description":"Gears of War 3","reviewerName":"gimli1357","summary":"Mostly for the Best","reviewText":"Well to start it out, let's talk about the good points.I will avoid all spoilers so don't worry here. The campaign is great, with the greatest voice acting and visuals ever. I don't think I have ever seen a game with as good of graphics as GOW3, utterly stunning. The voice actors are very convincing. And the small detail that the designers put into the visuals is amazing. There are many hidden \"Easter Eggs\"(little secrets put into a game just for fun) that add to the replay value of the campaign, as well as co-op. Arcade mode also adds a competitive piece to campaign allowing you to fight for the most points over your teammates. We see the return of most of the characters, though a bit older looking now, and the new Carmine is better than ever. The story was written very well and we get to see some new enemies as well. Basically, the campaign is utterly amazing and great. Good job here EPIC.Horde mode is also improved with the ability to purchase blockades, decoys, turrets, sentries and silver-backs. You earn money for kills, assists, and completing bonus objectives (usually killing enemies in different ways. EG: 10 Head-shots in a round). The more points you spend on specific \"fortifications\", the more you level it up. With higher levels you can build enhanced versions of that fortification, and unlock new ones. Also, a good job here.Beast mode is an interesting mode that puts you in the shoes of the locust as they attack in horde. You get to fight through 12 waves of horde as locust. The more kills and assists that you get, the more locust breeds become unlocked. You start out with simple breeds like tickers and wretches, then unlock stronger breeds like boomers and berserkers (oh is it fun being a berserker).And one last thing is the new abilities that you can do. Trading weapons with characters, both A.I. and player controlled, is a very nice addition. And if both characters have the same weapon, one can choose to share his ammo with the other.Now for the little bad points. (Mostly all of these are in online matchmaking)If you had the chance to play the beta of GOW3 you will see that a lot has changed, and not all for the good. It seems that there were many complainers who played the beta, and EPIC listened to them. The retro-lancer now spreads more quickly than it did in the beta, and it was already fairly in-accurate. You also slow down more when you get shot during a retro-charge or \"roadie-run\". The sawed off shotgun is also much less effective than it twas. The range of it has been reduced to a bare point-blank. Anymore and it won't even do damage. The gnasher shotgun is much farther range, and I feel that it's a little too far. The gnasher can now kill someone from 15+ yards pretty quickly. Besides these, most of the weapons have been left untouched power-wise. And, when playing campaign or horde, the weapons seem to be just as powerful as they were in the beta. It seems like they just changed it for match-making.The other bad point that this has is the team balancing. The problem is, I don't think it exists. I have been on teams that have had 3 bots (A.I. players). And bots do not play very good, mostly they are just walking ammo banks they give the other team kills. Of course this is in a quick match, but even in a ranked match, it also does not seem to keep even ranks on the teams when playing. Plus ranked matches take much longer to get into and don't really rank you up any quicker.All in all though, Gears of War 3 is a great game and I definitely recommend buying it. The campaign is perfect, the horde and beast modes are great, and you can get past the little annoyances, match-making is decent as well. So EPIC, you still get a nice 5 star, well done!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2011"}

The past games just couldn't hold my attention. It always felt like a slow grind of the same thing over and over and over again. It didn't even matter going from location to location in the past games , they all just felt the same and the same exact gameplay from place to place made them become stale very fast.I needed a new game for my new Xbox One so I decided to give Black Flag a go. I really didn't have high hopes for this game but to my surprise and amazing enjoyment I found this game to be excellent..i don't know if it was the naval warfare or the new lands and characters but I just can't think of anything negative to say about the game. This game truly is the best in the series and raises the bar for the next installment..I didn't really do a whole lot of side quests but just enough side quests and exploration to gain enough money to beef up my ship.. I strongly urge all of you to save your money for ship upgrades.. there are actually parts of this game ( main story line ) that are virtually unpassable without an upgraded ship. I found out the hard way and had to go back and grind a bit to get enough money to get the upgrades I needed.I just didn't feel an urge to play side quests because the story line of the main campaign kept me wanting to see what was going to happen next. Even though I didn't play many side quests I can tell you that the main story line is long and will give you more than enough game play all by itself.I can't recommended this game enough , its so different from the original that even if you are a person like me that didn't like the past games  , I have a feeling you are sure to love this one.Ubisoft hit one out of the park with this one !!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0044SA70M","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Laferriere","summary":"A surprisingly value with great replayability!","reviewText":"I've found this to be a really interesting open world game. A shame the MMORG project that this was supposed to evolve into never came to fruition. Lots of attacks that are easy to learn and great graphics. Reckoning is more than your average XXX (eXplore, eXperience, eXterminate) game. You can level up and practice individual abilitys, form alliances and such.I think one of the more interesting items in this game is the ability to make your own armor and weapons. For example if you are having trouble with a creature that uses a fire based attack you can craft a magical gem and then assemble armor and deposit the gem which will then cause it to be enchanted against fire based attacks. You can also experiment by mixing different gems to get different strengths and abilitys from the gems. The same goes for potions. You collect numerous reagents throughout the game and can then mix them and see what you get. Once you find a potion that works it will record the mixture for you allowing you to make it again.Even with customized weaponry, armor the game is not very complicated to pick up. The combat is more about good timing and wisdom than twitch speed.Bottom line, this is probably one of the most replayable dungeon type games I've played and I've been playing since \"Temple of Apshai\" came out!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2014"}
{"product_name":"B004FYKWZU","description":"","reviewerName":"HitRaj 47","summary":"Not the best ending, but a fun game nonetheless","reviewText":"Bioware has delivered something Valve can't - the final game in a trilogy, Mass Effect 3. I've reached the end of Shephard's journey and although in my opinion, the ending left a lot to be desired, the ride was one of the most thrilling I've ever had in a game. If you plan on getting this game, I recommend getting the Prothean DLC. Whilst not a story changer in any way, if you really care about the Mass Effect universe, then the Prothean is a good addition.One of the reasons to buy this game is for it's story, so in writing this review I'll assume you've played the first two, but if you haven't, you really should. I think it's essential to really appreciating the story and how far the gameplay has come since the first game. On top of that, your saves carry over from the previous games. This  continuity is rare in games and I don't think I've ever seen another game do this, as in, continuing a story as well as remembering all the choices the player made in the previous game. There are three different ways the game allows you to play, which I personally don't think should have been included, but I guess they were trying to appeal to a more broader range of gamers.The first is combat - the story choices are pretty much made for you and you focus on the gameplay and fighting. I hate, hate, hate this option because the choices and the story are what make this game stand out and there are few other games like this. Alternatively there's the story mode, where the combat is made easy and you get to focus on the story more, as the name suggests. Whilst this is better than combat mode in my opinion, you still don't get the full experience. For the real ME experience, I recommend RPG mode, which is a blend of both combat and story mode.The gameplay in the third has once again improved. In the previous game, in between missions, you went from planet to planet mining, which was incredibly dull. Now you have a scanner attached to your ship, where you go into various zones and scan for artifacts. These help boost your \"galactic readiness level\", which goes up to 100%. I'm still unsure what this actually does, but mine was 100% when I played through because I played a lot of the multiplayer when I played. In fact, multiplayer is just one way to boost your readiness, the other way is doing various side missions that gets certain people on your side to fight against the Reapers. Some can be small, such as allowing a news reporter to interview you (and not punching them in the face -_-), and some big, like getting the Batarian fleet on your side. There appears to be a minimum level in the game, which can easily be achieved by playing the game, so it's not a burden. Besides, it's an RPG, don't you want to do the side missions?The gameplay in ME 3 remains mostly the same, but I feel it's even more streamlined. One example is the use of the spacebar key... This key is used for pretty much everything and whilst that seems like it would be simple, it is, but it's also incredibly annoying. I have a beef with this because it's the fault of console gamers. The game had to be designed so it was easy to play with a gamepad, which I understand, but I wish developers would consider that PC gamers have more buttons to work with than a gamepad. One example where this is aggravating is in multiplayer. The spacebar is used to get behind cover, but it's also used to heal fallen team mates. What can end up happening, and it happens all too often, is that you run over to a fallen comrade getting there in the nick of time, only to find that when you press space, instead of reviving him/her, you get behind cover. This issue would be solved if they had a use key. I recommend `F', since it really isn't used for anything. Throwing grenades and using certain powers could be done better too. The Z and C keys aren't used for anything either and it would make the game a whole lot smoother if these keys were assigned something like grenades and powers. The number keys are fine for certain things, but sometimes in the heat of battle, stretching your finger over to the C key is a lot easier than using the number 6 for throwing grenades. There is one improvement that I like however, and that's the in game map. It's so much easier to find important characters now as when you pull up the map, they are listed to be in certain areas, so there's no time wasted hunting them down.Besides the controls my other big complaint was the endings. To be honest, this is a difficult task - I'm a huge fan of Deus Ex, Deus Ex: Human Revolution and I enjoyed the previous two ME games. What these games have in common is that the story and character and the world around you is shaped by player choices. However, with the exception of the first two ME games, all those choices simply funnel you into one of three endings, where none of them are any good. Human Revolution especially, because all you did was walk into a room and press one of three buttons. There was a fourth button that made you do something but not much more than pressing more buttons. The same is in ME 3. I won't spoil what those endings are, but you essentially walk into whatever platform you want for whichever ending you want. And to be honest, none of them bring that much closure. Without spoiling the endings, all three are very similar and none of them really are a good, evil or neutral ending, which is baffling to me since you work hard during the whole game series to make your character either renegade (evil, or really just rude) or paragon (goodie two shoes).However the good thing is, if you really play the game to it's fullest it should take you at least a week to finish. There are lots of hours to be had with the singleplayer alone and is one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a while, despite it's control flaws. Eventually you notice there are three different types of enemies - Cerberus, Geth and Reaper. Each has their own types of minions and big bad powerful mobs, and each requires a different tactic for taking down different enemies. Eventually you figure out what works best with the character class you've chosen, of which there are the same six classes from the previous games (Adept, Soldier, Engineer, Sentinel, Infiltrator and Vanguard). Each class has it's strength and weakness. In general I'm mostly an FPS gamer, so I went for the soldier class, however the others are fun to play with too and I recommend experimenting in multiplayer.The multiplayer contributes to your galaxy readiness rating, the more games you complete the higher it gets until it reaches 100%. You can still continue playing after it reaches 100% of course. Each class has different races within them. It seems you can have as many characters as you like and once one reaches the maximum level of 20, you can promote them to the singleplayer, which resets the class rank , adds 10 points to your N7 rank (some pointless leaderboard thing) and adds to your singleplayer galaxy readiness... Something I still don't even know what it does.The multiplayer is simple really, it's just survival. On round 3, 6 and 9, there are some objectives to complete, such as killing a target enemy, holding a particular area while some data downloads or downloading data of a somewhat randomly placed computer. It makes it a little varied but in the end, it's still predictable. Again the three enemy types reappear, Cerberus, Geth and Reaper, and again you have to use the strengths of you and your team to defeat them. There are also not that many levels and although they vary in theme, their designs aren't really too different and you get used to them really quickly. Despite all that, the multiplayer is a challenge. There are three difficulty levels - bronze, silver and gold. Bronze is fairly easy once you get used to the game but silver is pretty challenging. I have yet to win a gold challenge too. Again, it's simplicity doesn't mean it's a bad thing, after all, the most popular online shooter ever has only two game modes (Counter Strike - bomb defusal and hostage rescue... Unless you want to count VIP mode -_-). This simplicity paired with the class variations makes the multiplayer quite addicting and in all honesty, I think they may of added it as an afterthought, but it's turned out to be a nice addition to an already great game.In conclusion, despite the script writing for the last 15 minutes of the game, the game itself is brilliant. It has all of the solid gameplay you'd expect from a Mass Effect game despite a few control flaws and the multiplayer is a surprisingly good addition to the game. Upon completing the game you get a message inferring that there is more DLC to come. Perhaps this DLC might explain the endings a bit more, but beyond that, who knows. The game by itself is worth your money. It's early in the year, but I think this is definitely going to be one of the best singleplayer games this year and it's going to be hard to beat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2012"}

The bass boost is phenomenal.  It gives so much more to the game experience.  In my first live match (BFBC2) I got a melee kill with knife because I heard an enemy sneaking up behind me.  Anyone familiar with this game knows that this type of kill is alittle less common than in the COD series.  Absolutely the only issue I have with this headset is that Turtle Beach may want to consider stiffening up the volume controls, as these may be accidentally bumped during normal movement during gameplay which can affect volume levels causing the player to need to make an adjustment during the heat of battle.

Your elder comes to you to tell you that the water purification system has malfunctioned, and you need to find a replacement chip to fix it.  From there, all hell breaks loose as you battle raiders, monsters, and a slew of mutated creatures, all changed by the severe radiation poisoning the world has been left with.  Pick up weapons, develop your skills, and explore the landscape for answers to your people's salvation.Fallout 2 takes you some 80 years after the first title.  You are a decendent of the hero of the first Fallout game, and need to help your village survive a horrid drought by finding a Garden of Eden Creation Kit (GECK).  This item will help your people to grow new crops, and bring a new era of civilization to the tribals.  After that, you're left to find answers to where the sacred Vault 13 is, and whether or not you can get a GECK to save your people with.  You'll battle similar enemies from the first title, plus an assortment of new baddies.  You'll get some different weapons, and the command interface is a little more user friendly.The best part of these games is the freedom elements.  Don't want to complete that mission?  Then don't!  Many of the quests are optional, so you can choose which ones you want to complete.  You can attack just about anyone (provided you can fight off their friends), steal from people, or be a helpful vigilante and bring justice to the wastelands.This game should only be viewed by mature audiences because of sexual situations and coarse dialogue.  So, if you're 17 or older and want a game that you'll play again and again, pick up Fallout and Fallout 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

It apparently doesn't have as good of graphics as the other consoles of this generation, but I think the graphics look fine, plus the great games make up for it.  If you're a fan of the classic Nintendo games, like \"Metroid\", \"The Legend of Zelda\", or \"Super Mario\", then this may be a better console for you than the competing consoles.  (If you are a fan of RPG's like \"Final Fantasy\", the GameCube has little to offer there.  In that case, consider the PlayStation 2 or the more current PlayStation 3.)The GameCube also has accessories that you can buy that allow it to play Game Boy games or that connect it to the Game Boy Advance so you can access extra features in certain games, such as \"Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc\" and \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\".I must mention that you can, in theory, just get the Wii to play GameCube games now.  The only problem here is that the Wii does sometimes have issues with GameCube memory cards.  My Wii won't read the memory cards, and I hear many others have that problem, so I still need my GameCube for those games.There are a few issues I have with the GameCube, but nothing major.  For one thing, you must turn it off in order to switch disks, which is a little annoying, since the other consoles can be left on.Also, the smaller memory cards can't fit too much.  All my PS2 games fit on one memory card, but my GameCube games are scattered across several memory cards, and I lose track of what is where.  I would definitely suggest not buying the small 59 block memory card.  And the huge ones and the third party ones are more likely to have problems.  I never had a problem with my 1019 block Nyko memory card, but sometimes, the other third party ones I have need to be formatted.  I always got away with not formatting them, but if you do have to format the memory card, you'll lose all your data.  Probably the Nintendo 251 block memory cards would be your best bet.Also, the GameCube disks are smaller, which means that if they get scratched or dirty, they are more likely to have issues than regular disks that are in the same condition.The GameCube also has no way to connect to the Internet and will not play music CD's or movies.  This is not a problem for me, but it might be for other people.The GameCube may be behind the other consoles of this generation in a few areas, but in terms of actual games, the GameCube is a great console.  I have so many fun games for this console, so it absolutely doesn't matter to me that the graphics aren't quite as good or I can't play movies.  I bought the GameCube because I am a Nintendo fan, and I was not disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2012"}

Seriously, you have really accomplished a real milestone in FPS gaming if you are an elite player in Killzone 2. Now on to the review.The campaign is very generic and isn't as short as most people say it is. The first bits of game play are the best in any FPS ever IMO (right after you crash land). It really draws you in and immerses you into combat immediately. After the first 2 or 3 levels it feels really drawn out and dull. This is only because of the learning curve and dull environmants. Unlike Call of Duty's \"run and gun\" tactics, you are an actual soldier here with real weight and speed. You wanna just run out and kill em all, but you can't, just like in real life. You MUST take cover and make smart shots if you are to survive. It's VERY realistic, so if you are a COD junkie and can't adjust, it's like being a Midnight Club fan who can't adjust to Gran Turismo. This is a shooting sim here people.In terms of gameplay, it is amazing at first. The first few levels are easy like any other game. The mid-levels are where the difficulty is turned up quite a bit all of a sudden as I said, so it'll seem very drawn out and tedious, because of the difficulty. When you kill someone, it is so rewarding that I can't even begin to explain without sounding like a sadist. Unlike ANY other shooting game, you feel that you've accomplished something when you see the beautiful death animations of the Helghast. You barely ever see 2 of the same death animations, once again making the game that much more realistic. However, the game can seem very unbalanced at times. While you'll die in a few shots, it'll seem like your enemy takes about 10 or 12 shots before going down. In reality you must be pin point accurate because chances are, 5 or 6 of those shots missed entirely. I'll admit for gaming purposes that it is WAAAAAAAAAAAY too hard to aim in this game. It's absolutely brutal. Another mis-step of the game play is a lack of variety in the guns. You'll likely just stick with the assault rifle (green sight) because it is much better than all the other guns. One last complaint is that the Helghast are too accurate with the shotgun, and too abusive with grenades. You'll die from grenades much more than gunfire. And you'll die for sure if the Helghast has a shotgun in skirmish, and you're within 15 feet.The graphics are indeed beautiful as we all know. As much as Uncharted and MGS4, you MUST MUST have an HDTV to experience the beauty of this game. I know from experience. I played this game for a day on skirmish before my HDTV was shipped here, and boy was I underwhelmed on the SDTV. Once I plugged my PS3 into my HDTV via HDMI, I was in HEAVEN. It was so stunningly beautiful that I could not believe it! Even the ground, every piece of dirt, gravel, and rubble is extremely detailed. The difference is astoundingly apparent. The reflection on the guns are beautifully rendered as well. This game is drop dead gorgeous, even though it is inferior to only Uncharted 2 and a times, God of War and MGS4.As for the online, I got killed like 6 or seven times in less than a minute. Yeah, you guys are awesome and I suck. So........I play skirmish. I played only 3 sessions of skirmish choosing random maps because they only display the name, and not a picture of the map (which sucks). The best thing is that these 3 locations weren't in the game. I may be wrong, but I don't remember these levels at all in campaign, so that's a plus.Overall, if you're getting this as a Call of Duty fan, RENT IT. The gameplay is superior to the arcadey COD, and takes real skill and timing to get kills. The campaign dialogue is forgettable, and overall not very good. BUT is still is awesome somehow. The graphics, physics/realism, and set pieces make the campaign a blast. This is a rich man's shooter in terms of gameplay and graphics.Update Oct. 15th, 2010OK I've played this game enough to tell you the glaring problems that plague this from being a killer app. I said this was a shooting sim, and while it comes close, it is not quite a sim. There are 4 main problems.The first 2 are linked together. It is very hard to aim and enemies take far too many shots before dying (offline). If you hold the trigger on an automatic  assault rifle, the bullets would begin to spray sporadically and the recoil would throw off precise shots realistically. This is the case in KZ2 and I love that, but what offsets it is that the enemies will take like 10-15 shots before dying! At first when I was a rookie, I used to dump an entire clip at an enemy. Now at far distances I use half a clip, which is still way too much. I remember just yesterday planting 10 (YES 10!) shots in a Helghast's! That's just outrageous, and for the very hard down-the-sights aiming, you should at least be able to kill your enemy in less than 10 SHOTS TO THE CHEST.Third problem: I said there were plenty of death animations. In the campaign yes. In campaign they will rag-doll and fall over balconies. In MP and skirmish, you'll get so sick of the animations you won't know what to do! Honestly, is feels as if there are 5 death animations in total! These animations are slow awkward falls too.The fourth and BIGGEST problem of them all is the lack of guns. I stick to either the green sight assault rifle or the Helghast assault rifle because besides the shotgun (best shotgun in any videogame ever), they are the only reliable weapons in the game. The sniper rifle is very hard to master and I don't snipe. So 4 good guns in a shooting game? That speaks for itself lol.Other problems: The art direction in Corinth Crossing was definitely questionable. The upper level (on top of the bridge) looks FANTASTIC. But the reddish brown color of the lower levels is just ugly. I hate that half the level is pretty (upper) and the lower is downright fugly (lower). An even uglier level is Tharsis Depot! Poopy brown color but good level design. Looks and feels far less detailed than the other levels. Wasteland bullet is just that-a barren wasteland. This is the worst level I've ever played. I NEVER choose this one in skirmish EVER. Looks fun in a youtube vid, but not fun to die as you fall off train a dozen times.Levels online feel overwhelmingly crowded. Camping galore. Spawn points are raided often etc. I'd like the online element if there were less players (10 on 10) and more team based gameplay. Everyone ALWAYS plays like its bodycount. Last time I was online I died every 10 sec. NOT an enjoyble experience. General rank so I'm far from the best, but I've played enough to not SUCK. Rocket launcher is abused by many.Overall, if these problems are all fixed in KZ3, then we have the shooter of this gen coming our way.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I0K5RS","description":"","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"-This- close to being as great as the first two Lego Star Wars games.","reviewText":"Just when I was about to stop caring about popular movie franchises being turned into Lego games, Lego Pirates of the Caribbean comes out, and man does this thing kick booty. I loved the first two Lego Star Wars games, didn't care for Batman much, Harry Potter was decent, and shunned the Indiana Jones titles, and I'm happy to say that they did nearly everything right with Lego Pirates, and it's easily the best Lego game since the Star Wars ones. The Lego games have always been for a younger crowd, presenting the movie's story in a simple, dialogue-less way that's easy to follow and charming, but they're also great co-op titles that really got the whole drop-in/drop-out gameplay mechanic popular. Parents who don't play games can enjoy an hour or two of this with their kids. Even if your significant other doesn't play games often can get a lot of enjoyment out of it! To me, that's the true appeal of the Lego games, but enough about that, I need to tell you why this game's so great.Lego Pirates of the Caribbean covers all 4(!) of the PotC movies in bite-sized installments. Each movie/chapter only takes a few hours on your own or with a partner, but there's a ton of stuff to do in each one. Gameplay is your standard run, jump, attack bad guys, collect things kinda deal, but it's addicting, and many people who get into this game will actually want to collect every Lego stud and see what they unlock, or get enough to buy a favorite character not unlocked through regular gameplay. There are a couple of puzzles thrown in just to keep things interesting, and throughout the stages you'll need to build things to help you advance to the next area. An example being when you fight Barbossa at the end of the first section, he sends out pirates to attack you. After you defeat them, their bones will still be on the ground, and you'll be able to use them to build a platform or something to help you continue through the area. It's a pretty neat feature and I'm glad it's not abused in the game to the point where it ruins the flow. And for parents worrying if skeleton bones being used as construction kits is 'iffy', this game is VERY tame and everything's done in a cute, cartoony way. I've yet to read any negative reviews or press about kids who got the wrong idea from the Lego games. Even an undead monkey screaming got my 4 year old daughter laughing.As I mentioned, there's an ungodly amount of stuff to do. In each stage there'll be a certain amount of Lego studs that you need to collect in order to unlock new items and Gold Bricks. There are also boats you can build by collecting certain items in a level, and once they're complete, you can view them in the port (the main level select-kinda area after the title screen). And in traditional Lego game fashion, there are TONS of characters to unlock...basically any character that had a few seconds of screen time in the movies gets a playable character here, right down to the guard dog. Most of them play the same, but hey, it's fun playing as your favorites, and kids will get a kick out of it (especially when they see the tiny pirate flying back when he shoots a gun). While the main game can be completed in under 10 hours easily, getting everything in the game will take much longer. Very rarely do I buy a game for the original retail price, but this is one I don't have any problem doing so- the Lego games have always had high replay value. A game you can play WITH your kids or spouse for hours and hours? Really, how often do those pop up?But there are a couple of minor things keeping it from getting 5 stars overall, and it's the same problem I had with every other Lego game, even the great first two. Glitches. The first one we encountered was in the third portion of the first stage. You have to roll a barrel over to a slot that it goes in, then run on it to spin a gear that opens a gate. But when we rolled it into the slot, nothing happened, and running on the barrel wasn't doing anything. I had to look up a walkthrough video to see if I somehow missed something, but sure enough, I didn't. I had to exit the area, re-do everything and only then would things be ok. Jack Sparrow's compass skill, which points out key things, was also selective on when it'd work a couple of times. It gets frustrating, but hasn't happened too much. Just keep this in mind if you get the game. The other problems are little nitpicks, like swapping characters quickly being difficult when there are a lot of enemies around, and the split screen feature where the screen shifts around in weird ways, instead of in even halves, to show the action for both players is a bit much...but these don't ruin the game.Visually, this is the best looking Lego game so far, with some pretty impressive settings, and a smooth frame rate for most of the game. No complaints here. The audio's the usual too, with little grunts and gasps making up the dialogue. No bad voice acting here!So if you want a game that your kids can play together or with you, I highly recommend Lego Pirates of the Caribbean. It's easy enough for anyone of any age to play, and has a whole lot of replay value for those who love collecting things. There's nothing too difficult apart from problems caused by glitches, and the cut scenes that tame down climactic moments from the movies are hilarious. I really hope the next big Lego game that uses a movie franchise follows the example of this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2011"}

This thing seems to not hear me very well when there is what it considers to be excess noise. It also hears the TV when it's a problem. For instance: I was watching football the other day, and an Xbox commercial came on...surprise surprise. Well anyway, the xbox commercial, at the end of the commercial, said \"Only found on the Xbox one.\"  Problem? The xbox heard Xbox One, and thought I wanted the one guide. That's problematic to put it lightly.Skype doesn't work nearly as well as I'd like, as I have not been able to find a single way to sort by online skypers...I have to go through this laundry list of people, half of which I don't even know, to find the people I might want to talk to.The TV Guide function is useless, unless of course you are actually watching live TV.

Forza is great, except for the really cheap way they try to steal extra money from your soul by selling easier ways to get further (microtransactions). I have also had the pleasure of playing Powerstar golf which is pretty solid....good golf game, although you can sell your soul to get further there too.The game I haven't liked is Ryse.

The xbox one will NOT charge devices from its' one lonely USB port.These are the things that I think could use improvement:NO DVR Support through Xbox OneGuide: I understand it deals with proprietary software through cable companies, but why can't it control my DVR behavior as well? Why can't my controller walk around the cable box?  That being said, it's so easy once you're in actual tv to use your remote, so it's not like I have to change the HDMI cable.Voice commands don't do so well when TV is on. I guess there is something about the constant noise, but I'm not sure.My cable box has a tendency to disconnect from the xbox, and I need to reset one or the other to get it working...that's disappointing, and until it happens more I won't be really sure whether or not it will pose a long term issue.****UPDATE ON CABLE BOX SIGNAL DYING***I have done extensive research, and found the problem. The problem is that the TV app eventually crashes, which I assume should be expected. However, when you \"restart\" your xbox, remember its' actually still always on. It has to listen to find \"Xbox On\" at all times. So the TV app never has the opportunity to restart itself.There's two ways to fix this problem:1. Turn your console off, then remove the power cord for a few seconds. This is what I do, because I don't want to do #2.2. (not my favorite) Go into settings and turn off low power mode. This will stop you from being able to say \"Xbox On\" which I think is a big time loss of a big time feature.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

I'm happy I got it, this game is very satisfying to play this is a good step-up from Web of Shadows which was nice too.  I gotta point out what makes this game good, you're not just 1 or 2 Spideys you get to play as 4, each with their own unique moveset and purpose.  The Spideys are: 2099 Spidey he's from a hopeful future, seems to have a lot of  aerial levels,  then Noir Spidey  a 1930 version of Spidey who's all about stealthy and sneak attacks, then there's Amazing Spidey good old classic self-explanatory and of course the Black Suit Spidey with the awesome speed, strength and agility.  Each one of these Spideys have their own unique world, purpose and bosses they fight to find the shattered pieces of  the Tablet of Order and Chaos hence the name Shattered Dimensions.  A new feature in this I really like is the 1st person fights, when  you get to certain points in a Boss battle you switch to 1st person for a short period, that was a great idea.  Now for my review STORYLINE definitely better than past Spidey games 5Stars, GAMEPLAY 4 unique Spideys to play as 5Stars, BOSSES 4Stars, GRAPHICS 5Stars.

Together, these two titles laid the foundation for the series and spawned many hit sequels that have now sold over 42 million units worldwide.","reviewerName":"Marc Ruby&#8482; \"The Noh Hare&#8482;\"","summary":"And In the Beginning....","reviewText":"Typical of me, I've been playing the Final Fantasy series backwards, starting with FFX, then FF7-9, and now the two games in cluded in this set, Final Fantasy I and II.  The effect is, that as I move backwards, I get to see the beginnings of the ideas that later come to fruition.  Since this series is noted for the originality of each issue, it is the little common themes, like Chocobos and wizard hats that make the entirety something magical.  And here is where they all began.Of course, Final Fantasy I itself is derivative.  All long time PC and Atari gamers remember the beginnings of Origin Systems' Avater series with starry eyes.  Little characters dancing about a world map, asking questions, falling into dungeons, and saving the world.  When FFI first booted up I had a massive nostagia moment - the structural similarities are unmistakeable.  Even so, FFI is unique in world concept and plot, improving on the formula enough to be an instant success and rescue a game vendor from impending bankruptcy.  While it is primitive in many ways, it started an RPG revolution for the game console world.From a production viewpoint, FFII is head and shoulders above FFI.  The artwork is much more detailed.  To the point that some of the monsters and background scenes are quite remarkable, and several of the characters actually have something that resembles a personality.  The downside of ths is that the world is a bit smaller, and the story a bit shorter - but not in any harmful sense.  While I think the FFI is probably the better game, FFII is really the first clear hint of what was to come as the series developed.  And it helped to create the momentum behind one of the most successful franchises in gaming.What Squaresoft did in repackaging these games is revise the graphic, especially the CGI cut scenes, and rework the music.  In addition several new freatures - a bestiary and a collection of Amano Yoshitaka's original are for the series.  This is one of the best jobs of resurrecting something old and making it as much fun as it was originally that I have ever seen.  For the price, this is one of the best game sets one can buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2003"}

I'll admit that it is not on par with other FPS games on the market.  I'll admit that I'd advise people against buying the game and point them towards renting it instead.  But this is by no means a horrible game.  It is simply an average game in a genre filled with superb titles.The one thing that brings the game down, in my opinion, is the AI.  Enemy AI, even on normal, is stupid.  They tend to stand around and wait to be shot.  Friendly AI for some reason puts your squad on suicide runs in front of your line of fire, blocking your view of the enemy and getting them killed.Other than that one complaint regarding the AI, the game play is about average while the story is above average.  Don't spend $60 at the store or $40 here.  Rent the thing, have some fun over the weekend, and return it when you're done.

As usual i tried it out on both to see which played and looked the best, of course 360 won the demo battle. So i waited a while and got the game used. I was highly impressed with \"some\" of the graphics and the gameplay was stellar. Parts of the game look beautiful, other parts look a little rushed in certain areas, i still don't think during cut scenes the characters look all the great. This is basically like a futuristic version of Drakes Fortune with a great story and sci fi action. In the aspect of climbing its almost exactly like the formentioned game and also in lots of the back drops. The controls and mechanics are fast and responsive and as i said the dialogue is good along with the story, which i usually don't care about anyways. The game is quite easy, almost to easy and its never hard to find out where to go and what your next objective is. I think during the whole game i died about 5 times, thats it. Also for a journey or Odyssey, its a bit short. I didn't time it, but it was a slow snowy day and i don't think it could have been more than maybe 6 hours or so.The game is unique though and i would like to see more games like this in the future, fighting your enemies is a blast, the take downs are a lot like Batman Arkam Asylum, and as i said the gameplay is strong and not to repetitive. So if your looking for a great quick adventure actually with very little replay value and great graphics this game is for you. I really enjoyed it, a lot more than the straight forward bi-linear Castlevania Lord Of Shadows which was less than impressive, other than graphics. With much more repetitious gameplay. So go pic this up at gamestop for about 34 bucks, its worth it, and for what it is, a lot of fun.

If you want something different, then this game is for you.  I mostly play shooters, FPS or 3PS.  I don't care for sports or driving (cars, bikes, skateboards, etc.) games, so HR was a welcome addition to my game collection.  It's really what I consider to be an interactive movie.  It's not an open environment, in fact it's fairly linear, but depending on how you respond in certain situations will dictate how the story unfolds.GraphicsThe facial graphics are just amazing.  The facial close-ups will blow you away, but like what a lot of reviewers have already said, some of the background items look really clunky.  Overall, though, the graphics are amazing.ControlsAwkward.  I haven't felt like throwing my controller in a looooong time, but I did while playing HR.  This is the reason why I only gave it four stars for 'fun'.  You get directional cues that pop up on screen when you walk by something to be examined.  This is when you hit a button or push the stick in a certain direction.  You may have to to turn around and walk by something several times before you can get everything to work just right.Re-playI don't usually re-play too many games and since this is a murder mystery, the re-play value, to me anyway, is nil.SoundGreat.  It really adds to the suspense.StoryGood, but remember, these are game makers that have made an interactive movie, not Spielberg, Tarantino, or Shyamalan that made a game.  It's not perfect, but I still enjoyed it.CameraAlso awkward.  You play the game from a third person point of view.  Sometimes the directional cues that popped up were obscured by objects on the screen.  I knew I had to do something at certain places, but I couldn't see the directional cues clearly when they popped up.  You can change the POV a little, but I like to be able to look all the way around me when I play.  You can really only look in the direction your body is pointing.  If you want to look behind or far to the left or right, you have to actually turn your character around.ContentVery mature.  This is not for the kiddies.

Now I can control my TV and Xbox like a Jedi master!","reviewText":"I never had an HD gaming console and so this is actually our transition period.  We have a Wii, PS2, and other extinct machines by Nintendo and Sega.  My first dilemma is which one to choose between a PS3 and the Xbox 360 with the Kinect.  Frankly, what sold me is the addition of the Kinect controller.  I have seen the natal commercial at the beginning of its development.  Guess what, what made my wife also interested was seeing a lady trying different style and colors of clothes while standing in front of the tube.  Of course, we find out it is not out there yet, but that is a different story.For start, the Xbox seems to have a bigger game catalog than the PS3.  The PS3 on the other hand will let you watch your Netflix HD without having to pay $40-50 a year for an Xbox Live subscription, which kinda  disappointed me.  I can also do my Netflix on the Wii for free (just not HD).  Xbox cannot play Bluray while PS3 can.Doing gestures with your hand to control the game and the TV is awesome.  We have 2 games at this time that use the Kinect, \"Adventures\" and \"Dance Central\".  Lag? You do notice the lag, but for us who don't play competitive video gaming online, it is not a big deal.  We just more like play for fun with the kids.Watching an HD video from Netflix is flawless. I have a wireless configuration using a Cisco-Linksys WRT160N Wireless-N Router.  It start playing HD content probably in about ten seconds and play continuously until the end of the movie.Easy to setup, just plug all the cables and fire it up.  The Kinect camera moved up and down as if scanning the whole floor.  We do not have a very big space too, probably around 10 feet the max, but it worked great.  From time to time in the game, it will tell you to move away a little bit farther and then it is OK.You can do your Facebook and Twitter.  I just don't like the interface that much.  We have not tried video chatting but it is one of the features.  Imagine, you are sitting on your couch and have the other end see you from head to foot, not from a pc but on your widescreen TV.  You cannot surf or browse the internet unless you do some hacking.It only comes with one wireless controller.  It is black and it is a beauty.  It requires 2 double \"AA\" batteries which came in supplied with a couple of coppertop Duracells.  You can turn on/off the Xbox via the remote if you push the main Xbox button in the middle of the controller.For now it only has 4G of on-board memory, but it has a bay to upgrade with a proprietary drive.  You can use you old drive, but you will have to do some hardware tinkering.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001B1W3GG","description":"BioShock is an innovative role-playing shooter from Irrational Games who was named IGN&#8217;s 2005 Developer of the Year. BioShock immerses players into a war-torn underwater utopia, where mankind has abandoned their humanity in their quest for perfection.","reviewerName":"bluehobbes_7","summary":"Bioshock Review","reviewText":"Bioshock is incredible. It was the first game I ever fired up on my shiny new PS3, and I was simply mind-blown. The opening act is one of the most intense, exciting, awe-inspiring, and terrifying experiences I have ever had in a game. And the intensity never lets up - from your first encounter with a Big Daddy to the amazing conclusion, as you play through the game the mysteries of the underwater city of Rapture begin to unravel with incredible twists and turns.What makes Bioshock so outstanding is that it aspires to be more than just another shooter with a generic storyline that serves simply as an excuse for the gameplay. In Bioshock, the gameplay feels incidental to the story, which I find extremely refreshing. The game is all about exploring the city and confronting the many ethical, sociological, and psychological issues raised by many of the characters and the idea of the city of Rapture itself. Evidences of the ideals that formed the basis for the creation of Rapture by founder Andrew Ryan are found everywhere in the city. Signs, banners, advertisements, scrawled messages in blood, public service announcements...everywhere you turn there is something to examine or read that adds to your understanding of the city, and the deeper issues involved. The first banner you see, in that great opening act, reads: \"No Gods. No Kings. Only Man.\" This is the mantra of Andrew Ryan, and his vision for the city of Rapture. Allow Ryan to explain in more detail:\"I am Andrew Ryan, and I'm here to ask you a question. Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? 'No!' says the man in Washington, 'it belongs to the poor.' 'No!' says the man in the Vatican, 'it belongs to God.' 'No!' says the man in Moscow, 'it belongs to everyone.' I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose... Rapture, a city where the artist would not fear the censor, where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality, Where the great would not be constrained by the small! And with the sweat of your brow, Rapture can become your city as well.\"The implications of such a city are certainly frightening, and Bioshock forces you to confront many of those implications. Little Sisters present the most direct confrontation with these implications, as you have to choose to harvest them (giving yourself a better chance of surviving the horrors of the broken city, but killing the Little Sisters in the process), or to rescue them (leaving yourself less powerful but allowing the Litter Sisters to survive). Many of the other issues in Bioshock, along with the Little Sister dilemma, are confronted in the players mind, long after the game has been saved and the console shut down.The presentation and visuals are beautiful (and often disturbing) and strongly immerse the player in the dark, flickering halls of Rapture. The shooting gameplay is very fun, especially with the refreshing strategy and style of play that comes with using plasmids (the special powers your character uses through genetic modification). The story is very well written and dives into very deep issues, many of which are terrifying and difficult to confront - fitting for a game set so deep beneath the ocean surface. I also admire that the story is told without dependence on cutscenes; instead it is told through the information you obtain from your exploration of the city. An amazing game. Now...would you kindly play it?\"We all make choices, but in the end our choices make us.\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001BR95PW","reviewerName":"J. Mendoza","summary":"Great headset","reviewText":"I've been using the headset for the last two days, and so far I like it. It's a good product, but it does have some flaws that keep it from being perfect.I liked:* The audio quality. It's excellent; I've been using this when playing Uncharted 2 multiplayer, and I have no problem hearing my teammates.* Easy to synch. Simply plug in with the USB to the PS3. That's it. No menus, no holding buttons, no waiting for flashing lights.* Mute button. It's the biggest button on the headset, so you can't miss it. Push it once, and the headset is muted. Great for those times when you need to answer a call, or yell at a family member, or do something that the rest of the world does not need to hear.* Easy to charge. Connect any USB cable to it and begin charging. You can also use the stand to charge it, but I couldn't. Details are further down.* Simple on-screen display. Once paired, the PS3 will show you batter life, just like with the wireless controllers, and if the mic is muted or not with a simple press of a button.I did not like:* Constant beeping when the headset is muted. When playing, if you mute the headset, you will hear a beep every 30 seconds or so, I guess to remind you that it's muted. It's a little annoying.* That after a while, about 40 minutes or so using it, the headset becomes uncomfortable. You can switch the clip and put it in your other ear, which is why this isn't a major flaw, but for some people it might just be.* The little rubber cover for the USB connection on the headset is a bit difficult to move. This is just a personal gripe, but it's something that I just didn't like.* The charging stand. I don't know if I'm missing something simple or what, but I cannot connect the headset to the stand at all. Inside the stand is a little connector that goes inside the headset so it can charge, but again, I don't know if mine is defective or what, but it will not connect. I tried pushing it, sliding it around, but nothing. The headset will not go in. I have no plans on using this as a desktop microphone, and I can simply connect a USB cable directly to the headset to charge, so really the stand would have been useless for me anyway, but still.So there it is. $40 or so for a headset is not bad. Sure, you can buy cheaper bluetooth headsets anywhere, but if you need it to play online, than this is the best option for it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2009"}

Jump down the rabbithole to recover all the eggs stolen from Dragon World by the evil sorceressand her henchmen.

There are over 30 levels in which to recover 150 eggs andseveral minigames that complement the standard gameplay, includingboxing and skateboarding.","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"a surprising disappointment","reviewText":"Many people believe the third time is officially the charm.  When a game finally gets everything right as far as gameplay, graphics and music go and delivers the ultimate experience. Other times game developers disregard the things that were most enjoyable the first couple times to put more emphasis on other areas of the game (in this case, the fantastic bonus stages).Why so many people believe Year of the Dragon is the ultimate Spyro game is a total mystery to me. I believe something went wrong with the level design because several of the stages are flat out boring. Maybe Insomniac was under the impression during the creation of this game \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" or maybe people are confusing the fact you have a bunch of playable characters besides Spyro as something of an additional bonus to enhance the gameplay, but I have to disagree strongly.  These extra playable characters definitely aren't enough to put this game over the top I'm afraid.  Nice additions perhaps, but nothing spectacular.No, it's not an example of me getting tired of Spyro either. I've played the first two Spyro games quite a lot. I must have completed the first one at least 20 times, and Ripto's Rage 10 times. I'd play through them again right now if I could.There were some minor flaws with the first two games, but they honestly didn't mean anything to me. Certainly nothing to distract from the incredible gameplay and graphics that were so revolutionary in the development of 3D gaming at the time. I now feel a bit guilty for complaining that the very end of Zephyr seems boring to me because comparing that little area near the end of Zephyr to many of the areas in THIS game... let's just say, I had *nothing* to complain about.To me, the most exciting kind of 3D platformers are the ones that are positively LOADED with tons of little things to collect such as what the first two Spyro games delievered. You know, things like colorful gems scattered around the stages, a nice variety of enemies to take out, little things such as trees and grass included into most areas of every stage with special care and consideration for detail.  Adding these minor details actually make the graphics and gameplay better because they leave a lasting impression.Year of the Dragon feels flat in comparison. To say I'm a little disappointed would be an understatement. I'm *very* disappointed.After all the hype that Spyro's third installment is supposed to be the *ultimate* Spyro adventure by the majority of the gaming community, I was expecting to be blown away completely by this one. I was expecting this game to blow away the previous two by leaps and bounds. Instead, many of the stages are quite ordinary and bland in Spyro 3, and to be totally honest, many of them feel exactly the same, or have that \"been there, done that\" feeling.  Year of the Dragon is quite similar to Ripto's Rage as far as atmosphere goes, but feels inferior most of the time for reasons that could have been avoided had Insomniac worked harder on making the levels better.  Insomniac instead gave us a game that does nothing truly noteworthy to separate itself from Ripto's Rage.It's disappointing. Rushing through large areas of empty land *just* to finally come across a few scattered gems here and there, or enemies spaced out in such a way that it takes a while to arrive to them... these are the kind of things I dislike about most 3D games.Spyro the Dragon and Ripto's Rage avoided most of these boring problems since both of those games did just about everything right. In these two games, traveling your way through the many stages was always exciting because there was a ton of things to collect or destroy along the way (with detailed areas around every corner).  Not to mention when you entered a level covered with water or ice in the previous two Spyro adventures, it actually FELT like a water or ice stage.If it takes me several seconds just to ARRIVE to something while playing Year of the Dragon, that tells me the gameplay is a bit on the boring side. Year of the Dragon falls victim to this I'm afraid, on more occasions than I was hoping for. Many times you will run up and down hills, platforms, and other areas and come across *nothing* the entire time. This is a problem to me because this kind of thing didn't happen very often in the first two games.  There was always something to do in the first two games no matter WHERE you turned.When the levels felt boring in the beginning of Year of the Dragon, I just thought the game was leading me gradually to more impressive levels. But once arriving to world 3 and STILL feeling bored and disappointed, I realized the level design was just below typical Spyro standards this time around.  Not to mention all the home worlds are so ordinary they become boring almost instantly.Do I still like this game more than most video games I've played? Absolutely. It's STILL Spyro, you're STILL going around collecting gems and dragons, you're STILL having fun controlling Spyro's movements and taking advantage of his fun abilities, but I don't know... I get the feeling Insomniac didn't put as much care into this one that they did with the first two games (which are both classics in my opinion). The game DOES have a few interesting stages on the same level as the ones in the previous two Spyro games but there's a bunch of average ones along the way.Besides Insomniac not bothering to make the levels impressive or particularly fun, there's a couple other problems.The object is to go around rescuing baby dragons (many of which require the player to attempt something harder than usual in order to achieve).  However you get the feeling you're just repeating what's already been done in the very first Spyro game when, if you recall, the dragons would actually talk to you after you've freed them and say funny things. The dragons in this game are babies and they don't talk, and it's not nearly as much fun freeing dragons this time around.This isn't a BIG complaint, but a mild disappointment and a nagging feeling that all I'm doing is the same thing I've done before, but much better the first time.The baby dragons ARE cute, and they sometimes do funny things after they've been freed such as spin around, scratch behind their ears, and basically do things puppies and kittens do. If you're an animal lover like me, you'll fall in love with the way the baby dragons act. It's adorable and a nice touch.I don't know if most people noticed, but most of the bonus games consist of constant shooting.  Shooting, shooting, and well, MORE shooting.  One bonus level even morphs the gameplay into a first person shooter similar to Quake as you go around eliminating enemies. Of course this particular one gets quite repetitive after you've blown through a few rooms, and it's not very exciting because it's overlong, but some of the shooting action you come across in the game is quite good (such as blasting away that machine shark in that one game- I love this one). Plentiful shooting throughout Year of the Dragon such as shooting fireballs, cannons, and other things that first appeared in Ripto's Rage, but usually they are pretty memorable so I won't complain about this.Some of the bonus stages are quite difficult too, such as the boxing one. Just like real boxing- when you throw a punch, your opponent either immediately throws a punch of his own or blocks to defend himself. This makes these boxing games incredibly hard, and perhaps the hardest thing you will discover in the first three Spyro games from the Playstation's first console... but at least it's *fun*.The skateboarding bonus games are AWESOME. They appear more than once throughout the game, and they deliver a lot of excitement. I'm surprised how much detail went into the skateboarding games as far as the approach you take with the skateboard itself. Not *quite* at the level of detail that Tony Hawk provides or anything, but enough tricks to make skateboarding fun and something you wouldn't mind mastering with time and patience. The biggest highlight of the game easily.Another highlight are the special characters you play as-One of them is a kangaroo, probably the best one since he jumps high and has a kick move that's devastating. You have another playable character that's a beastly creature and he has a big club going around pounding things. It's fun, but he moves slow and he's not particularly interesting. There's some kind of monkey that shoots with his little outer space-looking gun. This is somewhat fun, but like I said above, the game REALLY goes too far with the constant shooting you'll be doing throughout the game. The Sparx games are fun because the gameplay turns into old school Gradius gameplay for each of his levels. It's an interesting change of direction (and not NEARLY as frustrating as trying to master Gradius, thankfully).I HATE playing as the bird though. He flies awkwardly, he's very very boring to play as, and his stages and challenges are just uninteresting to me.To be completely honest though, I'd rather play as Spyro the entire time if given the choice, but these characters are decent enough overall.The boss fight at the very end of the game is fun, but the boss is WAY too similar to Ripto with the whole arena showdown battle, and compared to that epic battle this one is over much sooner, and not nearly as memorable. Boss fights overall are a notch up as far as difficulty goes however.Most of the music in the game is good but nothing compares to the original Spyro (including Ripto's Rage).Some of the voice acting is questionable. For whatever reason Moneybags doesn't sound nearly as conniving as he does in Ripto's Rage. His voice definitely sounds different. Whoever thought it was a good idea for Sparx to talk needs a spanking, enough said.Overall this game is NOT a classic which is unfortunate because Insomniac nailed the first two games right on the head and made two classic (and original) platformers. Year of the Dragon misses the mark and unfortunately can't be put on the same brilliant scale. Why so many people claim Year of the Dragon is the best in the series is a mystery to me because even though the levels are longer, they clearly aren't better or more fun.  But Year of the Dragon does succeed in the bonus games above everything else.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2009"}

{"product_name":"B003O6EB70","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"Lackluster experience made worse by all the hype","reviewText":"Bioshock Infinite is a first person shooter with very light upgrade style RPG elements that tells a story set in a troubled cloud city existing in a semi-steampunk alternative 1912.  You play a mysterious character set upon a seemingly simple task by a faceless benefactor.This game has all the same basic game play elements that Bioshock/Bioshock 2 had, but arranged in a different way.  The makers clearly wanted to change the face of the game, and in doing so created some awkward differences -- but the game is still fundamentally the same.  The biggest difference between Infinite and the other two is the setting, and I think that is this game's biggest failure.  The bright open environment does not do the game play justice.  What was once creepy and claustrophobic is now run of the mill and unsurprising.  To me the environment and world simply didn't have the character that Rapture did.  This also goes for the enemies.  The enemies in Bioshock Infinite are indistinct and seemingly come in three different flavors:  Small, medium, and large.  Other than that, there's no real difference.  Another result of the change in environment is the distance that combat takes place at -- too far, in my opinion, to be anything but a poorly executed shooter.  Lots of long ball or arena-style combat scenarios are presented.  Very obvious, very Serious Sam, very disappointing.The sky-line/sky-hook stuff, while novel in the early part of the game, becomes a very obtuse dynamic that you are forced to contend with later on.  It, unfortunately, compounds the arena style shooting gallery issues.  In some cases it isn't entirely necessary, but in other cases it is vital to the \"scene\". I never found that it added, in a positive manner, to any part of the game.  It was more of something that was forced upon me, something that I had to work around.  It could have been left out of the game and the game wouldn't have been diminished in the slightest.I have often overlooked or looked past game play issues if the story is captivating or interesting.  Not the case here.  I won't go into any specifics because I don't want to spoil anything, but the story was not interesting.  I don't know where all these high praises for the story come from.  The story is bland, the characters uninteresting, and I never felt part of the world or invested in it.  The game was just a series of shooting galleries.  The female character lead, while cute, is full of contradictions and inconsistent motivations.  Your character is equally as flippant -- one minute a cut throat mercenary, the next a bleeding heart activist.  If disjointed time streams and nonsensical surprise endings are your thing, you might enjoy it.  For me I found the story without merit.  The story just wasn't good.Lastly, I've got to complain about the end game.  The final stage, the very ending portion of the game, is hackneyed garbage.  An overly long action sequence, defending a destructible target, with a time limit, and waves and waves of enemies.  I'm not necessarily a fan of the Big Boss Battle dynamic, but I understand it.  This was just plain abusive.  Imagine playing through ten or more minutes of a hectic frantic mess to fail at the end, only to have to replay the entire thing again.All in all, the game was very meh.  To say it was \"OK\", to me, best sums it up.  If the game hadn't been so overly hyped, and hadn't been connected to Bioshock I may not have felt so let down and disappointed by it.  My feelings on the game aren't centered around the fact that it is different than the previous installments.  My concerns lay with the specifics of the game, the execution, and the total effect of all of the changes -- but not the fact that there were changes, in and of themselves.  I was very excited about this game, I thought there was no way it would let me down...  it did.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2013"}

Compared to the other release titles for the XBox 360, this one seemed relatively light and friendly.The game is a traditional action-adventure game. In this case, there is hardly any plot line. You're a female shape-shifter whose family is held hostage by your jealous older sister. You have to work your way through level after level of enemies to save them.In essence it's the classic problem of which shape fits best to which situation. Sometimes you need the ice crystal powers of Chilla, a big Yeti creature. Sometimes you need the sneak-underground powers of Pummel Weed, a plant creature. Maybe it's the rolling ball type abilities of Major Ruin that fit the need. The further you go in the game, the more creatures you can turn into.This ends up being a complex set of puzzles. You have to roll and launch yourself into the air, but then turn into a Yeti mid-air to grab onto the wall. You have to flip up the enemies as the plant, but you do better pummelling them as something more powerful.The game is cartooney, but the graphics are rather quite nice. The little flaming guys are much different in texture from the rock monsters, and the world around you has a different appearance depending on what realm you're in. We're not talking high quality modern photo-realism here, but the world is nicely rendered in its kid-like fantasy way.The game is teen rated, so this is one of the few games that you can really feel comfortable buying for a younger gamer on the XBox 360. Most of the other games invole lots of blood, lots of swearing, or both. I honestly am not sure why they called this a Teen. Yes, you're killing enemies, but heck, they're all trolls. The elves clearly should win :)The soundtrack is pretty nice, a smooth, classic style track that sings along in the background. It doesn't stand out, but it doesn't get in the way either.I'm normally a fantasy / puzzle fan, but this one seemed just a little too \"standard\" to really catch my attention. No plot, no real connection with the characters and no real development. I didn't feel a great need to \"keep playing\" any time that I put the game down. That's the only reason I gave it only 4/5.Recommended if you're into action puzzlers or have a younger gamer in the house that isn't quite ready for the raw gore of a mature title.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2005"}

Roman","summary":"More of the same, for the 4th time.","reviewText":"I was lucky enough to get the first Katamari game for the ps2 when it first came out, and experience it before seemingly everyone got Katamari fever. The game was completely original, fun, had an excellent soundtrack, and I place it in my top 10 ps2 games. It got a sequel fairly quickly, and then another one on the PSP a few years later. I enjoyed the PSP game a bit, though was a bit curious as to why so many levels from the first game (and apparently the second, though I never got to play it all the way through) were in there. Now with Katamari Forever, I can see that the developers don't know what to do with this franchise, and it's easy to see why the creator has moved on to other things- this is more of the same.If you haven't played a Katamari game before, then you'll probably really enjoy this game, and can add another star to the rating. You play as the Prince, a little green guy who rolls around a Bumble Ball-looking object called a Katamari. You roll it around rooms, streets, towns, and over the entire world eventually, collecting everything in your path. Your Katamari will start out small, but can grow to be thousands of kilometers in size! An example being that you start out in someone's messy bedroom, but after you collect enough, you'll be big enough to pick up cars and people outside, and after that, you'll be picking up islands, boats and entire countries. When done in a level, your Katamari is used to create an object in space like a star, satellite or planet. It's totally fun, and somehow relaxing, though there are a few problems I'll get into in a bit. You control the Prince/Katamari with both analog sticks- if you want to move forward, you tilt both up, etc. You're collecting objects this time because your dad, the King of all Cosmos has lost his memory, and to have someone in his place temporarily, the Prince and his cousins made a robot king, but he's going a bit crazy. You'll be rolling up in levels for both the King and the RoboKing.And here's where my problems kick in- the King's levels start out in black and white, which is cool because as you pick up more, the world comes into color, showing that he's regaining his memory. But from what I could tell, all of these levels are from the previous games. While that makes some sense because they're things that happened in the past, I see it as the developers just being cheap and not wanting to put time into creating original levels. There were many times when I thought to myself \"hey, I played this in 2005\". Again, if you haven't played the games before, it'll be no big deal, but for myself- some of these levels are making their appearance for the 5th time now (twice on the ps2, once on the PSP and maybe once on the Xbox360's game). Next, the camera is still just as bad as it was in the old games. Sometimes you'll get in front of a wall and the camera won't zoom in more, or do the nice x-ray thing it does every now and then, and you'll be trying to get your way around whatever it is you may be stuck on. There's also a lot of slowdown in some levels, which stuck me as odd considering how powerful the ps3 is, and how light this game is in the graphics department. If games like SoulCalibur 4 and Dead Space can play smoothly, why is Katamari Forever getting such bad slowdown here and there? Finally, get this- remember all the great songs from the first game? The same songs that got remixed and put in all the sequels? They've been remixed again and make up most of the soundtrack! Granted, 2 or 3 of the remixes are good, but once more, can we get something new PLEASE??There are a few new things thrown in, but nothing too big. The Prince can now jump(!) with the Katamari if you press R2 or shake the controller. You're better off with R2 because everyone I know can never pull it off by shaking, and it's not the controller's fault either. This jump is useful but still has some control issues. There's also a multiplayer option- you can battle another player on the same console and try to roll up more objects than them or get a certain item before they do and hold it until time's up. Or you can play cooperatively and complete a level together...using the same Katamari. This is pretty clever but requires a lot of communication since one person controls the left side and the other controls the right. There are also a lot of Trophies you can get here to keep you busy, though a few require more patience than skill. And finally, I have to give them some credit for having a level where you roll around a sumo instead of a Katamari, and collect food to make him bigger in order to challenge another sumo. I can play that level at any time and still smile seeing this giant sumo rolling around with dogs and bikes stuck to it.Don't get me wrong- I enjoyed playing this game, and I can't stress it enough when I say that if you've never played a game in the series before, the score gets an extra star. But after 5+ years, the series should be making progress- not be stuck with the same levels with a story of amnesia to be used as a cheap excuse for it. And at that price? Ouch. Either until it drops, or borrow it and then see how you like it. You'd think that with it being so close to the previous games, it could've stayed at their price points when they first came out too.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2010"}

Most FPS stories (MW, MH, etc...) are just completely laughable. SOTL's story has a lot of flaws, but it definitely breaks the mold for FPS storylines.Combat: General pacing, battlefield layouts, and the feeling of constantly running out of ammo are both pretty cool. Enemy AI was more than good enough for me. I like it that they work as a team to try to suppress and flank you.Multiplayer: Co-op is really good. I like the maps and the missions.[Bad]Teammates: Your teammates can be morons. One of the things I really really liked about the Rainbow Six Vegas series is that you can order where your teammates position themselves, to follow you, to stay, and so on. It makes fighting just really awesome being able to have a good setup, even though Rainbow Six Vegas storylines were really stupid. For SOTL, your teammates are just independent idiots. They feel like props, nothing more and nothing less. It rarely feels like they help out. After the 1st of half the game, it feels like you have to go and rescue them for their stupid decisions. What makes things worse is that you're the lead officer and they just don't care about waiting for orders. To me this is what made SOTL a mediocre game even though it was close to being a good game. If only you could order your teammates more than just designating a target (which isn't ideal during heavy gun fights).Stealth: At various points the game hints that you can play it stealthily. I'm not sure it's even possible without a lot of luck. This is just stupid.Story: Even though it is better than normal, there are just too many holes and things that don't make sense; even after you get to the end. I didn't really care for it. Yes I've seen all the endings and I got all the intel.Limited Choice: I really hate games that pretend to give you choices that change the game world, when it's still on the rails of predestination. Either give players full choice or just take it away for the narrative you want to present. Half way is never good.Multiplayer: No one is playing multiplayer.[Misc]Graphics: While not bad, they didn't really stand out for me even on the PC.[Verdict]If you really want this game, get it on sale. It's not bad, but it's not good either (but so close).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2013"}

I am sure there will be a lot of patches in the upcoming future to fix a lot of bugs to get the multiplayer running smoothly as MW2 and to Activision/Infinity Wards best interest to release Map Packs Old(MW1&2) and New(Bigger and Better Maps).Specs Ops mode is a great improvment over MW2.  With being able to play with others online against the game especially in Survival Mode makes the experience a lot better then just finishing missions and moving on to the next.  Missions in MW3 are better in my opinion than MW2.MORE GUNS, OPTICS, and EQUIPMENT is a Definate PLUS.The story is just a continuation of MW2 (still playing through) and the graphics look just as good as MW2.  A lot of people comlpain about this but the graphics are as good as it gets and there is not much that can be improved until next generation consoles are released and thats if they surpass 1080p (the Game itself and the Console).

Lohrke","summary":"i've actually completed the campaign.","reviewText":"unlike a lot of reviewers who have only completed 4-6 missions and wanted to get their reviews up (i don't really blame them, but how can you review a product you've not finished?), i have completed GRFS almost twice now.  my first play through took 12-13 hours, with several restarted checkpoints.  if you're an FPS pro, you'll probably complete it under 10.  if you like to take your time and plan (and try to complete specific challenges), count on an even dozen or more.this is my first experience with a ghost recon game and i have to say that i'm very impressed.  in an age where most shooters keep you on the rails and have you kill endless waves of enemies, GRFS is indeed a breath of fresh air.  this isn't a monster-in-the-closet shooter.  it takes time, patience (i admit to more than few expletives while playing), and lo and behold, strategy.as with most shooters, plot is secondary.  there are some bad russians.  weapons caches.  coups. yadda yadda yadda.  we all know the drill.  thankfully, GRFS has enough going for it that you don't really need an intricate plot to have fun.  the set pieces are varied and dynamic - africa, russia, bolivia, pakistan, etc.  the graphics look pretty good - somewhere between COD (dated) and BF3 (impressive).  i was particularly impressed with the lighting and color during the last few missions.  the artists did a fine job. i have a 3D TV and found the 3D to just be ok.  nothing special.  it didn't really add much to the game, to tell you the truth (batman: arkham city still has the best 3D, in my opinion). the sound, too, is pretty good.  not BF3 good, but close enough.  the controls are responsive, but a bit fidgity.  several times i accidentally vaulted over cover and got my head handed to me.speaking of having your head handed to you, you will die. a lot.  if you're not careful, it doesn't take more than two or three bullets to take you down. sometimes another ghost (30k, Ghost Lead, Pepper) will come and revive you, but sometimes they won't.  depends on the situation. the AI can be dumb at times, but they're also nutty accurate. they will also suppress you with heavy MGs and LMGs. stay in cover! always!the challenges give you a reason to replay the game.  each mission has a weapon challenge (kill x amount of guys with x gun),  a tactical challenge (make to checkpoint a and exfil without raising the alarm) and a ghost challenge (finish with a ghost score above 60 - i have no clue how the ghost score is tallied, but hey).  on your first play through, you simply won't be able to complete some of the challenges because the gun you may need won't be available to you or two tactical challenges will contradict each other and you'll have to pick one of the two, or three.the highly touted gunsmith is pretty cool.  sure, you have twenty million combinations at your disposal, but you'll probably find two or three guns you like best and stick with them.  GRFS also has a gun range for you test out your creations (i've been wondering why COD or BF haven't been doing that for ages).the multiplayer is OK.  i played a couple of matches and didn't really find it all that compelling.  it's kind of like uncharted's multiplayer, only with fancier guns and camo.  guerrilla mode is pretty challenging.  i tried it alone and lasted a round and a half.  i'd like to try it with more people, but i don't know anyone else who has this game.there's also subtle and not-so-subtle humor.  towards the end of the game the ghost squad's gotta huff it up 15 flights of stairs to deal with some snipers.  as they're ascending a flight of stairs, one of the ghosts says, \"why do i feel like someone should be throwing barrels down at us\" (donkey kong reference, i assume); in a cut scene you see a solder bragging about how he sniped a pilot out of a helicopter (obviously reference to BFBC2 bush wookies who think they're the hot shiz); and another time there's a veiled reference to russian strongman vladamir putin when the ghosts ask the russian president about a time who wrestled a grizzly bear to the ground.  i'm not sure most people will catch the humor, but it's there.all in all, i really had a great time playing GRFS.  i'm already looking forward to another installment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Supreme Warrior","summary":"This is one of the best video games released in a long time for any console!!!","reviewText":"This game may very well get the best overall video game of the year award. Out of all the games that I have played, I have never seen such positive and excellent ratings than what this game received, and this game diserved every bit of the compliments that it received. First of all this game is much better than the first Uncharted and that was a great game. Up until now Infamous was my favorite PS exclusive game but I may have to change that. What makes this game so great is that it has absolutely no flaws and it offers everything that gamers want to see in a game like this. The plot and story is on the level of a big budget Hollywood action blockbuster, in some cases even surpassing it. The cinematics, graphics, action, special effects, plot, acting, gameplay are all 10 out of 10. It has several different locales and environments. You start out in an Istanbul musuem with some sections showing a great view of the city. On Nathans journeys to find Shangrila he also goes to a swamp, tropical jungle, urban city which is a war zone, warehouses, tombs, a high action train battle which would be perfect for any Hollywood action movie, snowy wasteland in the Himalayan Mountains, and of course beautiful Shangrila. The high mountain top view on some of these locales is absolutely breathtaking like on the top of a Borneo mountain overlooking the coast or high in the Himalayans. Deep in the Himalayan Mountains, you meet a guide name Tenzin. He speaks in the language of the locals and there are no subtitles at the bottom of the screen to translate what he is saying. The lack of subtitles for Tenzin is probably the only downside in this game. If this game were completely converted into a movie it would put movies like Indiana Jones to shame. The amount of weapons in the game and their different effects makes the gameplay very deep. One thing that was not in the first Uncharted that I really like is, if you beat the game, you can buy the cheats and play with them your second time around, creating a whole new type of gameplay experience. In the first one you had to collect so many treasures in order to even get the cheats. Anybody can pick up and play this game with ease on the normal level but it is still very challenging for experienced players. A novice can easily learn to get better at the game thanks to the ingame tutorials. Even if the game gets too hard for you, you always have the option to change the difficulty setting even in the middle of the game. Overall this is one of the best PS3 games available. There is definitely going to be a third Uncharted game and from the looks of the reviews, it will probably be the most anticipated video game sequel in the next two to three years.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2009"}
{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Bradford \"scottfbradford\"","summary":"Fun quickly wears off","reviewText":"I was lucky enough to get a Wii at launch.  I'd read the previews and was very excited to try out the new controller.  I thought its potential was unlimited and I didn't care that it lacked high-def graphics.  Boy was I wrong.Wii Sports was fun at first, particularly bowling and tennis.  Even my wife played and she never plays video games.  Friends came over and worked up a sweat.  I finished Red Steel and I actually liked it a bit better than Call of Duty 3 on the Xbox 360.  All was good.  Then I played Zelda, which was one of the most overhyped games ever.  I found it to be a boring kiddie game.  Then I tried Super Swing Golf.  Another disappointment.  Next was Excite Truck and while a decent and fun game at first, it too got boring real fast.I checked Gamespot for upcoming games and there are no decent ones on the horizon.  I'm not a Mario fan and I'll get any cross platform games on the 360 because graphics do matter.  I know a lot of casual gamers say its about the gameplay, but the graphics are a big part of that.  Who wants to look at the Wii's blurry 480p (if you have the component cable) on their 50\" HDTV?  Plus the Wii's controller has so far been clunky at best, which ruins gameplay.I guess I should have learned my lesson after owning the Gamecube.  Nintendo does not make the kind of games I like anymore.  I'm really torn by this since I loved my Super Nintendo and Resident Evil 4 on the Gamecube was the best game of the last generation (unfortunately that was the only game I played on the Cube).  But I like shooters and the Xbox 360 has plenty of good ones.  Also its controller feels perfect for them.  How are you going to use a scope with the Wii controller?I know the Wii is selling well at the moment.  But I think that is largely due to its low price and new controller that have attracted a lot of casual gamers with short attention spans.  They will not buy a lot of games (quite frankly Wii Sports is enough for most) and will go on to the next fad.  It looks like Nintendo has left the serious gamers to Sony and Microsoft in favor of the children's market.  But at [...]each, how many games are parents going to buy for their kids?  Ultimately I think the software attach rates to the Wii will be alarmingly low.  This is not the disaster it would be for Sony and Microsoft since, unlike them, Nintendo sells their console at a profit.  But its does not bode well for game selection and the overall health of the Wii, which may end up continuing the downward trend of the Gamecube.  Nintendo's disdain for graphics is  perfect for portable games and perhaps they should focus on their successful DS Lite.Any adult who is considering getting the Wii should reconsider what kind of games you want to play.  For me the Wii was a complete disappointment while the Xbox 360 has been a great platform.  I couldn't get my Wii on Ebay fast enough.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2007"}
{"product_name":"B001CMJAP6","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"A Great Concept Flawed Beyond Redemption","reviewText":"It's like Square and Microsoft brainstormed every possible way to ruin a strategy game and still have it be sorta fun.Concept:  9/10The Last Remnant is turn based strategy game set in a fantasy universe created by the masterminds who created Final Fantasy.  You play as a young adult named Rush.  Rush's sister has been kidnapped by villains that want to use her innate magical abilities to take over the world.You can access areas through a World Map.  There are towns where you buy weapons and equipment, or even craft your own.  There are also dungeons and battlefields where you fight enemy Squads and Bosses.You advance through the game by fighting turn-based Battles.You hire Warriors, Mages, and Leaders and form them into several Squads.The number of Units in a Squad = the number of attacks that Squad gets per round.  (Each Unit attacks per turn.)The Squad's HP is the combination of the Units' HP.  As long as the HP is above 0, ALL of the Units in that Squad can keep attacking.  If the Squad's HP = 0, all of the Units in the Squad die at the same time.You can issue commands to the Squads during the battle, like \"Charge\", \"Heal\", \"Attack with Magic\"...After the Battle, all of your Units are resurrected and improve based upon what they did during the battle.In a Battle, you cannot retreat, and if you lose, you must return to your last Save.Sounds Awesome... now here comes an avalanche of flaws that ruin the game.Technical Art:  1/10Square licensed an old version of Unreal before it had streaming.  As a result, there are Load Screens everywhere!  The game also is hindered by the most slowdown that I've seen since Aladdin fought Jafar on the SEGA Genesis.  Textures and Bump-Maps constantly pop in and out whenever characters or scenes are rendered.  It's incredibly distracting and makes your Xbox 360 feel like a PC with a 9 year old graphics card.  However, you can avoid most of these bugs, by installing the game on your 360 Hard Drive and playing it from there.Gameplay:  2/10During Battles, when you give orders to your Squads, you only get a few options per turn.  These options seem completely random.  There are many times when a Squad is at Full Health and you get an option to Heal them.  However, when a Squad is low on HP, sometimes the Heal Option doesn't show up, causing you to lose a battle.  There are other times when you fight an enemy and you're thinking, \"My Poison Gas Attack is perfect for this.\"  But it doesn't show up in your Command List.  Whoever thought of taking the Player's Options away in a Turn Based Battle Game was a good idea, is clearly insane.  Too often, you are forced to make bad decisions because the options you want just aren't available when you need them most.Even when you do get the commands that you want, sometimes the characters \"REASSESS\" and ignore your commands and do something different.  If your Squad's Leader gets KO'ed with a spell, it's called a BOTCH and the AI takes control of that Squad.It feels like the game is doing everything possible to take control away from you in a game where the fun is supposed to come from you commanding your army.  As long as the AI is good, this usually isn't too much of a problem...AI: 3/10At times Allied Squads join you.  You cannot give them commands and they act on their own.  Sometimes, they attack enemies for 20 points of damage instead of healing one of your Squads, restoring 2000 HP!  The AI is so bad, you'd swear that Leroy Jenkins hacked into your 360 through your live account and he's controlling the Allies.BOSSES:  2/10Because of the AI and Gameplay issues, the Bosses feel incredibly cheap.  Also, all of their Health Bars show up as ???.  You have no idea how many HP they have.  When they are close to death, their Health Bar flashes red, but that's the only hint that you get.  Bosses attack hard enough to take out an Entire Squad, or Charm them and make them fight on their side.  If you have 3 Squads, and the Boss decides to Charm all 3, you lose!  There are times when you don't get the commands that you need to win the battle at the times you need them, causing you to die.QUESTS:  4/10Most of the Quests are of the dungeon crawl variety.  You gain access to a dungeon and fight to an objective with an AI companion.  Most of them are ok, and some are horrible.  One Quest in particular has you running through a barren desert for 12 minutes, touching posts.  The only way to Identify them is to touch them and if you touch the wrong one in the wrong order, you have to start over.  It's got all of the excitement of your Gym Coach making you run 3 miles in real time.ART: 5/10Slowdown aside, the art is very dull.  The lighting is very dark throughout the game and colored lighting is pretty non-existent.  Everything looks dull and drab, like you're watching the game through a dirty window.  The Character Designs are interesting, but lack the Style found in the Final Fantasy series.  Another issue arises when your army fights another humanoid army.  The characters in the battle look nearly identical, so it is really difficult to tell who is who.  When you see a guy swing an axe at an identical guy and a 1000 appears above the injured character, you don't know whether to cheer or panic.WRITING: 3/10If you're looking for an epic script, look elsewhere.  The dialogue in this game is as epic as 2 third graders talking about their lunchables.  The lines are delivered like the actors are in a breakfast cereal commercial where the first 5 ingredients are Sugar.Rush's Battlecry, \"YEAH, Everybody is getting HYPED!\"  He says stuff like, \"Yo Dave, whassup?\"  \"Yeah, No Prob. Whatever...\"Another annoyance is that the team reversed the Critial Hit Dialogue, so when your characters critical hit the enemy, they say what they would have said if they had gotten critically hit.  If you do 5000 damage to an enemy, your character is likely to grumble, \"Aww shucks.\"BROMANCE:  0_o /10Homophobes beware.  The first major NPC that you speak to is an aging bartender at the Tavern.  He calls you \"Cutey\" and hits on you.  In all fairness, your character is feminine and he's wearing leather chaps as a fashion statement.  Later on, Rush meets Dave, a flamboyant magistrate, and they get along better than any other two characters in the game.  In one scene Dave gives Rush a flower and they gaze into each other's eyes.  Normally, Rush replies with a nonchalant \"whatever\" to the other NPC's but if Dave says something, Rush says, \"Aww, I can't say no to you.\"  If the enemy surrounds you, they can attack with a \"REAR ASSAULT\" and Rush says, \"They caught us with our pants down!\"  So, after a while, the game starts to feel like Brokeback Kingdom.ECONOMY:  1/10Rush is the only character that you can equip, and it seems like once you buy a decent sword, there's no reason to get another one until Disk 2.  The game has a crafting system, where you can make things for Rush, but the parts are so rare, it's not even worth searching for them.  Also, 90% of the items that you can create are the same as items that you can buy.  Your NPC's equip themselves and manage their own gear.  Sometimes, they'll ask you for something in the inventory and you have the right to refuse.  But if you refuse, the NPC just becomes less effective.The Game is Rated M for Blood, Language, Violence and Suggestive Themes (between males)Overall, the game is at least 50 hours long full of Quests and Side Quests.  At times, the game is fun and the cutscenes are pretty good.  Your Characters do improve after almost every battle, so it does feel rewarding.  It's a semi-decent way to kill time in small doses.  But, the lack of control that you have over your army is incredibly frustrating and the homosexual undertones as well as the juvenile dialogue can get on your nerves.If you're dying for a turn based strategy game for the 360, and don't mind playing it from your hard drive... and all of the stuff I just wrote about doesn't bother you... Buy this game.Avoid this game if you hate Slowdown, Bromances, Bad Art, Load Screens, Dull Quests, Awful Dialogue, or if you actually want to control your soldiers in a strategy game.Note:  There is also a bug that prevents you from getting 200 Achievement Points when you finish the game.If the flaws that I mentioned above are just too much, but you still want a strategy game, check out the Fire Emblem series for the Nintendo Systems, the Total War series for the PC, or King's Bounty for the PC.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2009"}

Xbox 360 is more expensive than PS3 if you want to have wireless internet access and HD DVD.Getting 1 Game and Two movies free instantly plus 5 movies free by mail, also helped. I wanted a system that would also let me enjoy my HDTV to it's highest potential. I have a 720p but once the PS3 detected the TV it showed its highest resolution is 1080i.

It is offered by SF Planet. I ordered it on Friday night and by Wednesday I had it in my mail box. It costs overWhat I Like* Integrated Hi Fi -If I had read the manual might have taken me less, still took me about 20 minutes to set it up with my wireless network.* BD Player- Movies look much better even compared to DVD's in 480p. Main reason to get it* Hi definition gaming- You can still get the 80 GB version if you are a hardcore gamer* Sony Store- You can download free demos so you don't end up paying 60 bucks for a game that you end up not liking at all.

{"product_name":"B0050SY4DG","description":"","reviewerName":"MikeB \"Metalhead\"","summary":"Disappointing","reviewText":"Resident Evil 6 is not a bad game, but it is a disappointment. I thought RE4 and RE5 were great games, and I was looking forward RE6 taking it all a step further. Instead it feels like 5 steps backward.STORY:The game is separated into four campaigns, each starring different characters in the RE universe, some new, some old. The stories are all intertwined and you don't get the big picture until you've completed them all. This sounds cool in theory, but unfortunately the problem this causes is that each story has a fuzzy intro and then you're thrust into the middle of a s***storm with no context. Throughout most of Leon's campaign, he doesn't even know where he is going or what he is doing, and the character keeps stating this. This left me baffled and uninterested for the majority of the game, and when you do get the whole picture, the payoff just isn't worth it. The other problem with the story is the lack of pacing. There is no attempt to build tension. The game just starts with tons of enemies attacking you and doesn't let up. There is no ebb and flow, no variation, no tension, and thus what could have been exciting is just grating.GAMPLAY:The controls have been revised for RE6, and unfortunately they don't work well. No longer are you restricted to standing still while aiming, which is a nice thought, but now aiming is imprecise and the camera is unwieldy. More often the camera is interested in showing you your character's shoulder than what's in front of you, and when you can see in front of you, aiming is loose and often you'll miss a shot that you'd swear was dead on. Movement feels awkward and correctly facing interactive elements takes a few tries. There is a cover system a la Gears of War, but it doesn't work well, and most of the time it's pointless. Overall, the controls feel broken, and this is the biggest downfall of RE6.The basic concept of any RE game is to explore spooky environments and kill zombies while solving puzzles. The element of exploration is gone thanks to very linear levels with virtually no branching pathways. Puzzles are reduced to simply picking up a keycard and using it at the next door you encounter. Zombies are so frequent, as is ammo, that the game lacks any excitement. It's hard to be scared when you already know there are more zombies waiting around every single corner. This is the least scary RE game ever. And by \"least scary\", I mean not scary in the slightest.GRAPHICS:RE4 on the Gamecube was the best looking game I had ever seen on that console. When RE5 came out, it was the best looking Xbox 360 game of it's time, so  I had high hopes for RE6's graphics. While RE6 isn't a bad looking game, it fails to impress. When compared to current games on the console, it's nothing special, and as a matter of fact, I don't think it looks as good as RE5. Character models are very detailed, but the environments look a little blurry and dull. Some monsters look good, while others just look like a pile of mush. Not what I expected from a series that has set the bar in graphics time and time again.SOUND:This time around, RE has taken a decidedly action-oriented direction, and the music reflects that. Ambient mood music is replaced with action-movie orchestral score. None of the music is memorable, as even as I write this I can't hardly remember it. Sound effects are pretty much the same gunshots and zombie moans that we've heard from past games, but I suppose that's expected. Overall, not bad, but nothing stood out as exceptional either.OVERALL:Considering how much fun I had with RE4 and RE5, RE6 was a let down. No longer is the game horror-survival. Now it feels like a poor-man's Gears of War. Chris' campaign is super action-heavy and feels like something out of Call of Duty. The game doesn't even try to be scary, the story is vague and confusing, the controls are wonky and imprecise, the camera is your worst enemy, levels are extremely linear, puzzles are stupidly simple, and there's no pacing to set the mood.  Most of the time I was playing this game, I was not enjoying myself. I only continued to play out of obligation since I payed money for it. It's not a horrible game, it's just terribly bland. I can't recommend this game to anyone. There are elements I didn't cover, like the co-op, but they don't rectify the many problems plaguing Resident Evil 6.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2012"}

These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt.

An endless well of public domain stories and characters that are perfect fodder for writers, movie makers and video game designers. It is to the credit of this game series that, rather than tell the stories of Perseus,Herakles or Theseus, they instead made up Kratos, in all his bloody, chain-blade weilding glory.I've playedGod of War PS2and enjoyed it immensely. I haven't played the sequel yet, but I'm sure I will. In the meantime, this PSP version of the game is a more-than-adequette substitute.The game is a prequel to the other two in the series. You play a tiny Kratos, running around eviscerating everyone that gets in your path. You also manage to find time for a little lovin' with some naked ladies, as was the style of the time (interestingly, Kratos never seems to hook up with any boys, as was also the style of the time).The game looks and plays incredibly well. The graphics are as close to a PS2 as anything you'll see on the PSP, and the controls work well on the smaller console.

{"product_name":"B00006Z7HR","reviewerName":"Marc Ruby&#8482; \"The Noh Hare&#8482;\"","summary":"I Built It Myself (with a little help)","reviewText":"The game uses an ingenious premise.  Max is a young man, living in Palm Springs, who discovers that there is a huge world beyond its locked gates.  He escapes through the sewers and discovers Monica, who comes from his own future.  An evil wizard is destroying Monica's time by changing the past, and it is up to Monica and Max to rebuild in the past to recreate the future.As the result of this device, the player has a lot more to do besides kill monsters and develop the characters.  There are whole towns to be reconstructed from raw materials, and if done right, the future can be accessed via special gems that Max and Monica wear.  Max carries a camera that he can use to take pictures of 'ideas' that he can turn into useful inventions and weapons.  These processes are a bit complicated, but once mastered, add a lot of fun to the game.Character development is actually done via weapons improvement, about which I have mixed feelings.  The process is complicated, and has to be repeated with each weapon.  This gets very time consuming near the end of the game when you are trying to bring four weapons and a robot up to enough power to make the final runs.  I would rather that the character developed and used bought or found weapons.Several other distractions exist to alleviate the drudgery of countless dungeon runs.  Spheda is a strange variation of golf that uses time distortions rather than holes.  There are all sorts of medals and prizes to be won, and it takes as much ingenuity as it does coordination.  And when you are not playing golf in a dungeon, you can go fishing.  You can win medals and even enter fishing contests.  I started out liking fishing best (it is easier) but spheda gets my final thumbs up for game within a game.Because I'm one of the senior generation of computer gamers, those games that finish with extended leveling up to prepare for the long run up to the final boss frustrate me.  I simply lack the youthful reflexes and ingenuity needed to artfully defeat a series of monsters that have furiously overwhelming attacks.  Unfortunately, that is nearly the only real flaw in 'Dark Cloud 2,' so I found it a bit of a spoiler.  The game does do an excellent job of making leveling up interesting enough to reduce much of the tedium.When you add everything up this is an enormous game, which could take as much as 150 hours if you are determined to touch all the bases.  Artwork and animation are showstoppers, and the music is good.  There is simply too much in this game to like.  Well worth the cost of admission.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2003"}

{"product_name":"SteelSeries Sensei Wireless Laser Gaming Mouse","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew Gray \"Beezer Review\"","summary":"Nice mouse but one thing bothers me","reviewText":"I've been using this mouse for awhile and unlike other people who have reviewed this mouse I am going to compare it to the G500, not the G700.The Sensei is a solid mouse but lacks the weight options of the G500. In fact while I used the G500 I added as much weight as I could and was used to how it moved. Switching to the Sensei took a little bit of getting used to but after a couple days it felt good.I like that it's wireless compared to the G500, and if you forget to cradle the Sensei to charge it, or have an extremely long play session unhooking the cord from the base and into the mouse makes it a wired option which is very nice for forgetful people like me.With software that you download from the SteelSeries website all the buttons are fully programmable, in fact you can program the buttons for different games and switch between those presets as you switch games which is also a very nice touch.Why the 4 Star rating then if I have nothing but good things to say you may be asking. Simple, do a lot of video editing and as such use the mouse extensively. The problem I have with this one is where the &#34;forward&#34; button is located and how low of profile it has. It makes it difficult to feel where it is, much less consistently press it when needed.It has a myriad of color options available for customization via the software. It's nice but really only useful for helping to monitor battery life.Overall I really like this mouse, it would be near perfect if those side buttons had a slightly different layout and a higher profile. As it is right now I can only say it's a very good option.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Ker Thao","summary":"Last Great Entry","reviewText":"Final Fantasy X is another great entry in the final fantasy series. The game follows Tidus as he tries to connect mysteries, falls in love, and realizes what he and his companions must do to save the world of Spira. From my opinion Final Fantasy X is the last great game in the final fantasy series, because after the creator Hironobu Sakaguchi left Square Enix the final fantasy games don't feel great anymore. Unless if he goes back one day. But yeah Final Fantasy X has great graphics, story, sound, and gameplay. You should play this game. You might be touched at the end of the game like some other people were.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00009MVJ7","description":"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliancetook co-operative action role-playing to new heights on the Playstation 2 console. Alone, or with a friend, you could tackle giant rats, undead monsters, dark elves, and even a white dragon, as you uncovered a plot against the good city of Baldur's Gate. But the ending indicated there was more adventure to come. Fans were worried that the sequel wouldn't live up to original's promise when the original design team jumped ship to work on Sony'sChampions of Norrath: Realms of EverQuest. They need not have worried;Dark Alliance 2is a worthy successor, retaining the weapons, monsters, Dungeons and Dragons action and rules, sharp graphics, responsive controls, and high adventure of its predecessor.The plot is a bit darker this time, but you're given a wider range of character classes to help face the elevated threats. There's the mighty barbarian, a dwarf rogue, a cleric, the monk (a martial artist), and a necromancer. The quest is huge and there are character-class specific side quests you can embark on--an extra incentive to play again as a different character. The level design tends to be a little too maze-like, and there's lots of boring backtracking, but the annoying jumping puzzles from the first game are gone.The biggest problem withDark Alliance 2is that it doesn't measure up to the competition. It's a 2-player game, whileDungeons & Dragons Heroes(on the Xbox) andChampions of Norrath(on the PS2 and Xbox) allow four-player play. Then again if you plan to play solo, or with a single friend, that shouldn't keep you from coming to the city ofBaldur's Gate'said once again.--Andrew Bub","reviewerName":"Chris H","summary":"Fun","reviewText":"I liked them both but I enjoyed this more than the original.

{"product_name":"B000R39GPA","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Frustrating fun or a fun frustration?","reviewText":"A pair of games that came out for the Playstation 2 were the 2 \"God of War\" games which had some stellar production values, fun combat and varied combos and cool premise but frequently I felt it was hampered by vague puzzles or frustrating ones to pull off (the underwater wall puzzle you have to outrun, anyone?) and trying to afford the expensive power-ups by building up combos only to have enemies respawn AFTER your combo meter reset and went back to zero was maddening. That's when I noticed when a developer can become a game creator who's a fan or just a fan lucky to make games since decisions and gameplay ideas are introduced that might not work and can cause tedium but they're put in because they're \"cool\".However, a game's faults can be forgiven if it's actually fun to play and you almost excuse it because it does so many things well and Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, possibly the biggest console release for the series since the Knights of the Old Republic games, this is a game that will frequently have you wowed and having fun on one hand but then have you swearing and wanting to punch something on the other. It's definately worth a try and many forgive the flaws and go straight to purchase while others might just get annoyed by something very frequently. Doesn't mean there isn't a good time to be had here, it's just the game finds it hard to maintain that pace.Story: Taking place inbetween \"Revenge of the Sith\" and \"A New Hope\", the game starts off with Darth Vader on a planet causing devastation and ready to wipe out a Jedi in the vicinity. But when he also finds a young boy, Vader decides to take him under his wing and teach him privately. Now a young man, codenamed \"Starkiller\", he finds himself a Sith Apprentice but finds being on the side of evil doesn't mean your safety or life is highly valued and with the help of the robot PROXY and pilot Juno Eclipse, he's got to help the resistance with their plans against the Empire.Ironically, what people consider the best entry in the 2 film trilogies were the darker ones, \"Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Revenge of the Sith\". The tone for this game is similar and while it's not filled with big plot-twists like Knights first game, it's a very compelling and enjoyable story that you want to get to the end for and not just because you just want to get to the end of the game and move on to something else. Also what helps is the voice acting from Sam Witwer (the poor dude knifed in The Mist) as Starkiller to Nathalie Cox as Juno to Adrienne Wilkinson as Sith character Maris Brood. Having some characters from both the prequels and original trilogy show up make it awesome as well.Graphics: One thing to keep in mind with the graphics is that they get separated into 2 categories: the presentation/art style and the actual performance. In the first one, this game is quite stunning with great lighting, amazing art design and impressive character models. Sure the level design is incredibly repetitive, subscribing to that \"everywhere else is a mess and untraverseable except this one path\" thing. But it's in the second category where the game falters since there's some pop up and things that seem to disappear/reappear, clipping, characters doing that weird glitch when they get stuck, some slowdown and the game even froze momentarily and in 2 cases for me personally, froze entirely and needed a restart. Game could've used a lot more polish and hopefully a future patch will correct it, especially the freezing bug.Sound/Music: Let's face it, the Star Wars films have some of the best music ever in a film. The ironic problem is that game developers seem to think so too so the score for the videogames barely deviates from it. We have all the familiar themes and more than once you'll hear a tune you know from the movie. That being said, the game is amazing to hear with the aforementioned voice acting too and this time, there's no glitches.Gameplay: Here's the proverbial backbreaking straw. Remember that one sentence I said about game developers using a cool idea because it's cool as opposed to a fun one? This game is similar and many aspects of the game just don't make sense even for people who don't even create games for a living. A character can't do a thing when they're hit unless left alone for awhile which is aggravating having to feel the full combo from the enemy as opposed to, I don't know, moving to the side and dodging? Then there's the Force Grab where you can grab enemies and sending them flying or grab things and send them flying to enemies. Believe me, it's fun to launch a huge block and smack em in their evil faces but the problem is that there's no real targeting tactic and frequently you'll grab some useful pipe as opposed to the enemy and also it's hard to target what you want to actually throw it at and it becomes kind of like playing pool where you have to line up your shot and hope it hits.The combat though is fun and the combos aren't that complex in moves like Heavenly Sword or Devil May Cry though there is some repetition and some moves I couldn't even activate making me just stick to tried-and-true techniques. But all that gets knocked out of the way when you lift an enemy into the air and fire your lightsaber and impale the jerk or having him thrown off a really high ledge. Being evil has never been this much fun and with the option to buy more combos or better stats and even your costume and lightsaber color, there's a lot of customization available.Now for the epitome of the bad part that's included because it's cool: the Star Destroyer. As the trailers showed, we can rip one of these bad boys right from the sky and make the sucker crash only the hugeness of this event seems to warrant a beyond-maddening sequence where you have a rate of turn that's too slow and a long distance you have to pull it to before it actually crashes. Oh and did I mention you're being shot at by multiple TIE Fighters that can't seem to be targeted for longer than a second? Very frequently you'll finally get your Star Destroyer lined up to be pulled down only the Fighters show up and shoot your *** up, making you having to deal with them lest you die and start over...oh yeah and the ship turns back to its original position making you having to slowly turn it back and then pulling it. This is the kind of sequence that when you replay it, it increases the dread and you'll find yourself going \"oh no, THAT part is coming up.\"Now if it sounds like I'm being incredibly negative towards the game, sorry. I have to admit I liked it and more than once I've thought of actually purchasing the game despite the huge amount of flaws that plague the game. But here's the thing: the presentation, the story, the music and not to mention just the sheer fun of laying the smackdown with your lightsaber is too hard to resist. Is it a masterpiece? Heh, far from it but for every thing it does wrong, I forgive it because it's doing something I like. Will you like it as much? Doubt it but it doesn't hurt to try. Hey, even critically acclaimed games like Grand Theft Auto IV and Halo 3 have their detractors, maybe flawed games like this can have their fans too.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2008"}

Play Godzilla as never before with non-linear story paths and all new Toho monsters.","reviewerName":"Andrew Gray \"Beezer Review\"","summary":"True Godzilla fans may appreciate it more","reviewText":"Overall, this is not really a bad game. The graphics are very nice. Sharp, crisp, clean and clear. However, if you are looking at this game to have a deep and engaging story mode... then you may want to look for a different game. The story mode, at least to me, was very flat and uninteresting.I think the appeal of this game will be in two areas.1 - Hard core Godzilla fans will no doubt love the inclusion of all the different monsters and unlockables. Personally, being only a casual Goddzilla fan, many of those things are no doubt lost on me. I only recognize a handful of monsters so that draw for me is lessened.2 - the multi-player aspect has the feel of being a blast. Up to four people can have an all out brawl, or destroy as many buildings as you can. Kind of akin to the old Rampage video game.One thing that frustrated me was the length of the battles. Most \"traditional\" fighters have a minute to a minute and a half length on 'rounds'. Not so here. You can easily hit the five minute mark for one battle, which at times, makes you lose interest in the battle and the game.While there are some fun aspects to the game, the controls (especially later in the game) become hampering and frustrating. As a multi player it is fun, as a single player... not so much. I don't think I would pay full price for it, probably best to hold off until you see it in the bargin bin.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2008"}
