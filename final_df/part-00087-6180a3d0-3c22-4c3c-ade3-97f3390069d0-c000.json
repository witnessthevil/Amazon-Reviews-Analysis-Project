Since I study so much and know all about the 1960s I felt right at home in this game no fooling Its the new game from Rockster and basically its Grand Theif Auto but instead of modern times its set in olden times the 1960s which is right after meny soldurs come home from World War Won. In this game you play as a soldjer who come home from the war and become a police oficer which is bada$$ and cool and you walk the beat but allso you play by your own rules and are wreckles and your capitan is allways screming at you saying STOP PLAYING BY UR OWN RULEZ YOU ARE A LIEABILLITY TO EVER MAN IN THIS DEPARMENT DONT YOU KNOW THE SENNATOR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MAN IN THE WORLD HOW CAN HE BE THE CRIMMINAL DIPLOMATTIC IMMUNNITIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Which is totally dope and ill!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So you and your partner get into a car and drive in the city and investigate crimes and bank robberries and murderings and car chases and exploshions and people who take drugs and jazz singers. Your partner is hilarious one minute he's a little guy then he gain a bunch of weight then he handsome so he has a rich back story and a life outside the viddeo game cuz how else would he gain so much weight!!!!!!  And you can take a car from people on the street and hijack theyre car just like a terrorrist!!!!!!  But you are not  a terrorrist because this is the 60s and there were no terrists back then just a bunch of pot smoking dope taking hippi librels (we call them latay librels or limosuinue librels!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) And they ruined sosiety and the world pretty much ended but up until REYGAN finely came and straighten it all out in the 1980s like I say I am an expurt on histories so I know belief me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ITs ovious that librels didnt write this vidio game because of 1) I loved it and I hate eelites, and because of 2) in this game criminals gets PUNISHED unlike wellfair or when they gayes want to get marry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So then SPAWLER ALERTS!!!!!  You solve all the crimes and you get prommoted.  I was supposed to get prommoted at Home Deppot but they fire me instead and say that I was allways late and I was all like WHATEVA that shown them!!!!!!!!!!!I give this game 10 out of 10 because its awsome and bada$$ and rad and you can pown newbs even though there no multeplayer you can still drive faster and pwon more newbs than in any other game plus it teach you about histry like the war and why we fought the Soviet Cong.  Maybe some of you idiots won't like this game because its too SMART for you with its hisstorys and solving of crimes using your BRAINS instead of your GUN (librels!!)  but for homies like me, this game is perfect and I give it 9 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sign, Anonimous","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2011"}
{"product_name":"B006VB2UNM","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Young","summary":"Not was I expected, but it's acceptable.","reviewText":"Okay, first thing first....I must say I was quite disappointed with Madden 13 because I played the heck out of Madden 12. I guess I was looking for some vast improvements in the series. I truly believe EA Sports had good intentions, but sometimes they are ahead of themselves. The first thing I noticed was that there was no Franchise Mode but it was there hidden under another name. I'm not going to elaborate on this year's Franchise Mode because every other review has done so. Anyway, I am writing this review because if you are a loyal Madden fan then no matter what EA does, we as fans will still buy and complain about everything that gets a change. One thing I realize as human beings we are not fans of change but we will complain and still love Madden 13. So this review is basically to say I love Madden no matter what, because despite the drastic changes it is still a fun game. It has however changed more to please more online players. I am still truly a Madden 12 fan, I wish I wasn't so eager to sell it for 13 but that is what loyalty does.If you have Madden 12 and have not purchased 13 yet, it's not a rush to purchase, maybe savor 12 for a while longer and wait until 13 drops in price during the holiday season. All in all, people will complain about every little detail but at the end of the day they will adapt and adjust and keep playing until 13 Madden 14 comes out next year...***One last thing, this year seems to be a lot more challenging, I was blown away at how challenging its become. I almost questioned my ability to play on All-Pro, it's a matter of adjusting to some of the technical game changes. Like this year you have to wait for your receivers to run their routes and then the A,B,X or Y button will light up on the screen to let you know who is open to pass too. The disadvantage is, if you DO NOT pump fake the ball you will get sacked trying to wait for these guys to \"get open\"... makes it much tougher.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2012"}

But this game blew me away.  Now I don't like Edward more than Ezio, but he's very close.  A very interesting character with an interesting story.  Also the story with the world after Desmond's arc continues in a very well done way.  The world in the Animus and outside are absolutely beautiful.  There's plenty of minigames outside the Animus you need to complete to advance through the story, or feed your curiosity.  In the game, there's no shortage of things you can do!The temptation is to just play through the story, but after you get your ship, play the game slowly.  Adventure, explore, pirate those Brits and Spaniards!  And the DLC of Assassin's Creed, Freedom Cry places you in the shoes of Adewale, an African assassin.  There's issues of slavery and race, and this game deals with them in a mature and accurate manner.PLEASE PLAY THIS GAME, OWN IT, LOVE IT.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2014"}

Mario Party 9 is a party game that just keeps the action at high speed almost all the time your playing it. The game has all players ride in 1 machine and you all travel together while taking turns to roll the dice. I love the boss battles! On every map you fight a mini boss and then at the end you fight a big boss! The action seems to just keep going and going in this game.I'm also very happy to say that the new mini games in this are a lot of fun (most of them that is). You might have to steer a wild Bullet Bill, count Goombas, ride dolphins, Jump on clouds, jump rope, catch Bowser Jr., and many more things! This game is really a fun game for anyone looking for a good fun game to play with friends and family. Mario Party 9 also has a single player mode that is pretty fun and in that mode you will be working towards unlcoking some neat stuff.There are a bunch of hings to unlock in this game and lots of different things to play in this game. The graphics look wonderful and really bring the Mario World to life.

{"product_name":"B001YHX4B0","description":"Blurring the borders of good and evil, this cinematic and stylized adventure stars Bayonetta, a heroine bent on sending supernatural forces to the depths of hell. Armed with her four enchanted guns known as Scarborough Fair, she battles both monstrous behemoths and angelic enemies. By combining special magic attacks, summoning primal forces and unleashing devastating weaponry, she impressively punishes anyone who gets in her way. From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint.Unleash your powersView larger.Amazing graphicsView larger.","reviewerName":"M. burns","summary":"Just Average","reviewText":"To start off, I would like to note that the loading issues have been completely solved thanks to the patch.Liked- Weapons and accessories:  There is a diverse arsenal in this game and each weapon feels and plays different than another.  Also, for the first time in forever, a game has actually made accessories meaningful.  Most games have 1 useful accessory and 9 useless ones.  Bayonetta has a diverse set that are actually useful in different areas of the game.- Combat is good.  Not great but definitely fun to play.  The Combo System tries to be deep by giving you a hundred different moves but at the end of the day you will be using the same 2-3 combos.Hated- Combat time:  Unless you play on the hardest difficulty, each individual battle lasts ~1 minute unless it is some of the bosses that are only open to attacks during certain sequences.  This is made worse by the small battle, long boring cutscene, small battle, long boring cutscene layout.  The game wants to be a high speed car race but unfortunately is designed in a way that you feel like you are driving in a city and getting stopped at every light.- Story:  One of the worst stories of all time if you can even call it a story.  It is incoherent, full of plot holes, poorly scripted and, well, just plain dumb.  After awhile you will stop even trying to understand what is going on after you realize that the \"storyline\" is nothing more than an excuse to flash Bayonetta's crotch/butt around for a few minutes every 3-5 minutes during the game.  I actually enjoyed this game 10x more skipping all of the cutscenes.- Characters: One of the few games that I have play that I absolutely hated every character.  Every character in this game reminded me of an EMO kid who thinks their cool, tries to act cool, yet at the end of the day they are not.  While I am all for sexiness in a game, Bayonetta's constant open-crotch and butt shots come off as a pathetic attempt to be sexy/cool.  Some will say that it is cool because it is intentionally over-the-top.  DMC was intentionally over-the-top and was cool, Bayonetta...no, just a pathetic attempt to cash in on sexuality.- Bestiary: Lame.  No creativity at all with this.  Most of it is just ripped off from other games and given a bird theme.  The all time low was the boss that looks almost completely like Metal Gear Ray.- Gimmick Levels (Space Harrier / Bike Levels):  Gameplay on these levels is horrible.  Space Harrier sucked the first time around, why would you bring it back?  And the bike sequence was a sloppy mess.- Graphics:  Included in this are the poor framerate (scientifically proven to go down to 20 frames/second once the action begins), the gray filter effect (look at the images on the page for this game.  See how every one of them looks like it has a gray filter over them; well it's there for the entire game) and the PS2ish look of most of the levels (most glaring ones are the clocktower, the lava, the road, and the bike levels; and the others don't look all that great either).Overall, Bayonetta is an average game.  I cannot say I hated this game but I can in no way comprehend why so many are gushing over it.  The combat is fun, yet there are just too many problems to give this game at best anything more that a 7/10.  Bayonetta is nowhere near the level of Uncharted, DMC, Batman, or Ninja Gaiden.  I would associate this game more with Bloodrayne or Shinobi, good but not great.  It's unfortunate that a game whose spiritual predecessor is DMC turned out so average.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"strump\"","summary":"Suprisingly Poor All Things Considered","reviewText":"Considering the Bioware pedigree I found this title to be rather lacking. At times it felt like Mass Effect had simply been reskinned --- but, even more alarming, quite often I wished that this was the case.One of the more notable problems in the game are plot twists that can make you lose key characters that you have invested precious time, care, and gold into developing and equipping. Sometimes with no acceptable recourse --- so no,  a well placed save will not really help since none of your choices are very appealing. In my case, I lost my favorite ally and by far my most expensive character right as the game was at its climax. Naturally this is completely disappointing and made the game far less enjoyable. This could be avoided I guess, if you decide to change your main character's basic personality at the last minute. The loss of this character was even more disappointing since money and decent equipment is relatively hard to come by in this game. Believe it or not, losing this character was better than the alternative. Considering what I know of the game, the same or similar decisions are embedded into the main story line and are unavoidable no matter what class one decides to play. This greatly reduces the way one can play the game and what NPC's have any value at all ultimately. My best advice is to not play favorites at all and develop/equip all of your NPC's as completely as possible --- and for gosh-sakes don't grow to like these characters or anything like that.Also the inability to do the side quests at anytime is pretty much unacceptable. If you should venture a bit too far into the main story line some side quests will be closed to you. I recommend that one does all side quests immediately and don't accidently do a story quest too soon. One can even bypass a certain caged ally character if one is not careful, although this is not what I am referring to.The biggest problem with the game is it's poor quest locating system. By today's standards it is an insult and practically useless. One may select a quest and supposedly make it an active quest but it really makes no difference since the pointer will simply point to whatever key character or key feature is the closest. I found this to be simply unbelievable in this day and age.The game is also a bit buggy as well. But this can be overlooked considering the ambition and work it takes to make any decent RPG. And don't get me wrong, it is a decent game. In fact, some of the story line can be quite engaging --- sometimes.And lastly, I don't find this to be a particularly epic game by RPG standards --- I found it to be fairly short --- while noting in fairness that there is added origin content for each of the classes offered. These origins all lead to roughly the same main story content.My advice is to play it --- next year --- when it's cheaper --- but be aware that the A team at Bioware was probably working on Mass Effect 2 and not this one ---ur --- hopefully.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2009"}

Well, Uncharted 2 Won","reviewText":"First of all, I will we clear, you are going to enjoy this game, its a very good one. Sadly, the hype that this one had, just killed it, why?? Well I was a very huge fan of MW1, I was sick of Halo, hated it after too much, and MW1 just came in the right time, managed to make me love FPS after all, I am really one mind(gaming of course in this case), I like games like Gran Turismo, Uncharted, Little Big planet, Gears of War, God of War of Course...) And this one is one, or maybe the one game I was waiting for between many the most. It started really well, but it only lasted few minutes. Not as Uncharted 2, which really hooked me up like no other game this generation before. Maybe I am not being comprehensive comparing, but its inevitably. Why? Because while playing MW2, I couldn't handle thinkin', what if Infinity Ward should have make this like Naughty Dog.. or so.. it was my reference, in every aspect, also Online. Which  is great in this game, but Uncharted is just to a lot wore refreshing, instead in MW2, its more of the same with few, really few extras, and of course new scenarios.Don't take me wrong, its a great game. but if you have a PS3 at least, and you are planning to buy a game that truly is worth your money, and you only have money for one, pick Uncharted... and enjoy it, Believe me, it will last. and then take this one, few months later, maybe a little cheaper, or used, its worth it to but not woth at the same time, you'll byt this one to rest. But to be honest, not all of us have that much time to spend on 2 different games, then pick the best first, then at a cheaper price point few months later, the other. or get 3 other games for 19.99 each.. which is what I should have done instead of buying this one now... like mirrors edge, bioshock, midnight club GH, etc.. then I'll just have to wait.Previously: Ohh why 1 star?? its because my disapointment vs Uncharted 2, otherwise maybe the second best game of the year. For x360 players, well, its the best choice this year undoubtedly.PD. remembering, I enjoyed Killzone's 2 story more, not the end of it, as a whole, graphically and on physics, its far more realistic, but slower, diferent kind of game though.Update: I''ll give this game 5 stars because it deserve them. this means Uncharted deserves at least 6 or 7 if possible. If you're into FPS, specially arcade style ones (Killzone is not Arcade style), This is simply your best option, period.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001QXNBNI","reviewerName":"Jared Burdick \"JBurd\"","summary":"A challenger to the COD Throne?","reviewText":"Quick backround on me - I'm an avid console FPS player. I achieved top 1% once and top 6% for 3 solid months on Killzone. I've gotten my kill rank as high as 91000 on MW2 (good enough for top 2%). I also played a fair amount of Resistance. I LOVE COD:MW2. I love the graphics, the speed, the twitch reflexes required to be good. I also do not play the single player games, so my review is aimed specifically at the online portion. I will say the 2 hours spent on the single player were very fun and the graphics phenominal (noticeably better than multiplayer). I also play with a clan that has carried over several games, that also weighs into my opinion. Finally, I played both the BETA and the DEMO, and about 48 hours online in, so I have a fair amount of experience with BFBC 2 .Based on DICE & EA's own admission, they are aiming to be the best, better than COD specfically. Do they succeed? Yes and no. Here is my comparison/opinion:Play is class based - Recon, Medic, Assault and Engineer. As you play as each character, their specific abilities are unlocked and enhanced. The leveling is slow. Unlike MW2 where getting hot could mean 2000xp and a quick couple of levels. Not so in Battlefield. You will need to play and play well as one class for an extended period to really get into the meat of the characters. You can customize your player, but not in the same fashion MW2. Edge: DrawModes include Rush, Capture the Flag, Squad Deathmatch and Gold Rush. The HUGE advantage BFBC 2 has over MW2 is that playing like a one man army is useless and you will probably lose. You CAN do it, but camping and playing as a lone wolf simply do not work in BFBC. Again, a stark contrast to MW2, the maps are enormous. And that is putting it lightly. Squading up is imperative if you want to move quickly across the map (and spawn with a squadmate). Edge: BFBCMechanics - The players move in a similiar fashion to COD:MW, i.e., like the player is on skates. This is in contrast to Killzone that moves more like Saving Private Ryan. The guns feel good, but do not have a weighty feel to them. The player can run for days and jump abnormally high. The bullets have drop at long range, wich is awesome. As opposed to a wobbly reticle, you have to aim based on distance to the target. You don't get much of a notice when you are getting hit or hit someone, and getting killed can be a bit jarring and abrubt. Players can regain health, but slowly, so as a sniper, you can get those one shot kills, especially if you snipe behind your tank. Speaking of vehicles. They are tide changer and vital part of winning the game you are playing. We're talking choppers, tanks, humvees and quadrunners. As far as the actual shooting goes, MW2 still just feels better, but that is going to be a strict opinion, as both work just fine. Edge: DrawMatchmaking - It's easy to jump into a squad and more importantly, hook up with friends. You can customize the map you play and all of the modes. The game also plays on dedicated servers supported by EA. Again, big edge: BFBC.Graphics / Sound - This is going to be very much debated. I like how COD and KZ looks. BUT - Battlefield has vehicles, 24 players, 10 maps that dwarf COD and KZ's maps and the big enchilada - fully destructable environments. Like the tanks your in, they change the game. If a sniper thinks he's going to camp, think again. The building he's in or tree he's behind will eventually fall. Near the end of some matches, the level of destruction is incredible. If you are a pure graphics fiend, youll probably think it's ugly, if you love the size, scope and destructability, you'll prefer BFBC. As far as sound - COD is like a Bruckheimer movie, BFBC is like Saving Private Ryan. More pops and thumps. Every gun in COD sounds like a cannon (which I love with my Turtlebeach P21 Headphones). Edge: DrawOverall - I personally prefer the gameplay of COD:MW2 by a wide margin over BFBC 2. However, if you've spent any time with MW2, you know it's full of lone wolves, campers, cheaters and glitchers. The matchmaking is inferior, clan support is nill and playing with friends online is very difficult because of constant drops. Playing as a team is paramount to having a good time on BFBC, and there in lies the rub. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I'm afraid the game will not have that pick up and play, jump right in replayability that COD:MW2 has. Ginormous maps played with strangers not playing together could end up being just as bad (or worse) than the faults of MW2.

{"product_name":"B003DNH95K","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew Mulligan \"Joker\"","summary":"Great RPG, Great Story","reviewText":"I'd like to start off by saying I've never watched a LotR movie.StoryThe story follows 3 characters, Eradan, Farin and Andriel, who are given the duty of going to The Shire to scout enemy forces, upon arriving, they are attacked by Orcs. The trio finds that a man by the name Agandaur plans on destroying the Free People of the North under the orders of Sauron. The 3 are given the duty of distracting the enemy forces while Frodo and the Brotherhood head towards Mt. Doom, and stopping Agandaur from completing his malicious plans.GraphicsThe graphics of LotR: WitN are very nice, areas are lush and green (or not if the area requires it), and effects are well done (blood sprays, element effects, etc). Characters look realistic (or as realistic as fake beings can be) and animations are smooth. Weapons and armour have unique skins (for the most part) and equipping something changes the look of the character.ControlsThe game relies on basic controls, normal attacks, heavy attacks, block and range attacks. Holding the right trigger will allow you to use one of three melee or ranged skills. When talking with NPCs, the game uses a Mass Effect style, allowing you to ask various questions or dig deeper into the situation, this can earn you extra quests or additional info as to what you should do.Voice/Music/SoundThe music can be a bit buggy at times, you'll hear battle music when not in battle, or it may reset a few times before working properly, but despite that, it sounds good and is appropriate. The VO seem to be appropriate for the setting of the game, characters use old tyme speech (my lord, thus, etc) and makes the game feel authentic.OtherThe game allows for split screen play of online play, this makes some parts of the game much easier to pass.When you level up, that level stays with you, if you play as the Ranger, but decide you want to play the Melee, you'll do so with the same level of your Ranger (with all the stat and skill points free to allocate as well as all the items you had). Your team, when controlled by the AI, will allocate points automatically, and upgrade their equipment by themselves, you can provide them with armour and weapons if you want, but they may lose them.When you beat the game, you'll unlock a higher difficulty and will be able to use your character and retain your gear, stats and level, making it easier to progress. You'll also earn more exp and better gear as you play.OverallThis is a very fun game for RPG fans, I don't even like LotR but enjoyed this game a lot.8.0/10.0Pros- Fun RPG- Weapons and Armour are unique- Can be a nice challenge for the playerCons- Can be beaten in, literally, a few hours if you rush- Areas are linear- Many locations on the map, only a small number are visitable","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2013"}

Released almost exactly one year after Call Of Duty 4, which was a huge success, Call Of Duty 5 has some flaws but is still a good shooter.The graphics in COD5 are great. In terms of how many things are going on at once, like fights, explosions, planes bombing from above, the game handles it very well and frame rate lag doesn't come up all to often. Besides the good things, I didn't find to many bad things about the graphics.The sound in COD5 is just great of course. War music, which was been successful in all the COD games, is once again great in this game.The controls are once again, very easy to learn. Shouldn't take more than a few minutes for experienced fans of shooters, and maybe a tad longer for others. The controls are just about exact to the previous COD installments.The single player in COD5 is very fun. You change between factions just like in the other COD games. You play as the U.S.A as they engage in combat with the Japanese. Then you play as the Russians, fighting in Russia then later on in Germany itself. So it takes place in the later years of WWII. I found the last few levels of the Russian campaign very fun and it had some good eye candy. The single player campaign can most likely be beaten in one day (if you played all day long) on an easier difficulty, but of course that would change on Veteran.Now, some people were saying that COD5 sucks compared to COD4. I don't necessarily agree but I understand where them people come from. COD2 and 4 were made by Infinity Ward, but COD3 and COD5 were made by Treyarch and some people didn't like 3 to much because it wasn't made by Treyarch. If you have played COD 2-4, you will see similarities between 3 and 5. Even though COD4 is better, I do not think 5 is a bad game.I haven't played the multi-player, so I cannot review it, but considering the single player and other aspects a long with it, I think the game is great, but the longevity of the game might not be as long with some people so I would probably recommend this as a rent. However, if you have played a lot of multi-player on previous COD's then I might consider it a buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2008"}

I dropped a star just for its lack of length.It sure is a fun game and the controls are 1 button off identical to Halo 3, so it's easy to pick up and play for the first time. And easy for friends who already know the Halo games.I didn't care for the night vision thing, it changed the game a little, a little as in easier, all the enemies are highlighted in red, and if it's off you can't see a thing in the dark, but they can still see you, so it must be on in darkness. To me is seemed like an easy way to make a cheep game...a bad gimmick.It's cool there is the other Halo 3 multiplayer disc with every H3 map, but it's only cool if you are like me and never bought any of the DLC maps, otherwise it will just make a lot of people very angry.Overall it's good and short, but still good, if you have never played a Halo game, go with the first one, You can find it for less the 10 bucks and I think it's the best of all of them, plus the console version works on the 360.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2009"}

It was also the first video game I ever played for any system. You couldn't possibly ask for more from a game from 1991. The graphics are amazing for a 16-bit game and system.Super Mario World is very similar to the first ever Mario game, Mario Bros. for the NES. Like in Mario Bros. you kill enemies by jumping on top of them and collect coins to earn more points and extra lives. Your goal is to save the Princess from the evil Bowser. But first you have to beat each level in every world by evading enemies and collecting as many coins as you can without losing a live. After you beat every level in the World you will face a boss which is much harder than any other place in the World. There are 96 levels in the entire game, including several bonus levels that you need to find and beat before you will face Bowser, the main boss in the entire game. Defeating Bowser is very hard and takes some time, but it's fun trying to save the Princess.This is the game that made video games become really popular. If you stop by Funcoland or any store with SNES games pick up this game today along with Super Mario All-Stars, another great SNES game with 4 Mario games on it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2002"}

You are still a powerful warrior, still taking on the various gods in a quest for survival and power.I've seen many sequels over the years. Often they are awful - just trying to get more money for the exact same product. I'm really happy to say that the God of War team did a great job here with God of War 2. They really listened to feedback, worked on their game and created a new version that is even better than the original.The graphics are just stellar. Sweeping movements, detailed backgrounds, action-filled situations. It's still a little dark for me - in terms of hard to see. You can make a game seem rich and dangerous without having it be a foggy gloom. Still, I appreciate their artistic intent here.The vocals are stunning. They've won numerous awards for this series and they are well deserved. Epic, beautiful to listen to.The game really draws you in. From the very first second you are immersed in battles that you really enjoy fighting in. There are varied enemies, each ones that you feel driven to take on and conquer. I admit that sometimes it can be a little confusing - you try repeatedly to take action X, only to discover through trial and error that it will never work until first you do action Y. Still, these types of inconveniences can be found in most games.Should you play God of War 1 before you move on to God of War 2? I would say yes. There's a lot of storyline and background here - and God of War 1 was definitely a fantastic game. By all means, track down a version of God of War 1 first and play through it. Then load in God of War 2 and see how the game progresses from there, how the characters evolve and change.Well recommended for any action gamer. My only caveat is that this is rated M for mature - so make sure you're not buying this for a very young gamer. It's rather violent.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2009"}

I am disappointed with this controller because it could have been better.  I like it much better than the classic controller, but ultimately there is almost no functional difference between the Classic Controller and the Classic Controller Pro.  Nintendo had an opportunity to really improve the design, but it really isn't much different from the classic controller except in two ways; the extended grip arms and the shoulder button layout.  Even with those improvements though, this controller is not Nintendo's most comfortable controller offering.  Nintendo's Wave Bird controller had a much more comfortable grip design and the shoulder buttons felt really nice.  In fact, I am really confused when I think about why Nintendo would chose this design over tweaking the original Wave Bird controller format.Pros:- The shoulder button layout is much improved, similar to that of Sony and Microsoft's controllers.- The grip arms on the front are definitely nice, making for a much more comfortable grip.- The D-pad has a bit of gritty texture to it, which is a nice but subtle touch.Cons:- We're still stuck with the wire that plugs into Wii Remote.- No rumble/force feedback feature.- The (mediocre) analog shoulder buttons of the classic controller have been replaced with simple digital buttons.- It feels a bit too light and flimsy to the touch, although it does seem to be fairly sturdy.- Not compatible with GameCube games.  Considering that it is nearly impossible to find a Wave Bird controller at a reasonable price it is still very unfortunate that most players will not be able to sit more than 6 feet away from their Wii while playing GameCube games.Given my criticism, I won't say that this is a bad controller; it just isn't a great controller.  Given the choice between this controller and a Classic Controller, this controller is definitely the better product and I recommend that every Wii owner own at least one of these if they don't already have a Classic Controller lying around.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2010"}

It is linear, There are seperate paths you can go, but you usually will have to stop shortly after because you need a special gizmo or gadget.You don't really need to scan that much to win, even though in the first level they make it seem like you will. Basically you shoot monsters, find things to make your suit do more, and fight bosses for those things, then backtrack.The game has alot of shooting, contrary to what other people say. You will shoot alot of monsters by rapidly clicking the powerbeam button. Eventually, I just started using missles, because every time you kill a guy he leaves something. Well, they don't always leave things, but usually they will leave a health up or missle up. I think it depends on what weapon you use to kill the actual monster.The pros of the game are the great environments. It isn't the same over and over again, actually the backtracking screws that up. You could of gone through tons of different environments, instead you backtrack between like 5 of them, mabye 6. Then there are the graphics, pretty good. The weapons are alright, I love just pounding guys with missles. The morph ball works well, you can use it whenever you want. Then there is the help system. Usually it tells you when there is a save system nearby, and your next objective. Most of the time I am not lost, but sometimes it tells me to go 5 miles to where I just came from and I feel like throwing the game in the garbage.However, the cons of the game greatly out-due all the good things. The control is weird at first, but once you master it, it becomes better. Still, there are points in the game when the control works against you. Say there is a monster shootiong at you from behind. You can't really turn around and keep moving left and right, so you usually will get shot a couple times. Cleared areas usually leave some really tough enemies, that gang up on you and you die. That's another problem, the monsters can be really tough. Usually you can't just shoot the monsters. Most of the time you will have to find a weakness or wait till it turns around and shoot it's back.The overall layout of the game is even worst. Boss, new item, backtrack. You will probably fight 20 bosses in the game. You can get a few energy cell boosters, and missle pack boosters. The only thing is, most of them require you to go out of your way for them. Backtracking isn't that big during the first hour or so of the game, but let me tell you something, it gets worse. You go to this iceworld to get a speed ball reward, then you go ALL THE WAY BACK to your ship. If you play the game and get to the speed ball part, you will know what I am talking about.Besides backtracking and such, the problem is death. Die, reload from last save point saved at. The one problem that could of been avoided easily. Say you get killed? Ok, you can't just continue from the beggining of that boss fight, you are going to have to reload. Say you fight some of the tough enemies, reload. Say you play for 2 hours to get a powerup then die, reload. I think you understand.In closing, the backtracking makes the game bad. The dieing makes the game bad. I wouldn't of minded a shorter game with no backtracking. I wouldn't have minded a retry system for bosses. But these problems overshadow all the good things in the game, and make it not worth playing.

I have lots of friends on xbox live and none of them liked any of the other halo games , but they really like this game and it is all we are playing at the moment. just because you didnt like the other halo games doesnt mean you wont like this one. this one is a great game in my opinion. I have played through the game on normal , heroic , and am currently playing through it on legendary. there is much replay value to be had in this game. dont listen to others downing this game because most likely they are fan boys of a particular title like call of duty. the graphics are great and the new abilities ( sprint , active cammo , armor lock , jet pack  ) make this a new experience over the older halo games. I play all types of first person shooters ( FPS ) all of the call of duty titles , battlefield bc 1 & 2 , wolfenstine , timeshift , legendary , tom clancy titles and more. all of these games I love and halo reach is no exception . as you can tell im not a fan boy of any particular series I just enjoy all types of games.

{"product_name":"B00000J9J9","description":"One of the best things about the Game Boy Color is that it's  basically an original Nintendo Entertainment System that can fit in  your pocket. What this means for gamers is that many of the great games  for the classic system are being ported to the Game Boy Color, giving  us a chance to re-play (or in some cases discover) the best game titles  from the '80s.Nintendo's ownSuper Mario Bros. Deluxeis among the first of  these conversions, and it certainly remains one of the best. Actually,  calling this game a conversion really doesn't do it justice. This  version actually contains more levels than the original game, including  the entire Japanese version and a slew of extras (such as a two-player  mode).The controls in this game are easy to grasp--even for novice gamers.  All Mario can do is jump (and shoot fireballs with the right power- ups), but it is amazing to see how much gameplay can be squeezed from  these simple actions when the controls work in direct harmony with a  player's thoughts. The only element of this game that could have been  better is that the Game Boy Color's screen isn't quite large enough to  show the entire layout of the original game screen, so players may  occasionally need to press up and down on the control pad to see some  offscreen action. While this can be distracting, it ultimately has  minimal impact on gameplay. If you are looking for the quintessential  side-scrolling platform game, you can't do much better thanSuper  Mario Bros. Deluxe.--T.

Even if you talk to all NPC's in the game and piece together as much as you can there is a lot of theory involved.  The only way to get the full picture is to read wiki pages for a while.&#62;Motivation.  Often during this game it is unclear what you are doing and why.

I was playing offline and it was too hard.  I was struggling to move forward, and was using poor weapons and armor because I couldn't find anything better.About 8 months later a friend gifted it to me on steam for PC and I decided to give it another try.  This time I asked him for advice and he gave me insight on how to find better gear and how to be smarter in combat.  With these tips, I really got into the game.  My point here is that without an outside source of information, I would never have enjoyed DaS 1.  The weapons and armor he told me how to get would have been almost impossible to find on my own.  It took a lot of advice before I even started to get decent at this game and I didn't enjoy it until then.However, once you do start to get the game down, it becomes a lot of fun.Just keep in mind that this game often doesn't explain things, it never holds your hand.

{"product_name":"B001D7T2VC","reviewerName":"MurphysLaw","summary":"Prepare for War","reviewText":"In case you know nothing about the game, the basic premise is that you play as War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.  Seems War answered the call that the seventh seal had been broken but was then accused of starting the Apocalypse himself.  In an effort to clear his name, War is permitted to return to figure out exactly what happened.  You first start the game with quite a few powers but of course, you will lose them soon enough and have to start rebuilding as War works to clear discover the truth.  The plot isn't exactly stellar but it's unique enough to keep your interest and at least seems to have a point.Now onto the appearance of the game:The graphics take advantage of the PS3 with bright colors and less of a washed out look that seems to be prevalent in many action games.  The voice work is top notch and the same is true of the musical score and general sound effects. The characters look interesting and unique and you'll see everything from demons, zombies and angels.  War himself looks nice and has very fluid movement.  He looks heavy and sounds that way when he moves, which isn't to say that the movements are awkward or clumsy, just solid.  He doesn't flit around like the Prince of Persia - I mean come on, he's War.If you're expecting a 'God of War' type game there are similarities to be sure however the mechanics of 'Darksiders' are not quite as sophisticated.  You could play as a button masher though there are combos to master which will improve your score and playing experience.  The finishing moves found in the 'GOW' games (you know when the circle button appears and then you press the various button or joystick combos as they appear on the screen) are primarily reduced to a circle icon and once you press the button, War mostly just handles things by himself.  I don't really feel this detracts from the game to be honest.The game controls are easy to learn and intuitive.  You collect souls which can be used as currency, wrath points or health.  You level up and obtain more abilities that are tied to your weapon, combo moves, health, etc.  War's weapon is one big a$$ sword to be sure and he handles it like a champ.  As you progress on your journey, you will achieve more and more weapon abilities and skills which really add to the game playing experience overall.The atmosphere of the game is first rate.  The developers obviously dedicated a great deal of time and attention to the details and it really paid off.  Cars, buildings, creatures, all of it, look realistic (well as realistic as a freaky demon can look).  The game gets  better as it progresses...in fact, though you'll have fun during the first 45 - 60 minutes of the game, it is the weakest portion of the game overall.  As you move through the game, the areas, enemies, your weapons and abilities get bigger and better.  The story line keeps things moving and you want to see what comes next. There are quite a few puzzles as you move through the game, most are simple though a few can be frustrating.I have to say I am quite pleased with it and feel it is definitely worth the purchase and is one of the better PS3 games I've played.  I've yet to find any glitches or issues in the PS3 version.  If you like action-adventure games with puzzle elements, you are probably going to like this one as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003ZHMMEM","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A Triumphant return for Donkey Kong","reviewText":"When my wife and I saw previews for this game, we both decided together immediately that we would get it. We both had hyper levels of nostalgia for the classic trilogy of Donkey Kong Country games on the SNES, and when I saw that Retro studios, the geniuses behind the best Metroid games in the franchise (I'm referring to the amazing Metroid Prime Trilogy, for those sadly unacquainted), I knew this sequel/reboot would be of the highest quality.We were not disappointed.We had an absolute blast playing together through each level to the end barrel, collecting red ballons, banana coins, and literally hundreds and hundreds of bananas along the way. We jumped around on evil sentient tiki torches, ran away from mountains of ants, and pounded on weird yet ridiculously fun bosses ranging from toad-armadillo-rhino hybrids, to a chicken operating a mech. All the while, we laughed, we fought, we screamed at the television, and we high fived when we actually got through a particularly difficult patch. This is not an easy game by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it is one of the most challenging games I have ever attempted to play in my life. Oh, it starts out easy enough, but by the fourth world, every level will leave you breathless and your adrenal gland aged at least a couple more years. Playing it on co-op, as me and my wife did, makes it even harder as you have to be almost one minded in jumping at the same time in rapid succession across platforms that collapse within one or two seconds of landing on them. We didn't have too much of a problem though, and it was made all the funner for it. Who would have thought Donkey Kong would be awesome for husband-wife bonding? Plus, if a sequence is too difficult OR requires you to be too precise for two players to get through, the second player as Diddy can jump on DK's back and let player one get through that rough area. It's a brilliant, yet simple, design choice on Retro's part. This game has a ton of replay value as well, as you can't see everything this game has to offer without all the KONG letters and puzzle pieces. Heck, we were even playing optional levels, just to experience the greatness that is DKCR in every way we could.Obviously, I am smitten with DKCR's gameplay, its strongest suit, but is there anything else that is great about it? The answer is a resounding YES! The graphics are fantastic by any system's standards. The backgrounds are full of depth and amazing originality. Because of this advancement in graphical technology, Retro could do things unheard of in the day's of DKC 1-3. For instance, some of the barrel shooting sequence send you in full 3-D trajectories and may land you way off in one of the background courses, only to send you crashing through giant stone totem poles to get you back to the main ground. Some levels also feature foregrounds being only black silhouettes with the only color being DK's tie and Diddy's hat and shirt. These levels were very, very unique and visually stunning. The animations are fantastic in every way, as well as the animal designs. The music is a perfect blend of nostalgic tunes and very cool new tunes that resonate with surprisingly deep atmosphere. I was very impressed.All-in-all, Donkey Kong Country Returns is a brilliant and triumphant return to platform for DK, who has spent too long being cameos in Super Smash games and Mario Kart or starring in bizarre titles like Jungle Beat. After playing this, I can't help but wonder what took the big guy so long to come back, but boy am I glad he did! My wife and I can't recommend this game enough! BUY IT! PLAY IT! LOVE IT!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004QEWVLC","description":"","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"A little more, a little less","reviewText":"I'm a pretty big fan of over-the-top violent games with slapstick humor so naturally, I wanted this game based on several reviews. After freshly coming off ofSaints Row 2 PS3for the second time, I noticed (like many others) that the game is stripped of a lot of customization. However, there's a trade-off sometimes. Maybe not a fair trade-off, but certainly some.Customization has been stripped of some of the details from SR2. In SR2, you could customize so much that it really felt unique. You could pick a shirt, have it tucked, untucked, half tucked... whatever you want. This time, you just pick your clothes and colors. It's definitely a step back. However, the trade-off is that you get more details in the actual look of your character, such as their \"junk\" or just random goofy looking creations. You can see what I mean by visiting SR3's website. Also, cribs have been completely stripped of customization, which really sucks. You can't do anything other than customize cars/characters.The weapons are greatly improved over the other games. There's a lot of cool things to play around with, including a laptop that gives you a \"satellite\" view of your surroundings, allowing you to drop missles on bypassers. A lot of the weapons you can now upgrade too. I've been playing on Normal difficulty and the guns take a while to take someone down unless you get a headshot. I actually like this though. It makes it arcadey.The soundtrack is really weak. There's some good songs, but there's only a few songs per station. One good thing about the soundtrack is a station dedicated to Adult Swim songs. I mean, Unknown Hinson is in a video game now! Unlike before, you can't go to the record store and buy new tracks or anything either.There's still a lot to do, but it's more of the same. If you were bored in SR2, you're not going to find much more to do here. I like that it's the same, but I wish it had an overwhelming amount of new content and nothing stripped from the previous game. I will say I enjoy SR3 a ton more since it's basically the same thing with a much more steady frame-rate and what seems like a much bigger area to kill everyone in. Plus, you get SR2 for free with purchase right now. Two games for one is never a bad thing.At this time, I haven't enough touched co-op yet. I don't think there's any other modes online except for co-op.These are just general impressions. I don't think the game sucks and reviews always tend to lean towards a more negative aspect of the game. Really, the only thing negative in the game is how much was stripped without a fair trade. Maybe a free \"Unkut\" pack will come out and we'll get much more content later.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2011"}

Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions.

If there's only one game you play or buy for the XBOX, make sure it's HALO.This is how all First person shooters should be done.  Not only have the graphics and game engine taken an evolutionary step, but the enemy/ally AI is so incredibly lifelike!The sniper rifle has never been implimented so effectively the game as it has been in HALO.  Your allies ACTUALLY cover you and proceed to mission objectives all while verbally communicating with you.  The congratulatory remarks when you take out a difficult enemy with the sniper rifle help to immerse you in the game even more.  The vehicles you can pilot are too cool for words...the sensation of flight is effectively conveyed with the Ghost ships.There are a few drawbacks, but these do not in any way detract from HALO's legendary gameplay:  Later levels can get monotonous.  The Library and fighting wave after wave of the &quot;Flood&quot; gets repetitive.  The later missions suffer from a lack of ally soldiers to assist you.  The difficulty can be a little much for some players, but you can turn down the game's difficulty if it's too hard.  The final level is somewhat frustrating and there is an instance where the framerate on that level slows to an absolute crawl--you can count the frame rate on your fingers--but thankfully it only happens in one instance and is over soon.This is a great first effort.

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world.

Gee whiz, ethel, you say Halo 2 didn't work in your pentium hard-drive?  There is a REASON that it says \"only for Xbox\" on the top of the case!  You can't put an Xbox game in a god**mn PC.  You put Xbox games in an Xbox.  What you did would be like me putting an Atari game into the playstation.  It.  Just.  Doesn't.  Work.  Before you randomly buy a game for your niece, why don't you get some basic terminology instead of assuming \"wow, I'm such a moron that I think EVERY game will work on PC!\"Second...ethel said that Microsoft was un-Christian when they made this game.  Just because someone isn't Christian doesn't mean they're terrible people, ethel.  Besides, Microsoft didn't make this game, Bungie Studios did.  That happens to be another instance in which you have no clue what you are trying to say.So...ladies and gentlemen who read this review, please learn from idiotic ethel's mistake and do not put an xbox game into your freaking computer.  Put it into the xbox.  Little did ethel know to actually take the blindfold off and look at Halo 2's box to see that it says in bright green letters \"ONLY FOR XBOX.\"  As if that wasn't enough warning.You see, if ethel were a bigger idiot, the world would be in serious trouble.Now onto the actual halo 2 bit: buy this game, it is a good one.  Not as good as Halo 1 personally.  Halo 1 was more about aiming.  It is easier to aim in Halo 2, but it requires a lot of teamwork.  So if you prefer teamwork over precision, buy this game.  Or if you don't, that's okay, campaign is also enjoyable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Great Platforming Experience","reviewText":"Insomniac games is mostly known for creating Spyro the Dragon back on the original Playstation.  And when the PS2 came out, there were probably millions of fans waiting for a follow up to that series on the PS2.  Instead Insomniac Games developed a different kind of tale.  One that would serve as a nice little compliment to Naughty Dog's Jak and Daxter (similar to how Spyro served as a nice compliment to Crash Bandicoot).  It was a game all about weapons, explosions and destruction.  The game was Ratchet and Clank.  It came out in 2002, sold millions of copies and went on to start one of the core franchises on the PS2.  Ratchet and Clank was, and still is, a triumph.Ratchet and Clank begins on Planet Veldin.  Ratchet belongs to a race known as the Lombax.  As he's fixing a ship to one day get off the planet, another ship crashes down.  Checking it out, Ratchet finds nothing more than a small robot.  This is Clank and as it turns out he's carrying an urgent message.  A man by the name of Drek is taking pieces of land from other worlds to rebuild his own.  Leaving the planets he takes from in shambles with no other alternative than to be destroyed or abandoned.  Clank wants to go find the legendary hero Qwark, and fixes the ship Ratchet in exchange for help to find him.  Ratchet, however, doesn't seem to care too much about Drek at the start, but slowly gets involved in the quest anyway.There isn't exactly much story to Ratchet and Clank.  It's not weak storytelling by any means, but the games to follow would do a lot of things so much better.  All the plot twists are pretty obvious twists, for instance.  At the very least the voice acting is great in most areas and there's a good sense of humor about things.  That's not to say there are no hiccups with the storytelling.  The villain is no where near as fun as what the game would produce later on in the series.  Likewise, the story doesn't draw you in nearly as much.  For the Playstation 2, however, it's certainly an achievement with all the right bits falling into place.  For a game made in 2002 there are a lot of beautifully crafted cutscenes that still hold up well, even to this day.  It's like watching a Saturday morning cartoon at times.Ratchet and Clank is well aware that it's greatest strength is not in the storytelling.  It's not Ratchet and Clank's weakness either, but it is to say that Insomniac Games knows that the strength is in the gameplay because it's nearly flawless.  Throughout much of the game you will play as Ratchet.  Though Clank gets small segments.  Ratchet primarily roams with Clank on his back.  You have a nice arsenal of weapons at your disposal.  You'll start off with pretty basic weapons such as the Bomb Glove and Blaster but you'll soon be firing off missiles and planting decoys and using flamethrowers.  The weapons are usually well balanced, enough that none of them will ever become useless as the game goes on, but there is definitely a \"best\" weapon for many situations.  It's interesting to see what all of them do, but you'll no doubt find yourself with a favorite at some point.The game has a pretty simplistic flow to it as well.  You'll often go to various planets and complete specific missions by taking one path or another that leads to the completion of different objectives.  Not EVERY objective must be completed on a planet.  The main goal is usually to find the infobot or use various items to learn the coordinates to another planet where you can continue the journey.  For the most part Ratchet and Clank is quite a linear game as you can never really get too far ahead of yourself.  And as you explore each planet there are plenty of shortcuts that will take you right back to the very beginning where you can get back in your ship and fly to another planet.Ratchet and Clank is not an easy game but it's not too taxing either.  Even if you fail a couple of times you'll start to learn the ins and outs of whereever it is you're not doing so well.  The game is easy to learn but difficult to master.  That being said, you'll rarely feel as though the game is being unfair.  Most danger presents itself early enough that there's no trial and error about it.  There will be some moments that will likely give you trouble but nothing that will keep you down so long you'll quit in frustration.There are small moments where you'll play as Clank and he controls quite differently.  While you'll still be running and jumping, Clank doesn't have weapons.  Rather he controls several tiny bots that can be ordered to attack, wait, follow you or enter into various stations that require it.  It adds a slight puzzle element to the game, but Clank's moments aren't quite as action packed.Ratchet and Clank has a lot to keep you going and it's a well structured game.  The story isn't much, but it's rather enjoyable just the same.  The story isn't really the focus here, the gameplay is.  That's not to say that production values of Ratchet and Clank are bad, though.  By far, Ratchet and Clank is one of the best looking games on the PS2.  And because of its colorful aesthetics still looks good even to this day.  This includes in HD.  There's a lot of life in the universe of Ratchet and Clank.  It's all around easy on the eyes.  The music, however, may be the best part.  There was no slumping on this.  Each planet sounds strangely in tune with the action.  All the moments are lovely and playful when they need to be and a bit darker and more perilous when they need to be as well.  If there's one thing Insomniac games really knows how to do: It's make a good sounding and looking game.For those that love adventure, Ratchet and Clank is nearly a perfect package.  It offers just about everything you want from a solid platformer.  If you enjoy platformers, it's not to be missed.  And it just so happens the HD collection is out there if you happen to have a PS3 and don't want to dust off your PS2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2012"}

You can also customize aspects that were previously only doable via modding, such as hair color for any hair style, regardless of what type it is, and adjusting realistic muscle mass that actually shows, realistic fat, and while female breast size is still unrealistically small, they still show a lot more if your character has more fat than muscle.- The graphics are cleaner and far less demanding with loading screens than The Sims 2.  Things load faster.- More stuff, more options, more base-game changes and additions.The bad:- The CAS system has several fundamental flaws---much of the Sims' face is customizable, but a great many parts aren't.  Most notably---the neck.  The base Sim neck is disgustingly thick even for females, and there is absolutely no way to adjust this at all.  None.  So my petite little female Sim has the neck of a teenage football player.  There is also no way to adjust the size of the eyes or color of the lips.  You can pretty much adjust absolutely nothing except the face, and whether your sim is fat or thin or muscular.  You cannot adjust any parts of the body at all.- The CAS system is revamped in a dense and almost incomprehensible way where \"extras\" and \"advanced\" functions are hidden behind buttons that don't look like buttons, meaning I had no idea that certain hairstyles such as ponytails and the like are hidden away from the main hair selection, because it's considered \"hair with accessories\".- Initial gameplay is pretty much just the same as The Sims 2.  There's very little real change so much as it just feels as though they made The Sims 2 again with a different game engine.- The entire neighborhood is alive, regardless of whether you're there or not.  Some people would probably like this idea, but I don't think they would enjoy it very much to play as one family then discover some time later that one of their favorite families all died in a fire while they were busy playing with another creation.  It's also a hassle to get out of playing in one household to get into anotherRe-starting from the start!  With this new release, what does EA get to do?Re-release everything they did with The Sims and The Sims 2 expansion packs!It's been a trend in Sim history.  Just look back: The Sims had \"Vacation\", The Sims 2 had \"Bon Voyage\".  The Sims had \"Unleashed\", The Sims 2 had the far less creatively named, \"Pets\".  The Sims had \"House Party\" and \"Hot Date\", The Sims 2 had \"Nightlife\".And now The Sims 3 re-plays that process by which The Sims had seven expansion packs, and The Sims 2 had eight expansion packs AND ten \"stuff\" packs, none of which were free, starting with a sparse base game, and getting people to buy up the dozen expansion packs to add more stuff.  More of the same, if you've already been suckered into buying the expansion packs for the first two games.I am completely and utterly sure that The Sims 3 will feature \"re-re-releases\" of the exact same \"new\" features with more and more expansion packs for the new game.And yet you could load up your Sims 2 and all its expansion packs and have virtually the same game.  Just like with DVD and Blu-Ray, obviously The Sims 3 (Blu Ray) is better looking and is different and more updated, The Sims 2 (DVD) still has all the same features.  Almost nothing has changed.  It's more of the same.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2009"}

It combined detailed 3D graphics with the frantic action of 2D platformers and topped it all off with a sinister gothic theme. Unfortunately, Devil May Cry 2 is only a shadow of those things. The gameplay remains very similar to the first game...but the story, enemy design, dialogue, and weapons all seem slapped together without much thought. The main character is still Dante, but he is also accompanied by a female playable character named Lucia (whatever happened to Trish?). The areas are now much more wide open...which is fitting for a urban setting, but most enemies just let you pummel them to death from afar. It lacks the sense of urgency and danger that was present throughout the first game. Everything just has a rushed and unbalanced feel to it. It's a shame Capcom let this happen to a series that showed so much promise. If you are looking for a good 3D action game, I suggest Rygar or Shinobi instead (or the first Devil May Cry if you don't already own it).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2003"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Surprisingly good and very creepy","reviewText":"When it comes to first person shooters, survival horror, or mature rated games, your choices on the DS are pretty limited.  Besides Metroid Prime: Hunters and Resident Evil: Deadly Silence, there isn't a whole lot that Nintendo's smash hit handheld offers in terms of either genre, but Dementium: The Ward more than makes up for that, and ends up being a surprisingly good and very creepy and atmospheric blast.  You start off trapped in a blood soaked hospital with no idea of what has happened or who you are yourself, and all you're armed with is a flashlight and a nightstick.  Eventually, you'll come across a gun, and from that point forward, Dementium is all about shooting and puzzle solving.  The game is also quite challenging, as you can't shine your flashlight and fire your weapon at the same time, and the game's dark and gloomy atmosphere only heightens the creep factor.  Graphically, Dementium looks great for a DS game, and the lighting and sound effects are wonderfully utilized as well.  With everything that Dementium has going for it, it also has it's share of drawbacks.  Most notably is the game's map which really doesn't help you much in figuring out where you are or where to go.  Also, the monstrous enemies you'll face have an annoying habit of respawning in a room once you go back in it, which will find you exherting effort that doesn't really pay off when backtracking.  Negatives aside, Dementium: The Ward is a surprisingly good survival horror FPS for the DS that delivers the goods.  If you own a DS and have been yearning for a new and good game that falls under either genre, you should definitely give Dementium: The Ward a deserved look.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000H96C9M","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"An Excellent MMO That Set a New Standard...","reviewText":"WoW is a MMO that tens of millions have tried and millions still continue to play.  When you see MMO a picture of WoW is the description pretty much.  It is the most talked about MMO in the West and the most played.  It set the standard for future MMOs pretty much.  While features in WoW have been used before its creation, WoW polished them and has created a system that is extremely user friendly and easy to pick up.  WoW brings a variety of adventure to the table and makes it so almost anyone could pick up a keyboard and mouse and crack a smile..** GAMEPLAY **The Core of any MMO, and an aspect WoW makes sure to fill consistently.  There is tons to do in this game, standard for almost any MMO, and it is handled very fluidly.  You pick your server, race and class.  From that point you pretty much have the MMO grind; getting quests, killing mobs, farming crafting mats etc etc. Just like any other MMO!  However, WoW has a multitude of systems setup to make life a little easier for the gamer.Once you pick a class you will have 3 skill trees. For example, Paladin, you can go Holy, Protection or Retribution.  Mix the trees up a little bit for a balanced build or invest heavily in Retribution for DPS with perhaps a little Protection for some added Armor/Defense.  It is a fairly simple system that works effectively at showing you each trees full potential from the start.  Another aspect of the gameplay that I like.. in fact.. down right LOVE  is the dungeon finder and PvP setup(see PvP Mechanics below).  The Dungeon Finder is a must for any MMO at this point.  Pretty much rather than sitting around going LFG(looking for group) and spamming to get a party for your dungeon; all you do is open your dungeon finder... click the dungeon you want to run (if you are of proper level it will be unlocked) and queue up.  When a proper party is found you get whisked away to your dungeon.  A great alternative to the older system where you had to manually find a party; then everyone had to hoof it down to the dungeon and summon one another (pretty much it is a time saver)There is so much to get into with WoW it is impossible to fit everything into a review. Pretty much WoW takes the time to make sure the gameplay element is solid and enjoyable.  The earlier areas have had experience boosted and quests \"simplified\" down pretty much to get you through to the end game areas faster.  In a way it makes the game ultra easy but you do get to the end game raids much faster so that is a plus.** PvP MECHANICS **Another aspect of WoW that has been polished to a fine shine.  With WoW you can PvP once you unlock the battlegrounds arena(level restricted).  At this point just like your dungeon finder you can queue up for PvP matches.  Quest until the queue fills and you are instantly ported to the PvP match where upon completion you get returned to where you were. PvP has many forms in WoW.  From simple CTF, capture and defend objectives to straight up conquer the other teams base.  I always enjoyed to random queue because of the variety to the objectives.  Of course there is also events that take place where participating in a certain PvP event type grants bonuses.  When PvP'ing you earn currency and can use this currency to purchase PvP based gear; the PvP version of High Tier raiding gear.The Mechanics you find in PvP are simple, fluid and are designed to get you into matches as fast as possible while allowing you to continue questing or crafting etc.** OVERALL **There is not much more to say about WoW.  The game has been around for about 6 years and it shows.  There is a very high level of polish and optimization.  There is great care put into the game to make sure it stays this way also.  It is an MMO one could sit back and casually play, and with each session make big strides towards level cap.  With that said the game does have its share of problems.  It isn't so much broken mechanics or gameplay but just the overall nature of the game.WoW is a fantastic game, don't get me wrong as I played it for over 2 years, but there are elements which I feel hurt the game in the long run at this point:- There is just no point to the lower leveled areas at this point.  The leveling is fast and plenty of solo content to get you to cap; BUT as good as this can be it hurts the first time player. There is a lack of importance to the earlier levels.  Attempting to run early level dungeons might be difficult since you can end up out-leveling them before you even get the dungeon quests.- Economy unbalance. The economy is just totally bonkers at times... and while add-ons have helped balance it out it still doesn't change the fact prices are going through the roof on items.  Gold seems to be the new copper at times and this only promotes gold farming / gold buying- Gold farmers/buying is rampant.  While it won't interfere with your gameplay all that much it is a rampant problem.  While subscribed to WoW my email was just bombed nonstop with WoW phishing links, gold buying spammers, fake account links.  Unsubscribe and the amount of spam dropped 90%!  It is a major problem that Blizzard really has not addressed and in fact made it worse in some aspects.- ADDICTIVE!!!  Beware!  The ease and fluidity of this game makes it very addictive.  The queuing systems and all... It is so easy to forget what time it is as you queue up for matches.  I know a few managers that ask new employees if they play WoW because they know how addictive the game could be.- At level cap, PvP and Raiding is all you got.  There just was little point to actually doing PvE content since there basically was none (unlike games like Tabula Rasa, Rift, Final Fantasy 11 and Guild Wars; where there was tons of PvE variety at cap)The problem is just the ease of execution for me. The game is fantastic but there is little emphasis on the earlier levels so you just blow through them to get to level cap and PvP / Raid over and over again.  There isn't much to do besides that on a PvE level so at level cap if you do not have the time to RAID and dislike PvP you will be pretty bored at level cap; unless you want to run standard dungeons all day.  But, with all that said, WoW is a must play game though even with its problems(5 stars).  Even if you hit Cap and find nothing to do.. the trip is worth the price of admission; and who knows... the structure of the game might just turn you into a PvP/Raid junkie after all.  It did for me as WoW was the first game where I actually enjoyed doing Raids and PvP content.** NOTE: This is the Battle Chest edition. It contains WoW + Burning Crusade Expansion.  To get full content unlocked you will need to purchase the Lich King and Cataclysm expansions as well.** NOTE: Blizzard is offering a free trial of World of Warcraft.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

However, instead of being blown to oblivion like thousands of others, he is instead granted superpowers that involve lightening.The story of inFAMOUS continues after Cole awakens from the blast, and later realizes that he was the center, and cause, of it.  He also finds out why it happened, who made it happen, why he was involved, and among other things.  inFAMOUS's story is one that is actually very well thought-out using bits and pieces from stories we have all heard countless times.  Someone travels back in time, someone has special powers, others do as well, etc.  But what makes it work is HOW those elements come together in this game.  It is very well-done, and I applaud the creators for such an amazing single player experience.\"But Jeffery, what happens during this game?  What makes it great besides the story?  How does it play?\"Calm down, I'm getting there.To start off, Cole's superpowers involve lightning, as mentioned before.  He can shoot bolts from both his hands (you can switch the shoulder camera by hitting R3, or pressing down on the right analog stick (for those that still don't know what R3 is)), he can shoot a ball of lightning (Megawatt Hammer), he can push objects with his Shockwave, and even create a lightning storm that causes lightning to strike the ground, electrocuting anyone in its path.Also, to make the game even more interesting, you can either play as the good guy or bad guy......or both, actually.  I, myself have two saves: one with me as the good Cole, and me as the bad Cole.  What determines your behavior is actually how you play the game.  For example, sometimes when walking around, you'll see a pedestrian hanging from a string, while others are around him, accusing the person of stealing food.  You can either shoot him down to spare his life, or just walk away and leave him hanging there.  If you shoot him down, you'll gain good karma, and walking away adds evil karma.  If you obtain enough good karma, you'll reach the rank of Hero.  An excessive amount of evil karma will make you Infamous.The characters in the game also react to your karma.  Another example, if it's good, Trish (Cole's wife in the game) will be proud of you for helping people.  But being evil will make her loathe you and blame everything that's wrong with the city on you.  When your friend Zeke goes to the hospital (don't worry, I won't spoil it), she'll either wonder why (good karma) or ask what did you do to him (evil karma).  When you're walking down the street near pedestrians, they'll either cheer you on (good karma) or run away, punch you, or throw stones at you (evil karma).  Having evil karma also changes Cole's appearance.  He's more pale, has what-looks-like lightning graphics in his head in black, and blood on his clothes.  Good Cole has more of a human tone to him, with none of the features from him being evil.Gameplay-wise, it's more of a platformer.  You jump from building to building to get to objectives or another mission, and sometimes you try to solve platforming puzzles while you're in the sewers to get to your objective and to come back from underneath the city.  Nothing really new here, but it works well.  Not TOO well, though.  But I'll get to that later.Some of the missions involve you saving your character's best friend, Zeke, from certain death by the hands of various enemies, and others have you chasing down a chopper in order to find someone before the people in the chopper can capture the person.  It doesn't seem TOO repetitive since no mission is 100% exactly like the other, but some missions do start out the same, such as restoring power to the city or figuring out what happened to a person that ultimately lead to their death.Now what I really REALLY like about this game is it's challenging.  The final boss on Hard took me a few tries before he finally went down.  He even has an attack that spawns bigger versions of himself.  If one hits you, an image of his face flashes on your screen, and you die.  It creeped me out the first time it happened because I wasn't expecting it.  My first playthrough was on Medium, and I had just finished it on Hard minutes before I began typing this.  I though Medium was hard enough since, in some parts, there aren't too many enemies on screen at once in this game, at most maybe 10 to 15, but with that many people shooting at you, some with shotguns that deal great damage, to turrets that tear holes through you in seconds, to enemies using RPG's and miniguns, and even those that are basically suicide bombers, it can get pretty hectic quickly, especially since the miniguns alone are enough to kill you with hardly no effort.  Even with the powers on your side, the game doesn't become easy to the point where you're bored.  Enemies can hide on top of buildings, can appear literally out of no where, and will sit on turrets right in front of where you need to be, trying to kill you.But the only thing bad I have to say about this game is there are times where Cole will just simply NOT grab something.  It gets very frustrating when you're trying to hurry up and complete something, but there have been points where Cole will literally...and I mean LITERALLY, have his hands up to grab something, only to have it completely go through his hands, me falling to my death, and having to start over.  It actually happened five times during a mission, as he would land on a platform, and as it move, he would fall right off.  I figured out that holding the X button while trying to land on a platform solved the issue, but I wish I had known that the first five times I tried landing on it.  I'm also not a fan of how the game tells important parts of the story.  Instead of some epic CG, it's more like a comic book.  The character explains what happens and images on the screen let you somewhat see what happen.  It's not bad, but I'm not a fan.  And for those that care about graphics, they're good, but not amazing.  The anti-aliasing is almost non-existent in some parts.  It's so obvious, it's painful.  It really only happens about four times throughout the entire game, but when it does......yea, it's bad.Overall, inFAMOUS is an amazing single player game.  The story is well thought-out, the platforming elements are fun and can entertain those that aren't even fans of platformers like myself.  It also provides an interesting twist to the end, and even before the end, events happen that some wouldn't have been able to predict.  The game always has things for you to do even after you've beaten it, and honestly, I don't understand how anyone could dislike this game.btw, for a few weeks after this goes up, it's available FREE on PSN as their Welcome Back program.  So you have nothing to lose for downloading this game, but a lot to gain.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2011"}

The graphics are beautiful, the controls are easy and the same from A Link to the Past, and for the first time, Link will become a moving portrait whenever he merges to a wall and he can move around. For the first time, this game had no ammo for arrows and bombs, so the magic energy will be drained from your weapons whenever you use them, but the magic energy can be refilled without magic ammo, and moving on the walls after being merged to the walls. Like Oracle of Seasons, Ages, and Link's Awakening, Link can use two weapons at the same time. For the first time, you will rent or buy weapons instead looking for them in dungeons and upgrade them to be more powerful, but if you die the merchant will take your rented weapons back except if you buy them. As a loyal fan of A Legend of Zelda, buy this game and do not listen to the negative reviews.

I tried the demos and didn't like them that much... but after actually playing the games from start to finish im glad I gave them a chance! If you love shooters then this game is for you! The story is interesting, showing an alternative timeline where Earth gets invaded by Aliens in the late 40's. The weapons are also very unique and a blast to use! All three games also have a co-op mode which I believe has a separate campaign for the 2 sequels. There are also online modes but the first two games have pretty much empty servers and the third game usually only has a server or 2 filled with a couple dozen people. If you have a PS3 and want to try a shooter that has unique weapons and story then this exclusive 3 pack is well worth the $40.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2013"}

I had read many subpar reviews about this title so I wasn't expecting much when I finally got around to playing it.  I was happy to find that the game was quite a fun run and gun.  Here are my thoughts;Pros+ Respectable graphics. Absolutely no framerate issues at all no matter how much was going on on screen.+ Amazingly fun remote vehicles/weapons.  The helicopter drones with rockets and machine guns were a blast to use.+ Fast paced action+ Abundance of enemies with repectable AI.+ Straight forward and unlinear gameplay.  There's no question as to what your objectives are but the maps generally (see Cons below) give you enough freedom to approach the mission how you want.+ Decent amount of vehicles to drive, most of which have great handling.+ Respectable soundtrack that lends to the futuristic action feel of the game.  Only a few cheesy guitar rock riffs thrown in.  A few of the tracks are almost exact rip offs of John Powell's scores for the Bourne films, not necessarily a bad thing.+ Guns have a great sound and feel.  I play a lot of FPS games and I tend to notice when the development team actually put time into using authentic sounds for the weapons.  I noticed immediately a difference in this game vs other FPS'.  There was also a wide variety of weapons to use throughout the game.  My only complaint was that you didn't carry weapons over from mission to mission.Cons- Forgettable story- Single player campaign is too short.  I finished the game in less than a weekend.- Helicopters are a lesson in frustration to fly- Terribly annoying messages for \"leaving the battlefield/abandoning your mission\" that really limit your freedom of movement while trying to accomplish your mission objectives.  I remember a few maps where I was literally forced into the open amidst dozens of enemies versus flanking and using cover to eliminate them.  Quite frustrating.- Narrator/Reporter is pretty much non-existant during gameplay yet he's supposed to be travelling with your company of soldiers.All in all I was very pleased with this title and found it a ton of fun to play through.  I would definitely recommend it to fellow FPS fans.  Give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2009"}

The intense racing, blazing sense of speed, nerve-wracking crashes, and traffic-weaving are all amazing, and (I thought) unmatched among arcade racers.Enter Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2.EA's cop chaser came out about the time of Burnout 2: Point of Impact, which meant I was having such a blast with Burnout that I completely ignored NFS.  But I kept hearing about how cool NFS was, so I gave it a rent, after exhausting Burnout, and was shocked out of my socks by the result:  I think NFS: HP2 is a superior game, all things considered.I will admit that Burnout 2 looks better, runs faster, and has a certain European style that I find highly appealing - not to mention the immortal Crash Mode.  Hot Pursuit 2 might not have the technical advantages of Burnout, but what it lacks in style, it more than makes up for with substance.First off, having licensed cars DOES make a difference.  Blasting round a curve in a Ferrari is miles more sexy than speeding through the streets in a Sports Car.  And what licenses:  Porsche, Lambroghini, Aston Martin, Jaguar, BMW, Corvette!  All modeled accurately, and gorgeously - there are over forty cars in all.NFS's gameplay has more depth as well.  While Burnout can seem at times like a tech demo for its superlative crash physics, NFS concentrates strictly on the racing.  The well-rendered courses are long, with single laps lasting three minutes, and riddled with shortcuts that can make or break the race.  Should I risk taking the narrow back road through the canyon and possibly nab first place, or play it safe and hope the other guys screw up?  EA deserves a big hand for producing some of the most devious clever track designs you're likely to see.You have a wealth of options to customize the races as well.  All the cars have two different settings for handling:  Classic (i.e. safe) or Extreme (for the powerslide freaks).  You can race with commuter traffic on or off, car damage on or off, lap number, controller configuration, AI difficulty, weather conditions, camera views, HUD, car color.....I hope you're getting the picture.  You can even adjust the licensed in-game soundtrack to play instrumentals only.  Not since the Dreamcast's beloved Metropolis Street Racer has an arcade racer had so many options.There are several race modes as well, which break down roughly into two categories:  Hot Pursuit (i.e. the cops are lurking) and World Racing (no cops).  Each mode has a 30+ race bracket with individual challenges, which get progressively tougher.  The races also range from timed runs to GPs to some where you drive as the police themselves, chasing down reckless speeders under a strict time limit.  Whereas Burnout can be beaten within a rental period, it'll take quite a while to unlock everything in HP2.  And the variety, constant unlocked items, and non-linear branching gameplay ensures that it never gets repetitive.While World Racing is noteworthy in its own right, Hot Pursuit is where the gloves come off.  As you & your opponents (or a friend) barrel along the twisting roads, the police are waiting.  You've got a radar detector that lets you know when you're targeted, as well as a scanner that contains some brilliant cop commentary:  \"27 to Central, I'm tracking a green Lotus Elisse that's doing 100+ and driving on the shoulder.  Let's test his air bags.\"  Ha ha - just try it.  Elude the black & whites for a while, and they might call for a roadblock.  Or a spike strip.  Or a bomb-dropping helicopter.  Yeah, it's all over-the-top, but oh man, what a rush:  four cops on your tail, weaving around commuter traffic, dodging bombs from above, all while hanging onto first place by the skin of your teeth.  Even the most traffic-choked Burnout streets didn't get this insane.  Then you hear that police cruiser smash into a wall, and your scanner says:  \"27 to Dispatch - my cruiser is out of commission.  Am unable to continue pursuit.  Over.\"  Awwww yeah!Did I mention you can play as the cop and chase down your friends......even calling in the chopper and roadblocks to stop them?  And that you can unlock Corvette and Murcielago versions of a police cruiser?  Let the trash-talking begin.My intent is not to bash Burnout 2 at all - it's a definite keeper based on the amazing graphics and Crash Mode - but as far as pure pulse-pounding intense arcade racing action, I've never played anything as fun and insane as Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2.  Toss sim racing out the window and smash down the accelerator - this game'll give you whiplash!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2002"}

I rank it in my top 10 favorite games actually.First off, I want to get the talk of how bad this port supposedly is as this is STILL mentioned to this day whenever there is talk of Valve and the Ps3. This is a great port!! The only time frame rate issues happen are during explosions and when glass breaks(have no idea about the second one) Rarely is game play affected at all. Everything runs smoothly and load times are about the same as the Xbox version(yes I have played both.) Plus the PS3 version gets the exclusive fast save feature!

All seven missions take place on the same open-ended map, though guard placement, weapon loadouts, and time of day (nighttime, rainy, sunny) can change, and each has a normal and hard difficulty setting. There are also challenges or \"trials\" to unlock and complete within each mission. The main story mission took me about 80 minutes my first time through. It's fairly short. When attempting an S-Rank, I did it in about 20. It's basically a two-part extraction mission, and acts as a brief prologue to the yet unreleased \"MGS V: The Phantom Pain,\" but probably isn't essential. I will say it has one of the most intense moments during its closing cinema that I've ever experienced. All told, I've spent over 12 hours doing everything (100%-ing the trophies). I should also note that this game looks and runs phenomenally well at a flawless 1080p/60fps, and is the best-playing \"MGS\" game to date.

{"product_name":"B00503E9FY","description":"","reviewerName":"Clayton J. Gibbs \"Horror Soundtrack Collector\"","summary":"It's still Modern Warfare territory and that's not a bad thing","reviewText":"So after reading a lot of reviews which read \"same as MW2\" I thought I would write a more objective review.  Yes, this is a Modern Warfare game and as such, it should and will follow in the footsteps of it's predecessors.  Is it exactly the same?  Not at all.  On a campaign, single player level, it's just as cinematic as the other MW titles, but I feel it has gone beyond in terms of tying the stories together and wrapping up the series with a more in-depth storyline.  The cut-scenes are fast paced and intense and while they might lack the initial shock factor of MW2's red-dawnish flavor, they are original in their own conception.  Those who expected more I think really wanted to see MW2 repeated.  The campaign was as long as the others and I never once felt disappointed or frustrated.Now onto multiplayer...Of course there are new perks, killstreaks, etc. and they are all pretty impressive and useful.  I thought it was funny there were several from the game 'Homefront'.  Nothing off the scale, but at least they are somewhat fresh and original.  The perks were standard with a few new added and the weapons streaks included some perks of their own which made the series more versatile.  The character types were all unique and easy to distinguish, which in my opinion has been an Infinity Ward multiplayer plus.  Here's my complaint about multiplayer...  The multiplayer in MW's always seem crowded with useless garbage.  The papers flying around are a nice effect, but every single board has boxes and cans strewn about and junk you can't jump up on.  Is this a big buzz kill?  No it isn't, it's just the same on every level.  Personally, I like levels which have snow in them and MW3 has one so far that no one ever seems to want to vote for, so despite my 18 hours in, I've never played it.  I thought Black OPs was horrible at first, but then after plenty of online hours I realized I like it better than MW because the crap lying around a level could be used to your advantage and not prevent you from seeing an assailant.  The level designs in Black Ops are more memorable and MW3 has some great 'looking' levels, but boring and useless areas.The Spec Ops mode is much improved from MW2 and has it's own leveling up system separate from the multiplayer.  Haven't played it too much, but it's a hoot none-the-less.If you are not an online player, the single player is an amazing experience, but not for the full price.  If you've always liked all versions, you should like this so long as you treat it as it's own MW game and not a repeat of the other two.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

Tilley Jr. \"goatman_1\"","summary":"Civilization meets Age of Empires","reviewText":"I knew it would take a great game to pull me away from Age of Mythology which I've been playing like an addict for over 6 months now.  This is the game I was waiting for.  As a veteran Player of both the Civilization series (and the far superior Alpha Centauri) and Age Of Empire series, the similarities to both series was immediately obvious.  It shoudln't come as any surprise since this game was built under the Microsoft banner (makers of the AOE series) but developed by former Civilization creators. The end result is a game so close to perfection you are forced to wonder why no one had though of it earlier.While the gameplay is real time, most of the interface concepts and strategy has been adopted from turn based strategy.  Basically combat plays like AOE, but city management plays like CIV.  It's the best of both worlds really. The depth of research, complex alliances combined with shrewd AI make this one of the deepest real-time strategy games ever made.  Probably the deepest.  The use of nukes, aircraft, and huge armies result in huge bloody battles that every real-time player looks for.One of the best concepts taken from the turn based games is the way cities are the key to conquest.  Cities can be raided and completely taken over by hostile armies.  Cities determine the size and shape of national borders.  Operating outside of national borders causes your troops to suffer attrition damage if improperly equipped.  Therefore, real-time players used to &quot;rushing' will find they must adopt a whole new strategy.  Armies might be the key to conquest, but it's developement that will govern their success.There are two basic modes to the single player game: quick battle and the campaign.  Players of the campaign will notice similarities to another hybrid type series: Total War.  There is a huge world map where armies can be moved around like game pieces.  After making your moves, the game goes into real time mode with objectives based on the decisions and moves you made previously.  Unlike Total War where the real time is strictly combat, the real time portion of the game also forces you to build resources and raise armies if necessary.  Exceptional victories are rewarded with game cards that can be played prior to going real time, another added bonus that gives depth to the game.While their are few real ground-breaking concepts in this game, by taking the best concepts of some of the greatest strategy games ever made is a bold leap forward.  Also, after playing Age of Mythology and Warcraft 3 with their beautiful 3D engines, the 2d graphics are a step back, but it's easily forgiven.  I've been playing this game for awhile now, and it seems like I learn somethign new every time I play.  Liek the best strategy games, there are a lot of layers and a lot of different paths to victory.  Any strategy game fan should pick this one up regardless of their preferences.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2003"}

I was very skeptical about it when I got it, but my skepticism soon turned to delight.  Unlike the miserable failure that was Castlevania 64, this game is loaded with the same type of RPG-ish gameplay from previous Castlevanias.  You can equip armor (although it doesnt show on the character), and you can find equippable items, of which 2 (and eventually 3) can be worn at a time.  There is an Encyclopedia of enemies kept as you encounter them, so you can keep track of the items they drop, or whether or not they have any items to drop and if they have dropped them yet.  The sub-weapons are once again in the game, and by collecting sacred Orbs, the effects of the sub-weapons are altered dramatically, so in actuality you have many sub-weapons at your disposal at any given time simply by switching orbs, though you can only equip one type of sub-weapon at a time.  There are 5 variations of the whip, acquired by finding and defeating secret boss enemies.  There are also magical relics that can only be equipped one at a time, which will help you gain access to new areas or help you defeat your enemies.The story itself is nothing spectacular, though this game covers the origin of the castlevania series, and the whole reason why the Belmonts have become vampire hunters.  The voice acting is decent and not as bad as some other games in the series (namely Symphony of the Night, which was also one of the best games).  As usual, there is a great soundtrack with the game.The overall gameplay itself is alot of fun.  There are many skills to be learned as you progress, which seem to happen either by chance, or by random mashing of the buttons.  You will learn most of your attack combos as you fight large groups of enemies.  While the combo attacks are a little complicated at first, its definitely nothign that will hinder your gameplay.  It takes only a few minutes to learn the combos and once you find how easy they are, you'll probably remember them and use them effortlessly.  If you have any confusion on skills, there is an easy tutorial available to you at the beginning of the game, which is integrated into actual gameplay.  The whip jumping is a little tough at first, but soon becomes second nature.  None of the controls in the game are very hard to learn at all.There is one thing that stands out in terms of control, however.  The game's inventory system is by far the WORST inventory system I have ever seen in a game of this type.  You cannot go into the pause menu to change your equipment, whether you are in a fight or not.  You must always do it real-time, as you are fighting or moving throughout the areas.  If you happen to be using a whip that doesn't harm a specific enemy or you need to use a health potion really quick, then good luck surviving the encounter.  Pretty much the only time I ever got killed in this game is when I was swarmed with enemies and I could not get through the awful inventory system fast enough to get a health potion.  There are also many encounters that you are forced to fight in, since the doors lock.  When you spend so much time backtracking in the game, you will probably want to skip fighting as you get much farther into the game, but those locked doors keep you stuck in there.  Annoying, but the Inventory system is definitely the worst aspect of this game.  If it weren't for the god awful inventory system and other minimal problems, this would've been a 5 star game.  You get accustomed to it, but it is always an annoyance.In terms of problems, the camera is a little iffy at times.  You can be pounded by enemies you wont even know are there because the camera just won't turn around to fce their direction.  The targeting system is ok, but you'll probably be swinging around in the wrong direction a few times.  Some of the fights get impossibly hard, and the 2-part final battle is extremely annoying, since you have to go through it completely again if you should happen to die.The rewards for beating the game include an extra character and other things.  Castlevania fans will probably really enjoy this game, since the flaws are easy to look past, even if they are annoying.  While I prefer Castlevania in its 2D roots, I don't own a Game Boy and never plan on owning one, so i'll just have to settle for this offering, which is a great one at that, but I would love to see another 2D castlevania on the Playstation 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2003"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J998","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas A. Zulli \"Tazz\"","summary":"It has begun....again","reviewText":"With the release of \"Mortal Kombat vs DC\", fans have been wanting a new MK game that would bring the series back to its roots. Luckily the people over at \"Netherealm\" studios heard and decided to do just that. What they gave fans is \"Mortal Kombat\", its not a sequel forsay...yes it does start after the events of \"Mortal Kombat: Armageddon\" but only for a few minutes. The plot goes like this:Shao Kahn has won and has killed every fighter and is about to merge the realms. Raiden is the only one is alive is getting his ass kicked. Desperate, Raiden sends a message to his past self giving the hindsight of things to come. Now back track all the way to MK1, Raiden recieves this message and now decides to alter the timeline in hopes of changing the futre.The game itself takes place during the events of game 1-3. Seeing the original tournament, to the 2nd tournament to Kahn's invasion of earth.The story is sometimes cheesy but its still enjoyable. There are multiple chapters, each starring a fighter, so we can whats going on with them. Dont see this as a remake. This is a time travel game, so history will be altered.The list of fighters, are mainly the fighters of the first 3 games with a couple of exceptions. Without spoiling anything, the roster is:Liu KangRaidenSonyaJaxJohnny CageScorpionSub ZeroSmokeKitanaJadeMileenaSheevaSindelNightwolfKabalKung LaoShang TsungNoob SaibotCyraxSektorKanoReptileStrykerQuan Chi-An altered version of a fighter, wont say or what, since its a twist in story mode.This will be the first MK game to feature dlc, and the first dlc pack will have Kenshi and a new female ninja named Scarlet. Whats good is usually the next MK game comes out 2 or so years after the last so there is plenty of time for more dlc.There are several modes which includes:Story mode: Go through the game with cutscenesArcade tower: Same as it always has, face random fighters, a boss or 2...or in this case 3. Ending for each fighterChallenge tower: Compete in odd tasks, 300 in all, to unlock somethingKrpt: Same as it always has. Earn coins to unlock artwork, costumes, fatalities, etcOnline: SameA new feature is tag team kombat, where its like whats in Marvel vs Capcom but only 2 per team. There is even a seperate tower for this.A good thing about the game is the returns of ultra gory fatalities. None of that MK vs DC T rating ones or Kreate a fatality. Also babalities return which some questioned it but now seem to enjoy as each one is different.Unlike past MK games or any fighters in general. The voice acting is actually very good.Only one flaw with the XBox version. No exclusive. While PS3 got Kratos and a new stage. XBox users got nothing.Either way....BUY!!!Pros:-Return of the ultra gory fatalities-Tag Team combat-Interesting storyline-They made babalities actually good-With no signs of a new game...plenty of time for a ton of dlc-Voice acting is actually goodCons:-No XBox exclusive-Storyline can be cheesy-No Rain","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2011"}

I purchased this because I thought it would be fun for a freind and I to play sonic like the good old days.  Well, I was horribly shocked to find that this has the great graphics and speed of sonic when it is not loading, and the controls are awful to use here. The camera angle keeps wanting to go straigh above the character when you start to run, making it at times impossible to see where your shooter is that is killing you.  It really makes the game difficult to enjoy because you are always stopping and tilting the camera.  It is possible to make progress, but there is a steep learning curve.  Not recommended for young users because it is so tough to hold your attention haing to stop the action all the time to adjust.  I'm glad I got it at 1/5 original cost.

Fraley","summary":"Average","reviewText":"I have finally finished this game and it is average to slightly above average.  If the Wii is the only system you have it is still one of the better games on the system.  The game is average because of the problems.First,I was able to shoot enemies through doors.  On one part I just walked through the door and backed back through and let the door shut.  The enemies came to the door and I could see their head through the door and shot them.  I was at one section were I shot multiple enemies through the cover they were behind.  This happened in many places.Second,The enemies are dumb.  They will run out in front of you a lot and just stand there for a few seconds while you wipe them out.Third,The game is not very challenging even on the highest setting.  With the dumb AI and the ability to get enemies in situations were you can shoot them through the doors and the walls/objects it take some challenge away.Lastly,The online is not near as good as i was hearing or expected.  I have never experienced connection problems with any other game or even when downloading games and software.  But i played online for a while and noticed that you could unload 2 clips into another player as they charged in for a melee kill with one hit.  I caught on and tried it and sure enough.  Just charge in and melee and you will 9 times out of 10 win.That is what i thought was wrong with the game.  Now, for what i liked.I thought the controls were pretty good and responded very well.  The graphics are not bad at all and things look like they are suppose to with the detail needed to make things out.  The story isn't to bad if you like this kind of story.  And the enemies keep coming, out of the portals so you are forced to push forward and close them, or out of egg pods that you have destroy to stop the growth of new enemies.  And although the problems above were apparent I still enjoyed the game as it was fun and the online can be fun with friends.All together i recommend this game for the Wii owner.  Without the problems i would have given the game a 5-star as it is really fun.  So, if you can look past the problems definitely get this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2009"}

Originally Fallout 3 ended but then they came back and opened it up so you could continue to play as long as you wanted. And added nifty DLC extensions.Problem 2: It is easy to end the game so early you haven't done even a quarter of what the game has in it to do.Problem 3: Not only does it end way to early, but even if you avoid the early ending they cap the levels at 30 and stop letting you accumulate skills and perks.It wouldn't have taken any effort at all to allow you to just keep accumulating skills and perks, so they stopped you why, because they wanted to.Many great ways to minimize your time and fun with this game brought to you by your freindly local game publisher for no reason other than they could!!!!I've collected most of the nifty weapons and thanks to one really cool level 22 perk that lets you use dissimilar and inferior weapons and apparel to upgrade high end weapons and apparel caps are no longer a problem.While this game has 4 times as many locations as Fallout 3 and a ton of quests, you are out of levels well before you are even half way done exploring and questing.Really takes all the fun out of continuing.I originally completed this game before level 15 and had to back up to before the final quest to continue.Great Game but with HUGE faults.Shame on you Bethesda and Obsidian!What would have been the problem with a hundred levels or just letting you continue from the ending, it really isn't even an ending you don't even die, you just can't play any more.This would have added like an additional 15 minutes to the coding; Thanks a lot!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"O. R. Rodriguez","summary":"LA Noire","reviewText":"LA NoireFirst ImpressionsAs soon as I started LA Noire I was met with a classy main menu that is in tune with the classy style of the game.  From my experience quality titles show the quality from beginning to end, with attention to detail in everything that is shown.  LA Noire has that element of polished from the very beginning.  As soon as the game started I was instantly engaged in the stage prepared for the gamer to develop  in detective work.Gameplay/Progression /Character developmentControlling the character of this game is fluid enough to make it work, but not  to make it shine.  In slow investigative scenes the mechanics work pretty good, but is when the action picks up, where running and shooting can be confusing since you cant draw the weapon whenever you want, the game draws the weapon for you and then you can aim and shoot.  Not a huge problem, but in occasions I was wondering whether to shoot or just keep running.  The one bad issue I have with the game is driving a car.  Is by far the black sheep of this game, I did my best to avoid driving by choosing the option to jump to the destination.  Car chases are terrible too.  As bad as driving is in this game, is something that can be tolerated.  The game progression and character development is where this game shines.  I have read some blogs about this game getting repetitive and boring.  My take on this is that is as repetitive as being a detective solving cases, just as a military shooter is repetitive for being a shooter.  Don't expect this game to turn from detective work to an all out action adventure game and you will be fine.  Throughout all the story I felt engaged on what was happening.  The main character goes through different divisions of the LAPD, and each division has a particular tone of characters and cases.  The character goes through different experiences and has its ups and downs.  The character is not a super/perfect person, it has its flaws and not everyone likes him, and not all his traits are admirable or likeable by you the gamer.OverallThe experience of this game is best described as entertaining.  Its action sequences will not have you sweating bullets, the interrogations might be another story (lol).  The cut scenes of this game are so good that when the gameplay picks up again it will have you wanting to see more cut scenes.  The attention to detail, the acting by the characters and most importantly the way the city of LA is bring to life with such rich detail makes LA Noire one special game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0001AVZ5I","reviewerName":"Kevin FitzPatrick \"eeble\"","summary":"If you come out to play-ay, you'll go back in pretty soon","reviewText":"The Warriors game is a good movie based game, but I feel like the product shows that the developers thought thatThe Warriorsdidn't have enough content to make a good game.There are 18 missions that take place before the movie's timeline. The movie itself: 5 levels. That is, the movie is 20% of the game missions. I do think it is nice that they gave the backstory for every Warrior, but it is a bit much. Also the backstories have almost no relation to the movie part of the game. As I was playing the earlier parts of the game I assumed that you were visiting locations that you later would have to trek through. Actually they have no relation whatsoever to the movie part.The game is also shockingly linear. Rockstar has a pedigree forGrand Theft Auto: The Trilogystyle sandbox games, but this game is NOT by the GTA Rockstar, this is Rockstar Toronto. They also made the PS2 Max Payne game and Manhunt 2 for Wii. (Rockstar North in Scotland makes the GTA series.)The controls are simple: kick, punch, & jump. You can also pick up knives, bottles, or other items to use as weapons. While playing this game I was constantly reminded of brawlers likeFinal FightorDouble Dragon (NES). Just like those games you can play the entire game co-operatively. The minigame \"Armies of the Night\" that you get after beating the game is a Warriors spin on those side scrolling type of games.The soundtrack is top notch, and many of the voices of the movie return for the game including Ajax, Swan, Cleon, Cochise, & Mercy. Some of the new replacement voices are so good that I didn't notice that it was different people until the credits.Ultimately this is a good game, but to hear that Rockstar was involved afterGrand Theft Auto San Andreashad gang fighting, will probably make you expect a different game. Unlike GTA:SA you will not have turf battles and you can't take a rival gang's territory. Also the game does not have a GTA style overworld that you can explore. Each level is an isolated piece of the city with straight-as-an-arrow linear action.If you were expecting GTA: The Warriors, you will be disappointed. If you were expecting Double Dragon: The Warriors, then you will be quite pleased.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2008"}

The RPG industry seems to be focus on MMORPG's more then anything else. Then comes along Bethesda with the Morrowind games. A game that straddles the fence between RPG and FPS, the Morrowind games are some of the most free flowing, most time consuming RPG's everWith Oblivion, Bethesda hopes to repeat the entire free flowing non-linear game. And it's with much enthusiasm that I write that this game is one of the best RPG's ever.Normally I don't give games 5 stars, but looking at Oblivion its difficult to find anything really wrong with this game. First of all the FPS fighting is extremely addictive and fun. One swipe from your sword or one miss block can change the course of an entire fight. Oblivion allows the player multiple methods of killing a prey. Whether you want to charge in there, sneak up on your target, or blast your target with arrows and magic...its all up to youWith that in mind, your character is at full liberty to make any choices he or she wants. You can even create your own class by selecting what major skills make up your character. You can quickly warp to a location on the map or walk there yourself. Find a cave and you're totally free to bypass it or explore it. Don't want to do your quest? Do a side mission for the guilds or fight in the arena. The possibilities are endless, and with different results depending on class and race, you can be sure that this game will be sitting in your D drive for a long time. This is a game that is worth playing over again.The graphics are simply gorgeous, the music and sound are great. The fighting is fast and fun. What more could a person want in an RPG?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2006"}

I do not care how much of a mans man you are, if you have never played this game before and make it through the whole game I can say with 100% certainty you will have a moment that will scare the hell out of you while visiting hell.The game has aged well despite those who will marvel that the graphics and game play do not hold up to the stands we have in games today. I am here to tell you that is a load of crap. The game creates a very tense environment that is both claustrophobic and unrelenting and it looks amazing remastered in HD. Sure you may have moments where you know a demon will pop out but there are moments in this game if you have never played it where you truly will not expect certain things to happen and it's in those moments of Doom 3 that it cements itself as truly terrifying.Instead of rehashing what has already been said by many in terms of what you are getting I will say simply if you have been only playing Call of Duty and have never played any of the Doom games, you need to play the Doom games. This is history and you would not be playing Call of Duty if it were not for Doom because Doom was the one game that really broke open the whole FPS genre and it took to the mainstream. If you enjoy scary games like the Resident Evil series and Silent Hill, you need to play the Doom games because it does not get any more scary then Doom, especially Doom 3.One quick area to cover, 3D. I own a 3D set and I can say that the 3D does have some minor issues with ghosting. While this is adjustable I had a hard time finding that sweet spot in the settings of the game to make it perfect so really while the 3D aspect of it was a great thought point it's not well executed.Lastly I really wish the auto save points in this game did not take 15 seconds the load screens for the next level take up to 40. That to me is really lazy on Id and Bethesda for not fixing those issues before releasing this at that price point. So my 4 stars and not 5 stars is for that reason.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2012"}

Lerch","summary":"I have an old 360, ran hot. Not anymore","reviewText":"To preface this story, I own an original Xbox 360, the version WITHOUT HDMI capability. It gave up the ghost to the RROD problem about a month ago. I sent it to a repair shop, since MS wanted way more than it was worth to repair it.When I received it back, I decided to attempt to do something about the amount of heat this beast was generating.For those that have the time, ability and money to spend on internal fans, this solution isn't for you. The best way to keep your older 360 cool isn't with external fans, it's with beefy internal fans.But most people don't have the time or inclination to open the system up and make the modifications necessary.For those people, this is the next best thing.Older Inter Coolers required you to draw power directly through the power supply on the 360. This actually added to the heat generated by the system and most likely helped speed the 360 into careening into RROD land.This new Inter Cooler has it's own external power supply, so no more sucking power from the 360 itself. Way to go Nyko.So does this little gem help? Yes is the short answer. It draws the maximum amount of air out of the system, more than the 360 fans themselves can even push out of the back of the console. It does help.One nice feature is that because this uses its own power supply, it will run, if the temperature is high enough, even after you've powered off the 360. Why is this good? Because if you don't follow the ritual of leaving your system running 15-30 minutes on the dashboard, when you power the system down ALL of the nasty hot air sits inside the system, taking a long time to dissipate, which adds to premature death of internal components. Now you can shut the system off and you know that when the Inter Cooler stops running, the system should be quite cool inside.The one downside to this device is that it is loud. I tried it on a new Jasper mother board based system (manufactured late Oct '08 until now) and the noise was extremely apparent.Of course, using this on the system I had repaired, it being a first generation 360, you can't tell the fans are running over the 360's own fan and DVD drive noise.So depending on the model 360 you have, you will either notice right away that the fans are running or you'll never know.One thing to keep in mind, if the Inter Cooler ever stops functioning and you don't know it, your system WILL over heat. In this instance it will act just like a big block behind the system fans, which means the inside will get to hot and the system will power down. If this happens, remove the Inter Cooler, let the system cool internally and stop running it with the Inter Cooler until you can replace it.Over all I am extremely happy with this purchase. It may not be the best solution to avoid the RROD problems, but it is definitely better than just waiting for it to happen again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2010"}

As each song plays, it counts down to the start of the dancing at which time you are to start mirror imaging the person on the screen. The dancer on screen is a simplified faceless person taken from real video. I kind of wish they left the actual person there.As the song plays, there is a visual cue as to what move to do next and well as a status bar showing how well you are staying in sync. Your success is based on your timing and movement in conjunction with the onscreen dancer. You can have up to four dancers at a time in a dance contest or you can do it by yourself.The variety of songs is OK offering a little of everything. It is the original artists singing. Each song has a difficulty rating based on how hard it is to do the dancing and how much effort you have to put into it. The one thing that is a little annoying is that the movement is recorded based on the Wii remote being in your right hand. That makes your right hand do more work. After awhile, my right arm gets tired from all that swinging around and I'd like to be able switch to my left hand for a break. I guess there is nothing stopping me.We have a lot of fun and don't mind looking like idiots trying to act like a puppy in Who Let the Dogs Out.

High realism levels really draw you into the combat.You start out as a raw Russian recruit, in the freezing winter of Moscow, trying to learn how to use a rifle and stave off the impending Nazi take-over. You only get a few moments of training before you're sent out into combat to defend your home town.The graphics are a really nice mix of realistic scenery and helpful gameplay. Items you need will glow gold so that they're easy to find.  A compass on your display will point your way to important objectives. Your ammo, health and other indicators are easy to find.But in the meantime, your main screen graphics are really quite impressive. From the brickwork on the buildings to the smoke-grenade haze, from the uniforms on your friends and enemies, the quality on a HD TV is quite impressive. The widescreen view lets you keep an eye all around you while you move your way through hostile territory. You try to focus while you hear the screams, calls, bullet blasts and grenade booms landing all around you. It's like being in a warzone, which of course it is.Your teammates are all around you, and they do their best to help you out. Like you, many of them are raw recruits and not very good at things. As you move forward, they get more skilled, as do you. You learn how to pause before aiming, how to use cover and to approach your objective with stealth.I do wish that you could have more than 8 simultaneous players online during XBox Live. The single player games are great, but of course they don't last forever. When you get through them, the next step is to start playing online to face a \"real challenge\" with live players. The game would be SUPERB if it let you play large squad on large squad. Maybe that could come with future upgrades. Still, at least playing with 8 people lets you keep enjoying the graphics, the gameplay and the skill set. It's always far more challenging to play against live players rather than playing against a computer set. Computers are great for training, but live players are where the long term enjoyment of a game shines through.Highly recommended for war game lovers, especially those who enjoy squad-type combat. If you hook up with a team of like-minded online players, this could provide for countless months of online fun, as you face your squad against other highly skilled teams.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2005"}

This game charms you the second you start playing it. This game is loaded with characters, and parts for you to customize your vehicle of choice. The tracks are all so highly detailed and creative that you can really tell Nintendo spent a lot of time working on this game. Most of the tracks in this game are very clever and fun! Online mode is fun, but plays it a little too safe. One big thing they did right with Mario Kart 8 is having a bunch of control options for you to play with. If you want to use the gamepad you can, if you want the Wii Wheel you can, if you want the Pro Controller you can, and the list goes on.That all sounded good right? Well sadly after that is where things start to get ugly! I'm a life long Nintendo fan and Mario Kart is one of my favorite series of all time! In 2014 we should NOT expect to lose little features that we have grown used to in the past. I will now make a list of things that this game is missing that there is no excuse for them not having in.- No Stars beside your players name online (why go through the trouble of getting the 3 stars on every cup if you can't show them off online like you could in the Wii and Mario Kart 7)- No Stats or Records (again these were simple to obtain in the Wii and 3DS version of Mario Kart, and there is no excuse why we don't have this in the Wii U)- Lazy Unlock system! (The Wii challenged you to do a ton of different things to unlock all of the different vehicles and characters, this game is just LAZY!)- Battle Mode! I refuse to call the balloon mode they have in Mario Kart 8 &#34;Battle Mode&#34; Again Nintendo got lazy and did not give us a proper or even decent Battle Mode, heck they did not even try!- Friend Ghost Data can't be viewed! Why? This added hours of play to the Wii  version, my friends and I used to send each other ghosts to try and beat each other's times on time trial, but Nintendo got lazy again and took that feature out!The list of things I mentioned above are all signs f Nintendo being lazy! They worked very hard on getting this game to look and play great, but that wears off very fast! Once you get the game you find out it is missing so many little details that it falls apart very quick! I HOPE that us Nintendo fans can get the message sent to Nintendo that we would like to see those features in this game, and I hope that they will release a patch or an update to add those features in Mario Kart 8. It could be done since all of those things I listed are pretty small, but small things add up!Bottom Line: If you own a Wii U this is a game you will want to have, even with all of the issues with it, the game still offers some of that Mario Kart magic you can't help but love! The sad thing is that you will find out quickly that with all of the little things this game left out, it is a pretty bare bones Mario Kart which we should not have to worry about having in 2014. If you ask me this game alone is NOT worth buying a Wii U for.Again I hope Nintendo adds a lot of the things I mentioned above with a patch/update for the game, if they do that than this game would score much higher with me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2014"}

There are some annoyances worth mentioning:1. the characters look good enough but it is all in the typical anime fashion -- big eyed girls wearing tiny skirts.  But the environments often look grainy and are covered with aliased jaggedy edges. Everything and I mean everything is normal mapped and therefore looks super shiny.  The snow world looks good and there's some other times when the environments look OK, but generally the look of the game suffers from grainy and blurry textures.2. The save points are few and far between in the \"dungeon\" levels.  Be prepared for a 60 minute long gaming session before you can save!  But that's not all --  there's never a point in the game when you can zip back to your ship (which is the only place you can craft new items).  There's no quick teleport option.  The levels are large.  So you will be walking around quite a bit.3. The real time combat is a plus and a minus.  Action combos are cool but there are too many times when button mashing lets you win anyway.  You often have no idea what your team is doing once the fight begins.  It is not unusual for you to try to pull off a combo but you cannot because your team just killed all of the enemies and the combat ends.  Your team's AI is almost too good and that sometimes makes the combat too easy.  In fact that my biggest complaint about the gameplay -- it is too easy.  Your enemies have elemental weaknesses but except with bosses, it rarely matters.  You can hit an enemy with anything and it will be defeated.  In an effort to make the combat real-time and action-based, the game designers lost some of the challenge in the combat.Having said all of that that, I am enjoying the game.  You can skip the cutscenes which is a nice feature and then get right back to the dungeon crawling.  Over all I like the Persona and Megami games better than this game as far as dungeon crawlers go.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"a fun revamp of old Castlevania....","reviewText":"While a lot of recent Castlevania games on the hand-held systems have been remaking 'Symphony of the Night', this new Castlevania for PS3 and XBOX360 takes things back to the old NES games where you were just a character with a whip killing monsters. While this has simplified the overall feel of the gameplay, Lords of Shadow is an impressive action-title in and of itself.The plot of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow follows a young warrior named Gabriel who's trying to ressurect his recently deceased wife Marie. Along the way Gabriel meets another warrior Zobek who can help him, but he must help him in return. This turns into a typical (and sometimes idiotic) save-the-world-ish plot, but the story actually has some clever surprises and starts to really draw you in during your 20+ hour gaming. The ending twist is especially memorable. The voice-acting is very well-done by professionals Patrick Stewart and Robert Carlyle and they have a real grasp of their characters as do other voice actors Aleksander Mikic, Emma Ferguson, Sally Knyvette and especially Jason Issacs. Unfortunatly as good as the acting is the actual dialogue these characters spout ranges from good to pretty bad (I cringed at some of Zobek's dialogue during the load screens and almost had to put the TV on mute).Thankfully story isn't everything and the gameplay in Castlevania Lords of Shadow is varied and a lot of fun. While you'll be killing all kinds of monsters God-of-War-style with Gabriel's whip, you'll be climbing buildings in platforming sections, riding creatures and climbing truly epic boss-monsters. While none of these things are particularly new to the 3D action genre they are all done with polish and the pacing of the gameplay segments is very smooth. Even the quick-time events (which I normally hate in video games) are well placed. The game does play out very linearly but the levels are so big and varied and there's so much to do I honestly didn't mind.Again, Castlevania Lords of Shadows is NOT a Symphony of the Night remake and doesn't add anything different to the 3D action genre. However it does everything with polish and is an impressive reboot of the old whip-and-kill NES Castlevania. A must play for 3D action fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2010"}

The controller or Buzzer, needs 2 AA batteries and has a small USB thumb drive receiver that needs to be plugged in.

{"product_name":"B00006GEX2","description":"From the makers ofAge of Empirescomes a strategy game where the line between history and mythology has been blurred. InAge of Mythologyheroes do battle with monsters of legend, and the gods intervene in the affairs of mortal men.Age of Mythologyplayers wage war as leaders of a Greek, Norse, or Egyptian civilization with a customized pantheon. Players use human armies and diplomacy, progress through development ages, enhance military and economic performance with improvements, and manage economics through resource gathering and trade. Mythology enters the mix when players call upon the gods to act on their behalf or reinforce their armies with more than 20 mythological creatures such as jackal-headed Egyptian warriors or mighty minotaurs.Age of Mythology's revolutionary 3-D engine provides the game with gorgeous environments featuring lifelike rolling terrain, beautiful waves and water, realistic sunlight, and lush forests. The units roaming these environments are incredibly detailed, move naturally over the terrain, and come to life through hundreds of fluid animations. Amazing special effects change the look of this beautiful world when the gods get involved: all grows dark as an eclipse takes effect, funnel clouds twist and grow as a tornado sends buildings spinning toward the heavens, and meteors streak in from the heavens to send people and armies flying.An entertaining tutorial, an intuitive interface, and logical game rules allow anyone to quickly and easily learn to play. Once started, there is a lot to explore: an epic 36 scenario single player campaign, easy-to-use multiplayer gaming online, single player games against the challengingAge of MythologyAI opponents, more than 15 different random map types that help make the game infinitely replayable, nine highly differentiated civilizations, multiple difficulty levels to allow players of any skill level to have an enjoyable game, and a fully functional scenario editor.Age of Mythologyoffers something for everyone: a fun game for any playing style or skill level.","reviewerName":"Nick","summary":"Addicting","reviewText":"Age of Mythology is one of the best RTS (real time strategy) games I have ever played. The game hooks you with the good single player campaign and then keeps you hooked with the insanely addicting multiplayer.The single player campaign consists of about 30 missions where you must guide Arkantos around the ancient world. The single player game is really a big tutorial, getting you ready to test your skills online. It teaches you how to use all of the civilaztions, how to use god powers efectively, etc. Still, it is very engrossing and much better than the &quot;campaigns&quot; in the previous Age of Empires games.The civilaztions are very well balanced. There are only 3- Egyptians, Norse, and Greek. Each civ. has their own distinct advantages and disadvantages. For example: The norse can create mobile resource drop points, the egyptians have the best god powers, and the greeks get siege weapons the earliest. Also, there are 3 major gods under each civ. that give you further advantages. The game really encourages you to choose your Civ and major god wisely.The units are also very interesting. The new myth units all have various skills and unique attributes. The units in the game are wonderfully detailed and are very well balanced. For every unit there is a counter unit that can easily kill it. Strategy, strategy, strategy - without careful planning you will certainly lose (offline or on). This is not the typical &quot;build a huge army and conquer the world&quot; RTS. The population cap and counter units make sure of that.Forget about single player random map games against the computer (they suck). Instead, head into the online realm and test your skills worldwide. It's very fun and the people online are very good. This really strengthens the replay value of Age of Mythology. Without the multiplayer the game gets 3 stars- but w/ the multiplayer it is easily 5 stars. You can easily play for months online without getting bored. If you are a fan of RTS games (like warcraft, starcraft, age of empires) then get Age of Mythology. You will not be disapointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2004"}

I am really impressed with the fact that a lot of the missions are not just the Grand Theft Auto style in which you kill 5 guys and then kill 10 guys in the next in a different part of the city. A lot of the solving each mission requires you to use the environment, stealth to stay hidden or eavesdrop on someone, climb a cliff, walk and swing through treetops to get past the enemy etc. Each mission can usually be solved with several different ways, stealth, fight it out etc.The historical realism is a pretty good selling point for this game. I work in Boston and am able to recognize some of the streets, the old State House, Faneuil Hall etc. I do have a question about the placement of \"Boston Light\" as it appears to be attached to the mainland. I believe it has always been located on Little Brewster island and would be a good swim even for Connor. You can google a few news articles which have side by side comparison shots of these modern buildings vs. the game imagery.Ubisoft does have a website that supposedly has stats, leaderboards etc. but the \"captcha\" at Ubsiofts website appears to be non-functional and other parts of the website just give an \"error.\"If you can get through Ubi's Captcha you are able to get \"Ubi points\" from the website and by completing certain parts in the game which you can cash in to carry more items in multi-player, or outfit your in game character.Great game with good re-playability, bad website thus four stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2013"}

The idea to take Diablo II and WarCraft, two extremely playable games, and meld them together to form a hybrid seems like an excellent concept.  The problem is that you get the worst of both worlds.  The tedious resource gathering aspect of WarCraft and the micromanagement associated with D2 when you hire a henchman.The graphics requirements are too high for what you get.  Compared to the graphics usage done by games like Neverwinter Nights, WC3 looks like it was written for Nintendo 64.  Blizzard should have stuck with 2D graphics like in StarCraft instead of attempting to utilize 3D.  Make sure your video card can support the game before making the purchase.  Although listed as supported, my Compaq n600c ATI Radeon Mobility video card would not run the game. Note that this card runs NWN, Half-life, and Wolfenstein just fine, all of which make much more use of 3D than this game ever will.  Voodoo 3 cards can run the game, but I found many screen artifacts.Gameplay is repetitive with little strategy.  In the single player mission, there is more cinematic than gameplay.  OK if you want to watch a movie.  Not OK if you want to play a game.Save your money, or spend your cash on a better game like Neverwinter Nights, because this one is a dud.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2002"}

Definitely the designers of Gearbox Games were huge fans of the series, and this translates fairly well.The game is definitely a good combination of intense combat and strategy.  Gung-ho button mashing and assaulting the enemy in any given mission map assures instant death.  While you can do missions at your own pace, the ability to 'pause' the game for what the designers term as 'situational awareness'' can help, but not always.  This feature will allow you to get an overhead view of the 'seen' battlefield to make some tactical decisions which is definitely helpful to keep you and your artificially controlled squad mates alive.There is also a fair amount of mixed missions and objectives (albeit only 10), so it's not the same get from point A to point B and kill as many Germans as possible.  You may have to blow up a strategic point, or clear a field, or infiltrate enemy barracks, to hooking up with stranded or lost squad mates.There are 4 difficulty levels, and completing each mission unlocks 'extra content' based on the mission difficulty.  While some of the un-lockable content is interesting, cheat codes and extra weapons are only obtained on harder levels.  Easy settings unlocks historical content which while interesting adds no substantive value to gameplay and is easily forgotten.There is a fair measure of explicit cursing.  Like real life war, your squad mates tend to have profane mouths and in any given mission you'll wanna make sure children are not present.The graphics are good, but not excellent.  There is some synching issues with spoken words and facial expressions and mouth movements of the AI characters.  Sometimes they move a bit stiff and seem un-natural.Sound is great, especially in surround sound.  The only musical scores you hear are in mission loads and completions, otherwise it bullets flying and shouting's.Game control does take sometime getting used to.  Even though you can remap the X-Box control settings, the default ones seem more complex than I am accustomed to on similar games.  Some frustrating moments for me occurred when it seem intuitive hand control is not what 'it should be'.  Also camera control in 'situational awareness' mode can also be confusing and not as smooth as it should be.  This has proven to be slightly more difficult to master than I would expect as well.I think the most frustrating thing is that the environments are not 100% interactive.  Why are there doors on homes or farm gates that can never be opened?  Why can I climb on the back of a tank, but can't crawl over or jump over a 3 foot wall?  Why can I use a building or tree for cover and jump in a fox hole, but can't walk through a small hedge.  Environment inconsistencies like this make the gamer puzzled.  I see many ways to get to an objective, just to realize when I try something, I can't crawl, or squeeze in a gap between buildings that is much wider than my body.  And why can't I loot fallen Germans for their grenades, but I can pick up their rifle?But don't let these negative comments detract you.  It is indeed intense.  It does have realism in certain areas and you do feel as a part of a team and quickly care about your AI controlled squad mates...they do have personalities and quickly are become likeable.

{"product_name":"B000JLIXIG","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"The best shooter on PS3 back then","reviewText":"Back when PS3 launched, there were not many good games out there. As I like shooters, I decided to give this one a shot. Simply put this game turned out MUCH BETTER than what I expected.PROS.-AWESOME ALIEN WEAPONS: Most of the first person shooters today have the same type of weapons, but Resistance has very unique set of alien weapons that will distinguish it from the rest of the average shooter. For example, with a gun named bullseye, you can tag an enemy and then regardless where it runs, your shots follow him. Another one is called Auger, that shoots bullets through the wall. And what I described is just tip of the ice burg.-MORE ALIEN WEAPONS: There are some cool alien weapons that are not available during the first playthrough. But once you beat the game, during the second playthrough, you can obtain and use them. This truly adds to replayability of the game.-VEHICLES: Other than weapons, you also get access to some cool human and alien vehicles. I can't tell you how awesome it feels to massacre hordes and hordes of enemies using devastating human tanks and giant alien fighters.-DECENT VARIETY IN ENEMIES: While all of their faces are very similar, this game does a very good job with challenging you with a variety of enemies. This can be single unarmed chimera to giant chimeran monsters and chimeran vehicles. In brief, you won't get bored.-PRETTY GOOD STORY: The story is about how Sergent Hale who is infected with Chimeran virus fights chimeran enemies while fighting infection itself. Unfortunately, I can't tell you much without spoiling, but story is simple and very nicely narrated. While it doesn't take huge twists, there are events that will get you curious about Hale and human race' fate.-VARIETY OF AREAS: So many shooters these days have the same type of corridor like area over and over again. Not resistance though. You will pass through plenty of open fields, woods, buildings, cities and chimeran towers in this game.-AWESOME MULTIPLAYER: You can fight as human vs human, human vs chimera and chimera vs chimera in different multiplayer modes. Being human and chimera introduce you distinct advantages and limitation making multiplayer very involved and deep.-GREAT REPLAYABILITY: With multiplayer, different difficulty modes and second run through weapons, you will be playing this game for quite a while.Like every game Resistance also has its limitation.CONS-YOUR HEALTH BAR: While some people may love it, I don't like health bar in shooters these days. It diverts me from the story experience and makes me focus on searching health packs. Really not big fan of it. This also kind of makes more challenging at times than what it needs to be.-MINES: Hate mines. While it makes experience more real, parts of the game are frustrating because you will suddenly die because of them.-COLORE TEXTURE: Graphics are awesome in this game, however, colors in general look a bit faded. Never the less the game still looks magnificent.Contrary to minor flaws, this game truly delivers. Different alien weapons, vehicles and enemies will truly make this game an enjoyable experience that will make you coming back for more. Oh did I tell you that other than single player, it also has an awesome multiplayer?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J4VQ","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Righting the ship","reviewText":"I wasn't too fond of the PS3 when it was originally launched, most notably by the hefty price tag attached more than anything else.  Well, here we are three years later, and it appears that Sony may in fact finally be righting the ship with the PS3.  The new PS3 slim is what the name implies: a slimmed down, cooler, and quieter console with a 120 gig hard drive.  Other than the slimmer size and the smaller price tag, nothing much has really changed with the PS3.  Online play is still free and the Playstation Store and Playstation Home are still easy enough to navigate through, and combined with its Blu-Ray capabilities help make the PS3 the best value that its ever been.  It isn't without its drawbacks however, as Sony has continued to lose a number of its once exclusive titles, although there are a larger number of great, exclusive games still in the pipeline.  Not to mention that in terms of being an all-in-one media center, the PS3 can't hold a candle to what all XBox Live offers.  The biggest flaw of the system for me however is the fact that it isn't backwards compatable.  Now this may not be such a big deal for some, but considering that it originally was a feature during the first run of PS3 hardware, this is a serious and regrettable oversight to be sure.  Other than all that however, the slim PS3 is a sign that Sony is perhaps righting the ship in this new age console war, and who knows, perhaps they'll end up coming out on top once again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2009"}

It features several  minor upgrades from its predecessors, but in essence it's still the same game.  The classic Pok&eacute;mon formula of adventuring, collecting, and battling is  at a series best withCrystal. This is one of the best and most addictive  role-playing games for the Game Boy Color.The most notable feature is the  selectable female trainer who has her own set of animations and backgrounds.  This is a great option for female Pok&eacute;mon fans who were previously stuck  playing the game as a male character. There are also subtle improvements to the  cell phone system, HM moves, and prebattle animations. Rival trainers' phone  calls are now more plentiful and pragmatic. HM moves, which are required  throughout the game, are available at the push of a button--you'll no longer  have to navigate menus to use these moves. Lastly, seeing a Pok&eacute;mon's new  animation makes encountering new creatures more fun than before.If you  haven't playedGoldorSilveryet,Crystalis definitely  the way to go. If you've played those previous games,Crystalhas only  enough new features to justify a purchase from Pok&eacute;mon fanatics.

It has new and improved graphics, new animation, and, finally, a girl character ^^ (woo-hoo!) You can choose between the boy and the girl, however the only difference is the appearance of your character. The way people talk to you and the storyline does not change. This game is VERY similar to its immediate predecessors, gold and silver. One major difference, however, is that you get a good shot at capturing Suicune without looking for it in the grass, and you also get little markers on your map showing you the other 2 legendary beasts' current locations if you have been lucky enough to spot them once. My only complaint about this game would be that as having played these games since Red/Blue were popular (and almost impossible to get), I am getting burnt out. It is beginning to be the same old thing over and over. I remember when Red, Blue, and even Yellow version used to keep me entertained for hours, but when Gold and Silver came out it was beginning to get tiresome. I have not even bothered to beat Crystal just because I know it will be the same ending. Anyways, it's a good game overall, so try it if you're not already bored with the games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2002"}

Perfect in nearly every way, this game is absolutely unbridled fun and should NOT be missed. So let's get to it :PRAISES : Pretty much everything. It's really difficult to find fault with this game being as fun as it is. The scale, the graphics, the playability (and re-playability!) the new items and weapons, the combat system, the fact that every boss is a Greek God, and the array of creatures to smash to a pulp make this a pretty tough game to top. If you're reading this review, you've likely read others, so I won't rehash what everyone (myself included) loves so much about this game. There's a LOT of it and it could fill pages, so suffice it to say, this is quite possibly one of the best video games ever created and unquestionably one of the top 3-5 EVER for any Playstation platform. But rarely is anything perfect, so....CRITICISMS: My complaints (though minor and few) are as follows....  As much as I love the combat system, what with the upgrades to the items and how they're used (no longer tied to your magic), the combat grapple and the new weapons themselves, it could still stand a little improvement in that, it still doesn't allow you to dodge if you're in the middle of a combo move. In this regard, Kratos could take a hint from Bayonetta, which is easily the best & smoothest combat system I've played in a game of this style. Additionally, the camera isn't as intuitive as it needs to be at times since it doesn't rotate to always give you an unobstructed view of what you're fighting. Sometimes you'll be fighting things off screen and sometimes the screen will be so filled with attackers, you'll be pinned behind them flailing away and can't even see what you're doing. This doesn't happen a lot, but enough that it bears mentioning. Also, something to note about GOD OF WAR 3 though, is it's difficulty compared to the other GOW games. On normal setting, it's noticeably easier than the previous releases. Not horribly so, but it's definitely a tad easier. Titan mode (Hard) is definitely harder and a little closer to what you might expect a GOD OF WAR title to be, although, there are a few spots that are INSANELY tough to get by. I can't imagine what it'd be like on Chaos mode (Very Hard)....The only other complaint I had was with the ending of the story. Sure, it's a Greek tragedy, but after the relentless slaughter, brutality & mayhem through 3 PS3 games, 1 PSP game and a mobile game, you'd think the ending wouldn't be so........flat. Granted, it's a fairly minor complaint as you play video games for the action, not for the great writing and literary value, but still. When you see it, you'll know what I mean. Although, there is a short cut scene after the end of the credits that helps but a LITTLE air back in the tires so to speak. So, make of it what you will.NOTES ON THE ULTIMATE EDITION : This is the version I purchased, as I'm a HUGE fan of the games. While I enjoy having it and I like what it came with, I'd also say it's not worth the $100 MSRP. I'm not sure I'd be able to say what it's worth, but not an add'l $40 worth of content. I can only reccommend this version if you're serious fan of the games. Although, one thing that's worth mentioning is that this edition comes with a downloadable character skin that is easily & by far better than any of the other downloadable character skins offered for GOW3. The Dominus skin jacks up your damage output, orb value and reduces enemy damage, whereas all of the other skins only increase orb value or, if they do increase your damage output, it's at  the same level the damage to you is increased. So, be advised, if that kind of thing matters to you. The art book is nice, but again, for collectors only. If you want a taste of the art book and some add'l content with real value to your gaming experience, buy the Ultimate Edition gaming guide (but try and ignore all the typos!).THE VERDICT: It should be pretty obvious by now, but I absolutely LOVE this game (despite my few criticisms) and can't reccommend it enough. While it's not perfect, it's pretty close and what flaws it has aren't enough to damage the 'fun' factor of this title. Do yourself a favor and pick this up!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2010"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"S.

{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"MikeB \"Metalhead\"","summary":"Incredible effort from 343","reviewText":"When it was announce that Bungie was leaving the Halo franchise in the hands of newcomer 343, some were worried about Halo's future. I, for one, wasn't really that hyped for Halo 4, and wasn't awaiting it's release with any real anticipation. Now that it's out, however, I've had a chance to get my hands on the game, and I can honestly say it's an amazing first effort from 343, and one of the best games of 2012.GAMEPLAYIn my mind (and I hope the minds of many Halo fans) what makes Halo so great is the solid gameplay. When I think of Halo, I think of precise, responsive controls. It's been this way since Halo 1, and Halo 4 is no exception. The first thing I noticed about Halo 4 was that it \"felt\" like a Halo game. Movement, jumping, aiming, shooting and driving all feel perfect.Like previous Halo games, Halo 4's campaign has a good amount of variety to keep the shooting from getting stale. The weapons, enemies, and armor abilities all keep the game interesting, and just when it feels like the shooting is about to get monotonous, the game will throw a driving section to change it up.The Covenant return for Halo 4, and they act just like in previous games. Their presence keeps Halo 4 \"feeling\" like a Halo game, but to keep it from feeling old, Halo 4 also introduces a new enemy, the Prometheans. They act different than the Covenant, and will require you to change your battlefield tactics. They are a very welcome addition and prevent Halo 4 from feeling like a rehash of the same old game.GRAPHICSHalo 4 looks great. Some have said it's the best looking Xbox 360 game yet, but I don't know if I'd agree with that. I will say it is the best looking Halo game yet, and certainly stands among the top tier of 360 games. Geometry is higher than ever, textures looks crisp (with some super rare exceptions), and the lighting is better than ever. They've added lens flare and bloom lighting (which I'm sure some gamers will complain about) and a whole bunch of new effect that make the game look more real than ever. The animation (especially for faces) is also more detailed than ever and is really impressive.The look of the game has been tweaked somewhat. The UNSC ships and uniforms have been redesigned and look a little less military and a little more sci-fi. The Covenant troops and ships have been redesigned as well, and it's a bit odd at first. It doesn't hurt the game in any way, but for those long time fans (such as myself) who are used to the look of previous Halo games, it takes some getting used to. The new Promethean enemies and architecture look great and are very well designed, and fit well into the Halo universe. Overall, I like the aesthetic changes to Halo 4, as it helps the new game (and the new studio) distinguish itself.SOUNDThe music for Halo 4 is a big departure from the previous games. It's great music, but it's quite different. The music is still orchestral, but the Halo theme music we've all grown to love is absent. The new music works well with the new game, but so far it hasn't been memorable like the soundtrack for Halo 3.Sound effects have also been completely re-done. The new sound effects are great, they have a very full sound to them and every weapon and blast sounds devastating. Enemies sound ferocious and intimidating, and vehicles sound powerful. Although everything sounds different, it still sounds appropriate and works well in the new game.STORYHalo 4's campaign has a good story. Some have hailed it as the best Halo story yet, but I wouldn't agree with that. The story (like the previous games) often feels like Cortana telling you to go here and there, and you follow waypoints until another cutscene plays. Most cutscenes consist of characters telling you they're under attack and then you have to go kill things. Toward the end more important story points are revealed, but for the majority of the game it's pretty basic. It's not bad, just nothing really complex or intriguing.MULTIPLAYERHalo 4 has changed multiplayer in several ways, most notably the new perks system. You can tell it was inspired by Call of Duty, but fortunately it doesn't feel out of place. The thing that makes Halo different from CoD is the pacing. CoD is frantic and chaotic, but Halo has a tactical feel. What weapons you choose and what armor abilities you use are will have a big impact on how you play, and taking into account your shields and your enemies' shields is key. I'm not a huge fan of multiplayer (in Halo or any game), but I've played enough of it to know that Halo 4 does not feel like CoD as some reviewers on here have claimed. Halo 4's multiplayer still feels like a Halo game through and through.CLOSINGHalo 4 has changed in a lot of ways. The enemies are different, the aesthetics have been re-designed, and the music has a different vibe. But Halo 4 keep intact the areas that matter most: The gameplay and the feel. As a longtime fan of Halo who was getting burnt out on Halo games after Reach, I am impressed with the way 343 has breathed new life into the franchise. And most importantly, the whole time I was playing I was having a great time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2012"}

If you choose to play as an outlaw then it's really odd to see in story missions that you're helping others right wrongs and care about justice, but outside these missions you can still kill innocence people and cause all types of mayhem. This could have been fixed with more choices and branching paths in story mode its self like in games such as Mass Effect.- The second half of the game seems to drag (this is the part which takes place in Mexico, during the revolution), when compared to the first half.- While the traditional online player modes (like Death Match & Capture the Flag) are all here and lots of fun, they are not adjusted or balance enough for hardcore completive online gaming titles such as Call of Duty and Halo franchises (this was the case with GTA4 as well).- Watch out for bugs, glitches, and game freezes (hopefully a patch should be out soon enough).IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A third person (camera behind the player character) action adventure game. With a focus on shooting, riding horses, and letting beat missions how ever they see fit - it's a very open ended game, gameplay wise.- A historical third person action game much like Assassins Creed or that takes place during the early 20th century American west.- If you can stand the structure and nature of Grand Theft Auto games you really may not like this game very much.- The story is linear, much like GTA4 (and most action/adventure games) you get a chance to make some limited choice story wise, but for the most part the story is like a movie script that you can't change. It's in the actions outside the story where you make the most impact and have the most freedom.- The game is broken up between two different styles of play, first there is the main story adventure missions which will take the average play 20 something hours to finish. Second there is doing all the side missions (which there are tons) and challenges (also tons) which will unlock more story and items for your use - you can do these at your own time. And let's not forget about the Online Free Roam with other players, which is like a mix between traditional online modes mixed with the freedom found in the single player mode.- The gunplay is similar to that in GTA4 (in this game you can not turn on/off the target lock system, when its off you can free aim), but reworked to make it work smoother.- Like in the previous game Red Dead Revolver you can do something called Dead Eye Mode (bullet time), which makes everything turn red and in slow-motion and you can then mark a person with icons, which then at the end of Dead Eye Mode your character will automatically hit those icons really quickly. You build Dead Eye Mode by making regular kills without it.- The wilderness is filled with all types of wildlife. There are over twenty different kinds of wild and domestic animals. Some will ignore you other might try to eat/kill you if you get to close.- You can kill and then skin just about every animal in the game (yes even your own horse) and then sell the skins to a fur trader in towns for money.- There are several different breeds of horse (and one type donkey) you can ride. When you first get a horse, you first have to break in that horse in order to ride it. Also the more you keep to one horse then more it will trust you and the easier it will be to ride and it will follow your commands quicker (this will become more apparent with better more powerful breeds of horse).- If taking your horse across the land still takes too long (note trails and paths make your travel quicker in the wilderness), you can always use warp points found at camps (that you set up while out in the wilds), as well as use stagecoaches as taxis.- There are about 15 different outfits you can wear. Some of these outfits give you bourses in areas like combat (increased damage and ammo count), better prices at shops, ect.- You can not swim in what is considered deep water (any water that can go above your head).- A sample of activities you can do in this sandbox style game is, save people form gangs, follow up on bounties, hunt animals, watch a silent movies, search for gold, herd cattle, picking herbs and desert flowers, playing poker the old west way and more.- You can play as a saint or sinner, kill just about anyone and decide the outcome of the fate of innocents; you can also rob peoples, homes, and trains. A type of karma meter (next to your fame meter) tracks your actions and those you help/hurt after a while new people you come across will begin to react to your based on this.- Building \"fame\" will open up new missions, and new areas to explore. You build fame by doing story missions and by completing side missions or challenges.- Break the law and a lawman (sheriff) will come to get you, keep breaking the law and he will form up a posse with other lawmen to hunt you down. If you get away then a bounty is put on your head, then you gotta watch out for bounty hunters.- You can play a few mini games of the ear such as Poker, Blackjack, Horseshoes, Liar's Dice, and a game called Five Finger Fillet (where you take a knife and stab between the fingers as fast as you can - like that scene in the famed 80's action movie aliens). You can also cheat at these games, but if you get caught by other players they will want to fight you.- In the game you meet plenty of \"Women of ill repute\", but unlike GTA4 (and all other GTA games) you can not sleep with them.- There is also a multiplayer aspect to this game called Free Roam (think of a really graded lobby from the GTA4 multiplayer). Free Roam works by putting you and your party (up to 16 different players per room) in a version of the world of Red Dead Redemption, where you can go anywhere and do almost anything together (see from the sample activities and mini games above). You and your party can also do more traditional activities like death match, team death match, capture the flag (but now it's a bag of gold), cops-n-robbers (from GTA4) and more.GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Gun (360/PS2)- Grand Theft Auto 4 (360/PS3/PC)- Assassins Creed 2 (360/PS3/PC)- Red Dead Revolver (PS2)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- This game takes place in 1908, well after most other western titles, \"wild west\" was already \"tamed\" by this point. Example the Wright brothers already built and flew the historic first airplane (The Wright Flyer) and this was the same year that Ford Motor Company put out the Model-T to the mass public and World War 1 was about ten years away. Despite this most people in the American mid-west still didn't have electricity and still had never even seen a car - life in most of these then considered rural areas looked as if it was still 1860 until about the 1920's.- This game is the sequel to Red Dead Revolver on PS2, but has very little to do with that game story wise.- There is a co-op downloadable content pack for this game coming out sometime in June and it's free.- As far as preorder downloadable content goes those who got it on Amazon (here) get Golden Guns which builds fame quicker and look cool to boot. Those who got this game from Gamestop get a new 16 outfit called the Deadly Assassins Outfit which makes your Dead Eye meter fill more quickly thus making you more Deadly. And those who got this game from BestBuy got the War Horse which is the strongest and fastest horse in the game. You cannot get theses preorder downloadable content items with the game normally and this is the only way to get your hands on some.- If you're a member at the Rockstar web site known Social Club ([...]) you can complete extra challenges not normally found in the game for more unlockable goodies you can't get any other way, like in-game power ups (example: getting an ability for your shots to do fire damage) and even Xbox360 Avatar items.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2010"}

Taegel","summary":"Seriously FUN Game","reviewText":"Far Cry 3 is an open-world, first-peron shooter that allows you to use a variety of weapons and approach missions using a variety of tactics.  If you played Far Cry 2, and liked it even a little, Far Cry 3 will make your head explode.  Gone are the elements that made FC2 a slog.  You can fast-travel more easily.  The terrain is more breachable, and the game autosaves.  Hence, the pace of Far Cry 3 moves along at a nice clip.  Not only is does the game provide a variety of weapons and upgrades, there are also a lot of takedowns and skill upgrades you can use to further tailor your experience to your preferred style of gameplay.  There are also tons of side missions that prove to be more fun than tedious (e.g. Find a guy and kill him with your knife).The storyline is one familiar to videogame mythos--but clear and well written: You and your friends have been captured by pirates.  Your brother is killed while you and he escape.  You're found by some indigenous warriors who help you badassify so you can free your enslaved friends and avenge your brother's death.But the overwhelming feeling I got while playing FC3 was that the people making the game really took the time to make sure that the game is fun.  That may sound like a platitude, but if you've played even a few games, you'll know what I mean.  Some games are groundbreaking and beautiful and all that (LA Noire, Assassin's Creed 3), but they aren't really that fun to play..

{"product_name":"B001D7T2VM","reviewerName":"Andrew K.","summary":"Darksiders is simple, derivative fun","reviewText":"Vigil Games' premier effort, Darksiders has arrived, although one shouldn't expect it to have an apocalyptic effect on gaming as we know it. Darksiders is, instead, a rather derivative experience, but, oddly enough, there's a lot of fun to be had within its unremarkable nature.Darksiders follows War, one of the four Horsemen of the apocalypse. War has been duped, it seems, as he mistakenly triggers the apocalypse, removing humans from the equation, and leaving heaven and hell to contend with each other. War is given a second chance however, to right his wrongs, and get revenge on whoever it was that set him up. Darksiders' story is interesting, if uneventful. The politics of heaven and hell are very interesting, and the characters are colorful, and imaginative. It's a shame however, that the intensity of the plot isn't ramped up until the last few hours of the game.Darksiders, as mentioned before, is very derivative, and it can't be helped but to compare it to two franchises in particular: Zelda, and God of War. The game is equal parts exploration, puzzle solving, and combat, and all are done pretty well, although there isn't an original idea tossed in throughout all of Darksiders' campaign.Combat plays out a lot like God of War. War will usually find himself in situations in which he's vastly outnumbered, and must hack his way through boatloads of baddies. The combat is simple enough at first, with only one button used, but slowly builds up some real depth. Soon enough War will have a pretty big arsenal of equipment, weapons, magic, and even a demon form to help him against the odds. One issue I had with the combat is in the finishers which don't use quick-time button presses, allowing you to dispatch weakened enemies with the simple press of a button. It's not a huge problem, but it makes the game's executions a lot less satisfying.Once you get into the true meat of the game, its exploration and puzzles, you'll likely start seeing War as a hulking, steroid-abusing Link, as the game's formula of working your way through dungeons, and finding new items will easily remind you of the adventures of the aforementioned tunic-wearing man. The game's five dungeons are littered with often devious, and satisfying puzzles that require some serious thought to get through. Each dungeon also introduces a new item, be it a grappling hook, or a portal gun, which must be utilized to complete the dungeons' tougher puzzles, and boss fights.Darksiders also changes things up a bit from time to time, be it an on-rails segment on the back of a hippogryph, or the few moments in which War picks up an angelic machine gun (you read that right) to blast away his foes.The game also heavily rewards exploration. Environments are chock-full of hidden rooms which can contain anything from currency, glyphs that increase War's health and magic capacity, or even pieces of a set of awesome armor littered throughout the world.As far as gameplay goes, Darksiders may not have a single original piece to its formula, but it certainly borrows from the right games.The graphics in Darksiders are a bit of a mixed-bag. The game's cartoony art style, done by renowned comic book artist Joe Madureira, is great, and characters are impressively expressive during cut-scenes, although once you get tossed back into gameplay, the animations are pretty terrible. The game's engine is fairly mediocre, only occasionally showing off sites that are truly impressive.The sound department suffers the same fate. Voice acting is mostly good, the standout being the always-awesome Mark Hamill, but the game's various sound effects can get quite repetitive. Thankfully, the music is quite good.Darksiders is a fairly lengthy adventure, clocking in at about 16-18 hours on a standard playthrough, although true explorers can extend their time easily upwards of 25 hours. Beyond the campaign there's nothing else to do, which is mildly disappointing, but the main story is respectably long as is.Darksiders is a game which aspires to be much more than it is. I'd love to see Joe Mad's post-apocalyptic universe expand, but the derivative nature of Darksiders makes it difficult to look passed the amazing games it takes after. Still, Darksiders is derived from two of the best franchises out there, making it a perfectly entertaining game despite its flaws.PROS:+Good story+Great art-style+Borrows from the right games+Lengthy campaignCONS:-Mediocre graphics engine, and awful in-game animations-Lots of screen-tearing on the Xbox 360-Extremely derivative-Mediocre sound department","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00064MUIA","reviewerName":"Sloopydrew","summary":"A gimmick with potential ...","reviewText":"EDIT 8/15/05 - After buying the DS a second time and playing Kirby: Canvas Curse, which, for my money, is one of the most innovative games ever made, and the best platformer of the past year, and playing an advance copy of Nintendogs, I'd up my ratings to a 5 out of 5 for fun and a 4 out of 5 overall (some of  my complaints in the review below still hold true).  Overall, I would definitely recommend this handheld!Disappointment in the PSP led me to buying a DS today (probably not Sony's intention). While the system is more innovative than the PSP, it's still a huge letdown (one of the first from Nintendo). If I could change one thing, it would be the ergonomics of the console. The worst thing is how hard it is to hold when using the stylus. It physically hurts your wrist and fingers if you play a stylus heavy game for more than 15 minutes. The stylus control setup also seems to only be half there -- a gimmick with potential. Nintendo needs to either take it one step forward or one step back. As it is now, they're dangling in some weird limbo that's simultaneously too innovative and not quite innovative enough. I'm returning my DS tomorrow and will only consider buying a new one if:*It's lighter and thinner*It's easier to hold while using the Stylus*It has at least 5 good games and 3 great ones (of the 3 games I played only Mario 64 DS was great and I played that one almost a decade ago on my Nintendo 64 -- and it had better controls then. Metroid Hunters has potential, though.)*I don't have to turn it off and on when leaving a chat (what's up with having to reboot when changing the functionality of the system?)*It is online enabled with at least 2 or 3 online enabled games (Mario Kart and Wave Race would be a good start)I think Nintendo should consider knocking $50.00 off of the price by dropping the GameBoy Advance support, which would also automatically make the machine lighter and slimmer. Or keep it at $149.99, drop the GBA support, making the system thinner and include full PDA software (right now you get a non-interactive clock and non-interactive calendar). Dropping GBA support would then prevent Nintendo from falling back on its incredible GBA library, possibly pushing them to create an equally incredible library for the DS. I think the company needs to make the DS a worthwhile purchase, in and of itself. Metroid Hunters' full game not available until August 8th? C'mon Nintendo -- we need at least one killer new app. unique to the DS! The potential is there. I could see it in the amazingly addictive mini games on Mario DS and I could see it again playing Yoshi. The stylus could make for some of the most innovative, inventive and fun gaming since video gaming began -- if the big N would only take that extra step forward and made full use of the unique control setup they came up with.  As it stands, I think the DS and the PSP are both wasted machines. Until something better comes along (or until the DS improves), I'll stick with the Gameboy Advance for my portable gaming.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

I have also seen an after market device for the regular GBA called the Afterburner that adds side light.  The Afterburner voids any warranty with Nintendo and also it seems to only light from the top.  Also you might need a degree in Electrical Engineering because it requires some soldering, that or find a place on line that will do the modification for a fee.  The new Advance SP lights from all four directions, also it did not seem to have a blue cast that the Afterburner is famous for; the GBA SP did not have this problem!  The Advance SP fits like a dream in my hands, but I have small hands.  Other reviews have mentioned that it felt good to hold.  It reminds me of a Game Boy Color cut in half and folded over.  Both me and my wife are in our 30s, we both have GBAs because we tend to travel a lot.

{"product_name":"B0017ZIIK6","reviewerName":"Micheal Hunt","summary":"Watered Down Mortal Kombat vs DC","reviewText":"I don't always review everything I play or watch, sometimes things can be 0 or 5 stars, but if I don't have anything to say about it, then I won't write something for the sake of writing it. That was the case with Mortal Kombat Komplete. I just got done playing that for about 2 or 3 weeks, and loved it. It's graphics, controls, physics, detail and sound where 5 stars. Which brings me to this version of Mortal Kombat, versing the DC universe. This game was released 3 years before MK Komplete (MK9) and you can see the massive improvements right away in MK9 compared to the stiffer controls and weak hit detections of this game. This has been the biggest problem I have found with this game. MK9 is fast paced, combo's galore, and you can dominate, where as DC, for a real hardcore MK fan, it just does not run fast enough and your strategy is to time moves and what not more then just get in on the action. Some controls feel sluggish, and others have been programed to not allow you to spam the move over and over again by way of it either wont work, so you end up doing to different specials, one after the after, or it works so well it just becomes repetitive and boring. But then again, the AI catches on and counters most of it. Overall, it does not feel like it's a well balanced game. It comes off more like some characters are just plain better than others when you master their special moves.The fatalities are pretty watered down in this. I suppose with a fatality like the Joker pulling out a gun and shooting someone in the head is far from complaining that it's made for kids, but then again, it feels more like the home console version of the original arcade game where so much was watered down from the blood filled arcade that it ruined the home console versions till cheats where discovered on how to put the blood and guts back into it.Story mode was, to say the least, pretty boring. It doesn't take long to complete. You can choose either DC or MK and play in 2 different sides of the story. The story is that in one universe, Raiden electrifies Shao Khan as he is going through a portal, and in a parallel universe Superman does the same thing with his laser eyes to whats his face. This someone causes Khan and whats his face to merge, and the two worlds start to slowly merge together. DC and MK members find themselves battling each other, because the now merged Dark Khan is effecting their rage and causing them to fight each other instead of realize they are all fighting to save Earth. I'm sure you can guess how it ends.The graphics are nice enough for what they are, and the sound it ok. But this game really lacks in a lot of things other than the controls that I already mentioned. Each character only has 2 fatalities or hero brutalities. There is no friendship or babality which would have been perfect for this game. There is only a few modes to play. Arcade on 1 player only, story mode (2 sides to choose), vs (2 player) a kombo challenge and practice. There is no tag team, no 2 player story mode or ladder matches, and no test your anythings to keep you occupied after you have completed the story modes. Pretty much, unless you love the controls of this game for some reason, or are just obsessed with having DC and MK characters fight it off, then this game is pretty disappointing in the end when it comes to replay value. It's just such a shame the DC characters did not become DLC for MK9, or even a DLC for a kreate a karacter and you could build these guys from DC etc ... it would have made fans of this game forget it even existed.Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the game is horrible, I'm just saying it's far from perfect. If you happen to own this game and love it, and have not yet played MK9 (komplete) then I can't express how much I recommend you go and get that one and discover what you have been missing out on.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2013"}

It has a roster of familiar characters, which Combat moves that should be familiar to you as well. Plus, it adds new unique characters such as Superman and Batman, to fight with, each with MKish combat moves.A good fighter, but poor Storybased fighter..so, it really depends on what you are looking for in a game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2014"}
{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"Halicon5","summary":"An amazing game, but not perfect","reviewText":"Zelda always leaves fans with high expectations, and I am one of them.  When I first saw Skyward Sword was going to require motion plus I was very apprehensive.  Wii motion plus has been very hit and miss with me thus far and I won't go so far as saying that Skyward Sword nailed it, I can say they did a pretty good job.  Now, let's tear into this thing, shall we?STORYLINE AND SETTING:I don't want to put any spoilers in, but thus far I must say this is definitely one of the best story lines presented in a Zelda game.  While the series traditionally puts much more emphasis on exploration and puzzle solving than the story, this time around it is clear that Nintendo wanted the story to be more substantial.  The characters are exactly what we expect and I jokingly compared the introduction of the game to Harry Potter due to some very clear similarities to Hogwarts.  It's a good thing.  The game also takes itself lightly and even makes fun of itself in a few unexpected spots.  The dialogue is pretty decent and manages to evoke some real emotion at times as well.GRAPHICS AND PRESENTATION:I am kind of torn on this.  In some ways I think this is the best looking Zelda game ever and then other ways I am wishing for a return to the days of Twilight Princess or Wind Waker.  For the most part the game manages to be a best of both worlds and manages to have a \"painted\" look.  Facial expressions in particular are very nice and manage to capture the essence of emotion.  Two things hurt the game graphics in my opinion.  Some of the textures in the environment are shockingly low resolution and just don't look good compared to other textures nearby.  The other problem is that character animation is sometimes awkwardly stiff.  Link's jump animation and climbing animations in particular look clumsy and awkward.  At other times the game displays some gorgeously fluid animation that just makes me wonder how the jump animation managed to pass inspection.GAMEPLAY:As with every Zelda game, expect the first hour or so to be extremely dull and slow as you are forced to go wander around town and talk to every citizen.  Once you manage to get past that hurdle the game picks up nicely and fast travel is introduced early on.  So far enemies have been fun to fight and it has been rather clear what is necessary in order to beat them.  Puzzles have been decent and aren't simply a huge collection of \"how do I light all 4 torches?\" type events.  The game focuses primarily on exploration with regular bouts of combat sprinkled about.CONTROLS:This is another place where the game both shines and suffers.  The very first thing I noticed in the menus was that the accelerometers in the controllers are used to control the cursor and pointer instead of using the actual pointer controls.  This has the unwanted effect of causing the the cursor to move much slower than I want, to the point of sluggishness.  Unfortunately Nintendo must believe their control scheme is perfect and doesn't allow the user to calibrate the cursor or turning speed to their own preference.  You're stuck with what Nintendo gives you and you better like it.  I'm not saying that it doesn't work because the controls do work, but there is absolutely no customization allowed and it honestly tarnishes an otherwise great game.Another area where the game suffers is during the flying scenes.  Considering how important they are to the game, I am surprised the controls were implemented in the way they were.  As long as you are just gliding or using power boosts the flying handles surprisingly well.  As soon as you need to flap your wings to gain elevation you see how awkward the control scheme is and it sometimes doesn't even respond the way I'd expect.  Flat out, this is a little disappointing because other games have handled motion controlled flight much better than this game has.The worst control issue I've had is when Link has to tightrope balance across chasms.  This is just sloppily implemented and it isn't very responsive.  This type of motion controlled mechanic has been included in plenty of other games successfully (although I will never say enjoyably).  Skyward Sword seems to have gone out of its way to guarantee that it usually doesn't do what you what.  Maybe Link get's a magic balance bracelet later on in the game that makes the controls work, but as it stands expect the pace of the game to slow the moment you have to cross a tightrope.But, even after all of my complaining about the controls, most of the game works very well.  I love the combat.  Combat is intuitive and responsive.  Link is nimble and deadly and the motion controls are pretty engaging during combat.  I'm having a lot of fun as long as I don't encounter tight ropes.  Does the game benefit from motion control?  Only during combat.  Motion control in most of the other areas of the game feels like a forced mechanic that could have been done better.IN SUMMARY:Overall, I'm loving this game but I have to question anyone who thinks it is perfect.  It is a truly amazing game with some very annoying flaws.  The inconsistent controls are what keeps this from being the best Zelda game ever.  Even with the flawed controls I have to recommend this game to anyone that enjoys action adventure games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2011"}

Exclusive","reviewText":"With every system nintendo has made there has always been a mario game to go along with it. Ever since the NES and super mario bros to the latest games on the Wii such as paper mario and mario galaxy this iconic brand has sold more systems than any other brand that is out there. And with the introduction of their newest system the Wii U they are releasing New Super Mario Bros U. But will this newest installment be a great addition to the mario games already out there or will you want to avoid this one like mario teaches typing?The story is pretty much standard fare for a mario game as bowser and his legions of koopas invade peach's kingdom. As mario and luigi step in to save the princess bowser uses a mechanical arm to hurl the duo far away from the castle. They are thrown so far that they must now battle thru strange lands to make their way back to the castle in order to save peach.But that is where the similarities end instead of just playing this as a one player game (which you can do) five players can play this game simultaneously! You can play as luigi, mario and two different colored toads (blue and yellow) as you make your way thru the various stages. There is also a very neat feature as you can play as your Mii's instead of one of the chosen characters which is a first for any mario game.  The fifth player who holds the game pad is also playing the game but in more of an assist role than anything else. This player can add blocks so that the other players can reach areas they couldn't before or stun enemies which can come in handy if the characters are being overrun.The gameplay is pretty much standard as you are making your way to the end of the stage and each stage ends with a flagpole (like in the original super mario bros game). There are also power ups scattered throughout the levels ranging from the typical ice flowers to the new flying squirrel suit (which allows you not just to glide across the level but also slowly descend down vertical paths). There are also returning power ups with new properties such as the mini mushroom which allows you to walk up walls!I have to say that this new incarnation of mario bros is not only fun to play but addictive as well and I love that you can play with more people instead of just playing solo. So what are you waiting for go and get this game for the Wii U and get ready to save the princess!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

Pohle","summary":"Be aware of a terrible glitch that hugely detracts from the fun...","reviewText":"This really isn't a review as much as it is a heads-up. All the other 5 star reviews I'd only be reiterating, they have it spot on: GTA V is truly marvelous.I just want to alert people to a fairly serious bug. Basically, you are unable to save your cars in your safe house garages with any degree of assurance. They constantly disappear. The cars should always remain wherever left on the map when not at home, but once return home should ALWAYS be erased off the map to respawn in the garage. This is never guaranteed to happen and they often vanish without a trace.Making this worse is the fact that there's shops in the world where it's possible to customize your rides in a multitude of ways, and these customizations ain't cheap. This glitch basically renders this aspect of gameplay entirely irrelevant and risky. The shops are pointless aside from repairs, but if it's a car you care nothing for, why not just jack another one and save the $$$?It is the 2nd of October as I write this, and a 39mb patch for online that supposedly fixes this and other issues was released yesterday that claims this issue addressed. It hasn't been.Stealing and saving cars is a large part of the fun of GTA games so this is no minor glitch. For me it detracts from the enjoyment significantly. I'll remove this review as soon as R* remedies this, but as they already believe it fixed and are now scrambling to get GTA online up and running, I'm not holding my breath it will happen anytime soon.So, just be warned. You might want to hold off picking this up if you care about vehicle customization and saving rides.And this is GTA... who doesn't?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Joey Z. \"Joey\"","summary":"Grand Theft Auto V - The Best Open World Game Ever Made","reviewText":"It's finally here. After nearly two years of waiting since its announcement, and watching the hype levels rise and rise, Grand Theft Auto V is finally upon us. Rockstar's huge open world series is back in a swan song to this generation of consoles. Making big gameplay changes and with a less serious tone than its predecessor, does GTA V live up to the hype? Let's find out.The story of GTA V centers around three main protagonists. That's right. Breaking tradition, Rockstar introduces us to three main heroes, rather than focusing on one. First we are introduced to Franklin, a street thug who wants more than a life of crime in the hood. Next there's Michael, a retired bank robber who now lives a depressing life in the rich part of town with his resenting family. Lastly, there's Trevor, a crazy psychopath living in rural San Andreas.Various events bring these three men together in the city of Los Santos. Franklin is taken under Michael's wing, sort of as a son. The dynamic between these two is fun to watch as it unfolds. In contrast, the relationship between Michael and Trevor is rocky, to say the least. The two have quite a history together, and until now, weren't even aware that the other was alive. The three have a good group energy, but neither character is all too interesting. Having three main protagonists unfortunately doesn't allow time for three main fleshed-out characters or personalities. Unlike GTA IV's Niko Bellic, or GTA: San Andreas's CJ, these three guys just aren't as interesting, without clear motivations or goals. Sure, they have their own struggles, be it with family or work, but on the whole they aren't as fascinating as other Rockstar heroes.The new mechanic of having three main characters adds its own unique touch to the GTA universe. For one thing, it keeps the story fresh, and there is always something exciting going on in one of these guys' lives. If you get bored playing as one character, or don't want to travel across the sprawling map, you can switch on the fly, zooming out in a Google Maps-type loading screen, which then zones in on the other character's position. They might be in a crazy situation since you last left them, or they may have new missions to tackle. I like the new system of multiple protagonists, but would I want it to return in future GTA iterations? Probably not.After an opening prologue, you are introduced to the world of San Andreas, which has seen an update since we last visited. The bustling downtown of Los Santos mimics Los Angeles perfectly, and the resemblance is uncanny. Furthermore, you have backwoods and countryside to explore, mountains to scale, oceans to dive in, and much much more. The initial feeling of having too many overwhelming opportunities eventually subsides, and you are soon left to explore the world at your will. The entire map is unlocked from the get-go, and it is a blast to explore. The diversity in the many locales you venture keeps things from getting stale, and the many diversions will keep you busy when you aren't on missions.Speaking of diversions, San Andreas is not lacking in activities to take part in. From golf or cycling, to hunting animals or customizing cars, to base-jumping or scuba diving, you will always have something to do. There are cars to customize, clothes to buy, weapons to upgrade, and a lot more. There is rarely a dull moment in San Andreas. In addition, random events occur quite often, akin to Red Dead Redemption, where you can choose to participate or flee the scene. You may stop a cutpurse, or even save a barber shop from being robbed. These random events keep you on your toes, and sometimes even have unexpected rewards.The city itself is the star of the show. Los Santos is dense, and jam-packed with people and cars. The concept of a living-breathing world has never been as fully realized as it has here in GTA V, and Rockstar did it best.Grand Theft Auto V represents a sort of conditioning at work here. Rarely do I cause mayhem as Michael or Franklin, only when necessary. As Trevor, though, I go crazy: stealing cars, killing pedestrians, and the like. The stark contrast between the three characters make things like this matter, even if it isn't a big deal in the long term. Because the city feels so alive, I feel more inclined to drive with the flow of traffic, and park in designated parking spots. Of course occasionally I'll speed through red lights or cause heavy crashes, but in GTA V there isn't much of a point. It's an interesting thing, and I can't quite explain it, but at times GTA V feels more like The Sims than it does GTA V. With so many things to do in the city, and with things to do around the house and with friends and family members, GTA V feels like a life simulator. It's a strange effect, but when not on missions, you'll feel it, too.In terms of missions, GTA V isn't lacking. With over 65 story missions, and plenty of side-missions, you'll be busy for a long time. GTA V has made great changes to mission structure, and they're for the best. For one thing, checkpoints are now here, so you avoid frustration and having to drive to these locations over and over if you fail.  Another new feature allows you to skip a mission entirely if you fail three times. This is good if you are stuck on just one mission, yet want to continue with the story. The biggest change is in mission variety. GTA IV had a lot of \"drive here, shoot these people, get this thing, and come back\" kinds of missions, with the exception of an awesome bank-robbing heist. Rockstar has taken that with a grain of salt, and expanded on the mission variety immensely. Early on, you're still doing small jobs, but these are a lot of fun and don't feel like they're tacked on just to teach you the ropes.The biggest and best part of GTA V comes in the form of heists, huge missions that your gang tackles, in order to make big bucks or make a big score. These require careful planning, and you must plan each element of the heist meticulously. Your pal Lester helps you here, advising you on whether to go in smart, or go in guns blazing. One jewelry heist gives you the choice of gassing the customers and then breaking in, or going in Rambo-style and take no prisoners. You plan these heists straight down to the getaway vehicles, and you choose who you want to take with you on these missions. You need hackers, getaway drivers, gunmen, and more, and these come in the form of gang members you recruit, or old friends from past games. The planning of these big missions make each attempt feel unique, and they allow for repeated attempts, so you can see each outcome.On these big heists, you can switch to any of your three main characters, to see their perspective on things. The game tells you when you might want to switch, but its entirely up to you. Michael may be holding a man hostage, while Franklin provides cover fire, and Trevor flies a getaway helicopter. By giving you three different points of view to see through, Rockstar has given you more freedom in execution, and this is a welcome change. You can also replay missions at any time to try for a better score, and there are even optional objectives to complete during the mission, similar to Assassin's Creed's synchronization challenges.The gunplay this time around is more akin to Max Payne 3's gunplay. A weapon wheel lets you select your weapon of choice, and the snap to aim feature is a welcome addition. This can even be turned off entirely for those who want a challenge. The cover system has been greatly refined, being less sensitive and more tactful this time. Sometimes you even have the option to be a bit stealthy, and you are often rewarded for keeping a low profile. Melee combat also feels tighter, with more options, and character movement is less floaty.Of course, being a GTA game and all, you're of course going to run into some cops, and they've been made smarter and more aware since the last time they graced Liberty City. Now, instead of escaping a \"zone\" of police sirens, you can break their line of sight. If you go around a corner, they may lose sight of you. After this, they still search for you at your last seen location. Each cop has a small cone of vision which you must stay out of if you want to avoid capture. It's a small change, but it makes you think before you act, and gives you more options in evasion. The police officers themselves are now smarter, and they'll flank your position and take cover in addition to ramming you off the road to spin you out. This nice AI upgrade is definitely a needed and welcome change, as the GTA IV cops were sometimes bumbling idiots.In addition, each character has their own set of stats, which you can improve as you play. Franklin is the driving expert, Michael's great with guns, and Trevor can fly planes very well. Stamina, stealth, lung capacity, and more skills can be upgraded as you play, making each character feel useful in specific situations. Each character also has their own unique special skill, which they can use when their special meter is full. Franklin can slow down time when driving, and Trevor goes into a rage mode, boosting damage and defense for a short time. These unique skills allow you to choose which character is best for the job, be it combat or driving.The driving, too, has been more refined. Cars and vehicles now stick to the road better, and don't fly past turns or tumble over upon hitting a small bump. Driving is tight, precise, and feels great when you're flying at high speeds down the freeway. There's no shortage of vehicles either. From sports cars to bicycles to ATVs to jet skis to choppers and even blimps, the options are endless. Most vehicles can be customized to your need, fine tuning the engines, adding better brakes, or a completely new paint job. You can then store these in your personal garages to take with you when you cruise around or take part in street races. One small gripe I have is with driving and shooting. The reticle is super small, and you use the same button to shoot as you do to aim. This is a hassle when there is a lot on the road and you can't focus your aim precisely.You are given a smart phone, as well, to communicate with NPCs and fellow characters via email or text message. There's no relationship system this time around, so don't expect to be pestered by other characters asking to go bowling or get drinks. You can set these up yourself, and plan a night of darts or visiting the strip club, but you won't be penalized for not socializing. Also on the phone you can take pictures, helpful for heist set-up missions. You can even take selfies and share them via Rockstar's Social Club, and show them off to friends. An in-game stock market is also present online, allowing you to buy and sell shares of stock in big companies, and their success is determined by in-game events. You may hear financial predictions on the radio as you're driving, and then its up to you whether you want to risk it all or not.Rockstar has never been known to shy away from controversy, and their entire game worlds seem to be littered with satire and sharp jabs at pop culture and the media. In GTA V, sometimes they take things a bit too far for their own good. One torture scene has Trevor waterboarding a victim, which calls to mind the CIA's use of waterboarding on Al-Qaeda suspects. This scene is uncomfortable to say the least. Get ready to hear the media's reaction on this one.Grand Theft Auto V's visuals are subtle, less grainy and more detailed than its predecessor. Colors are brighter, helping the city feel more alive, and its hard not to marvel at the view of the city's skyline from on top of a mountain. Unfortunately, due to hardware limitations, texture pop-ins are frequent. Characters, too, don't look all that great in cutscenes. This makes me wonder where the technological potential used in L.A. Noire went. The voice acting is astounding. The characters are funny, and have fun things to say around town or when interacting with NPCs. Many guest stars also help give the city some flavor. The soundtrack is great, as always, featuring many radio stations to listen to while you drive around, with hit songs from great artists. The score is also good, although it didn't standout from the crowd. There is even an online play mode in the form of GTA Online, which isn't available until October 1.Grand Theft Auto V is the king of open-world games. The best open world in recent history can be found right here in San Andreas. The city nails the feel of a bustling, alive metropolis, and there is no shortage of stuff to do. The gameplay changes keep things new and fresh, and the entire engine has been refined for the better. Despite some graphical hiccups here and there, and protagonists who aren't as interesting as they seem, GTA V is a champion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00309XHD0","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Dead Space 2 Review","reviewText":"Dead Space 2 puts you back in the shows of everyone's favorite engineer Isaac Clarke. You are discovered in what looks like a medical wing of sorts by someone who quickly meets his end. You'll have to race through a couple of areas but soon you will have a familiar suit and weapon to use. You'll find that your in a colony this time around and there seems to be plenty of people willing to help you, but to what end. Travel all over the city fighting all those creatures that you so grew to hate. Don't be surprised if things come at you from all over the place in this very dimly lit setting.Graphically this game feels like a slight update of the first. The enemies look gruesome as ever, and will make you feel the pain. I do feel like there are more death sequences in the game this time around, but that might just be me, but what spectacular and creep scenes those are. The scenery that you get to interact with looks top notch. You'll go through a church, a government building, a ship (wink, wink, nod, nod), a school, a hospital, a train station, and more. All of which look amazing but also have that feeling that something could go wrong at any minute.The sounds of the game is probably why one could have nightmares. This is the type of the game that if you want to be scared out of your mind you're going to need surround sound. There's constant noise from something just off screen to keep you on your toes. There's also just the ambiance as well that will give you that creeped out feeling. My \"favorite\" is when you're at the pre-school and the teacher is talking over the PA.This game is going to utilize almost every button on your controller. Thankfully this time around you'll have the ability to replenish your health, if you have health packs, or recharge your stasis meter, if you have the stasis item, without having to enter your inventory. They're simple button presses, while not aiming the gun. You'll also find that when you are aiming the gun you can do a secondary fire with certain guns, cause things to go into stasis, or pick up objects by telepathic means.I have to say that ever since I played the first I was interested to see where the story was going to go, and I have to say I was not disappointed. There are enough twists and turns in this game that you're not going to know what is going to happen next. The artifact is somehow back, and once again some bonehead thinks that if they study it it will unlock some huge secret, nevermind the fact that every crew member is getting attacked and killed by things that have appeared since the Artifact has come back into being. There will be many parts in the game that you're going to probably do a couple of times to survive, at least that's what I found. I will tell you this though, there are certain areas that if you try to take on every enemy you're going to find that they are in unlimited supply and you're going to run out of ammo before they run out of bodies. I do have to say though there was one enemy in the last couple of chapters that I really really really wish was not in the game, I wish I could say more, but I'll let you discover the fun that is that multiple eyed fiend. I do have to give props to the game creators it is awesome to have so many save points, and if you're playing at certain levels of difficulty the ability to replay from the last checkpoint. This allowed for not too much backtracking and it kept the story going strong through the whole encounter.I can't say that this game will scare the pants off of everyone, but it definitely has that creepy jumping out of the wall, you're not expecting it, feel. So if you're looking for a survival horror game set in outer space, centered around a strange artifact that some view as humanity's salvation, and others see as a curse.  You might just want to check this game out. If you've played the first Dead Space you'll find that you can get your old Cutter back, and if you complete the arcade game Ignition, you might find some other surprises. Should people get this game, definitely, is it that good, I wouldn't be saying so if I didn't think it. So without rambling any further this game gets a 9.3 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

The gamecube beats out the Xbox, cuz it's cheaper, and it has more quality titles, like Mario, Zelda, Metroid, and more and some great graphics.  Even if some are 4 kids, the games beat out some of those games for the xbox.  Nopw 4 da  PS2, the gamecube is cheaper and has better technology than the PS2, but the PS2 has sum of my favorite games, like GTA3, FF, Devil may cry, Tekken, and more.  I'n my opionion the PS2 and GC are the 2 best systems out there.  The Xbox has the best technology and stuff, but the only game I hear about is Halo and Splinter Cell nothin else.  All the time, the only game me and my friends play on the Xbox is halo.  No system is garbage, cuz every system has thier own games, but if u have $$$ don't hesitategamecube.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2003"}

Recently, I bought an Urban Camouflage one as well. The controllers themselves are small and comfortable, intuitive and easy to use, hold a charge for a long time (mine seem to last between 48 and 72 hours of continuous use...at least, they stay on and charged for abut that long. They've definitely seen 32 hours of actual continuous use between myself and my step daughter though). Pretty much though, if you are reading this, you probably own at least one controller and know the specifics common to the standard black model.The Urban Camo just flat out looks cool. The camo itself carries a somewhat pixelated graphic style, in the classic grey's camo blend. I really like it. I dont know if it is really more comfortable to use or its appearance simply makes it seem that way, but I prefer it over my older black models. So much so in fact that I am buying a couple more.Anyways, you cant go wrong with the official DUALSHOCK controllers, and the price on them is far more reasonable these days than it was the first few years they were out.Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2012"}

The DC is...was the new Resident Evil Machine and every game in the series except for 1 was on it.  Which brings me to Resident Evil 3This is the Survival Horror god.  RE3 is perhaps the most scary(insert shocking here) game of the series I have played yet.  Rather than face several boss charactors at obvious areas, Nemisis, the big, bad boss of this game will literally chase you throughout the game.  I still remember fondly the first time I saw his distorted face.  And I remember well his tenacious persuit of me causing my fingers to curl and my stomach to clench.  He is scary.Added to Nemisis himself is the wonderful, useful dodge ability.  Tired of Zombies walking through your hail of fire to rip open your neck?  Charge them and push them back!  Tired of spiders wraping their legs around you and pumping you full of poison?  Jump aside.  It is so nice to actually roll out of the way of a enemies swinging claws.  And RE3 is the only game so far where you get to do this.Finally, the gripes.  Although I have not played 1, RE3 is the shortest of the series I have played.  It is also much less epic than 2 or Veronica.  If it is lengh and amazing story you are looking for, go for RE code Veronica.  But is you want to be gripping the armchair seat and shivering from overdose excitement...This is the game for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2002"}

After a sudden attack by a fanatical Martian military regime known as the Z.O.E., Ender Leo Stenbuck finds himself with access to the one weapon that can save Antilia: a mechanized attack vehicle called an orbital frame.InZone of the Enders, you'll command the orbital frame against several robotic opponents. The game features agile 3-D movement, both in the air and on land, and smart camera work that keeps your opponent in view during the most intense, furious battles. The game also comes with a playable demo ofMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty.","reviewerName":"\"arxane\"","summary":"An anime movie made into a game...complete with flaws!","reviewText":"After playing this game, a gamer can easily tell it is not for everyone. While not perfect, \"Zone of the Enders\" is a pretty solid title if the gamer is the right kind of person to appreciate it.\"Zone of the Enders\" plays out very much like an anime movie; The characters, mecha, and storyline are all indicators of a typical anime production. Naturally, the plot is riddled with cliches, but so is almost every good anime out there. Luckily, \"Zone\" isn't at its heart a movie but a game; if it were a movie, it would be as stupid and dull as \"X: The Movie\". And as a game, it manages to give the gamer an experience not found anywhere else.The gameplay of \"Zone\" is fast-paced mecha action. The control-scheme is simple, the pace of gameplay is perfect, and the lock-on feature during battle is a pure joy. The gameplay does stale somewhat as the game progresses, but it's somehow always a gem to play. I wish that all mecha-fighting games were this beautiful.Accompanying the lovely gameplay are sweet graphics. The mecha (called an Orbital Frame in the game) that you command is a work of art to look at. The characters are very well drawn, and the environments, while a little claustrophobc, are nicely layed out. It was arguably one of the best-looking PS2 games when it was released.The sound department is a mixed bag. The sound effects are sweet, especially the sound of an Orbital Frame's laser sword slashing through an enemy. The disappointment possibly lies in the dubbing. The English voices for the characters are by no means terrible, but they definately could've been improved. The voices range from acceptable (ADA, the program of Jehuty, the player's Orbital Frame) to eyebrow-raising (Viola, an enemy) to almost laughable (Leo, your mech's driver).Another tragic flaw in \"Zone of the Enders\" is its length. Dedicated players can probly finish this game in two to three days. And the ending is a terrible cliffhanger, terrible in the sense that it makes the gamer feel cheated out of more great gameplay. Thankfully, finishing the game unlocked a two-player versus mode, which I found incredibly sweet. Players use a single screen instead of a split screen, which makes for a teriffic and refreshing mode of fighting. Of course, the two-player mode isn't too revolutionary and it's best played with a friend and not the AI, which can be quite a challenge but stales after a while.All in all, \"Zone of the Enders\" is a unique game that should probably be tested before bought. Like an anime movie, it has a cliched plot, a questionable dub, a fist-clencing ending, and an unwanted length. But the overall experience is enough to make some gamers look past the flaws and at the game's core: the excellent gameplay.Of course, with its cliffhanger ending, virtually everyone knows a sequel is inevitable. And a sequel has been released...for the Game Boy Advance and not the PS2! Why this happened is questionable, and the gaming engine isn't even the same. Fans of \"Zone of the Enders\" can only hope, pray, and send petitions so that a sequel that's bigger and better than the first will be made for the PS2. Allowing a potential series like this to be degraded to the GBA would be a real shame...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2001"}

Sherman \"The Critic\"","summary":"Just What I Needed!","reviewText":"In 1990 Nintendo released \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" for the original NES system, and it was hailed as the most commercially successful video game of its time.  In 2003, a remake was translated from the Super NES title \"Mario All-Stars\" to the Game Boy Advance's \"Mario Advance\" series and it still sells at GameStop for $25.  I shelled out half as much for a copy elsewhere and I never looked back.Aside from the fact that you don't have to beat the game in one sitting with what is otherwise a limited power source, you can win power-ups from minigames before you play through a level.  As with every Mario Advance title, SMA4 includes a remake of the classic Mario Bros. arcade game.  New copies of the game also include special 'level cards' with bonus content for use with Nintendo's short-lived e-Reader device.  While this captures the look and feel of the original SMB3 game, it's not a completely faithful remake; the music's that made me dance along as a kid is slightly toned down.  Otherwise, the updated graphics are pleasing to the eye, the gameplay still excites (and frustrates) the player and the added voiceovers are \"just what I needed.\"This game is rated E for Everyone: Violence.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2009"}

No More Heroes, of course. The game's not quite as weird as some of Suda's other games but compared to the average video game it's still pretty freaking crazy. I do have to say the game does get really repetitive after a while, the game flow works this way: player has to get money to pay an entry fee to fight a boss, does so by doing mini-games or arena battles for cash; character pays the entry fee at his motel room and I guess just hangs out around town for a while; player drives to wherever the boss is located and goes through a ton of henchmen to get to the boss and then fights the boss. Start over from the beginning around ten times and that's pretty much the entirety of the games, if you exclude the cutscenes and the occasional bullet hell dream sequence. The game's around 14-20 hours long, depending on if you breeze right through it or do all the side-missions and stuff. The game has a really weird vibe to it, like Travis Touchdown's whole experience as a hitman is totally separate from the rest of the world. Santa Destroy is just a regular place with some strange stuff going on, no authorities in sight- except for the police cars, if I remember correctly, but you can slam your motorcycle right into them and it doesn't really matter. As I said, strange vibes.If you can pick this game up for $20 or less it's a nice way to spend a weekend, just don't expect triple-A production values and innovation out the wazoo. More than anything else it reminded me of games I played in my childhood after finishing up with my SNES and moving on to the PS2, it definitely wouldn't be out of place anywhere in the 2000s. Surprisingly I feel the Wii's lack of modern online functionality really helps the experience, just hole up in your room for a few days and play this game through and you may feel transported back a few years just as I do when I play through the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"ManUPT","summary":"Can Only get Better from Here","reviewText":"I'm not one to be obsessed with anything, but man can this thing do it all. I find myself using my Xbox one for everything because that is what it was built for. I play video games with great graphics, watch TV (Football usually) even while playing a game, and using Xbox fitness to get in shape while having fun. That's generally speaking; now let&#8217;s get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about. The Bumpers on the controller are a little bit annoying. They take some getting used to because they are positioned slightly differently and make a very loud and annoying sound. The thumbsticks are smaller which is somewhat better and also have the edges a little tighter which keeps it from tearing like it did on my 360 controller. The positioning of the home button is much better in that it doesn't get in the way of the buttons. When my Dad plays, he might hit the center of the 360 button in the middle of the game, but this controller helps avoid that from happening. Overall it is similar to the 360 controller and I believe it is easy to get use to the new layout within a day or two. 4.6/5[Design] Now this is an ugly ass Xbox, but that was kind of expected now wasn't it. The upside to this is that we will not have to go through the horrible red ring of death. It is capable of keeping cool and will not overheat even if on for 24 hours straight for every day, I would know. I'm sure within 2 or 3 years we will have a redesigned Xbox that is smaller, just like how the Xbox slim was released. Another upside is that the Xbox is very quiet which is quite surprising given the size and consumption of it. But until then, just be content with the fact that there is no more red ring. 3.5/5 (The 3.5 is mostly due to the upsides)[Xbox, Record That] Well the Xbox is constantly recording the last 5 minutes of gameplay so you can easily record anything, either automatically or with a voice command. Unfortunately I have been having trouble with the voice command so I have been stuck having to do it manually. Sharing videos with friends is very easy thanks to this. Hopefully people will reduce the uploads of there uninteresting videos and keep it restricted to only the ones worth watching. 3.9/5[Movies] Finally a blu-ray player, I have been wanting this for many years. Although I already had one in my living room, I could really use one in my basement. Sometimes you just want to watch a movie by yourself without being disturbed or by disturbing others, this is why this came in handy. Now that I get almost all my movies either streaming or Blu-ray, the Xbox is my number 1 movie player. It is true that you have to download an app to play the blu-ray, but it's free and easy. 5/5[Kinect] Well, well, well, so you add a Kinect Microsoft and you bump up the cost 100 bucks more than the PS4?... NO PROBLEM! I am not disappointed at all. The Kinect is amazing; 10 times better than the old kinect. I can say anything and the kinect will do it with ease. Also, almost all games have at least some kinect functionality. Battlefield lets you turn your head in order to turn your head in battlefield when in a vehicle which is really cool. FIFA allows subs to be made just by saying it which is also cool. As time goes on, I feel that the kinect will be more and more useful in these games. In the end, this is a great addition to the Xbox.  4.6/5[Overall] With everything the Xbox has to offer, there is no other thing I would rather have. I give it a 4.46/5 for now, but I think I will rank it higher as time goes by. It has been great for everything, mainly gaming with revolutionary graphics. And remember, it can only get better from here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00009TW6R","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play.

Its 3D and you have to do tons of missions for each level.While this adds depth do the game it can also make you really frustrated(especially because the N64 controllers are so awkward) when you go to a mission and its really difficult to complete it. My advice is that you should take a break from that level and play an easy,fun one.I wish this game didnt have so many jumping styles though. Mario Sunshine is a thing for us to look forward to but will at be an action/adventure game like this one? Is Bowser even in it?We don't know yet. The one thing we do know is that the Game Cube controller is easier to use than the N64 one and that the new Mario game's guide will be easy to look for. While I still say Super Mario Bros 3 is the most fun Mario game of all time, this one comes close. I prefer Sonic Adventure though.

The battle system is fun and enjoyable, no random battles, you lear tech moves which allow you to perform special attacks on enemies, the soundtrack rules, the graphics are awesome (2D is best), the characters are actually well rounded and memorable, and the story is intricate yet easy to follow and involves time travel obviously. The character designs are done by Akira Toriyama from DBZ fame.Look be honest, in a game that spans 40+ hours the likely hood of you playing it again and again is uncommon. This game can be beaten at anytime! You can go to the last boss very soon after you start the game if you feel inclined to die a horrible painfil death.

Troubled scientist Bruce Banner and his enraged alter ego the Hulk are forced into battle against the terrifying forces of the Leader, who&#x92;s intent on using the Hulk&#x92;s gamma energy to unleash a relentless army of gamma creatures on the world.","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"Overall a very decent Hulk game","reviewText":"Believe it or not, this game is sort of a movie tie-in. The story supposedly takes place after the first Hulk movie with Eric Bana, which was a very lackluster film. Fortunately, this game makes things much more interesting by blending elements of the movie with those of the comic books. More specifically, many characters from the comics like the Leader, Betty Ross, and other more obscure Hulk enemies like Ravage, Flux, Madman, and Half-Life appear as well. In this game, Bruce is looking for a way to cure himself of the Hulk, but in the process a supposed doctor friend of his absorbs some of Bruce's radiation and turns himself into his own version of the Hulk, naming himself Ravage. The Hulk then goes after Ravage in the hopes of stopping him and the Leader from using his own radiation to create an army of Hulks. So the story is pretty good, and the gameplay is thankfully even better. Even though this is not a free-roaming game, it's still plenty fun going through the many levels (mostly underground or military bases) and beating the crap out of soldiers, tanks, Hulkbuster robots, gamma dogs (like in the movie), and gamma soldiers. The gamma soldiers can actually be quite annoying with their martial arts attacks, and they're twice as annoying when they're armed with gamma blasters that do an insane amount of damage to the Hulk. The boss fights are also quite challenging, and several of them require more than simply running up to the boss and continually smacking them around. For example, getting close to Half-Life allows him to absorb the Hulk's health while increasing his own, so keeping him at bay by throwing crates and pipes at him is the way to go for that battle.The Hulk himself controls well and can perform damaging grapple attacks on his enemies like breaking their backs or throwing them into other enemies. His standard punching, smashing, and thunderclap attacks can get the job done most of the time, but he can also perform powerful rage attacks that can take out large groups of enemies simultaneously with either a super ground smash or super thunder clap. The one downside gameplaywise are the levels where you play as Bruce Banner, which involve him sneaking through certain areas in order to reach his destination. Bruce has limited combat capabilities which can work against weaker enemies who don't have firearms, but against armed enemies (not to mention gamma dogs and soldiers) Bruce will get killed in seconds. So stealth is the name of the game while playing as Bruce, and while the stealth itself isn't bad, it seems a little out of place with this particular type of game. The hacking portions of these stealth playthroughs are especially annoying; could have done without those. For its time especially, this game looks pretty good with its cel-shaded graphics and the sound of all the explosions, energy blasts, and the Hulk's roaring and poundings are well done. All in all, this game is good for Hulk fans to buy, especially at its current price, and it's plenty challenging and fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2011"}

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game.

First, the graphics and overall visuals are exceptional. There are limits to the amount of damage you can do to the environment. Only certain things burn or break off, and it is really cheesy by the time you get the hang of it. You can't just set fire to the entire forest because even dry bushes burn out by themselves. Pyromaniacs will be disappointed.The gameplay and weapons physics are the worst parts of the game. Weapons seem to rust and jam very frequently and it takes the reliability upgrade to make the weapon last longer than 2 missions. There is no lean or prone command for your character, which reduces the tactical nature of the game.The worst aspect is the brain-numbing traversal system. Going from Point A to Point B is awful. If you drive a car, you run into a technical within a few minutes. The checkpoints are always hostile. This game offers no satisfaction in maintaining a reputation level since there aren't any true allies. You might as well walk from point to point, which takes even longer. You cannot get rid of enemies at checkpoints on a permanent basis. They always respawn.The Jackal character pisses me off. His voice acting is horrible and he makes you do the stupidest things to progress in the game. The missions are linear and idiotic in nature: blow this pipeline, take out this convoy, etc... The ending has to be one of the worst game endings in history since it offers a really dumb choice for the character. The malaria system makes the gameplay boring, not exciting.The weapon selection isn't terribly exciting. The primary weapons range from sub-machineguns (like the MP5SD) to rifles (A modified M16, AK47), to sniper rifles (Barrett M95, Dragunov SVD), and even a semi-automatic Milkor MGL 40mm grenade launcher made in South Africa. Secondary weapons are mainly pistols (Desert Eagle .50, Walther, Colt 1911) but also include the M79 grenade launcher, flare gun, and IEDs. You always get a machete, but a special weapon choice is also available. Here you can choose from a PKM machinegun, the M249 SAW, RPG, or a Carl Gustaf M2 anti-tank weapon (think Bazooka) that you can guide like a TOW missile from Battlefield 2.Overall, the visuals are only so-so. They might appeal to gamers that think Crysis was amazing, but it still isn't very realistic. After playing Farcry 2, I think I will skip out on playing Crysis and Crysis Warhead because both of these games seem to focus on style over substance. It would take one heck of a plot and unique gameplay to convince me to fork over money for Crysis Maximum Edition.Bottom line, Farcry 2 has a sub-par storyline, poor voice acting, horrible gameplay, and I wanted to just get done with the game ASAP. It is that bad. The game also crashes intermittently about every hour of gameplay. I know several other people that tried Farcry 2 and they all said it was a frustrating experience. The game just plain sucks because I did not feel any type of connection to the characters or the plot. I didn't care what happened after 50% of the game because it was just a lackluster overall experience.To improve the game, they need to revamp the checkpoint system and enemy AI. They should also import the tactical system and weapon handling system from Rainbow Six Vegas/2.Pros: Decent visuals, some nice explosions and brushfires.Cons: No substance! Horrible: gameplay, characters, storyline, etc...I give it 2 out of 5 stars.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2009"}

N","summary":"This is a weird one...","reviewText":"As silly as it may sound to those reading a review of a Castlevania game, Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance has got to be one of the weirdest games I have ever played. Point blank there are just SO many odd design choices within this game - some of them good, some of them pandering, some of them (surprising) game saving but NONE of them game breaking - that I'm dumbfounded that I like it and that it even works. Games with much more promise than Harmony have been forgotten for much less yet here's a game that is - dare i say it - actually \"fueled\" by its irreverent choices and memorable because of it.Now, you may be wondering what is just so \"weird\" about Harmony of Dissonance? Well, oddly enough the story begins with the soundtrack. I think most people that have partaken of what Konami offered here will agree the quality of the audio leaves a lot to be desired. Seriously, there are original GameBoy games that sound better - even those with lazy sound programming. For a game with the word \"Harmony\" in the title there isn't much to be heard musically, but this is just part of the stupid, logic-defying gamble that saves the game from itself. The game's audio prowess was sacrificed to make the game's world larger and it is the story line twist that explains the increased geography that ultimately makes the game worth playing. Yes, you heard that right, the twist explaining why the game is larger than its predecessor or successor is what saves the game.Without that gamble and quite possibly a hand from above the other curious aspects of Harmony of Dissoance would be dead on arrival. The level design isn't terrible but it's far from elegant which makes it... interesting? The rather absurd amount of time Konami spends using Juste Belmont to remind players of Alucard from what is a vastly superior game? Somewhat suicidal and pandering yet it doesn't derail the experience. Really, I've only scratched the surface of these in-game oxymorons but rest assured Harmony of Dissonance is filled to the brim with them and it is what makes the game so interesting in that \"can't look away from the train wreck\" kind of way.Regardless of what I say those who are into Castlevania are going to buy this regardless - and I don't say what I said above to make the game less attractive - but those who really like to play games and analyse them as to why they work and don't work should definitely nab this one. Harmony of Dissoance is like the video game equivalent of a rubrics cube. Just when you think you understand it something comes along and throws it all up in the air again. Quite honestly, Konami should be counting their lucky stars that this game is so off-kilter - it's literally its saving grace.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2013"}

An interesting thing about this game is that it is really two games in one. The first part of the game is the original Xbox Far Cry Instincts and the second part is the new Evolution mode which is 8 maps in length. While it seems a bit much to go through the original FC Instincts mode to get to the new levels, it is worth it, mostly because the first part pretty much looks like a port with high definition textures and character models. I mean, things like the water look fantastic, but I thought it was kind of weak of how much it imitated the original. Another gripe I have about this game is the AI. To sum it up, they aren't that good. Most of the time it seems as though the AI just stands there while being shot at, or just run away aimlessly into the distance. All in all, the single player is still fun, especially when you get into the new 8 maps.The best thing about this game is the multiplayer aspect. There are new maps (now totaling 22) and a new mode named Seek and Secure. Along with this, the map editor has been improved with a few new tools/objects and it seems easier to use than before. Some of the new maps seem bigger than the original ones and are a lot of fun to play on. It brings a new experience to the online play. Although you can play with up to 16 players in a room online (only 4 playing split screen), I feel the game plays best with 8-12 players. All in all, the multiplayer game is truly the reason to buy this game, especially if you've already gone through the original Xbox Far Cry Instincts. It is a lot of fun and will keep people on Xbox Live for quite some time to come.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2006"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CPK","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"An Art House Game?","reviewText":"Games have been described as art in the past.  A game that comes immediately to mind is Ico, which oozed personality and landscapes that were both etheral and were just like a painting.  Not until this game have I ever played a game that was almost like interactive art.As far as I can see, if there was ever a game that was pretending to be an art house film, Killer 7 would be it.  From the stylized, psuedo-noir/comic book/anime inspired graphics to the dark, brooding, and sex-laden story and the weird gameplay, you have the makings of an art house video game, as strange as that sounds.  But does it work?  In a word, mostly.Going back to the art comment, each level in this game and each presentation of idea screams art.  It's like passing surreal paintings in a museum.  You pass one and go \"whoa, that's weird.\"  And you might pass another one that makes you want to tilt your head so you can maybe understand it better.  And yet, you come up with a hint but nothing concrete.  This game is like that, except that each level, each character each piece of dialogue is connected in a way a wall full of paintings usually isn't.Normally, when a game puts style and story over gameplay, bad juju occurs.  For instance, Xenosaga II was a great movie, but as a game it was horrible.  In this case, I've known from the beginning that the gameplay would be as equally weird as the storyline.  Suda 51, the game's creator, had been asked when Killer 7 was first introduced via some strange cut scenes how it would play.  His answer was he didn't know.  They had spent so much time and effort getting the feel and story of the game down, that they had no clue how it would ultimately play like.Truthfully, I shouldn't like this game.  And yet, somehow I do.  So, how does it play?  In a move that is a throw back to some of the early Sega CD games I played, you push the A button to move forward.  If you want to turn around, you push B to do a 180.  When you get to a specific junction that allows you do something other than move (i.e. an object or different hallways or rooms), you tilt the controller in the direction you want to go and push A.  When you hear the satanic laughter of the Heaven's Smiles, you pull the R trigger and enter a FPS mode when you aim and shoot at the approaching time bombs.  Hitting them in a yellow weak area is an instant kill that gives you the most blood.Yes, blood.  In fact, an interesting strategy system for leveling up involves collecting blood from fallen enemies.  As you kill enemies, you collect blood which can be used to level up each of your personalities in areas of power, aim control, speed, criticals etc.  So, you want to hit the yellow areas for an instant kill and for the most blood.Basically, that's the gameplay in a nutshell. You move around incredibly linear levels, on a rail, set path and blast any and all enemies you find.  Along the way, you'll come across various puzzles that require you to use your brain and sometimes a lot of luck to figure out.  Since this is a Capcom game, expect some Resident Evil (the earlier ones, not the new one) type puzzles.The game can be difficult in places both for your brain and for your trigger finger.  There are some enemies, the giant Heaven Smiles for one, who are difficult to kill.  Other enemies have to be shot in specific places or its exploding time.  Remembering the various enemy types and how to confront them adds an exciting and sometimes difficult strategy to the game.  When one of the personalities die, their head is left at the scene.  You then have to play as Garcian Smith to collect the head to bring it back to life.  This makes the game pretty \"easy\" in that it's hard to truly have a game over.  However, this adds to the backtracking/repetitiveness as you have to watch a cutscene of your character's head, then you're back in Harman's Room, you choose Garcian, run back to the body, another cutscene, then you're back at Harman's room again to choose your personality and then you're free to go play again.Honestly, though, the gameplay is just there to differentiate this from being a movie.  The best part is the incredibly bizarre and truly disturbing story.  In a (dis?)Utopian society where the world has reached peace and missles are shot off into the sky at each other in a sort of celebration that missles are no longer shot at each other, a new terrorist organization has taken hold.  The Heaven's Smile has members who seem perfectly normal until they explode.  Only the group Killer 7 can truly see them for the evil they are and annihilate them.What is the Killer 7?  They are the personalities of a Mr. Harman Smith, a wheelchair bound guy who seems to enjoy rough sex.  Each of the 7 personalities have their own strengths, weaknesses and special abilities that make them absolutely invaluable to the missions.  For instance, Kaede (the sole female) slits her wrists and baths barracades in blood in order to destroy them.  Mask De Smith performs wrestling moves on plywood blocking a door.  Kevin Smith can become invisible and invincible.  Coyote Smith can jump to high areas and open any lock.  Did I mention Kaede who slits her wrists?If the last paragraph didn't clue you in, this is a rated M game.  Which means it was created for those over 17.  Unlike games like Conker (a game I love by the way) that use their M rating for South Park style humor, Killer 7 has many disturbing moments.  Running into talking heads in dryers and other assorted places is just the beginning.  As the game progresses, you will see and hear many weird things, from the nurse/sex slave? Samantha and her sexcapades with Harman to a blinded kid to the head that tells of its former, death filled life involving the cutting off of certain body parts to a rainstorm of blood.  And then there's the cursing, the countless uses of the F word and various other four letter words.  This is not a game for children.There are some genuine problems with the game, however.  Yet again, Nintendo hasn't supported those of us who have High Def, a wide screen or surround sound.  The game isn't presented in HD or in Wide Screen format.  It isn't even Dobly Pro Logic II like some Nintendo games released.  And it shows.  If you have a receiver, it will be odd hearing sounds coming out of far spaced left and right speakers.  The quality of the sound isn't too great.  The voice acting is genuinely good, but sometimes it's set at a tone that is much quieter than the music.  Add to the fact that there aren't any subtitle options (except the scene specific ones where the characters speak in semi-gibberish) and you have a problem; especially since it's such a story heavy game.  Speaking of dialogue, another sore spot is the fact that some of the characters constantly repeat things.  There are three main characters you see in every mission, a red dressed thing (can't remember it's name), Travis and the information seller.  Each time you talk to them, they start off with the same dialogue.  For instance, the red dressed thing always says \"Master.  We're in Trouble.  Big Trouble.\" or \"Master.  We're in a tight spot.  A very tight spot.  I don't want to say what type of tight spot.\"  Dialogue like that.  The first few times, it's okay but when you're done with the 15 hour game you will really wish you could hit A or something to skip through some of the dialogue.  As is, you can hit start and skip ALL of the dialogue but since puzzle pieces, story and boss strategies are given, it's not recommended.There are only 3 options in the Options menu, rumble, invert aiming and stereo/mono (do people even play games in Mono any more??).  The problem is, everytime I continue the game, I have to change the invert aiming for some reason.  Mighty annoying.Overall, I'm having a hard time explaining this game.  I hope I gave enough to give readers an idea of what to expect if they decide to rent/purchase this unique game.  It's hard to qualify it as anything but an artistic expression.  One does not play art usually.  One views it, tries to gather some meaning from it, and moves on either changed or unchanged.  This game is like that.  It's very difficult (impossible?) to fully explain in any lucid way what this is.  Besides what I've written above, my best recommendation is to play it.  You can't get a feeling for it without trying it.  This isn't Halo nor Final Fantasy where I can say it's this or it's that.  This is something completely and utterly different, comprehensible and yet totally the opposite.This is a game that will go down as a love it or hate it experiment.  If the mainstream video game audience even hear about the game, I will be surprised.  The Electronics Boutique I got mine from only ordered two copies, both preordered.  And, those who actually do play it will either love it for the chances it takes, or will hate it for having the stiff gameplay.  I happen to love it and I can't tell you exactly why.  The story is interesting and very post-modern which is partly why I like it.  And, for some reason, the gameplay that is so stiff is also an addictive situation.  Either way you look at it, though, Kudos to Capcom for taking the chance and creating this dark masterpiece and experiment.  In an environment filled with sequels and movie to game licenses, I have to applaud Capcom for releasing such a different, yet enthralling piece of art.  Yes, art.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2005"}

With its numerous trophies that recognized its incredible drama and writing, the dark story of a NYPD detective whose american dream is destroyed by a horrible tragedy became a classic of the video game. Filled with references from asian action movies, the Matrix and even David Lynch works (ex:Lost Highway), this action game has been adapted for the X-Box console, and also for the X Box 360 as a downloadable game on X Box Live. So far, I think the transfer to the XBox works very well. For example, the controls and the camera are easy to use and the game offers enough replay thanks to its various levels of difficulties one can select at the start of the game. Though some would complain that the level design is a little bit dated today, I disagree with them for I think that Same Lake managed to put what sometimes game designers don't put in certain great-looking video games. And by that I mean that Sam Lake put in his game an atmosphere, a tension in the story, the dialogues, its comic book cinematics and an upsetting presence in Max Payne's nightmares, essential scenes to the narration of the game.Unlike Alan Wake, which is rated for teens, this game is definitely not for younger players for it is rated for mature audiences only. With all its drug references, dark occult cults and psychotic characters, I think this game may not be a relaxing treat for those that want to play relaxing game. I'm saying this because I read many reviews for Alan Wake where gamers were a bit upset by the atmosphere of Alan Wake. But playing a Sam Lake video game is never a comfortable ride. It is a strange and terrifying world, but it is one where you find great scripts, voice-acting, soundtrack, visuals, and most of all, excellent plots, unlike what the reviewer Bob Andrews is saying.A great way to start for those that want to see more of Sam Lake's universe and excellent prose.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2011"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"msadder","summary":"boring","reviewText":"a boring game..and I traded it in at gamestop lost money but you might like it just go to gamefaq.com and read reviews okay","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2014"}

Marble \"Movie fan\"","summary":"First game ever to make you FEEL like you are Spider-Man!","reviewText":"I've played almost every Spider-Man game since the Sega Genesis. Beenox has managed to do what no one else has done... What Treyark came close to accomplishing, but still weren't quite right.... For the first time, you actually FEEL like you are Spider-Man in a video game.  Most games take a particular engine and try to stick Spider-Man into it (be it a skateboarding game engine, or a Diablo-clone with Ultimate Alliance). While Spidey always LOOKS and often SOUNDS great, he's never done justice where powers and the feel was concerned. This game hits the mark.With Great Powers comes great gameplay:Webslinging:  Other games had openworld webslinging, but this game perfected it. There is wind resistance, motion blur, and it just feels exhilarating. Also, instead of webzipping, they introduced a brilliant concept of \"webdash\" where you see the infinite possibilities of quick travel, and Spidey will get there in an acrobatic, cinematic way. It's addicting. Also, in previous games, webslinging wasn't effective indoors, turning those games into just another third-person brawler... not here! Artful maneuvering via web WILL mean the difference between a successful mission or a very well fed Spider-Hunter.Spider-sense:  A wonderful plot device for a comic, but the bane of game programmers for decades. While not the BEST implementation of the Spider-sense (that goes to Shattered Dimension's \"auto dodge\" - looked and worked GREAT), this is easily a well implemented feature. There are two types of \"Spider-Sense\"... counter-attack and \"Get outta Dodge!\"  If you can counter, Spidey will do a cinematic evade followed by a web or punch attack, keeping the action flowing. If it's a red spider-sense, a simple tap of \"L1\" will whisk Spidey into the safest place away from the baddies.Webbing:  Not as well implemented as the other powers, but still useful. Unlike previous games where webbing was the primary attack, in this game, webbing is the equivalent of spitwads and a slingshot. It is used mostly to annoy and slow enemies, and after a combo, to subdue them. Spidey also uses webbing in \"stealth attacks\" - cocooning enemies and sticking them to the ceiling to avoid getting swarmed.Now... a quick rundown of other things about this game.  Great selection of baddies. No top tier baddies, but a solid collection of lesser villains that FINALLY get their debut. Most look good (Scorpion looks vaguely like Topher Grace) some look kind of dorky (Rhino - who AGAIN runs the exact same pattern he has for the last decade).  Alternate costumes range from good - Scarlet Spider 2012 & Raimi black suit - to questionable choices such as Negative Zone and Big Time.  If you complete the game at 100%, you get the new Amazing Spider-Man version of the Black costume. Hopefully future DLC will provide the classic comics version of Spider-Man both red/blue and black, as well as missions featuring more characters (similar to the Stan Lee and Rhino missions). Would be awesome to play as Venom in an open world (like Ultimate Spider-Man game).Well, that's about it. Voice acting is decent, animation is excellent, and LOTS of replay value (600+ comicbook pages must be collected!). For those of you who love Spider-Man, and played Arkham Asylum with the thought \"Gee, if only it was Spider-Man instead of Mr. Grouchy-Pants\", this game is for you. Once they have the classic costume as a downloadable, you won't ever have to see the atrocious new costume again!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2012"}

This is a step up from Black Arrow on the XBOX, and from what I heard about Lockdown, Vegas blows it out of the water.  I have three shooters for the 360 and next to Gears of War this game is a close second.The storyline is actually pretty good, like the title suggests you will spend most of your time in Las Vegas taking out tangos in casinos and lavish hotels.The graphics in this game are done very well.  It looks like an XBOX 360 game is supposed to look, if you have an HD TV, that is even better.  It seems to me that every detail was taken care of down to the shadows cast on walls by your enemy and your teammates.  The detail of your weapons is also quite realistic.  You can actually tell the difference between each gun even down the camouflage design on one of the sniper rifles.  The environments are also done very well, down the tiny detail of bits of tumble weed blowing across your path in the train yard.Sound also gets two thumbs up.  You will really appreciate the sound if you have the optional optical audio cable for the 360 that allows you to connect your 360 to your A/V receiver via the optical input.  Crank the volume up, and you will feel as if you are there.  Nothing but crisp sound all around, if someone is talking to you and he is behind you, it will sound like he is behind you; spin around while he is talking to you and the sound moves from speaker to speaker accordingly.  If you don't have an A/V receiver, no worries, the sound effects in this game are still very good.  Guns sound very convincing and like they are supposed to.  In addition to this, sniper rifles actually sound powerful, and not that puny sound from Black Arrow.The game play is very fun for the most part.  The game can be quite challenging at parts, but the great placement of buttons on the XBOX controller, make controlling your character very simple.  Another thing I like about this game that wasn't in past Rainbow Six games is the ability to really cover.  In past games you may recall that \"covering\" just meant standing behind a wall and if you wanted to shoot at someone you had to leave cover completely to do so.  Not anymore, in Vegas your character can now take cover and fire at enemies without exposing your entire body to danger, this is definitely needed in this game because your enemies are a lot smarter and you WILL get killed frequently if you don't take advantage of this new feature.  You can even blind fire to keep your enemies at bay while not giving up any of your body (except for maybe your arm).For some reason you only have 2 other teammates in R6:Vegas instead of 3, I don't know what is up with that but oh well.  Your teammates are smartER than on Black Arrow.  Notice I said smart-ER.  They pretty much follow your directions, but sometimes they go into stupid mode still and when you tell them to move or regroup with you, they will continue to fire at the enemy and eventually get killed.  They no longer flash bang or frag themselves with their own grenades anymore as they did on the XBOX versions of the R6 games.  In addition to this, if they go down in the field, you can actually heal them or tell your other teammate to do so.  In fact, you HAVE to save them, because if you don't, they will eventually DIE for real and your mission is over.  This adds a great aspect to the game, but what I don't understand is if you go down, why can't they heal you instead of the mission being over completely?Now for the main thing I HATE about this game;  UBISoft's idea of having a checkpoint system in the game instead of or in addition to user initiated saves.  This is the ONE thing that makes this game so frustrating especially on Realistic difficulty.  I like a challenge and my first time through the game, I was challenged pretty well, but what I didn't like is having to repeat things I already did over and over and over and over again just because I didn't reach the next checkpoint before I got killed.  This is not my idea of fun, after the 3rd or 4th time spending 20 or more of going through the same stuff again, it starts to get old, boring and downright frustrating.  I had a little issue with this my first time through on Normal difficulty, but then after beating the game on Normal I went back and tried my hands at Realistic and while I loved the extra challenge, the current checkpoint save system really showed how flawed it is.  Realistic difficulty is way too difficult to only have this type of save system.  Sure it's beatable and I do like the challenge of Realistic difficulty, but the frustration of having to do things you spent so much time doing the same thing 5 and 6 times makes me not want to play anymore, especially since I already beat the gam anyway.  Games are supposed to be fun, which is why they are called \"Games\".  Apparently UBISoft thinks it is an absolute blast to force the players to play the same part of a level over and over and over and over again.  Call of Duty 3 suffered from this same flaw which is why I probably won't play it again after beating it the first time.  As I said with COD3 if they are only going to have a checkpoint save system at least make the checkpoints closer together.That being said this is still a great game.  Definitely fun on Normal difficulty, and if it wasn't for the save system problem it would be even more fun on \"Realistic\".  It's the save system that stopped me from giving this game 5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2007"}

As previously mentioned, the music does set a whole new standard for video games. Millions of GTA fans and dozens of imitators have proven that the GTA franchise is a powerhouse to contend with. If you enjoyed previous GTA games, chances are you will enjoy Vice City Stories.  However, the inheritance of almost every single shortcoming of previous GTA titles, especially the PS1-like graphics, is in excusable. When Rockstar ported GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas to XBOX they took advantage of the system's higher graphical capabilities. Thus, the graphics were dramatically improved in the porting process. It can certainly be appreciated that this PSP-ported game is only $20. However, how many folks would have paid a little more for a polished title that attempted to fix at least some of the native GTA problems that have plagued this franchise?Pros:Unparalleled music track selection and quality. They took some of the very best songs from the 80s and brought them back to life.GTA through and through (for good, bad, or indifferent)The unmistakable GTA atmosphere that cannot be reproduced by any of the wanna-bees is omnipresent in Vice City StoriesFun missions aboundGreat sense of humor still thereVehicles and stunts are still fun as hellCons:Graphics are embarrassingly low quality.

{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"Tex \"dionysus_olympus\"","summary":"Better than GTA 3.  Still Needs Some Improvements!","reviewText":"This game is definitely better than Grand Theft Auto 3.  The graphics have been improved, and the controls are slightly better than before.  The entire environment isn't drab and boring and actually is much more dynamic than GTA 3.  For example, other people jack cars and motorbikes other than you and cause miscellaneous mischief (such as smacking people and causing police trouble).  Additionally, the comments made by the masses are no longer canned per se and even really funny.  For example, when I jacked some young guy's Infernus, he yelled at me \"Hey, man, that's my Dad's!\"  I was rolling in the aisles, but that comment was soooo '80s. Even though I don't consider myself an 80's kid, I can definitely relate to that 80's-style comment.  Additionally, now the storyline is much more compelling and Tommy Vercetti (played by Ray Liotta) is engrossing and has some moxie to him.  He makes comments in the scenes that are very \"Goodfellas\"-like, and the the scenes have a feel like \"The Getaway,\" the PS2 game, not the movie.  He even makes comments like \"I'm innocent\" and \"I don't like people in uniform\" when the police rain down upon him.  Again, the remarkable improvement in the radio stations is funny.  True, I wasn't an '80s kid per se, but I do appreciate some of the music that they had offered.  Again, I appreciate the talk show stations, especially KCHAT and KCPR.  I like the commercial they did for Degenetron, the '80s version of the consoles (e.g., Atari 2600 and the like) back in the day in Vice City.  Another important note, Tommy Vercetti, unlike his predecessor, no longer lives in an alleyway or even a garage in the alleyway.  He actually lives in a hotel in the beginning and can purchase some very nice properties along the way.  The motorbikes and choppers are definitely a welcome addition to the mix.  Even the hookers look nicer in Vice City than they did in Liberty City.  The addition of exploring the inside of clubs and other properties is great.  (Note: at the Malibu Club, you get the see the infamous group The Village People doing their thing!  Ack, as the grunts in Halo say, \"Run away, run awaaay!\"  I mean, that's a truly scary sight to behold!)  Overall, this is a great game with a few exceptions.First, I wish there was more interactivity with the people of Vice City.  For example, at the Malibu Club, you can buy and drink drinks for yourself and others and dance with the people.  Additionally, it would be great if you were able to pick up chicks and get their phone numbers.  Or, like the Sims, visit their place and maybe have them as roommates and the like (with a similar but better reward system than DOA: Extreme Beach Volleyball).  Additionally, if they can pull the stunt off like Leisure Suit Larry or even BMX XXX, that would be cool as well (making the game a wee bit more racy) or at least have the option to. The interactivity of NPCs should also increase for the next sequel (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas?) for your friends and family that you earn during \"Mission Mode\" such as you get random calls on your cell phone from your friends and colleagues between missions and even obtain the random mission (such as pick up someone and drop them off, beat someone up, etc.).  Lastly, the auto-aim controls and the helicopter controls can definitely use some work.  They are counter-intuitive and far too complex.Overall, Rockstar North did a good job on this piece of artwork.  Hopefully, the next one, we get transported into the 90s, with the use of techno-culture and the updated computer infusion into culture. Maybe e-mail in the sequel (like the \"dot-com hack\" series)?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2003"}

Starting with a prison break at Blackgate, Batman must confront a whole city full of criminals as well as a cadre of assassins hired to kill him. Of course nothing is so simple, and as the Dark Knight explores Gotham he will encounter numerous sidequests featuring a variety of characters from the Batman Rogue's gallery.Origins caught some flack for a buggy initial release and the reuse of resources from Arkham City. I'm pleased to report that at its current state, Origins is now very stable. As for the city, while fans may recognize bits and pieces, especially the mall at the Bowery, the developers have done a great job dressing it up to show a different time. A big part of this is dynamic snow that drifts, piles and leaves footprints- it looks quite good on DX11 capable cards, and if you have a phys-x capable card the weather looks even better. Additionally, character models look a good deal more detailed and realistic than in City, and the game seems to handle big fights more efficiently.Origins also sees a spike in difficulty. The timing necessary for proper countering is less forgiving (at least on Hard) and the game throws well-armed and defended enemies (including some new ones) at you much sooner. The bosses are also a step up from previous installments, and must be fought with skillful hand-to-hand combat, not arcade projectile tossing and easy dodges. To even the field, a variety of new gadgets and takedowns are also available.There are small gripes about the game that I have experienced. Looking at Barbara Gordon inexplicably lowers my frame rate (perhaps her character model is rigged for more kinematics?), and there are far fewer stealth areas in this game than in the past two. Overall, though, Origins stands tall alongside its predecessors, and is stuffed to the brim with all the action, Bat-lore, and creepy ambiance fans should expect.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2014"}

Not with patience","reviewText":"You're probably thinking to yourself that you've played harder games and that you can master this one, no problem. You've gamed for years, since you can remember, so what's one more \"difficult\" game? This was my initial thoughts and I wish I was right. This game beat me down and then spit me out. But I enjoyed every minute of it. Not that I'm a sucker for punishment, but because I think I learned something most games fail to teach, which is patience. Patience is the key to beating Demon's Souls. The reason this game is even considered hard is party due to the fact that us gamers are focused on winning quickly to get to the next game we bought. Demon's Souls is nothing like this. You'll have to train yourself to take it slow, and think. You need to plan assaults, learn to utilize defense and offensive distinctively. Once you get past this small detail, you'll be slaying demons and collecting their souls in no time.Demon's Souls is a dark fantasy world set in the land of Boletaria.  This land is full of demons and it's up to your custom character to slay them all. There's a total of five different worlds that you'll travel to from the Nexus (or the safe zone). Each land is rich in unique detail. One land will have you fighting soldiers and knights, while the next area may have you fighting slugs and goblins. This is one of the reasons I dealt with my impatient nature to get through the game. The worlds are really interesting to look at. It always amazed me when I'd climb down from a castle wall and look up thinking, \"I just scaled that?!\". There's plenty of things to look at and it feels like each area was taken special care of.Each area also has a checkpoint zone. Right after you defeat a demon boss, you have a way to transport to the Nexus and back to the world where you left off. The reason checkpoints are important is because when you die in Demon's Souls, you have to start all the way back at a checkpoint. Everything respawns. Oh, and you lose all of the souls you've collected. Souls are needed to level your character up, buy upgrades, buy health or mana, and more. Basically, souls are everything. When you lose them, you have to battle all your way back to the place you died to recover your souls. If you die before recovering them, then they're just permanently gone.The gameplay is very action based, but it feels realistic. For instance, you might find a great sword you want to use, however, you're character may be too weak to walk around with it. This will slow down movement and/or evasive maneuvers. You'll need to maintain a good variety of defense and offense, as mentioned above. To do this, you need to constantly be on the look out and ready to block or roll out of the way. You only want to attack when you see a weakness in your enemies movement. Playing Rambo is not going to win you any souls.There's a very unique multiplayer mode to this game. During the game, you'll eventually land yourself some stones that give you certain abilities. First, you have the ability to invite friends or strangers into your game to help slay demons. This is just your classic co-op adventure. Where the game takes a bigger twist is in the co-op. While a player is alive (has full health), a Phantom can join into a server. This is another player, and he's aggressive. You may know this as PvP. There's not an ability to opt out of it unless you play offline or just stay in soul form. Outside of playing with others, there's a way to drop messages for people in the server to alert (or trick) them about what's ahead. If you found a treasure hidden in a small area, you can drop a message to tell people that there's treasure ahead. It's a great system that I hope is used in other games of this nature.The graphics and music in this game are fantastic. The worlds are full of beautiful gothic architecture, and manage to have some of the best looking armor I've seen in a fantasy game. The music is usually to a minimum until you hit a demon boss. This helps you focus on your surroundings and keep you looking at the graphic art work. In these departments, there's a few flaws that pop up, and really, it's the only big flaws in the game. The voice acting is horrid. I actually hated talking to people due to this. For all it's worth, From Software would have been better off just using subtitles. As far as graphics, there's a cost for the beauty. In some areas, you'll end up hitting major slow downs due to so much being on the screen at once. As a note, I have never died from the slow downs as they usually never pop up. World 3 managed to be the worst in my play through.This game isn't for everyone. Some people will just hate the game. My best friend, and sometimes-editor on this site, bought this game and took up drinking. Literally. He sold the game to save his sanity. He couldn't beat World 1-1. So don't rush out and just buy it because you've heard great things about it. If you have little patience and little time on your hands to play games, this isn't a game for you. I spent around 40 hours on my first play through. But if you have the time and you want to learn what to do, I'd recommend visiting the Wikidot website. Good luck.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2011"}

Finally got it, and I absolutely love it. I'm NOT a hardcore gamer, I'm more of a casual gamer from the old school video game generation (Atari/NES). So here's my take: the story, action, gameplay, graphics, audio are stunning. This game is a challenge, but only because you have to actively develop a strategy for progressing through it. Enemies aren't necessarily impossible to defeat, but you will have to start the level from the beginning if you are killed (like the old days). This really isn't as frustrating as people claim, because you're going to spend time developing your skill and strategy anyway and the levels are a joy to play through however many times. And cheer up, there are no forced start-the-entire-game-overs after 3 deaths like original NES games; those of us who grew up on those style games know true gamer frustration.

The line moves as the characters move around each other which makes it very difficult to see what you're doing if your partner is jumping, falling in holes, flying, etc. This really makes a difference when you're targeting something.

That's right, we now get to hear the joker, harley, batmant, etc the entire cast. And I'm glad to report that the voice work is outstanding. I'll be honest, the entire time I played the game, I had a smile on my face; Batman 2 managed to squeeze in beautiful voice work and just the right amount of humor that will lighten up any bad day you could possible have.The mechanis of the game remain untouched, go through levels, fill the lego meter, find golden and kit parts, and unlock the map for free play. If you've played Lego games before, you will feel right at home.The controls are responsive and on spot. I did not experience a single signal drop from control inputs. I played through with ease and I can't see anybody having any problems; the game is well balanced.Great details,I was quite surprised, in a very good way, that players are able to fly and drive vehicles, that's right, the batmobile is here! and others.... ;)~ Plus the entire cast of villans and heroes that most of us have known from years, are here, lego style. I won't spoil it, but trust me, \"you will love it\".The story starts at an event taking place where the \"man of the year\" award is being given, but as always,  I NEVER SPOIL the story of any game in any of my reviews, and this being a Lego game, is no different. I will let you enjoy every bit of the story as you go. But I will tell you this though...you will not be disappointed. You will enjoy a fun ride from Start to Credits. You will laugh, you will have a permanent smile on your face.Graphics....it maybe hard to believe, but graphics have been polished. don't get me wrong, all the Lego tittles, at least for the new console generation, have always been good looking, but this latest installation, looks very good; water effects are detailed. At times I forgot that all and most structures and items are made of Legos. I won't say this is Gears of Wars or Uncharted material, but I can say this, it can hold its own against any other titles out there.Some will argue this game is \"for kids\". I'm not a kid. I won't say my age, but let's just say I'm not 12, that's all I will say lol, but in all seriousness, this is game is for all ages, from young to old. This game has features that other titles lacked and has all the elements of a true gaming experience, where the player is given \"what he expects\", so you won't longer say, \"I wish I could do or drive that\".A point worth mentioning, during \"many\" parts of the game, I kept thinking \"this would've been so cool in Batman Arkham Asylum and City\", and to be honest, I'm surprised it wasn't. Lego Batman 2, has in a lot of ways set a standard for what Batman games should be like and make players feel like. I know it's a Lego game and a sense of lightness has to be kept, but some of the aspects of this game, could very easily be or have been applied to other Batman games and that would've and could make them that much better.In conclusion, if you are a fan of Lego games, this will be everything you've always liked, plus more. If you are a fan of Batman, you definitely have to get this game. Do not skip it. Trust me, you will regret not buying or at least renting this game. It is fun in every single aspect. True fans will appreciate the many perks and additions of this tittle. New comers will be hooked and possibly start looking into other Lego titles and Batman games. Regardless of who or what level gamer you are, Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes IS FOR YOU.

The resulting reviews will reflect this with people saying how amazing the game is and how it's a must-have for system owners. But then you get the 2 oddballs: the ones that praise a mixed-reviewed game (Force Unleashed, for its many flaws was FUN) or giving a huge game a decent score saying it's just good but not revolutionary. Silent Hill: Homecoming, the 6th in the series and the 2nd done outside of Team Silent is here and it seems like people just want to read the review and make sure it didn't suck. Well I'm happy to report that the game is actually quite a sweet surprise and aside from the inevitable gripes since no game is out-and-out perfect, it's still an enjoyable playthrough.Story: You play as Alex Shepherd, a 22-year old soldier returning from the war. Seems he's been having nightmares involving his brother Josh and returns to his hometown of Shepherd's Glen. Turns out there's even worse news as the town is now empty, filled with creatures and blanketed with a thick fog. His mother is catatonic and his father has gone missing so Alex tries to find his brother and unlocks some secrets involving everyone's favorite spook town of Silent Hill.While the story is indeed interesting, some might gripe that it's not as layered in terms of what actually happened. Previous games have always had a sense of ambiguity or at least a feeling like certain things weren't quite explained, either through laziness or preferring to let gamers decide. Here, the story is as direct as they come. Oh, and for those of you wondering: this is more like 2 and 4 were with a stand-alone story with the occasional bit of dialogue or journals hinting at previous characters so don't expect the guy from the first game or James to make a strange cameo.Graphics: Survival horror games in general have never really been about wow-inducing graphics (though they help) but rather creating a certain emotion in the player, that of fear, adrenaline and paranoia. Homecoming certainly looks more impressive than before with detailed environments, well-done character animations and great use of lighting. Keep in mind though, this game is dark and you will frequently have an entirely black screen save for your character and a dim instance of light from your flashlight. With grain, real-time overworld changes and enemy designs, this might not have the amazing look of other games but what it does it does well.Sound/Music: Anyone who's ever been a fan of Silent Hill knows how vitally important composer Akira Yamaoka's score is and here it definately excels. From the eerie atonal ambiance to beautiful serene moments (if you can believe it) as well as his near-trademark of having rock songs sung by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, people will be more than happy with this. Ditto with the sound design which has strange noises, creature noises but no creature...at least right away and disturbing sounds, it's all there. The voice acting has always been fairly inconsistent for the games since there's always one or two characters that really work while others are iffy. Alex for example has a great VA performance while the youngster doing Josh is a bit too, idk, snotty?Gameplay: One of the frequent gripes about the past games was having fixed camera angles which made it frustrating to run from enemy encounters since you'd find yourself running right back into them when the camera angle changed. Now the game takes on more of a Resident Evil 4-style camera where it's behind you and it's more free-range. This helps not only with navigation and the aiming of your gun but gives a bigger immersion factor in the environments. The big plus of course is the aiming with specific targeting which helps bring down monsters quicker instead of just chestshots galore.Speaking of changes, the other notable and obvious one is the combat system. Instead of just smacking enemies but having to be close in order to even hit them, now we have the Combat Stance where holding L2 readies Alex's melee weapon/gun and is ready for action with X being quick attack, Square being strong attack which can be held for bigger damage or pressing R2 to fire your gun. Also added (and practically required really) is using your Circle to dodge. See an enemy about to smack you, just press Circle and you can dodge the move and be able to get a Counter attack or build up a combo and there can even be finisher moves for some monsters. The problem with this is that sometimes I wanted to dodge one way but didn't and got smacked anyway or sudden moves that knocked some of your health off without room to dodge and some enemies are a little cheap and actually smack you just as you get up. It isn't overly frustrating but you might find yourself yelling \"let me up already!\".That takes care of the changes, how about the rest? Well it's quite easy to get back in the game so to speak since the game's interface is very familiar with sound effects, text, puzzles and the items collected have the same feel as in previous games. Also, changing your items is a bit more quicker since L1 controls your Health/Items like your first-aid kits as well as puzzle items while R2 controls your weapons which makes it easier to switch from knife to the favorite Steel Pipe more quickly than before. Pressing Triangle will bring up the Map which will have markings written into it based on your room discoveries. Saw a door you can't enter cause \"the lock is broken?\" The door will be scribbled onto, holes located will be marked and save points and rooms that connect via a hole you duck under or openings you cut/busted your way through will also be marked which helps a huge deal when you're looking around.So some enemy encounters are a bit too frustrating (those damn nurses will basically cut endlessly until you dodge and Smogs are annoying runts) and save points and health drinks are a bit less frequent but pay no attention to negative reviews and give the game a shot. It might not de-throne Silent Hill 2 but the fact that the game is as enjoyable as it is makes up for it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"A. D. Anderson \"Flying Gamer\"","summary":"You don't want to miss this.","reviewText":"I wonder about the people who gave this game four stars.  They compare it to Halo and other FPS's as if it's inferior to them in some way.  They probably said the same about Halo when it first came out.  \"It's alright, but it's no Perfect Dark/Goldeneye.\"  In two months they'll be on the bandwagon singing Bioshock praises.  This game is groundbreaking, and don't let the nay-sayers dissuade you.Originality.  We're getting Halo 3 this month.  I'm as excited as the next guy, with the Legendary Edition and Limited Edition on pre-order (the Legendary version is staying in the wrap).  But it's Halo 3.  I've seen it before.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.  I can't stand the linearity of the CoD series.  I consider the games very uninspired.  Bioshock.  Enter a world that is unlike anything you've ever seen.  Massive levels that you can't stop exploring because you have to see what's in the next room.  The environments never get repetitive, which was one of my biggest concerns entering the game.  Each level has a unique personality that you will remember long after playing through.  The game is haunting with it's utopia-gone-wrong feel.  You know this place was awesome once, and then something went horribly wrong.I'm not going to spoil any of the story for you.  This game is best played fresh, with no idea what's going on.  Anyone who says it's predictable or boring is full of $#!T.  It's one of the best stories I've seen in a game in the past few years.  And how you play through it will definately have an effect in the end.  The good ending even got me a little teary-eyed.There is a review that complains about the lack of variety in enemies, saying there are only two types.  These two types are more like categories.  Big Daddies and Splicers.  Splicers are the screwed up citizens of Rapture (who have been doing a lot of bad things) and have modified themselves in different ways.  Spider Splicers, Houdini Splicers, Leadhead Splicers, etc.  They all fight in different ways and require different ways of dealing with.  There are only two types of Big Daddies, but fighting them is something you'll remember for a long time.  They are completely docile until you mess with them.  Then their eyes go red and you feel a nice little poo in your pants as the thing comes raging at you.  It's awesome.  Finding more efficient ways of killing them is even better.Another complaint is that this game lacks multi-player.  It's true, but who cares.  Resident Evil would suck if it were online and so would this.  Not every game needs (or should have) a multi-player component.Summing up, picking up this game is a no-brainer.  If you hate the idea of no multiplayer, at least rent it.  You can play through it in 15-20 hours, but I took the time to enjoy it and put about 30 hours in on the first playthrough.  Now I'm playing through it again.  I've got to beat it on the hardest difficulty and see what happens when I kill all the little sisters.  Gotta get back to it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2007"}

Indeed, who can resist a good chase, or the opportunity to collect literally hundreds of Pokemon. Of course, the old games pretty much required that you have a friend to play alongside you, and as I got older, it became more difficult to find people willing to devote a similar amount of effort into the game.Now, however, with the Nintendo Wi-Fi option, all of that is a thing of the past.Now, one can trade for Pokemon around the country, or even the world. Thus, after a 6-year layoff, I decided to pick up Pokemon Diamond (which gave me an excuse to finally get the DS, which incidentally is 1000x better than the PSP that merely takes up desk space in my room). And yeah, the obsessive reared its ugly head immediately, as I then bought Pokemon Fire Red, Pokemon Sapphire and Pokemon Ranger.But ahem, back to the game at hand. Pokemon is excellent. Although formulaic, it's always been a fantastically deep RPG experience, even without the postgame collection madness. I won't detail the plot, as it has been beaten to death in these reviews. Instead, let's move immediately to the good and bad here.GOOD:- Great gameplay. Yeah, the engine is a bit tired, but it still chugs along. I particularly enjoy the fact that it is easier to catch weak Pokemon in the wild with a special Pokeball.- Good graphics. Although not the best the DS has to offer, with all the other data stored in there, they aren't bad.- Wi-fi is nice. I have yet to experience any problems with connections or whatnot. It is annoying that some people will cheat you online (with hacked Pokemon, e.g.), but what can you do?- National Pokedex. Come one. When they say you can now collect 493(!) different Pokemon, how can you not resist?BAD:- legendary pokemon. There's not much \"legendary\" about them anymore. I mean, there are around 13 new \"legendaries\" introduced in this very game. Moreover, many cannot be obtained except via Nintendo \"events,\" most of which have yet to grace our fair shores (yeah, I know there was a Manaphy event - of course, you can get that Pokemon in other ways). This has always been an annoyance of mine, but it's particularly bad now. There are three Pokemon that simply aren't (legitimately) available at the moment, and another three which require the purchase of other games. The REAL annoyance is that there is no reason for this whatsoever - with a Wi-fi option, Nintendo could make their events available to the public at large. But whatever - Nintendo has always been annoying this way, and it won't change any time soon.- Underground. Do I really have to mine the walls for hours to find certain fossils? Does my base really have a bunch of rocks in it that can only be moved if I find another person's base? Does anyone really have time for this? A complete dud.- Pal-Park. Later in the game, one gets the opportunity to migrate Pokemon from older games to their pal-park. This was a great idea. Why, then, do I have to be bothered by its mechanics? Only six Pokemon can be migrated each day, and then I have to go through a \"minigame\" to catch them. Just let me upload them to the PC, for crying out loud!The last two BAD remarks are somewhat nitpicky, but the first is getting outrageous. When it was only one Pokemon, it was reasonable. But Nintendo has turned their clever little satire about obsessives into a mass-marketing campaign...geared ONLY for fanboys. I'm pretty sure that we NEVER got the chance to get Mew in the GBA games, and that's annoying. Hopefully, Nintendo will use their Wi-fi to make events more public, I ain't holding my breath.And thus, I knock the game one star.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SY4DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Nate","summary":"Not Worth The Time Or Money","reviewText":"I got into the Resident Evil series a little late, but not too late as I got to experience 4 and 5. I was amazed at how great a series this was, then came RE6. Everything that made me a fan of Resident Evil in the first place has been shot to pieces and replaced with this junk. I'm being very polite when I use \"Junk\" because it's worse at that. Here's the negatives on why a Resident Evil Fan shouldn't get this game.- If you like the Story behind Resident Evil, then avoid this game. It adds nothing to it. You're not missing anything trust me.- If you like upgrading weapons, that too has been gone down the two holer.- No more horror only action in this game, it played like Gears of War, run, shoot, run, shoot....- You can no longer enjoy cut scenes, because each one will require you to push a button, don't push it, GAME OVER.I probably died 100 times in the game due to stupid cut scenes.- This Archives edition doesn't include a physical disc containing RE4, RE5, and Code Veronica. It all needs to be redeemed online through xBox Live. Jipped.- Over excessive bad language, I mean it's in there a lot. So much it is very noticeable. If you are Christian, avoid this game because every other sentence in Jake Muller's quest is \"Jesus Christ.\" It's very distasteful.- No more collecting money to buy cool new weapons, there's only lame skill points. Every weapon is handed to you in the game. No strategy whatsoever.- Herbs are now annoying tablets you have to take individually.- Damage ratio is way off, examples: A zombie slaps your face, 1 bar of health. A zombie smashes your face with a sledge hammer, 1 bar of health, A zombie shoots you with a sniper, 1 bar of health, etc.. I sense laziness on someone's part in this game's development.- Only one character's quest line has puzzle's and they are cake. No challenge.- Over use of explosions, yep I didn't think you could over use something as cool as an explosion. I was wrong...Leon's quest was Ok, but then again cutscene's easily disrupted the gameplay which made it annoying real fast. Throwing every main character from the series into one game was a bad idea and it really shows during the story line too. It's a mess. My opinion: Capcom really sold out on this one. Trying to draw in a new crowd to make more money. If I felt like playing Call of Duty or Gears Of War then I'd buy those, but this is Resident Evil. I guess it's a trade off though, because for all the FPS fans they are drawing in they are loosing loyal fans like me and you. RIP Resident Evil, it was fun while it lasted.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0002SQ0AY","reviewerName":"mdizzog","summary":"Favorite series of all time...trashed... yes?","reviewText":"Some people seem to think that Suikoden 4 is the best game ever, yet can't even write a decent review concerning it. Most people here seem to be too loyal to the original Suikodens to admit that this game is terrible. Suikoden 1 is my favorite game of all time so I actually know what im talking about.The graphics are horrid. The towns don't get better. There are literally 2 dungeons in the whole game that are absolutely terrible. The character models are bland and disproportional. The main character has eyes the size of grapefruits while other have regular eyes. What's worst, the enemy badguys are so incredibly unoriginal and boring to look at. There's some grass with mist floating over it. Grass is one of your monsters... These monsters aren't interesting like those leaves seen in previous Suikodens. All the monsters look stupid.The story has been done before. It deals with the Runes a little more, but doesn't really have much else to do with the previous Suikodens. Considering it takes place 300 years before the first, they can't put many original characters in(clive, flik, viktor). One of your first missions is to go to Middleport. When you arrive there, a man asks you to kill a monster in the sea. Apparently, it was just a black pot with the ability to call upon the water god. That was stupid and pointless.The battles quickly become repetitive, as they are constant. Random battles occur way too often. Breath of Fire for the GBA had this problem, but those battles you could deal with. This game has way too many easy battles. Upgrade at a blacksmith and buy some armor and you'll be unstoppable. The water battles would be fun if they weren't so strategically easy. If your enemies have lightning boats, get an earth rune cannon and he's dead. It's as simple as that. The duels don't occur enough. When they do, they are so easy as you just listen to what the opponents say and you win.The worst thing about this game are the little technical issues that Konami decided not to fix. For example, autopilot doesn't work ever. What they did for the islands was make large invisible barriers around them. When you first have to go to Middleport, cruise around the island it's on. You will realize that the collision size of the land is too big, and when you hit it, it will cause you to spin off into some weird direction. Another stupid thing is the way your character walks. He looks like he's sprinting but he doesn't move fast at all. Even worse, Konami made the characters swing their swords like idiots. When you hit an enemy, your character will walk up and lightly swing their sword. The sound of the sword hitting and the impact point are different. That sounds weird, but play it and you'll see what I mean.So how are the characters exactly? They must be good, considering there are 108. Well, some of them are. However, you quickly learn that Konami didn't know what to do with most characters. Snowe is constantly changing personalities. At first he's a brave fighter, than he falls on his arm and breaks it apparently. He then complains about it and runs away. 5 minutes later you see him rowing a boat. He then gets out and complains about how he cant move his arm. The commander believes him. How was he rowing that boat just now if he couldn't move is arm? Why is Snowe all of a sudden scared of battle. About 20 minutes earlier you got attacked and he was fine. And why did those guards let that one dude raise his hand up and summon his rune? Why didn't they just kill him? Things like this make the characters seem stupid and uneven.I would love to give this game a good review. I truly would. I loved the original Suikodens and Konami is better than this. One person said that the graphics were the best they have ever been in the series. No they aren't. They aren't the best in the series, and anyone can clearly tell you that. GMR reviewed the game and only gave it a 5 out of 10. This is a horrible score to recieve from them. The graphics are so bad to support the higher poly character models. Everything runs smooth, but it looks like crap. That leaves only one real question.Why do you think Konami is only selling this game for 40 bucks. Why won't they just sell it for 50? Maybe they know that it isn't that great, considering the screenshots released a year ago look exactly like the game now.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2005"}

The multiplayer as of today is still not patched, though the upcoming patches look interesting, and the game is a complete trash bin balance wise. This is definitely not the same team that made Warhawk. Too many issues to list. Go to the forums.I cannot reasonably give this anymore stars than two. Servers are unplayable and the player base is incompetent. This is what happens when COD marketing tries to sell a game to a crowd that doesn't fit the demographic.

HUH?!  8 OUT OF 10","reviewText":"Indigo Prophecy is a rather interesting title. It thinks outside the box, it's different from all other games, you are never given a weapon; instead it requires a lot of thought and quick reflexes, and it's the only game that actually qualifies as a game of drama.WHAT THE GAME IS: Well, it qualifies as an adventure game, but you can't exactly pigeonhole it into what kind of game it is, it's that unique. It's January 2009, in New York City, a series of murders involving ordinary people who kill total strangers in public places is occurring. There is no connection between these murders other than they all follow the same ritualistic killing methods. One of the protagonists in a game; Lucas Kane; becomes the latest person to kill someone in a public place. For no apparent reason, Lucas kills a man in the bathroom of a restaurant, so he must avoid capture from the police. The story also stars two police detectives; Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles; who are working on the case and they are playable characters as well. The game is all about quick reflexes and strategically (not to mention frantically) carrying out your actions and choosing what the characters say during a conversation.GRAPHICS: These graphics don't look that great, even for when it was released in 2005. The textures are lousy and the animation is stiff.MUSIC: It's good and it sets the drama mood as well as for the frantic moments of gameplay.SOUNDS: Mostly just talking.GAMEPLAY: Okay, let's just get the bad part out of the way, the controls are awful and are very difficult to get used to. The gameplay relies almost exclusively on the analog sticks, I'm not kidding. Almost all the movements and actions are done via analog sticks. But once you get the hang of the controls, the game turns out to be quite an entertaining piece of work. There are no guns, no weapons of any kind. The gameplay revolves around the everyday lives of Lucas and the two detectives. Whether it be relationship problems, going to work, working on the computer, analyzing evidence and crimes, drowning your sorrows in alcohol or drugs, saving people from drowning, hiding evidence, having strange visions, engaging in conversation, opening things, listening to music, playing guitar,  and avoiding becoming an emotional wreck this drama title has got all of this and more. It requires a lot of use from your brain, so if you only like the old Xbox for shooters, you won't like this game because it has no weapons.OVERALL: If you like games that are out of the ordinary, this game is definitely worth a look if you please. But be warned about the controls and camera problems. I wish developer Quantic Dream had spent more time fine-tuning the controls, but what's here is just fine and quite entertaining. I honestly would be more than willing to play Quantic Dream's upcoming Heavy Rain, but the question is, when does it come out, and will it go multi-platform (So far it has only been announced for PS3)?THE GOOD: A game that is surprisingly smart, inventive, innovative, and quite interesting as a drama game.THE BAD: Awful controls and squirelly camera.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2008"}

A man named Lucas Kane murders another man for no apparent reason. Fortunately he is innocent, he was somehow temporally possessed and had no control of his body. Unfortunately only Lucas and the player know this. To prove his innocence Lucas will have to go to great lengths and ultimately end up saving the world.Indigo Prophecy is told through the eyes of 3 main characters, Lucas Kane and 2 detectives Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles. Tyler and Carla cover the investigation parts,while Lucas get the interactive scenes/evasive scenes. The story of IP is well told in the first 3/4's,but after that it seems to feel rushed and you never really find much out about the Indigo child,you only know marginally more about her at the end then you did at the start. I do feel that the ending was done good,just that the last quarter of the game leading up to the ending could have been done better.The voices of IP are well done,possibly some of the best of the Xbox era,everything in the game is voiced over,not one lick of text to read. The music is good and features 4 songs from Theory of a Dead Man as well as a few classic tunes as well as some love making music :D. This game mimics almost every aspect of every day life, including bathroom breaks! The graphics in IP are of typical 2005 Xbox/PS2 quality,the slight edge might go to the Xbox as it was made for PC/Xbox first then ported over to PS2. Anyway bottom line is its really just average looking Xbox graphics.One complaint I do have is that IP is short,I beat it in 5hr 5min and some odd seconds. To its benefit it does have a second replay in it,you can choose different answers and end up with a slightly different ending,depending on what answers you know to choose. I personally didn't play it a second time as I didn't feel it warranted one, I was happy with the ending I got. At the end of the game you are given some bonus points to purchase songs,scenes,images,and behind the scenes content,it's a nice touch but nothing special. Overall if you see it cheap somewhere ($10-$15) I'd give it a try, don't pay too much for it as it might be a rather short experience for some people....","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2010"}

I am coming back and writing this review after having played all of the games, and 3 years after having played it the first time through (I have recently played it again start to finish).Simply put, this game is amazing.TECHNICAL ASPECTSThe graphics were incredible for its time, and still are good.  The textures, the locales, and the ambience are all exceedingly well done.  The music ranges from really good to unnoticed.Then there is the voice acting.  This entire series, and especially this game, have the best voice acting of any videogame I've ever seen.  It's even better than most movies that come out these days.  Even most of the people who dislike or hate the game admit the acting is superb.  The character animations fit the dialogue, which is itself very well written.STORYBeing a story-driven game, this is where it shines.  It is rare to see videogames with actual dynamic characters, and a well laid out plot.  I can't go into detail about it, partly because it's a vast storyline (with 2 games full of plot preceeding it), and partly becasue i don't want to spoil it for anyone.  Besides, the game's pacing and unfolding of the story is done so well, I don't want to screw it up by telling it poorly.GAMEPLAYI prefer the puzzles in this game to the ones in any of the other games.  They seem more organic, if a little easier.  Gone are the block puzzles, and (for the most part) jumping puzzles.  These seem more like a riddle without words.Combat is interesting at first, but grows stale after not too long.  While a general improvement on the first games, this is probably the worst part about this game (and it's not that bad).On one hand, it never really gets frustrating, on the other, it's never really that exciting.  Combat in general is why this game received 4 stars (instead of 5) in the fun department.I loved the puzzle-type boss battles from Soul Reaver 1, and was saddened to not have them here, but it's something you'll learn to live with out.The camera in this game (unlike most 3d games) is excellent, mainly because you're in control of it.  Having full control of its rotation is such a relief and suprisingly rare in games of this ilk.I actually like the fact that there are no \"powerups\" in this game.  Hunting all over the world for hidden pieces of extra health has its place, but not in such a plot-driven game such as this one.OVERALLIt is a superbly presented game.  It's biggest fault is that it is rather on the short side (probably 10 hours of gameplay to beat), but that just means its slightly longer than most other games out there nowadays.  But, what time you do spend playing it is well worth that time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2005"}

{"product_name":"B004S5TDL0","description":"","reviewerName":"Jared Burdick \"JBurd\"","summary":"After Two Weeks of daily playing the verdict is....","reviewText":"As a game, Rocksmith is really rough around the edges. The graphics are non-existent, crowds look lame, menu system forces you to constantly move backwards, training tools are buried and often info about a specific technique comes after a song that requires it, not before, there is no story mode and tons of loading screens. You basically just learn to play songs. If you like the song, keep working at it. If you don't move on. Nothing to it.You do unlock guitars, pedals and amps, but as an actual guitar player with real equipment, I can tell you they're pretty much worthless. The songs all have a predetermined sound...which is a necessity. The idea of dialing up your own sound on a virtual pedal board and inserting it into another song is kind of cool...I guess. But the pedals and amps aren't licensed, they're just generic OD pedals and amps. It would have been really awesome if you could actually use and modify the same gear as Robert Smith, Eric Clapton (57 Champ, no pedals) or Josh Homme (Bassman and Drop tuned guitars, Fuzz Face). Anyone whose played a lot of guitar will tell you finding your hero's tones can be nigh impossible and having an accurate (i.e. name brand listing of guitar rig) would have added a lot to the experience.The other issue I have is that Rocksmith is like learning to play using tabs. Lots of people do that, BUT you miss any theory or technique work. You also have to figure out songs. As an example, Sweet Home Alabama uses a simple chord progression starting with a D chord played with a 4,4,6,5 string plucking pattern. You don't have to move your hands and it's pretty simple IF you know how to play it right. But just having notes flying at you at full tempo makes something that is relatively easy more difficult than it has to be. When it comes to playing an instrument, there are more than enough difficult parts and you always want to keep it as easy as possible.It would have been great if there was some sort of \"how to\" for each song. It would also be nice if there were some basic chord progressions that ramped you up from an E minor to a full barre F outside of the songs. Just dropping that on a new player is pretty brutal. It would also be really cool if there was something in the game to show you what scale solos were based on, how the chord progressions worked, anything that gave you some theory to support the tabs.***Update***As a game - Rocksmith is really rough, and that is a fair assessment. It is also VERY difficult if you have zero guitar knowledge. I read an article that put it best, \"it's like learning to spell watching Wheel of Fortune\". That said, it works. I've seen immediate improvements in my speed on the neck because the game forces you out of you comfort zone with the large variety of songs and styles. Although it can be frustrating when you aren't ready for the speed of some of the songs, it really helps improve timing because it's like a full band for a metronome. It's going to keep going whether you are or not.There is a lot of room for improvement across the board, but that's not to say this isn't a really fun game. I'm already looking forward to part two. Here's to better menus, metal, funk, country and punk in the next iteration.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000WS97QI","reviewerName":"CastleD","summary":"Good single player, great multiplayer","reviewText":"Single Player:Battlefield: Bad Company's single player mode is good and I enjoyed playing it. It adds a few things that separate it from the pack: wide open playing areas and destructible enviroments. Unlike Call of Duty 4's linear gameplay, here you can approach enemies from different angles. This is nice because the whole game feels less claustrophobic and scripted. Sometimes you choose whether you want to snipe from afar or go in blasting away, or you can storm the enemy with a tank or other armored vehicles. Blowing away stuff with tanks and the helicopter is a blast so to speak. The destructible environment is great and I can see it being the future of FPS games because after this blasting a thin wall with a grenade launcher and seeing it still standing will seem silly now.The control is good except for aiming. It's way too sensitive and takes awhile to get used to, especially after being accustomed to the precision of COD4. I turned the sensitivity all the way down and still it never feels right. I had to turn it back up for multiplayer because otherwise you turn too slow and you're a sitting duck.The graphics are very nice and do the job, however I never really had the wow factor. You travel around with three squad mates with different abilites and yes they do help you out. But of course it's up to you to get the job done. The voice acting is great and so is the motion capture, these guys sounded and moved like real people which adds to the immersion of the game. However, the dialogue is silly. These guys are always joking around and they have some funny lines, but it's so unrealistic that it diminishes the game. One of the reason people loved COD4 so much is the realism. You grew attached to your squadmates, like Captain Price, because they talked like real people would in the middle of a war. That game took war seriously, and by the time you got to that amazing ending, you felt genuine emotion. In Bad Company, I always felt like I was just playing a simple videogame. The contrast between humor and war didn't work for me, and there was no emotional connection to the characters. Characters like the real people in COD4 and Drakes Fortune should be the future, it's time to move on from stereotypical videogame characters.So if we must compare and take everything into consideration, overall COD4 is a superior FPS experience.Multiplayer:Multiplayer is a hell of a good time and by far the best part of this game. There's a lot to do, you can drive tanks and armored vehicles and also the helicopter. There are now two team modes: Gold Rush and Conquest mode. Both require different strategies and approaches. I like conquest mode the best. What I like most in this multi is the sense of teamwork that you feel. The point system encourages good teamwork and I like healing guys or fixing a guys tank and then hopping in and being his gunner. I wasn't to crazy about some of the maps in Conquest mode, they feel too small and there's a lot of dying going on.There are I think 5 different classes with different guns and equipment. Over time you learn what class works best in different situations. If there are a lot of vehicles on the map I go with support class because you get a tool to fix tanks and other vehicles, and other maps it's usually just assault class with a good gun, grenades and the healing ability. Being an effective sniper in this game is not easy due to the destructible environments. You can't just sit by a little window in an attic forever, eventually they'll blast you out. This multiplayer is challenging and people new to FPS multis will die continuously at first. But if you soldier on and not get discouraged you'll begin to understand where to be and when. As you rack up points you increase in rank and can unlock equipment. As far as lag I never have any, everything runs very smoothly, but that could vary by person. Overall I love this multiplayer and am very addicted.So the bottom line is Bad Company is a good single player and a great multiplayer and definitely worth playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0053B5RGI","description":"The Next Evolution in Pokemon comes to Nintendo 3DS.","reviewerName":"Charles H.","summary":"I really enjoyed it.","reviewText":"Ah, it's Pokemon! The mere mention of the word evokes feelings of nostalgia in me. If the reader is unfamiliar with the series, it's a type of RPG in which you play a little boy that wants to these catch and train creatures called Pokemon. You train your Pokemon by battling them against other people who have Pokemon, and throughout the course of the game, you collect eight badges and go on to battle the Elite Four, the greatest Pokemon trainers of them all.Pokemon Y is another game like what I just described. If you're looking for an innovative storyline or something, look elsewhere. That's not really what Pokemon is about. It's a game that's built around customization. There are many different types of Pokemon, and you can form your 'party' with any Pokemon you choose. Each individual Pokemon has the ability to learn different types of moves. The player is encouraged to build his or her party in whatever manner they see fit to try and win the game. I think that's why Pokemon is so successful. The customization is great in these games, and Pokemon Y is no exception.Despite that level of customization, Pokemon Y is just a little too linear in terms of where you can go and such. The pathway to the next town is always blocked off until you beat a certain Gym, talk to a certain person, or something like that. Since Pokemon lets you make plenty of choices throughout the game, it's really not as big of a deal as it might be in some other games. However, I'm still not a fan of NPCs popping up to block my path for no apparent reason.Also, you now have this item called \"Experience Share' which shares the experience needed to level your Pokemon with all the Pokemon in your party. I turned it off from the start since I'd heard that using it makes your Pokemon too strong. Presumably because of that decision, I approached the end of the game with under-leveled Pokemon. It's actually really challenging if you choose to play it that way.An important thing to mention is just how complicated this game can be. Physical and Special attacks aren't as clearly delineated as they used to be. For example, I had a Tentacruel with a Poison-type attack. In old school Pokemon, Poison attacks were physical and relied upon a given Pokemon's Attack stat. However, it appears that some 'physical' attacks now rely upon Special Attack stats. Then, you've got O-Powers and training stat bags. I don't claim to understand what is going on there. I think the stat bags improve your gains somehow and that the O-Powers are temporary. Back during Generation 1, I had Pokemon down to a science, but I don't really know how a lot of things work in Y. It would an interesting thing to study for younger players who probably have more time to analyze it all than I do. ;)I should add you don't really need to understand all of the specifics to win the game.Finally, you should know that the multiplayer options seem really good for Pokemon X and Y. Since TM moves can be taught to an infinite number of Pokemon now, you can try out a variety of different Pokemon and strategies with impunity. That's a luxury that didn't exist in the older games. You have to love that! It's true that these 'Mega Evolutions' tend to steal the show in multiplayer battles, but I think that's forgivable when you consider the larger experience.So, yeah, Pokemon Y is a really good, really complex, 3DS game. Get it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2014"}
